https://openalex.org/W2054987125,"O(2) is the ultimate electron acceptor for mitochondrial respiration, a process catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (COX). In yeast, COX subunit composition is regulated by COX5a and COX5b gene transcription in response to high and low O(2), respectively. Here we demonstrate that in mammalian cells, expression of the COX4-1 and COX4-2 isoforms is O(2) regulated. Under conditions of reduced O(2) availability, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) reciprocally regulates COX4 subunit expression by activating transcription of the genes encoding COX4-2 and LON, a mitochondrial protease that is required for COX4-1 degradation. The effects of manipulating COX4 subunit expression on COX activity, ATP production, O(2) consumption, and reactive oxygen species generation indicate that the COX4 subunit switch is a homeostatic response that optimizes the efficiency of respiration at different O(2) concentrations. Thus, mammalian cells respond to hypoxia by altering COX subunit composition, as previously observed in yeast, but by a completely different molecular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2132102978,"Piwi proteins specify an animal-specific subclass of the Argonaute family that, in vertebrates, is specifically expressed in germ cells. We demonstrate that zebrafish Piwi (Ziwi) is expressed in both the male and the female gonad and is a component of a germline-specifying structure called nuage. Loss of Ziwi function results in a progressive loss of germ cells due to apoptosis during larval development. In animals that have reduced Ziwi function, germ cells are maintained but display abnormal levels of apoptosis in adults. In mammals, Piwi proteins associate with approximately 29-nucleotide-long, testis-specific RNA molecules called piRNAs. Here we show that zebrafish piRNAs are present in both ovary and testis. Many of these are derived from transposons, implicating a role for piRNAs in the silencing of repetitive elements in vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that piRNAs are Dicer independent and that their 3' end likely carries a 2'O-Methyl modification."
https://openalex.org/W2057257618,"Mitochondria are critically involved in necrotic cell death induced by Ca2+ overload, hypoxia and oxidative damage. The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore — a protein complex that spans both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes — is considered the mediator of this event and has been hypothesized to minimally consist of the voltage-dependent anion channel (Vdac) in the outer membrane, the adenine-nucleotide translocase (Ant) in the inner membrane and cyclophilin-D in the matrix1,2,3. Here, we report the effects of deletion of the three mammalian Vdac genes on mitochondrial-dependent cell death. Mitochondria from Vdac1-, Vdac3-, and Vdac1–Vdac3-null mice exhibited a Ca2+- and oxidative stress-induced MPT that was indistinguishable from wild-type mitochondria. Similarly, Ca2+- and oxidative-stress-induced MPT and cell death was unaltered, or even exacerbated, in fibroblasts lacking Vdac1, Vdac2, Vdac3, Vdac1–Vdac3 and Vdac1–Vdac2–Vdac3. Wild-type and Vdac-deficient mitochondria and cells also exhibited equivalent cytochrome c release, caspase cleavage and cell death in response to the pro-death Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bid. These results indicate that Vdacs are dispensable for both MPT and Bcl-2 family member-driven cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2015049954,"The number of N-glycans (n) is a distinct feature of each glycoprotein sequence and cooperates with the physical properties of the Golgi N-glycan-branching pathway to regulate surface glycoprotein levels. The Golgi pathway is ultrasensitive to hexosamine flux for the production of tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, which bind to galectins and form a molecular lattice that opposes glycoprotein endocytosis. Glycoproteins with few N-glycans (e.g., TβR, CTLA-4, and GLUT4) exhibit enhanced cell-surface expression with switch-like responses to increasing hexosamine concentration, whereas glycoproteins with high numbers of N-glycans (e.g., EGFR, IGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR) exhibit hyperbolic responses. Computational and experimental data reveal that these features allow nutrient flux stimulated by growth-promoting high-n receptors to drive arrest/differentiation programs by increasing surface levels of low-n glycoproteins. We have identified a mechanism for metabolic regulation of cellular transition between growth and arrest in mammals arising from apparent coevolution of N-glycan number and branching."

https://openalex.org/W1968975193,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form aqueous conduits in the nuclear envelope and gate the diffusion of large proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. NPC proteins (nucleoporins) that contain phenylalanine-glycine motifs in filamentous, natively unfolded domains (FG domains) line the diffusion conduit of the NPC, but their role in the size-selective barrier is unclear. We show that deletion of individual FG domains in yeast relaxes the NPC permeability barrier. At the molecular level, the FG domains of five nucleoporins anchored at the NPC center form a cohesive meshwork of filaments through hydrophobic interactions, which involve phenylalanines in FG motifs and are dispersed by aliphatic alcohols. In contrast, the FG domains of four peripherally anchored nucleoporins are generally noncohesive. The results support a two-gate model of NPC architecture featuring a central diffusion gate formed by a meshwork of cohesive FG nucleoporin filaments and a peripheral gate formed by repulsive FG nucleoporin filaments."

https://openalex.org/W2171089964,"The late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory (LTM) requires new gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not fully understood. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha inhibits general translation but selectively stimulates translation of ATF4, a repressor of CREB-mediated late-LTP (L-LTP) and LTM. We used a pharmacogenetic bidirectional approach to examine the role of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. We show that in eIF2alpha(+/S51A) mice, in which eIF2alpha phosphorylation is reduced, the threshold for eliciting L-LTP in hippocampal slices is lowered, and memory is enhanced. In contrast, only early-LTP is evoked by repeated tetanic stimulation and LTM is impaired, when eIF2alpha phosphorylation is increased by injecting into the hippocampus a small molecule, Sal003, which prevents the dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha. These findings highlight the importance of a single phosphorylation site in eIF2alpha as a key regulator of L-LTP and LTM formation."
https://openalex.org/W2040192661,"Heterodimers of CLOCK and BMAL1, bHLH-PAS transcription factors, are believed to be the major transcriptional regulators of the circadian clock mechanism in mammals. However, a recent study shows that CLOCK-deficient mice continue to exhibit robust behavioral and molecular rhythms. Here we report that the transcription factor NPAS2 (MOP4) is able to functionally substitute for CLOCK in the master brain clock in mice to regulate circadian rhythmicity."

https://openalex.org/W2134063049,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from the loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates a variety of cytoplasmic mRNAs. FMRP regulates mRNA translation and may be important in mRNA localization to dendrites. We report a third cytoplasmic regulatory function for FMRP: control of mRNA stability. In mice, we found that FMRP binds, in vivo, the mRNA encoding PSD-95, a key molecule that regulates neuronal synaptic signaling and learning. This interaction occurs through the 3' untranslated region of the PSD-95 (also known as Dlg4) mRNA, increasing message stability. Moreover, stabilization is further increased by mGluR activation. Although we also found that the PSD-95 mRNA is synaptically localized in vivo, localization occurs independently of FMRP. Through our functional analysis of this FMRP target we provide evidence that dysregulation of mRNA stability may contribute to the cognitive impairments in individuals with FXS."

https://openalex.org/W2044819348,"Caspases are intracellular proteases that cleave substrates involved in apoptosis or inflammation. In C. elegans, a paradigm for caspase regulation exists in which caspase CED-3 is activated by nucleotide-binding protein CED-4, which is suppressed by Bcl-2-family protein CED-9. We have identified a mammalian analog of this caspase-regulatory system in the NLR-family protein NALP1, a nucleotide-dependent activator of cytokine-processing protease caspase-1, which responds to bacterial ligand muramyl-dipeptide (MDP). Antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL bind and suppress NALP1, reducing caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production. When exposed to MDP, Bcl-2-deficient macrophages exhibit more caspase-1 processing and IL-1β production, whereas Bcl-2-overexpressing macrophages demonstrate less caspase-1 processing and IL-1β production. The findings reveal an interaction of host defense and apoptosis machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2003807422,"αβ T cell receptors (TCRs) can crossreact with both self- and foreign- major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in an enigmatic phenomenon termed alloreactivity. Here we present the 2.35 Å structure of the 2C TCR complexed with its foreign ligand H-2Ld-QL9. Surprisingly, we find that this TCR utilizes a different strategy to engage the foreign pMHC in comparison to the manner in which it recognizes a self ligand H-2Kb-dEV8. 2C engages both shared and polymorphic residues on Ld and Kb, as well as the unrelated QL9 and dEV8 peptide antigens, in unique pair-wise contacts, resulting in greater structural complementarity with the Ld-QL9 complex. In the structure of an engineered, high-affinity 2C TCR variant bound to H-2Ld-QL9, the “wild-type” TCR-MHC binding orientation persists despite modified TCR-CDR3α interactions with peptide. Thus, a single TCR recognizes two globally similar, but distinct ligands by divergent mechanisms, indicating that receptor-ligand crossreactivity can occur in the absence of molecular mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2094879159,"Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1) is a major candidate gene for diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes, contributing to decreased expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in muscle and adipose tissue. We have demonstrated that muscle expression of PGC-1α and -β is reduced in both genetic (Lepob/Lepob) and acquired obesity (high fat diet). In C57BL6 mice, muscle PGC-1α expression decreased by 43% (p < 0.02) after 1 week of a high fat diet and persisted more than 11 weeks. In contrast, PGC-1α reductions were not sustained in obesity-resistant A/J mice. To identify mediators of obesity-linked reductions in PGC-1, we tested the effects of cellular nutrients in C2C12 myotubes. Although overnight exposure to high insulin, glucose, glucosamine, or amino acids had no effect, saturated fatty acids potently reduced PGC-1α and -β mRNA expression. Palmitate decreased PGC-1α and -β expression by 38% (p = 0.01) and 53% (p = 0.006); stearate similarly decreased expression of PGC-1α and -β by 22% (p = 0.02) and 39% (p = 0.02). These effects were mediated at a transcriptional level, as indicated by an 11-fold reduction of PGC-1α promoter activity by palmitate and reversal of effects by histone deacetylase inhibition. Palmitate also (a) reduced expression of tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial genes and (b) reduced oxygen consumption. These effects were reversed by overexpression of PGC-1α or -β, indicating PGC-1 dependence. Palmitate effects also required p38 MAPK, as demonstrated by 1) palmitate-induced increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, 2) reversal of palmitate effects on PGC-1 and mitochondrial gene expression by p38 MAPK inhibitors, and 3) reversal of palmitate effects by small interfering RNA-mediated decreases in p38α MAPK. These data indicate that obesity and saturated fatty acids decrease PGC-1 and mitochondrial gene expression and function via p38 MAPK-dependent transcriptional pathways.

Although this metabolic phenotype is increasingly well characterized, the precise molecular basis of diabetes risk remains unknown. Recent genomic and functional studies of muscle from humans with diabetes or at high risk for diabetes have demonstrated that impairments in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression and function are a key signature of diabetes (5Patti M.E.

Given the worldwide increase in DM, it is critical to understand the upstream genetic and transcriptional mechanisms mediating mitochondrial dysfunction. PGC-1α (PPARγ coactivator 1α) and related coactivators are recognized as key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function via interactions with nuclear respiratory factor and other nuclear receptors and transcription factors (10Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Because expression of both PGC-1α and -β is reduced by about 50% in skeletal muscle from prediabetic and diabetic humans (5Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R. Kashyap S. Miyazaki Y. Kohane I. Costello M. Saccone R. Landaker E.J. Goldfine A.B. Mun E. DeFronzo R. Finlayson J. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8466-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), PGC-1 has emerged as a potential candidate gene mediating diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes. In turn, both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to reduced expression of PGC-1α and -β in humans. Polymorphisms in PGC-1 have been associated with obesity and diabetes (11Oberkofler H. Linnemayr V. Weitgasser R. Klein K. Xie M. Iglseder B. Krempler F. Paulweber B. Patsch W. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Ling C. Poulsen P. Carlsson E.

We hypothesize that PGC-1 may also mediate the effects of environmental risk factors, including caloric excess, inactivity, and the development of obesity, in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. Indeed, severe caloric restriction, which improves insulin sensitivity, increases PGC-1α expression in skeletal muscle of obese subjects (14Larrouy D. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1999; 23: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Likewise, exercise training increases muscle expression of PGC-1α in both humans and rodents (15Terada S. Tabata I. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Pilegaard H. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 851-858Crossref Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Conversely, infusion of lipids decreases expression of PGC-1α and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (17Richardson D.K. Kashyap S. Bajaj M. Cusi K. Mandarino S.J. Finlayson J. DeFronzo R.A.

Experimental high fat feeding in healthy humans also results in decreased PGC-1α and mitochondrial gene expression in skeletal muscle after just 3 days (18Sparks L.M. Xie H. Koza R.A. Mynatt R. Hulver M.W. Bray G.A. Smith S.R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1926-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Although such links between obesity, over-nutrition, and PGC-1 expression have been identified, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly defined. We now demonstrate a prominent role for saturated fatty acids to inhibit both PGC-1α and PGC-1β gene expression and downstream mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative function at a transcriptional level, mediated via p38 MAPK-dependent pathways. Reagents and Plasmids—Fatty acids were obtained from Alltech Associates (Deerfield, IL). SB203580 was obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Chicago, IL), PD98059 and PD169316 were from Calbiochem, and AICAR was from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rosiglitazone was provided by GlaxoSmithKline. For amino acid treatment, cell media was supplemented with modified Eagle's medium amino acids (Invitrogen). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The pSV-β-galactosidase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI), the pGL3basic luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega) subcloned with a fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of the PGC-1α gene (2-kilobase promoter, –2533 to +78 relative to transcriptional start site), and adenoviral vectors containing coding sequences for GFP, GFP-murine PGC-1α, and murine PGC-1β (Ad-GFP, Ad-PGC-1α, and Ad-PGC-1β, respectively) were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (19Lin J.

Animal Care and Treatment—Mice were housed 4 per cage in an Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare-certified animal facility, with a 12-h light cycle. All experimental plans were approved by the Joslin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For basal comparisons, male C57BL6, ob/+, and ob/ob mice (age 10–12 weeks) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Two cohorts of 6-week-old male mice were placed on chow (17% calories from fat) or high fat diet (42% calories from milk fat) (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and followed from 1 to 11 weeks (C57BL6 and A/J strains, n = 5 per group) or from 1 to 14 days (C57BL6 only, n = 8 per group), respectively. 2-Month-old male Lepob/Lepob (ob/ob) (C57BL6 background) or Lepob/+ (ob/+) mice (n = 8 per group) were treated with rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) or metformin (350 mg/kg/day, mixed with chow) for 3 months. In all mice insulin sensitivity was assessed by insulin tolerance testing (0.75 units/kg humulin R, intraperitoneal), with glucose sampling at time 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. For tissue analysis, random-fed mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg); quadriceps muscle was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA Isolation and Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue or C2C12 cells using RNeasy columns with DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers (Advantage, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for subsequent real-time quantitative PCR analysis (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence detection system, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). PCR products were detected using Sybr Green and normalized to TATA-binding protein expression. Primers were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. Cell Culture—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at a confluency of 60–70%. To initiate differentiation, cells were allowed to reach 100% confluency, and medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (Invitrogen) and changed every 2 days. Full differentiation, with myotube fusion and spontaneous twitching was observed at 5 days. Protein Isolation and Expression Analysis—Protein was harvested from cells in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), sodium orthovanadate, and Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for subsequent Western blotting. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween-20, incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) overnight, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) at room temperature for 1 h, and visualized using chemiluminescence (Western Lightning kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fatty Acid Stock Preparation—Fatty acids were dissolved in 0.1 n sodium hydroxide (final concentration 100 mm) at 65°C for 2 h and then complexed with 10% fatty acid-free BSA, yielding a final stock of 5 mm (20Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Wrede C.E. Kajio H. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transfection and Reporter Analysis—C2C12 cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase and reporter gene expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) on day 0 of differentiation. Cells were treated with 500 μm palmitate or 1% BSA on day 3 and lysed (Galacto-Star System, Applied Biosystems), and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the enhanced luciferase assay kit (BD Biosciences) and Galacto-Star Systems (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase. Microarray Analysis—RNA was isolated as described from C2C12 myotubes treated overnight with 500 μm palmitate or 1% BSA, and cRNA was synthesized (n = 3 per condition). 10 μg of cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430A 2.0 arrays. Intensity values were quantified using MAS 5.0 software. MAPPFinder was used to integrate expression data with known pathways. Adenoviral-mediated Overexpression of PGC-1α and -β—Viral vectors were amplified in Ad-293 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. C2C12 myotubes were infected at day 2 of differentiation with 4.3 × 104 plaque-forming units/well of 6-well plates, allowed to differentiate for 2 more days, treated as indicated, and harvested on day 5. Real-time PCR for Mitochondrial Copy Number—Mitochondrial copy number was measured using primers specific for rRNA, COXII, and ND1 genes and normalized to the β-globin copy number (sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1). Oxygen Consumption—C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in 24-well microplates (Seahorse Labware, Chicopee, MA). After 4 days of differentiation, cells were treated with 250 μm palmitate or 1% BSA for 24 or 48 h. Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a nondestructive, time-resolved method (Seahorse Bioscience XF24) (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Three successive 4-min measurements were performed simultaneously at 2-min intervals. Data were normalized to protein content (assayed after completion of measurements). siRNA—C2C12 myotubes were transfected at day 3 of differentiation with 100 nm p38α MAPK, PGC-1α, or PGC-1β siRNA SMARTpools (Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colorado) or siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA using Dharmafect 3 transfection reagent. Cells were treated overnight with 500 μm palmitate or 1% BSA on day 4 of differentiation, and RNA and protein were harvested on day 5. Efficiency of transfection was determined using siGLO-RISC-free non-targeting siRNA and estimation of siRNA uptake by fluorescence detection (absorbance/emission 557/570 nm). Expression of PGC-1 Is Decreased in Skeletal Muscle in Mouse Models of Obesity—We first assessed whether genetic or experimental diet-induced obesity might contribute to decreased expression of PGC-1 and mitochondrial gene expression. In the leptin-deficient Lepob/Lepob (ob/ob) mouse, PGC-1β expression was decreased by 68% (p < 0.001) in quadriceps muscle as compared with Lepob/+ (ob/+) (Fig. 1A); similar trends were observed for PGC-1α (39% decrease, p = 0.1) (Fig. 1A). These differences were also apparent in ob/ob muscle compared with wild-type C57BL6 (supplemental Fig. 1). Likewise, in C57BL6 mice exhibiting diet-induced obesity after 2 months of a high fat diet, both PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression was decreased in quadriceps by 35% (p = 0.01) and 48% (p = 0.001), respectively, as compared with chow-fed controls (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, reduced PGC-1α expression in C57BL6 mice occurred as early as 1 week after initiation of a high fat diet and was maintained over an 11-week time course (Fig. 1, C and D), with expression correlating inversely with weight (r =–0.41; p = 0.03), plasma leptin levels (r =–0.53; p = 0.02), and plasma insulin levels (r = –0.45; p = 0.02) at 11 weeks. In contrast, muscle from obesity-resistant A/J mice exhibited an early reduction in PGC-1α expression (38% reduction at 1 week, p = 0.04), but this was not sustained over the 11-week time course (Fig. 1D). Expression of PGC-1β was also significantly decreased in C57BL6 mice (49% reduction at 11 weeks, p = 0.03, not shown). Reductions in PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression in both genetic and experimental obesity models suggest that obesity and/or related metabolic effects, including hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and cellular over-nutrition, may contribute to patterns observed in humans with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (5Patti M.E.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1926-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Sustained Insulin Exposure and Insulin Resistance Have No Effect on PGC-1 Expression—We next assessed the direct cellular effects of sustained exposure to high insulin concentrations in the absence of complicating systemic metabolic changes. Treatment of fully differentiated C2C12 myotubes overnight (16 h) with insulin (1 to 100 nm) in the absence of serum produced no significant change in mRNA expression of PGC-1α or -β (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, pathway-specific pharmacologic induction of insulin resistance induced by overnight incubation with the MAPK-extracellular signal-related kinase inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) had no effect on expression of PGC-1α (Fig. 2B). Likewise, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) was without effect despite induction of insulin resistance as demonstrated by decreased insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, right). Similarly, treatment with 1 mm dexamethasone for 24 h or with 1 nm tumor necrosis factor α for 24–96 h, both potent inducers of insulin resistance in myotubes, did not affect PGC-1 (not shown). Because leptin deficiency and resistance are key features of genetic and diet-induced obesity, we also tested the effects of leptin on PGC-1 expression in myotubes. Overnight leptin (1 ng/ml) had a modest effect of increasing PGC-1 expression in C2C12 myotubes (29% increase, p < 0.01). Neither High Glucose Nor Activation of the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway Affects Expression of PGC-1—In both humans and mice, hyperglycemia is associated with reduced expression of multiple mitochondrial genes (22Sreekumar R. Halvatsiotis P. Schimke J.C. Nair K.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To test whether elevations in glucose might mediate reductions in PGC-1 expression, C2C12 myotubes were incubated overnight with either low (5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin to ensure glucose uptake. Expression of PGC-1α or -β did not differ as a function of glucose concentration (supplemental Fig. 2A). Likewise, prolonged exposure (48 h) of myotubes to high glucose had no effect. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is a nutrient-sensing pathway implicated in the development of both hyperglycemia and lipid-mediated insulin resistance. Robust experimental activation of this pathway by glucosamine infusion decreases expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in rat skeletal muscle (23Obici S. Wang J. Chowdury R. Feng Z. Siddhanta U. Morgan K. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether direct activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway might modulate PGC-1 expression. Overnight incubation with 5 mm glucosamine did not affect PGC-1α or -β expression in either the presence or absence of insulin (supplemental Fig. 2B). Excess Amino Acids Have No Effect on PGC-1 Expression—Nutrient excess, particularly high concentrations of amino acids, can induce insulin resistance via activation of the mTOR/S6kinase nutrient-sensing pathway (24Tremblay F. Jacques H. Marette A. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2005; 8: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mice with ablation of S6 kinase exhibit increased PGC-1 expression and are resistant to high fat induction of insulin resistance and obesity (25Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). In C2C12s, however, there was no effect of increasing amino acids (to levels 2–4-fold above that in standard media) on expression of PGC-1 (supplemental Fig. 2C). Long Chain Saturated Fatty Acids Decrease PGC-1—Fatty acids (FA) have long been implicated as particularly potent nutrient modulators of insulin resistance (26Boden G. Shulman G.I. Eur.J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 32: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 27Dresner A. Laurent D. Marcucci M. Griffin M.E. Dufour S. Cline G.W. Slezak L.A. Andersen D.K. Hundal R.S. Rothman D.L. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Therefore, we incubated C2C12 myotubes overnight with representative saturated and unsaturated BSA-conjugated FA, including caprylic acid (C8:0), lauric acid (C12:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), and oleic acid (C18:1), and the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosopentanoic acid (EPA) or with BSA control. Although short chain, unsaturated, and omega-3 fatty acids in concentrations up to 500 μm had no effect on PGC-1 (Fig. 3, A and B), long chain saturated fatty acids potently decreased expression of both PGC-1α and PGC-1β (Fig. 3A). Palmitate decreased expression of both PGC-1α and -β by 38% (p = 0.01) and 53% (p = 0.006) respectively; stearate similarly decreased expression of both PGC-1α (22% decrease, p = 0.02) and PGC-1β (39% decrease, p = 0.02) (Fig. 3A). As expected, this dose of palmitate induced insulin resistance as demonstrated by decreased insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation (see Fig. 5C). Interestingly, when cells were incubated in the presence of palmitate and either oleate or EPA, no decrease in PGC-1 expression was observed (not shown).FIGURE 5Modulation of PGC-1 expression by rosiglitazone, metformin, and AICAR. C2C12 myotubes incubated with 10 μm rosiglitazone (Rosi), 2 mm metformin, or 2 mm AICAR 30 min before treatment with 500 μm palmitate (16 h).

Hollenbeck C. Jeng C.Y. Wu M.S. Chen Y.D. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although our fatty acid experimental dose is within this range, we recognize that plasma contains a mixture of fatty acid subtypes (29Staiger H. Stefan N. Machicao F. Fritsche A. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, lower, more clearly physiological doses of palmitate also decreased PGC-1α expression (250 μm, 40% decrease, p = 0.01; 125 μm, 36% decrease, p = 0.11; not shown) and during a time course ranging from 16 (Fig. 3C) to 72 h of exposure (not shown). Palmitate was chosen as a representative saturated FA for future experiments. Incubation of cells with 500 μm methyl palmitate (a palmitate derivative that cannot form a coenzyme A ester) had no effect on PGC-1 mRNA expression, suggesting that formation of a fatty acyl-CoA moiety is necessary for palmitate-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with etomoxir (an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, required for transport of long chain acyl-CoAs from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria) inhibited the effects of palmitate to decrease PGC-1 expression (data not shown). Palmitate Decreases PGC-1α Promoter Activity—Changes in PGC-1 mRNA expression may reflect altered transcription or transcript stability. To test the impact of palmitate on PGC-1 promoter activity, we cotransfected C2C12 myoblasts with the pGL3basic reporter gene vector (Promega) subcloned with a 2-kilobase fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of the PGC-1α gene and a pSV-β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were treated at day 3 of differentiation with 500 μm palmitate or BSA. Under these conditions, palmitate decreased PGC-1α mRNA expression by 33% (p = 0.002) (not shown) and decreased PGC-1α promoter-regulated luciferase activity by 11-fold (p < 0.005) (Fig. 3D). Palmitate Decreases Mitochondrial Gene Expression and Oxygen Consumption—Pathway analysis of microarray data from C2C12 myotubes treated overnight with palmitate revealed decreased expression of many mitochondrial genes, including members of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (MAPPFinder Z = 3.3, p < 0.004) and electron transport chain (MAPPFinder Z = 5.1, p < 0.001) (supplemental Table 2) as compared with BSA-treated control cells. We confirmed differential expression of selected tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain genes by PCR, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (67% decrease, p = 0.001), citrate synthase (14% decrease, p = 0.03) (Fig. 4A), NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1α subcomplex 5 (45% decrease, p = 0.04), mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit ATP5J2 (49% decrease, p = 0.04), and the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (47% decrease, p = 0.04) (Fig. 4B). Notably, we observed no change in mitochondrial DNA copy number during 72 h of palmitate trea"
https://openalex.org/W1979355065,"Target-derived factors organize synaptogenesis by promoting differentiation of nerve terminals at synaptic sites. Several candidate organizing molecules have been identified based on their bioactivities in vitro, but little is known about their roles in vivo. Here, we show that three sets of organizers act sequentially to pattern motor nerve terminals: FGFs, beta2 laminins, and collagen alpha(IV) chains. FGFs of the 7/10/22 subfamily and broadly distributed collagen IV chains (alpha1/2) promote clustering of synaptic vesicles as nerve terminals form. beta2 laminins concentrated at synaptic sites are dispensable for embryonic development of nerve terminals but are required for their postnatal maturation. Synapse-specific collagen IV chains (alpha3-6) accumulate only after synapses are mature and are required for synaptic maintenance. Thus, multiple target-derived signals permit discrete control of the formation, maturation, and maintenance of presynaptic specializations."
https://openalex.org/W2023008210,"Previous work in Drosophila has defined two populations of circadian brain neurons, morning cells (M-cells) and evening cells (E-cells), both of which keep circadian time and regulate morning and evening activity, respectively. It has long been speculated that a multiple oscillator circadian network in animals underlies the behavioral and physiological pattern variability caused by seasonal fluctuations of photoperiod. We have manipulated separately the circadian photoentrainment pathway within E- and M-cells and show that E-cells process light information and function as master clocks in the presence of light. M-cells in contrast need darkness to cycle autonomously and dominate the network. The results indicate that the network switches control between these two centers as a function of photoperiod. Together with the different entraining properties of the two clock centers, the results suggest that the functional organization of the network underlies the behavioral adjustment to variations in daylength and season."

Here, we have used purified E. coli components to address the mechanism of translocation. Disulfide bridge crosslinking demonstrates that SecA transfers both the signal sequence and the mature region of a secreted substrate into a single SecY molecule. However, protein translocation involves oligomers of the SecY complex, because a SecY molecule defective in translocation can be rescued by linking it covalently with a wild-type SecY copy. SecA interacts through one of its domains with a nontranslocating SecY copy and moves the polypeptide chain through a neighboring SecY copy. Oligomeric channels with only one active pore likely mediate protein translocation in all organisms.

Here, we have used purified E. coli components to address the mechanism of translocation.

SecA interacts through one of its domains with a nontranslocating SecY copy and moves the polypeptide chain through a neighboring SecY copy. Oligomeric channels with only one active pore likely mediate protein translocation in all organisms. Many proteins are transported across or are integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in eukaryotes or the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes. These proteins are directed to the membrane by cleavable signal sequences or by transmembrane (TM) segments of membrane proteins. Translocation occurs through a hydrophilic channel that is formed from a conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex, called the Sec61p complex in eukaryotes and the SecY complex in bacteria and archaea (for review, see Osborne et al., 2005Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Protein translocation by the Sec61/SecY channel.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The complex consists of a multispanning α-subunit (Sec61p or SecY) and two smaller β- and γ-subunits, called SecG and SecE in bacteria. The channel can associate with different partners that provide the driving force for translocation. In cotranslational translocation, the Sec61p/SecY complex associates with the translating ribosome; in posttranslational translocation in eukaryotes, the Sec61p complex associates with the Sec62/63p complex, and the ER luminal ATPase BiP; in posttranslational translocation in bacteria, the SecY channel associates with the cytoplasmic ATPase SecA. How the Sec61p/SecY complex forms a channel and how it associates with its different partners to translocate polypeptide chains is unclear. In the simplest model, the channel would be formed from a single copy of the Sec61p/SecY complex. This is supported by the crystal structure of an archaeal SecY complex (Van den Berg et al., 2004Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. X-ray structure of a protein-conducting channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The structure shows a monomer of SecY complex and is likely representative of the closed states of all Sec61p/SecY channels. SecY consists of two linked halves, TMs 1–5 and 6–10, which form a lateral gate at the front and are clamped together at the back by SecE. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is closed by a short helix, termed the “plug.” During initiation of translocation, a signal sequence or TM sequence intercalates into the lateral gate of SecY and causes the plug to move toward the back of SecY (Tam et al., 2005Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. Investigating the SecY plug movement at the SecYEG translocation channel.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The open channel would have an hourglass shape, with a pore ring of hydrophobic amino acid residues at its constriction, through which translocating polypeptide chains move, as demonstrated by disulfide bridge crosslinking (Cannon et al., 2005Cannon K.S. Or E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. Disulfide bridge formation between SecY and a translocating polypeptide localizes the translocation pore to the center of SecY.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic segments of membrane proteins would move through the lateral gate into the lipid phase. The idea that the active translocation pore is formed by a monomer of Sec61p/SecY complex is challenged by observations that the solubilized complex can form oligomers, containing between two and four copies (for discussion, see Eichler and Duong, 2004Eichler J. Duong F. Break on through to the other side–the Sec translocon.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 221-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Oligomers of the SecY complex have also been observed in intact membranes (Mori et al., 2003Mori H. Tsukazaki T. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Johnson A.E. Kimura Y. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of protein translocase. SecYE from Thermus thermophilus HB8 forms a constitutive oligomer in membranes.J. Biol.

Weinkauf S. The oligomeric distribution of SecYEG is altered by SecA and translocation ligands.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystal structure excludes the formation of a hydrophilic channel by the simple association of several SecY copies, because these are entirely hydrophobic in their membrane-facing regions. However, it is conceivable that multiple complexes associate at their front surfaces and open their lateral gates to fuse their pores. This could explain fluorescence-quenching experiments, which indicated a pore diameter of at least 40 Å (Hamman et al., 1997Hamman B.D. Chen J.C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. The aqueous pore through the translocon has a diameter of 40–60 Å during cotranslational protein translocation at the ER membrane.Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and it would be consistent with a near front-to-front orientation proposed for a ribosome-bound dimer of SecY complexes (Mitra et al., 2005Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Ban N. Frank J. Structure of the E. coli protein-conducting channel bound to a translating ribosome.Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, oligomerization of the Sec61p/SecY complex may not necessarily indicate that the pore is formed from several copies; rather, it could serve another purpose, for example, to increase the number of interaction sites with channel partners. In posttranslational translocation in bacteria, the SecY channel cooperates with the ATPase SecA, but the translocation mechanism is poorly understood. In one model, SecA would undergo nucleotide-dependent conformational changes to “push” successive segments of a polypeptide chain through the channel (Economou and Wickner, 1994Economou A. Wickner W. SecA promotes preprotein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion.Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the originally proposed “plunging” model, according to which SecA reaches through the SecY channel (Economou and Wickner, 1994Economou A. Wickner W. SecA promotes preprotein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion.Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), is difficult to reconcile with the crystal structures. How SecA interacts with the SecY complex is also largely unknown, although several cytosolic loops of SecY appear to be involved (Mori and Ito, 2006Mori H. Ito K. Different modes of SecY-SecA interactions revealed by site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 16159-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we address how the translocation channel is formed during SecA-mediated translocation, using purified SecY complexes reconstituted into proteoliposomes and purified SecA (Brundage et al., 1990Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. The purified E. coli integral membrane protein SecY/E Is sufficient for reconstitution of SecA-dependent precursor proteintranslocation.Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We show that the translocation pore is formed from a single copy of the SecY complex but that translocation is mediated by oligomers, with a nontranslocating SecY copy providing a static interaction site for SecA. To understand how the SecY complex forms a translocation pore, it is important to know where the translocating polypeptide chain is located. Previous crosslinking experiments suggested that the polypeptide chain inserts into the channel as a loop, with the signal sequence intercalated into the lateral gate between TM2b and TM7, and the following mature region in the actual pore (Cannon et al., 2005Cannon K.S. Or E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. Disulfide bridge formation between SecY and a translocating polypeptide localizes the translocation pore to the center of SecY.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Plath et al., 1998Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Signal sequence recognition in posttranslational protein transport across the yeast ER membrane.Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We now asked whether the signal sequence and mature region of a substrate are both contained in the same SecY molecule. If so, this would demonstrate that a single copy of the SecY complex forms the pore. We incorporated single cysteines into E. coli SecY that would form specific disulfide bonds with cysteines in either the signal sequence or the mature region of a translocating substrate. Using proOmpA (pOA) as a substrate, we first tested crosslinking of the signal sequence. Single cysteines were placed at the cytoplasmic side of the lateral gate of SecY, at positions 97 (in TM2b) and 331(in TM8) (Figure 1A). Upon loop insertion of the substrate into the channel, these residues would be expected to be in proximity of the N terminus of the signal sequence (Figure 1B). Proteoliposomes generated with purified SecY mutant complexes supported the translocation of pOA when combined with purified SecA and ATP (Figure S1A, lanes 9–12, in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Single cysteines were also introduced at several positions of the signal sequence of pOA (Figure 1C, residues in bold). All cysteine mutants of pOA were translocated by SecA into SecY complex-containing proteoliposomes (Figure S1B, lanes 6–17). To increase the likelihood of disulfide bond formation, the polypeptide substrate was trapped in the channel by preventing its complete translocation with a bulky tRNA at the C terminus (see scheme in Figure 1B). 35S-methionine-labeled substrate was generated by translating in vitro a truncated mRNA coding for the first 120 residues of pOA. In the absence of a stop codon, the nascent polypeptide chain remains associated with the ribosome as peptidyl-tRNA and can be released from the ribosome by treatment with urea. Radiolabeled pOA120:tRNA was incubated at 37°C in the presence of purified SecA, ATP, and reconstituted proteoliposomes containing purified SecY complex. The trapped translocation intermediate was treated with the oxidant copper phenanthroline to induce disulfide bond formation. The products were digested with RNase to remove the tRNA and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Cysteines at positions 5 or 7 of pOA:tRNA substrates (pOA-5C or pOA-7C) formed a disulfide bridge with the cysteine at position 97 of the SecY mutant SecY-97C (Figure 1D, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, cysteines at positions 9, 13, 15, or 17 of pOA did not crosslink (lanes 9–12). None of the substrates crosslinked to the SecY-331C mutant (lanes 13–18). Two other SecY mutants, one with a cysteine at position 69, which is located in TM2a of the plug, the other at position 368, which is located in the cytoplasmic loop between TM8 and TM9, did not crosslink to any of the cysteines in the signal sequence (lanes 1–6 and 19–24, respectively), although they were active in translocation (Figure S1A, lanes 7, 8, 13, and 14). We conclude that residues 5 and 7 in the signal sequence of pOA make a specific contact with residue 97 in SecY. Crosslinking between pOA-5C and SecY-97C was also observed with a significantly longer translocation intermediate of 206 residues (Figure 1E, lane 10). Thus, the signal sequence remains stationary while the C-terminal region of pOA is moving through the channel. Several controls confirm that disulfide crosslinks are derived from a functionally relevant translocation intermediate. For example, no crosslink was observed in the absence of copper phenanthroline (Figure 1E, lane 1) or if the cysteines were modified with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior to addition of the oxidant (lane 2). The crosslink disappeared upon reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT) (lane 15). Disulfide bridge formation did not occur in the absence of SecA, SecY (lanes 3–5), or ATP (lane 11), if the samples were incubated at 4°C rather than at 37°C (lane 12), or if the appropriate cysteine residue was lacking in pOA or SecY (lanes 6 and 7). No crosslink was seen with a substrate that contained a mutation in the signal sequence (A11K) that renders it nonfunctional (Tam et al., 2005Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. Investigating the SecY plug movement at the SecYEG translocation channel.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (lane 9). Also, crosslinking was drastically reduced if the substrate was treated with RNase to remove the tRNA prior to translocation (lane 8), thus allowing the substrate to move all the way across the membrane. Finally, when the sample was not treated with RNase prior to SDS-PAGE, the crosslinked product was larger, as expected from the retention of the tRNA at the C terminus (lane 13). Insertion of the signal sequence did not occur when ATP was depleted (Figure 1F, lane 1 versus 2). Also, no crosslinking was seen with a SecA mutant defective in ATP binding (K108A), with SecA mutants that bind ATP, but do not hydrolyze it (D209N and E210Q), or when ATP was replaced with the nonhydrolyzable analog AMPPNP (lanes 3–9). Thus, signal sequence insertion into the lateral gate of SecY requires a complete ATP hydrolysis cycle by SecA. Next, we tested crosslinking of the mature region of pOA. SecY with a cysteine at position 69 of the plug, close to the central constriction of the channel, can form a disulfide bridge with a cysteine in the mature region (Cannon et al., 2005Cannon K.S. Or E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. Disulfide bridge formation between SecY and a translocating polypeptide localizes the translocation pore to the center of SecY.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SecY-69C is a signal sequence suppressor mutation, and we therefore introduced a cysteine into the neighboring position 68 (SecY-68C), a mutation that is neutral (Tam et al., 2005Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. Investigating the SecY plug movement at the SecYEG translocation channel.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The substrate pOA contained 206 residues, representing an advanced stage of translocation, and had a single cysteine in its mature region at position 175 (pOA-175C), which is expected to be inside the channel. Oxidation of the trapped translocation intermediate indeed induced disulfide bridge formation between SecY-68C and pOA-175C (Figure 2A, lane 9). Crosslinking was not seen if the oxidant was omitted (lane 1), if the sample was pretreated with NEM (lane 2), if SecA, SecY-68C, or ATP were omitted (lanes 3–5; lane 10), or if the sample was incubated at 4°C (lane 11). Also, no crosslinking occurred if either cysteineless SecY or substrate were used (lanes 6 and 7) or if the substrate was allowed to move completely into the vesicles following RNase treatment (lane 8). The crosslinked product disappeared upon reduction with DTT (lane 14), and it increased in mass when the sample was not treated with RNase (lane 12), consistent with it being tRNA associated. These results show that during translocation, position 175 in the mature region of pOA comes close to position 68 of SecY. Importantly, pOA-5C did not crosslink with SecY-68C (Figure 2B, lanes 1 and 2), and conversely, pOA-175C did not crosslink with SecY-97C (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, the signal sequence and mature region of the translocation substrate have specific, nonoverlapping contact points with the channel, the signal sequence with the lateral gate, and the mature region with the central constriction. The specificity of disulfide crosslinking allowed us to determine whether the signal sequence and mature region of pOA reside within the same SecY molecule or are located in separate SecY molecules. We introduced cysteines into both the signal sequence and mature region of pOA, and two cysteines into SecY at the respective interaction sites, and asked whether the substrate forms disulfide bridges with one or two SecY molecules. As expected, pOA-5C+175C gave a crosslink to both SecY-68C and SecY-97C (Figure 2B, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). Likewise, pOA-5C and pOA-175C gave crosslinks with SecY-68C+97C (lanes 13–16). Importantly, when both the substrate and SecY carried two cysteines, i.e., when pOA-5C+175C was tested with SecY-68C+97C, a crosslinked product of the same size was observed and no higher molecular weight crosslinks were visible (lanes 17 and 18). Thus, a single pOA substrate was crosslinked to a single SecY (see scheme in Figure 2C). To test directly whether the signal sequence and mature region of pOA are crosslinked to the same SecY molecule, the crosslinked products were treated with endoproteinase LysC, an enzyme that cleaves after lysine residues. Upon digestion with LysC, the two cysteines in SecY-68C+97C will remain in the same peptide, as there is no lysine between residues 68 and 97 of SecY (Figure 3A). The two cysteines in pOA, however, should end up in separate peptides, as there are multiple lysines in the segment between residues 5 and 175. Thus, digestion of a crosslinked species that contains two disulfide bridges should yield a SecY fragment that is disulfide bonded to two pOA peptide fragments. If only one of the disulfide bridges is formed, digestion of the crosslinked product should yield a smaller species, in which the SecY fragment is linked to only one of the two pOA fragments (Figure 3A). We first analyzed crosslinked species that contain a single disulfide bridge. The substrate itself was digested to a major band of ∼10 kDa and several minor bands (Figures 3B and 3C, lanes 7–12 versus 1–6); the major band is likely a mixture of N- and C-terminal pOA fragments of similar mass. The crosslinked product of pOA-5C+175C and SecY-68C, which can only contain a single disulfide bridge, was cleaved by LysC to a doublet of bands of ∼30 kDa (Figure 3B, lane 7, empty circle). Considering the size of the C-terminal fragment of pOA contained in these bands, the SecY fragment must be ∼20 kDa, although the appearance of a doublet suggests that it is somewhat heterogeneous. The same fragment was generated when the crosslinking was performed with pOA-175C and SecY-68C+97C (Figure 3C, lane 9, empty circle). A slightly larger doublet of bands was obtained upon cleavage of the crosslinked products generated with either pOA-5C+175C and SecY-97C or pOA-5C and Sec68C+97C (Figure 3B, lane 9, filled circle and Figure 3C, lane 7, filled circle). These products contain the N-terminal fragment of pOA. We then analyzed the crosslinked product generated with pOA-5C+175C and SecY-68C+97C. When treated with LysC, it gave rise to an additional species of ∼37 kDa (Figure 3B, lane 11, Figure 3C, lane 11, asterisk), proving that indeed two disulfide bridges are formed. The size of the product is close to the expectation that the ∼20 kDa SecY fragment is disulfide linked with the N- and C-terminal pOA fragments of ∼10 kDa. All crosslinked products were only seen in the presence of ATP (Figures 3B and 3C, compare even and odd lanes), and they disappeared upon reduction with DTT (lanes 13–18). These results show that the signal sequence and mature region of pOA can simultaneously crosslink with the same SecY molecule. Thus, the pore is contained in a single SecY copy, even though the SecY complex forms oligomers in reconstituted proteoliposomes (Mori et al., 2003Mori H. Tsukazaki T. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Johnson A.E. Kimura Y. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of protein translocase.

Braun N. Nothdurft L. Stumpf M. Veenendaal A.K. Kol S. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Weinkauf S. The oligomeric distribution of SecYEG is altered by SecA and translocation ligands.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To address the role of oligomers of SecY complex in translocation, we employed tandem SecY molecules, in which the C terminus of the first SecY copy is coupled covalently to the N terminus of the second SecY copy (Duong, 2003Duong F. Binding, activation and dissociation of the dimeric SecA ATPase at the dimeric SecYEG translocase.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Tandem SecY complexes generated by expressing fused SecY genes are active in translocation (Duong, 2003Duong F. Binding, activation and dissociation of the dimeric SecA ATPase at the dimeric SecYEG translocase.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We used purified tandem SecY complexes reconstituted into proteoliposomes to test whether a SecY copy with an inactivating mutation could be rescued for translocation by its association with a wild-type SecY copy, a result that would prove the involvement of SecY oligomers in translocation. We first followed the insertion of the signal sequence of pOA into tandem SecY constructs that contained the 97C mutation in either the first or second SecY copy. Both proteins were able to translocate pOA (Figure 4A, lanes 11 and 19). They also inserted the signal sequence, as demonstrated by the ATP-dependent formation of a disulfide bond with pOA-5C (Figure 4B, lanes 8 and 16). Judged from the crosslinking efficiency, the activity of the SecY copies in the tandem is about the same. To inactivate one or both of the SecY copies, we introduced the R357E mutation into the cytoplasmic loop between TMs 8 and 9 of SecY. This mutation in monomeric SecY-97C drastically reduced protein translocation (Figure 4A, lane 9 versus 7), as expected (Mori and Ito, 2001Mori H. Ito K. An essential amino acid residue in the protein translocation channel revealed by targeted random mutagenesis of SecY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and it abolished crosslinking of the signal sequence (Figure 4B, lane 6 versus 4). As expected, when this mutation was present in both copies of a tandem construct, no translocation activity or signal sequence crosslinking was observed (Figure 4A, lane 17; Figure 4B, lane 14). However, tandem constructs containing one wild-type and one R357E copy were active in translocation, regardless of whether the dead copy was at the N- or C terminus (Figure 4A, lanes 13, 15, 21, and 23). Remarkably, when linked to a wild-type SecY copy, the inactive SecY copy in these tandem constructs could insert the signal sequence; when the first SecY copy carried the R357E mutation and the second SecY copy was wild-type, the signal sequence gave a strong crosslink to the first copy (Figure 4B, lane 10; scheme in Figure 4C). With the wild-type copy at the N terminus and the R357E mutation in the C-terminal copy, the signal sequence could also insert into the inactive SecY copy (lane 18). These results strongly suggest that SecY functions as an oligomer during translocation. It should be noted that a SecY monomer with a R357E mutation could not be rescued by simply coreconstituting it with wild-type SecY monomer, probably because the desired dimer combination constituted only a small percentage and because the R357E mutation affects SecY dimerization (Tam et al., 2005Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. Investigating the SecY plug movement at the SecYEG translocation channel.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Next, we followed the insertion of the mature region of pOA into tandem constructs, in which one SecY copy contained a cysteine at position 68, and the R357E mutation was present in one or both SecY copies. Proteoliposomes containing these purified mutant proteins were all able to translocate pOA, except if both SecY copies contained the R357E mutation (Figure 5A). Disulfide bond formation occurred between pOA-175C and monomeric SecY-68C (Figure 5B, lane 4), but was abolished when the R357E mutation was introduced (lane 6). Wild-type tandem SecY complexes containing 68C either in the first or second copy of SecY were able to form a disulfide bridge with pOA-175C (Figure 5B, lanes 8 and 16). When both SecY copies contained the R357E mutation, no crosslink was observed (lane 14). Most significantly, when the first SecY copy contained both the 68C and R357E mutations and the second copy was wild-type, disulfide bridge formation was observed (lane 10; scheme in Figure 5C). Surprisingly, the tandem construct in which the cysteine was in the first, otherwise wild-type copy, and the R357E mutation in the second, yielded weaker crosslinks (lane 12; by a factor of 2.7–5.7 in three experiments). Similarly, a wild-type SecY copy at the N terminus allowed significant crosslinking to a dead SecY copy at the C terminus (lane 18); by comparison, a dead copy at the N terminus showed weaker crosslinking by the associated wild-type copy (lane 20; by a factor of 2.7–5.9). These results again indicate that an oligomer of SecY mediates translocation. They also suggest that the translocating SecY copy is less sensitive to the R357E mutation than the nontranslocating copy. Why is translocation mediated by oligomers of the SecY complex? One possibility is that one copy of SecY is primarily responsible for SecA binding, while another forms the pore. In a tandem construct, one may then expect that one SecY copy can be crosslinked to SecA, and simultaneously the other copy to the substrate. To test this idea, we first screened for combinations of cysteines in SecY and SecA that would give efficient disulfide crosslinks. Because the N terminus of SecA interacts with SecY (Dapic and Oliver, 2000Dapic V. Oliver D. Distinct membrane binding properties of N- and C-terminal domains of Escherichia coli SecA ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Mori and Ito, 2006Mori H. Ito K.

USA. 2006; 103: 16159-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we introduced single cysteines into the NBF1 domain. The cysteines in SecY were placed into the 6/7 loop, previously implicated in SecA binding (Mori and Ito, 2006Mori H. Ito K.

Purified SecA mutants were mixed with proteoliposomes containing purified SecY mutants, and treated with an oxidant to induce disulfide bridge formation. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie blue. Cysteines at positions 48, 55, 163, and 202 of SecA formed a disulfide bond with cysteines introduced into the tip of the 6/7 loop of SecY (Figure 6A, lanes 7, 8, 12, 13, 27, 47, and 48). The identity of the crosslinked species was confirmed by immunoblotting with SecA and SecY antibodies (data not shown). Cysteines introduced at positions 148, 153, 180, 184, or 188 of SecA did not crosslink to the 6/7 loop. All SecA residues that gave crosslinks were localized to one face of NBF1 (Figure 6B; colored in red). For subsequent experiments, we chose a cysteine at position 48 in the NBF1 domain of SecA (SecA-48C) and a cysteine at position 255 in the 6/7 loop of SecY (SecY-255C). This combination gave a prominent disulfide bridge in the presence or absence of ATP (Figure 6C, lane 9, and data not shown). A crosslink of the same intensity was seen if SecY contained an additional cysteine at"

Ligand stimulation of G protein- and tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors activates phospholipase C generating the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The former functions as a chemical messenger that interacts with IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) to rapidly release calcium from the ER lumen (1.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). The initial release of calcium is followed by a more sustained entry of calcium into cells via several potential mechanisms, including calcium release-activated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, and receptor-operated calcium channels (2.Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). The tonic phase of calcium entry mediates long term calcium signaling and provides calcium to replenish intracellular stores.

There is growing evidence that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family can assemble in the plasma membrane to participate in cation influx pathways. TRPs are members of a large superfamily of mammalian TRP channels (TRPCs), and to date, seven TRPCs (TRPC1-7) have been identified (5.Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Heterologous expressions of the highly homologous TRPC3, -6, and -7 channels are clearly activated by phospholipase C-derived DAG (6.Okada T. Shimizu S. Wakamori M. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Takada N.

In vascular endothelial cells, sustained calcium entry into the cytosol is necessary to release vasoactive agents such as nitric oxide or prostaglandins (12.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A.

The compositions of the native TRPC channels in endothelial cells are not known and are likely complex and species-specific. However, there is recent evidence that TRPC3/C4 heteromers are necessary for cation influx activated by redox signaling in porcine endothelial cells (14.Poteser M. Graziani A. Rosker C. Eder P.

Recently, we have developed a mouse model to study the effects Cav-1 on endothelial function in vivo by breeding the Cav-1 knock-out mice to endothelium-specific Cav-1 transgenic mice, thus rescuing caveolae in the endothelium only (23.Yu J. Bergaya S. Murata T. Alp I.F. Bauer M.P. Lin M.I. Drab M. Kurzchalia T.V. Stan R.V. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1284-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Here we show using genetic criterion in intact blood vessels and isolated cells that Cav-1 is necessary for the second phase of calcium entry in endothelial cells. Mechanistically, Cav-1 is associated with a dynamic protein complex consisting of TRPC4, TRPC1, and IP3Rs, and the loss of Cav-1 impairs the localization of TRPC4 and agonist-simulated complex formation. These data favor the idea that Cav-1 in caveolae of specialized cells, such as endothelia, may serve as a scaffold to integrate TRPC regulation of calcium influx pathways.

Male mice (8-10 weeks old) were used for the experiments. Lungs were dissected from the mice, minced in 0.1% collagenase, and homogenized by passing through a needle (14-gauge). After centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min), cells were plated into flasks and were cultured for 2 days. Cell were then immortalized by infection with a retrovirus expressing the polyoma middle T antigen, and cultured again for 2 days.

MLEC Staining−Confluent MLEC were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4 °C, 10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (room temperature, 5-15 min), and blocked with 3% normal goat serum containing PBS (room temperature, 30 min). Then the cells were probed with anti-Cav-1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-TRPC1 (Alomone Labs and Pharmingen) and anti-TRPC4 (Alomone Labs) polyclonal antibodies, and rabbit anti-IP3Rs polyclonal antibody (kindly donated by Barbara Ehrlich; 1:500 dilution at room temperature for 3 h). Alexa 568 anti-rabbit IgG and 488 anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probe) were used as secondary antibodies. Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG and 568 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe) were used as secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, room temperature, 1 h). For actin staining, we applied Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probe) to samples (1:200 dilution, room temperature,10 min) after the paraformaldehyde fixation. After mounting of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, all of the images were captured using a Carl Zeiss scanning microscope Axiovert 200M imaging system (×400-630), and images were digitized under constant exposure time, gain, and offset. After capturing images, protein co-localization and cell area were measured by the OpenLab program (Improvision). Cav-1 WT, KO, and RC mice were perfused for 10 min at room temperature under anesthesia with oxygenated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium through the left ventricle, followed by fixation by perfusion (10 min at room temperature) with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer. Specimens were taken from lung and trimmed into small blocks. The blocks were immersed into fresh fixative (1 h at room temperature), washed twice (15 min at room temperature) in 0.1 m cacodylate, postfixed in Palade's OsO4 (1 h on ice), stained en bloc in Kellemberger's uranyl acetate (overnight at room temperature), dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in LX112 resin (Ladd Research Industries). Thin sections (50 nm) were cut, stained with lead citrate, and examined and photographed under an electron microscope (JEOL 1200EX or CM10, Phillips Electronic Instruments). After 12 h of incubation, pulmonary arterial segments (4 mm) were placed in sterile 48-well tissue culture plates with 300 μl of HEPES solution at 37 °C and kept in the incubator for 30 min. Aliquots of 100 μl were then taken to measure the basal release of prostacyclin. ACh (3 μm) and ionomycin (3 μm) were added, and the plate was incubated for an additional 30 min, after which the aliquots were again taken to measure the ACh-stimulated release of prostacyclin. This protocol was carried out both in the absence and in the presence of ibuprofen (10 μm) and La3+ (300 μm). The aliquots were frozen, and prostacyclin release was measured as the stable breakdown product, 6-keto-PGF1α, by immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences). Serum-starved MLECs were stimulated by ACh (3 μm) for 3 min, homogenized in 7.5% trichloroacetic acid solution, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, as described previously. The cell suspensions were applied to an IP3 (25.Missiaen L. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) Biotrak Assay System (GE Healthcare), and pellets were used to determine protein content. IP3 contents are expressed as pmol/mg protein content. Tissue and Cell [Ca2+]i Measurements−Measurement of the [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells in situ was performed using fluo-4AM (Molecular Probe) according to the method described previously (26.Murata T. Sato K. Hori M. Ozaki H. Karaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44085-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The artery (0.6 mm wide) and confluent MLEC were incubated in physiological salt solution (136.9 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 23.8 mm NaHCO3, and 5.5 mm glucose) with 5-μm fluo-4AM and 0.02% cremophor EL for 30 min at room temperature. The opened strip of pulmonary artery or MLEC was mounted on the stage of a microscope, and the images were captured by a Carl Zeiss scanning microscope Axiovert 200M imaging system (×100-400) using 488-nm (excitation) and 540-nm (emission) filters. Images of vascular endothelial cells stained with fluo-4 were taken every 1.8-10 s at 37 °C, and data were expressed as the change in fluorescence after agonist challenge relative to base line (F/Fo) as a function of time. Confluent MLEC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were Dounce-homogenized (30 strokes), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 20-50 μg of each protein was subjected to regular Western blot analysis. Small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) duplexes for mouse TRPC1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_011643) and TRPC4 (GenBank™ accession number NM_016984) were designed by Qiagen. Individual TRPC1 siRNA duplexes (sense sequences) were as follows: TRPC1, r(CGAGGACUAGAAGAAA9)dTdT and r(GCCGUAAGCCCACCUGUAA)dTdT, and TRPC4, r(CGUUAUUCGAGACACUACA)dTdT and r(GGAGCACUUGAGCGAAAUA)dTdT. MLEC maintained in serum-free EBM-2 were transfected with siRNAs (40 nm) using Lipo-fectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol. Fresh medium was added 6 h post-transfection, and experiments were conducted 72 h after transfection to assess mRNA levels using each specific primers against TRPC1 and -4 and protein using Western blotting. Confluent MLEC (3 × 150-mm dish) were serum-starved for 48 h and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11), and sonicated (3 times, 20-s bursts). The homogenate was then adjusted to 42.5% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 85% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 17 h in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradient fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the tube to yield a total of 12 fractions, and each fraction (fractions 1-12) was used for Western blot analysis. Blots were probed with the anti-Cav-1 monoclonal (1:500), anti-TRPC1 polyclonal (1:200), and anti-TRPC4 polyclonal (1:200) antibodies (as described above), rabbit anti-IP3R1 polyclonal antibody (1:500; Calbiochem), anti-IP3R3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-flotillin-2 monoclonal (1:5000; BD Transduction Laboratories) and anti-α-actin monoclonal anti-bodies (1:5000; Sigma). Tissues and MLECs for Western blot analysis were resuspended in lysis buffer (for TRPC1 and -4, and IP3Rs immunoprecipitation: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, and protease inhibitor mixture (mentioned above); for Cav-1 immunoprecipitation: 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mm n-octyl-d-glucopyranoside, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Pefabloc, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. One thousand (for TRPC1 and -4, and IP3Rs) or 500 μg (Cav-1) of protein from lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation. Anti-TRPC1 and -4, IP3Rs, and 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) were added to the supernatant, which was then rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing 3 times with lysis buffer, binding protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Construction of the Cav fusion proteins was performed as follows. Full-length Cav-1 (residues 1-178, Cav-FL) and Cav subdomains (the N-terminal domains, residues 1-61 and 61-101) and the C-terminal domain (residues 135-178) were separately amplified by PCR and subcloned into the vector pGEX-4T-1 (XmaI-XhoI sites) as described previously (27.Gratton J.P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). All fusions in Escherichia coli strain BL-21, were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and lysed by sonication (three 20-s bursts) after addition of purification buffer (7.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% N-lauryl Sarkosyl (v/v), 2% Triton X-100, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA). Debris was removed by centrifugation. Purified GST-Cavs were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare). Cells were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Lysates (500 μg of proteins) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with beads containing either GST alone or GST-Cav. After binding, the beads were washed (3 times) with wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. Binding protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. The results of the experiments were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey post-test for comparison between groups using Prism 3.0. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Cav-1 Is Necessary for Acetylcholine-induced Calcium Fluxes and Prostacyclin Production−Previously, we have established mice deficient in Cav-1 that were bred to transgenic mice expressing Cav-1 in endothelial cells only (23.Yu J. Bergaya S. Murata T. Alp I.F. Bauer M.P. Lin M.I. Drab M. Kurzchalia T.V. Stan R.V. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1284-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, PCR genotyping of WT mice expressing endogenous murine Cav-1, Cav-1-/- mice (labeled Cav-1 KO) was determined by the presence of the neomycin cassette and lack of the endogenous gene, whereas the Cav-1-/- mice bred to the EC specific transgenic Cav-1 mice (Cav-1-/-, TG EC-Cav-1; labeled Cav-1 RC) contains the neomycin cassette and the transgenic canine Cav-1 gene but lacks the endogenous gene. Fig. 1B documents Cav-1 protein expression in intrapulmonary arteries isolated from these mice. WT mice demonstrate the presence of Cav-1 (Fig. 1B left column) in both endothelial and smooth muscle layers (n = 6, top panel shows Cav-1 alone, middle panel shows labeling of smooth muscle α-actin, and bottom panel show the merged images), whereas as Cav-1 KO (middle column) lacks Cav-1 immunostaining in both layers (n = 9). Reconstitution of Cav-1 into the endothelium generated by crossing Cav-1 KO to EC-specific Cav-1 TG mice reintroduces Cav-1 into the endothelium but not into smooth muscle layers marked by smooth muscle α-actin staining (n = 22; Fig. 1B, right columns). Next we used whole-mount staining of the endothelium to examine the extent of Cav-1 reconstitution in these strains. As seen in Fig. 1C, WT and Cav-1 RC have relatively equal levels of immunoreactive Cav-1 in endothelial cells (n = 6 and 10, respectively; top row, left and right columns) defined by the endothelial cell marker, PECAM-1 (n = 6 each; bottom row). Cav-1 KO vessels lack endothelial cell Cav-1 immunoreactivity without changing the levels of PECAM-1 (n = 10 and 6, respectively). In multiple experiments, we estimate ∼85-90% of the endothelial cells from intrapulmonary arteries are Cav-1-positive. Cav-1 KO mice lack caveolae organelles in several tissues examined, including blood vessels, adipocytes, and fibroblasts (18.Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 28.Razani B. Park D.S. Miyanaga Y. Ghatpande A. Cohen J. Wang X.B. Scherer P.E. Evans T. Lisanti M.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7914-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, transmission electron micrographs document the presence of ample caveolae in EC lining pulmonary vessels, the loss of EC caveolae in Cav-1 KO vessels, and the presence of the organelle in the Cav-1 RC vessels. Thus, we have generated a model of Cav-1 re-expression in the endothelium only, resulting in formation of endothelial caveolae. Next, we examined the changes in endothelial [Ca2+]i induced by the calcium-mobilizing agonist ACh (3 μm)by imaging fields of endothelial cells lining the intrapulmonary arteries loaded with the calcium indicator fluo-4AM. As shown in Fig. 1E, ACh induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained increase in all of the arteries (n = 5 each). However, the sustained phases of [Ca2+]i stimulated by ACh was reduced in the endothelium of Cav-1 KO pulmonary arteries compared with that seen in WT and Cav-1 RC mice. Thus, Cav-1 reconstitution in the endothelium completely restored the impairment in [Ca2+]i fluxes during the tonic phase of the response. Next we sought to examine if the reduction in stimulated changes in calcium entry may impair endothelial function. To this end, we examined ACh-stimulated increases in prostacyclin production (an index of endothelial function; quantified by the stable breakdown product 6-keto-PGF1α), which is known to be calcium-dependent (13.Kan H. Ruan Y. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of Cav-1 reduced resting and ACh but not ionomycin-induced 6-keto-PGF1α production in vessels compared with vessels from WT and Cav-1 RC mice (n = 5 each, Fig. 1F). The cyclooxgenase inhibitor ibuprofen completely inhibited 6-keto-PGF1α production in all of the arteries (n = 5 each). To confirm the dependence of 6-keto-PGF1α release on extracellular calcium, vessels were treated with the nonspecific blocker lanthanum (La3+; 300 μm). La3+ inhibited ACh-induced prostacyclin release in the pulmonary arteries from WT mice (n = 4). These results demonstrate that the impairment in endothelial cell calcium handling in Cav-1 KO mice results in reduced endothelial function quantified by the release of prostacyclin, and both calcium fluxes and prostacyclin production could be genetically rescued by the endothelium-specific transgenic Cav-1. Ca2+ Fluxes and Entry, but Not IP3 Production, Are Impaired in Isolated Endothelial Cells of Cav-1 KO Mice and Rescued by Reintroduction of Endothelial Cav-1−To examine potential mechanisms of how the loss of Cav-1 and caveolae impaired the tonic phase of agonist-stimulated changes in calcium, MLEC were isolated from WT, Cav-1 KO, and Cav-1 RC mice. ACh-, but not ionomycin, stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i were decreased in Cav-1 KO MLEC compared with cells isolated from WT and Cav-1 RC mice (n = 5 individual experiments; five individual cells each; see Fig. 2A). These data are consistent with the data collected monitoring intracellular calcium in the endothelium of intact blood vessels. It is well accepted that Ca2+ enters the cytosol from two general sources, namely Ca2+ release from mainly the ER and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Next, we investigated whether Cav-1 deficiency would affect Ca2+ release from the intracellular calcium stores. Fig. 2B shows typical traces of calcium signal intensities, and C and D show the summary from individual experiments quantifying phasic (C) and tonic (D) calcium levels after ACh (n = 5 experiments per cell type; three individual cells shown). In the absence of external Ca2+ (plus 0.5 mm EGTA), stimulation with ACh (Fig. 2B, top, left panel) induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i due to primarily Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Cav-1 deficiency slightly decreased the amount of ACh-induced peak Ca2+ release, an effect rescued by Cav-1 (Fig. 2C). Next, we investigated the effects of Cav-1 on Ca2+ entry. Re-addition of external Ca2+ after ACh stimulation induced sustained Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2B), and the loss of Cav-1 markedly attenuated the entry of Ca2+ by at least 50% (see top left panel after re-addition of 2 mm Ca2+ after stimulation by ACh and summary data in Fig. 2D). We further investigated calcium entry by examining the effects of three nonspecific inhibitors of cation entry, gadolinium (Gd3+), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and lanthanum (La3+; n = 4 experiments) in WT endothelial cells. Gd3+ (100-300 μm), 2-APB (100 μm), and La3+(100-300 μm) all decreased ACh-induced Ca2+ entry (see Fig. 2B and summary of data in Fig. 2D). ACh binding to muscarinic receptors leads to phospholipase Cγ activation and the generation of DAG and IP3. To examine if Cav-1 was important for IP3 generation, we measured basal and stimulated IP3 accumulation in WT, Cav-1 KO, and Cav-1 RC MLEC. As seen in Fig. 2E, basal and ACh-stimulated IP3 accumulations were identical from these cells suggesting that defective calcium influx was not attributable to d"

https://openalex.org/W2102465785,"In both the vertebrate nose and the insect antenna, most olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) respond to multiple odors. However, some ORNs respond to just a single odor, or at most to a few highly related odors. It has been hypothesized that narrowly tuned ORNs project to narrowly tuned neurons in the brain, and that these dedicated circuits mediate innate behavioral responses to a particular ligand. Here we have investigated neural activity and behavior downstream from two narrowly tuned ORN types in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that genetically ablating either of these ORN types impairs innate behavioral attraction to their cognate ligand. Neurons in the antennal lobe postsynaptic to one of these ORN types are, like their presynaptic ORNs, narrowly tuned to a pheromone. However, neurons postsynaptic to the second ORN type are broadly tuned. These results demonstrate that some narrowly tuned ORNs project to dedicated central circuits, ensuring a tight connection between stimulus and behavior, whereas others project to central neurons that participate in the ensemble representations of many odors."

https://openalex.org/W1986866841,"Human mitochondrial Lon is an ATP-powered proteolytic machine that specifically binds to single-stranded G-rich DNA and RNA in vitro. However, it is unknown whether Lon binds mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in living cells or functions in mtDNA integrity. Here, we demonstrate that Lon interacts with the mitochondrial genome in cultured cells using mtDNA immunoprecipitation (mIP). Lon associates with sites distributed primarily within one-half of the genome and preferentially with the control region for mtDNA replication and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis of mIP data revealed a G-rich consensus sequence. Consistent with these findings, in vitro experiments showed that the affinity of Lon for single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides correlates with conformity to this consensus. To examine the role of Lon in mtDNA maintenance, cells carrying an inducible short hairpin RNA for Lon depletion were used. In control and Lon-depleted cells, mtDNA copy number was essentially the same in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. However when oxidatively stressed, control cells exhibited an increased frequency of mtDNA lesions, whereas Lon-depleted cells showed little if any mtDNA damage. This suggests that oxidative mtDNA damage is permitted when Lon is present and prevented when Lon is substantially depleted. Upon oxidative stress, mIP showed reduced Lon binding to mtDNA; however binding to the control region was unaffected. It is unlikely that oxidative modification of Lon blocks its ability to bind DNA in vivo as results show that oxidized purified Lon retains sequence-specific DNA binding. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mtDNA binding is a physiological function of Lon and that cellular levels of Lon influence sensitivity to mtDNA damage. These findings suggest roles for Lon in linking protein and mtDNA quality control.

Furthermore, order-of-addition experiments demonstrate that once protein substrate stimulates DNA binding, added nucleotide leads to DNA release and vice versa. Thus, nucleotide inhibition and protein substrate stimulation coordinately regulate DNA binding. Whether nucleic acid binding by Lon is a physiological function of the protease has not been demonstrated.

Yeast mutants lacking the Lon ortholog Pim1p exhibit large mtDNA deletions (18van Dyck L. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 238-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Suzuki C.K. Suda K. Wang N. Schatz G. Science. 1994; 264 (and 891): 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and Lon-mediated proteolysis is required for the expression of mitochondrial transcripts that contain introns (20van Dyck L. Neupert W. Langer T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, in higher eukaryotes it is unknown whether Lon is involved in the maintenance and expression of the mitochondrial genome. Human mtDNA is a small circular genome of ∼16.6 kb that encodes 13 proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (Fig. 1A) (21Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 22Albring M. Griffith J. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1348-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MtDNA consists of a heavy and light strand; the heavy strand is distinguished by a higher percentage of guanine and thymine residues resulting in its greater mass. Both rRNAs and all but one structural protein are encoded by the GT-rich heavy strand. In addition, mtDNA contains a noncoding region, referred to as the control region (CR), that carries the light and heavy strand promoters (LSP and HSP, respectively), as well as replication elements and the displacement loop (D-loop), which is a stable three-stranded structure composed of the parental strands and a partially replicated daughter molecule (see Fig. 1A) (23Eichler D.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 129-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a combination of cell biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to answer several fundamental questions pertaining to the function of human Lon in mtDNA maintenance. Does human Lon bind to the mitochondrial genome in living cells, what is the nature of DNA sequences bound, and does Lon play a role in mtDNA integrity? We show that in cultured cells, Lon binds to mtDNA sites, which are distributed within one-half of the mitochondrial genome and associates preferentially with the CR. When cells are oxidatively stressed, Lon binds to significantly fewer sites within mtDNA; however, binding to CR is unaffected. The binding affinity of purified Lon for DNA oligonucleotides correlates with their conformity to the G-rich consensus sequence identified by bioinformatics. Consistent with mIP, purified Lon binds with highest affinity to a mtDNA sequence overlapping LSP within the CR. Cellular levels of Lon influence the sensitivity to H2O2-induced mtDNA lesions such that increased damage is observed when Lon levels are normal as compared with when Lon is down-regulated. Taken together, these results provide new insight into the potential roles of Lon in mtDNA metabolism, damage, and repair. Cell Culture—HeLa and LS174T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (complete DMEM). Inducible RNA Interference (RNAi)—The pTER vector system (25van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) was used for integrating and expressing an inducible short hairpin RNA under a doxycycline (Dox)-regulated H1 promoter. A 68-base oligonucleotide 5′-gatctccgttcgtctcgcccagccttttcaagagaaaggctgggcgagacgaactttttggaaagctt-3′ (starting at position 476 of the Lon coding sequence) was annealed to its complementary sequence and cloned into pTER+. The siRNA (short interfering RNA) construct and a control construct lacking an oligonucleotide insert were stably integrated into LS174T cells that expressed the tetracycline (Tet) repressor resulting in LonRNAi or control cell lines, respectively. Clones were selected in complete DMEM supplemented with uridine (50 μg/ml), blasticidin (4 μg/ml), and zeocin (500 μg/ml); inducible depletion of Lon was determined by immunoblotting protein extracts isolated from cells incubated with or without Dox (4.0 μg/ml). Expression of the short hairpin RNA leads to substantial but not complete Lon depletion, as determined by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with anti-Lon antibodies (data not shown). Mitochondrial DNA Immunoprecipitation (mIP)—HeLa or LS174T cells were cultured to 90% confluency. Formaldehyde cross-linking solution (11% formaldehyde, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA) was added to 1/10th final volume and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was terminated by adding glycine (125 mm final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested and incubated in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing leupeptin, 100 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm) for 15 min on ice. Cellular DNA was sheared by sonication using a Misonix Ultrasonic Processor XL fitted with a microtip (setting 3) for 5 s followed by a pause for 30 s and repeated four times. The size of DNA fragments produced was between 500 and 900 base pairs as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Cell extracts (1 mg) were precleared with protein A-agarose; a rabbit anti-Lon antibody (8Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene. 2003; 306: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that was affinity-purified or a nonspecific affinity-purified rabbit anti-interleukin-8 antibody (PeproTech 500-P2850) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added for 2 h at 4 °C to isolate protein-DNA complexes. Samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 140 mm NaCl; three times with RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl; three times with LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA); and two times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). TE buffer containing 0.5% SDS (200 μl) was added to the samples and incubated for 6 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. To each reaction, 20 μl of 3 m NaOAc (pH 5.2), 20 μg of glycogen, and 500 μl of absolute ethanol were added and placed overnight at –80 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature, and the pelleted material was washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 200 μl of MilliQ water containing 50 μg/ml RNase, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteinase K (100 μg/ml) and SDS (0.25% final concentration) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction followed by chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and DNA ethanol precipitation. The mIP mtDNA was suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Control mtDNA from HeLa cells (ρ+) was purified using a Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA purification kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control and mIP mtDNA were subjected to PCR analysis using 27 primer pairs; supplemental Table S1 shows the numerical assignment of primer pairs, the regions of mtDNA amplified, and the corresponding DNA sequences. PCR reactions were performed with 20 pmol of each primer in a 25-μl mixture (200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2; Applied Biosystems) using a Biometra TRIO 20 Thermoblock. Amplification conditions were: one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and then finally one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. Reactions were analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.3% agarose gel in TAE buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Quantitative PCR (QPCR) of mIP DNA—QPCR was performed with TaqMan primers and probes (supplemental Table S2) using 1 μl of the mIP DNA in a 50-μl mixture (1× TaqMan Master Mix, each primer at 200 nm, 100 nm TaqMan probe). Thermal cycling was performed using the following parameters: AmpErase UNG activation was at 50 °C for 2 min, and AmpliTaq Gold activation was at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The amount of mtDNA amplified by QPCR from 1 μl of a mIP reaction was determined from standard curves using known concentrations of each target sequence (supplemental Fig. 1). This amount was multiplied by 50 to determine the total amount of mtDNA isolated by mIP/milligram of cell extract, as 1/50th of the mtDNA isolated by mIP was used for QPCR. The results of three independent mIP preparations were used to calculate the standard error of the mean presented in Fig. 1E. Multiple Expectation Maximization Motif Elicitation (MEME) and Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) Analysis—To identify a consensus sequence within the mIP amplified regions of mtDNA, computational analysis was performed using MEME (meme.sdsc.edu) (26Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). The training set included the 11 mtDNA regions amplified by mIP with the following parameter settings: MEME was set to find any number of nonoverlapping sites within each of the training set sequences; motif width setting was restricted to 15 nucleotides; both heavy and light strands of mtDNA were searched. To search sequences conforming to the MEME-derived motif within mtDNA (GenBank™ accession number NC_001807), analysis was performed using MAST (27Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). H2O2 Treatment and Determination of mtDNA Copy Number and Integrity by Gene-specific QPCR—Cells were exposed to 100 μm H2O2 in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C and then immediately washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested; QPCR was performed as described previously (28Ayala-Torres S. Chen Y. Svoboda T. Rosenblatt J. Van Houten B. Methods (Amst.). 2000; 22: 135-147Google Scholar, 29Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol.

Briefly, total DNA was isolated from control or LonRNAi cells with or without Dox and treated or untreated with H2O2. DNA was quantified using PicoGreen, and QPCR was performed with identical amounts of input DNA. Specific primers were used to amplify a fragment of the β-globin gene (13.5 kb) to determine nuclear DNA integrity; a large fragment of mtDNA (8.9 kb) to determine mtDNA integrity; and a small fragment (139 bp) of the mitochondrial genome to monitor changes in mtDNA copy number and to normalize the data obtained when amplifying the 8.9-kb fragment. Relative amplifications were calculated comparing H2O2 treated with respective controls; these values were used to estimate mathematically the number of lesions present in DNA, assuming a Poisson distribution (28Ayala-Torres S. Chen Y. Svoboda T. Rosenblatt J. Van Houten B. Methods (Amst.). 2000; 22: 135-147Google Scholar, 29Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol.

The data shown represent results from three independent experiments in which duplicate QPCR reactions for each target DNA region were performed; the standard error of the mean is indicated. Statistical significance was evaluated with Student's unpaired t test. Breakdown of H2O2—H2O2 concentrations in the culture medium were determined using Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence was recorded in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Synergy™ HT multi-detection microplate reader) with 528 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths. Standard curves were determined using known concentrations of H2O2 diluted in serum-free DMEM. Background fluorescence was measured using DMEM alone and subtracted from each value. Oxidative Modification of Lon—Lon (4 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of H2O2 for 60 min at 37 °C, after which 5 units of catalase was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Carbonylation of Lon (20 pmol) was detected using the Oxyblot assay (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protease, ATPase, and DNA Binding Assays—Recombinant human Lon was purified as described previously (7Liu T. Lu B. Lee I. Ondrovicova G. Kutejova E. Suzuki C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activity was determined using the Quanticleave protease assay kit (Pierce). Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications, and 150 nm Lon, 4 μm FITC-casein, 2 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 were added. The ATPase activity of Lon was determined with the Malachite Green phosphate assay kit (BioAssay Systems) using the manufacturer's protocol with 50 nm Lon and 400 nm casein to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. Lon binding to DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences within human mtDNA (supplemental Table S3) was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (7Liu T. Lu B. Lee I. Ondrovicova G. Kutejova E. Suzuki C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene. 2003; 306: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA binding reactions (30 μl) were performed using purified Lon (10 pmol of Lon monomer) incubated with radiolabeled probe (2–3 pmol) in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at a 10-, 50-, and 100-fold excess. Binding to DNA by H2O2-treated Lon was determined by Southwestern analysis using 40 pmol of Lon that was separated electrophoretically on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated in renaturation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with probe (1.6 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h at room temperature and washed with buffer to remove unbound probe; the bound probe was visualized by phosphorimaging. Mitochondrial DNA Immunoprecipitation—To establish whether Lon binds to mtDNA in living cells, we utilized the mIP assay, adapted from well established protocols for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP has been used to identify protein-DNA interactions regulating DNA replication and chromosome stability and transcription (31Das P.M. Ramachandran K. van Wert J. Singal R. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 961-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 33Meluh P.B. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both ChIP and mIP provide a spatial map of DNA binding that may change depending, for example, on the cell cycle, intra- or extracellular signals, or response to stress. These assays are not aimed at demonstrating sequence specificity and affinity per se. Briefly, HeLa cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein to DNA and then harvested and lysed, and cellular DNA was sheared by sonication. Lon was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and co-precipitated mtDNA was identified by PCR using primer pairs that amplified overlapping regions of the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). The principal advantage of this approach is that cross-linking of protein bound to DNA occurs in a physiological environment, in contrast to techniques in which protein-DNA interactions are assayed using purified components. The results of the mIP performed with HeLa cells showed that 11 PCR products were amplified using the primer pairs 9–12, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, and 27 (Fig. 1, B and C). The amplified regions contained sequences encoding the D-loop/CR, cytochrome b (cytb), cytochrome c oxidase subunits (COX1 and -2), F1F0-ATP synthase subunits (ATPase 6 and 8), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits (ND4, -4L, -5, and -6) as well as several tRNAs. Control PCR reactions using purified HeLa mtDNA resulted in products of the expected size (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S1). Negative controls were performed by immunoprecipitating Lon from HeLa cells that completely lacked mtDNA (HeLa ρ0). As expected, no PCR products were amplified from contaminating nuclear DNA. Negative controls were also performed using an irrelevant rabbit antibody recognizing interleukin-8; no PCR products were amplified (data not shown). In the mIP assay, the intensity of the DNA bands visualized on agarose gels cannot be used to quantify or even estimate the amount of mtDNA bound by Lon. This is because in standard PCR reactions, amplification efficiencies are not identical for all primer pairs because of the relatively large size of the DNA products and sequence content differences. Therefore, QPCR was employed to determine the amounts of mtDNA co-precipitated with Lon in mIP assays. In these QPCR reactions relatively small DNA products were amplified and quantified in real time using a “probe” that fluoresces upon release of a quencher. Primer probe sets were designed to amplify mIP regions 12, 17, 24, and 27 that contained sequences encoding cytb, ND4, ATP6/8, and the D-loop/CR, respectively (supplemental Table S2). The amount of mtDNA associated with Lon was determined from standard curves using known amounts of target mtDNA (supplemental Fig. S1). The cytb region is of particular interest, as it is the mIP-amplified region closest to the D-loop/CR. Results demonstrated that ∼3 times more D-loop/CR associated with Lon than with the other regions examined (Fig. 1E). Bioinformatic Analysis of Lon Consensus Sites—Potential Lon binding sites within mIP-amplified mtDNA were identified by computational analysis using MEME (26Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1995; 3: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). MEME searched mtDNA with a motif width setting restricted to 15 nucleotides (2 nucleotides longer than the Lon DNA footprint). Previous footprinting analysis demonstrated that Lon protected a 13-nucleotide region within a ssDNA oligonucleotide called LSPas that consists of a sequence overlapping the heavy strand of LSP (6Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). MEME derived a consensus sequence that gave a p value of 5.1 × 10–32, where lower p values indicate a lower probability of random occurrence. The consensus sequence was G-rich and contained a cluster of five centrally located guanines; notably, there were no C residues present within the identified motif (Fig. 2A). To determine the distribution of this consensus motif within the mitochondrial genome, the program MAST was used (27Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The distribution of consensus sequences within mtDNA is shown in Fig. 2B. Sequences with p values with the greatest similarity to the consensus motif having the lowest p values (≤10–6) were located in only 11 of the mIP regions. Consensus sequences with p values on the order of 10–5 were located in 21 of the mIP region, whereas those on order of 10–4 were located throughout the mitochondrial genome and in all mIP regions. In HeLa cells, mIP results showed that Lon was bound to mtDNA regions having consensus sequences with the lowest p values; 8 of the 11 mIP regions amplified contained such sites. The sequence protected by Lon in DNA footprinting experiments that is located within mIP region 27 was among the top “hits” identified by MAST. These bioinformatic data make predictions about the binding of Lon to DNA sequences in vitro. Lon Binding to Consensus Sites in Vitro—The mIP technique does not demonstrate the sequence specificity or affinity of a protein for DNA, nor does it distinguish between protein binding to single- or double-stranded DNA. In addition, it has not been possible to specify Lon binding sites that are <300 bp apart within mtDNA, because the"

Based on evidence that myristic acid and TSP1 each modulate endothelial cell nitric oxide signaling in a CD36-dependent manner, we examined the ability of TSP1 to modulate the fatty acid translocase activity of CD36. TSP1 and a CD36 antibody that mimics the activity of TSP1 inhibited myristate uptake. Recombinant TSP1 type 1 repeats were weakly inhibitory, but an anti-angiogenic peptide derived from this domain potently inhibited myristate uptake. This peptide also inhibited membrane translocation of the myristoylated CD36 signaling target Fyn and activation of Src family kinases. Myristate uptake stimulated cGMP synthesis via endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase. CD36 ligands blocked myristate-stimulated cGMP accumulation in proportion to their ability to inhibit myristate uptake. TSP1 also inhibited myristate-stimulated cGMP synthesis by engaging its receptor CD47. Myristate stimulated endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell adhesion on type I collagen via the NO/cGMP pathway, and CD36 ligands that inhibit myristate uptake blocked this response. Therefore, the fatty acid translocase activity of CD36 elicits proangiogenic signaling in vascular cells, and TSP1 inhibits this response by simultaneously inhibiting fatty acid uptake via CD36 and downstream cGMP signaling via CD47.

Pathological angiogenesis or the lack thereof underlies a number of major diseases (1Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar).

Defining the mechanism of action of these inhibitors has been complicated by the finding that vascular cells express multiple receptors for several of these molecules. In the case of TSP1, endothelial cells express at least eight receptors, and some of these elicit pro- rather than anti-angiogenic responses (4Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Zhang J. Krutzsch H.C.

CD36, a member of the scavenger receptor B family, is a TSP1 receptor that is selectively expressed in microvascular endothelium (7Kerkhoff C. Sorg C. Tandon N.N. Nacken W.

Investig. 1997; 100: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CD36 was initially reported to recognize CSVTCG sequences in the type 1 repeats of TSP1 (9Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but further studies identified higher affinity binding to the adjacent GVQXR sequences in the second and third type 1 repeats (10Dawson D.W.

Silverstein R.L. Henkin J. Bouck N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CD36 binding was markedly enhanced by epimerization of the first Ile in a peptide from the second type 1 repeat 434GDGVITRIR442, where I (Ile) is the d isomer (11Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Pearce S.F. Schneider A.J. Silverstein R.L. Henkin J. Bouck N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TSP1, recombinant type 1 repeats of TSP1, and peptide mimetics of its CD36 binding sequences inhibit FGF2-stimulated endothelial cell migration and induce apoptosis in vitro and inhibit FGF2-induced corneal angiogenesis in vivo. The pro-apoptotic signal from CD36 requires activation of the Src family kinase p59-Fyn, signaling through p38, and downstream activation of caspase-3-like proteases (12Jimenez B. Volpert O.V. Crawford S.E. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 is also involved in the anti-motility activity of TSP1 mediated by CD36 (13Jimenez B. Volpert O.V. Reiher F. Chang L. Munoz A. Karin M. Bouck N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3443-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Combined with the observation that several Src family kinases co-immunoprecipitate with CD36 (14Huang M.M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Bull H.A. Brickell P.M. Dowd P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), these results imply that TSP1 signals through CD36 via a physical coupling to Fyn activation. However, a subsequent study concluded that Src kinases and CD36 mutually associate with lipid rafts but lack any direct binding interaction (16Thorne R.F. Law E.G. Elith C.A. Ralston K.J. Bates R.C. Burns G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We recently identified a new downstream target for the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 that involves CD36 (17Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) stimulate angiogenesis through a cGMP-dependent pathway. NO is synthesized in endothelial cells by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), and eNOS in turn is activated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS stimulated by VEGF signaling (18Ignarro L.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 595Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence that NO is an essential mediator of VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis (19Milkiewicz M. Hudlicka O. Brown M.D. Silgram H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Yu J. deMuinck E.D. Zhuang Z. Drinane M. Kauser K. Rubanyi G.M.

We found that NO-stimulated cGMP signaling in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells is potently inhibited by picomolar concentrations of TSP1, its type 1 repeats, and CD36 antibodies (17Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) In endothelial cells, TSP1 blocked VEGF-stimulated cGMP synthesis. Although engaging CD36 is sufficient to inhibit NO signaling as well as VEGF-induced cGMP formation, we subsequently found that CD36 is not necessary for the same activity of intact TSP1 (21Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rather, we found that the TSP1 receptor CD47 is necessary and sufficient for the anti-angiogenic signal elicited by picomolar concentrations of TSP1. However, a weaker inhibitory activity of TSP1, observed at 1–10 nm, was deficient in CD36 null vascular cells (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, synthetic derivatives of CD36-binding peptides, similar to those currently in phase II clinical trials as angiogenesis inhibitors (23Haviv F. Bradley M.F. Kalvin D.M. Schneider A.J.

Verweij J. de Vries E.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 5188-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), required CD36 for their ability to potently inhibit NO signaling. It is important, therefore, to identify the molecular mechanism by which TSP1, these TSP1 mimetics, and CD36 influence NO signaling in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. CD36 also has fatty acid translocase activity (for review, see Ref. 25Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Myristic acid was recently shown in a CD36- and AMP kinase-dependent manner to activate eNOS (26Zhu W. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29543-29550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to ask whether TSP1 and its CD36 binding sequences might modulate NO signaling through antagonizing fatty acid uptake via CD36 and thereby inhibit endogenous NO synthesis. We report here that TSP1 inhibits both signaling and functional responses of endothelial cells elicited by myristate. Although myristate uptake into some cells may not require CD36 and the activity of myristate to activate eNOS was inferred on this basis to be independent of uptake (26Zhu W. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29543-29550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we now show that TSP1 peptide mimetics are potent inhibitors of myristate uptake into endothelial cells. Consistent with its known effect on eNOS activity (26Zhu W. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29543-29550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), myristate treatment of endothelial cells elicits similar functional and biochemical responses as exposure to an NO donor, and these responses are effectively blocked by TSP1 peptide mimetics and other CD36 ligands that inhibit its translocase activity. We further show that membrane targeting of the known CD36 signaling target Fyn is stimulated by myristate and inhibited by antagonist ligands. Cells and Reagents—HUVEC and HAVSMC (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in either endothelial cell growth medium (EGM, Cambrex) with 2% FCS or vascular smooth muscle growth medium (SMGM, Cambrex) with 2% FCS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were utilized at passages 4–8. CD47 null VSMC were prepared from aortic segments from knock out mice and grown in vascular smooth muscle growth medium as described (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were used between passages 2 through 8. TSP1 was prepared from human platelets obtained from the Blood Bank of the Clinical Center of the NIH as previously described (27Roberts D.D. Cashel J. Guo N. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 217-222Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The recombinant fragment of the type I repeat domain of TPS1 (3TSR) was graciously provide by Dr. Jack Lawler (Harvard University). TSP1-derived peptides 488VTAGGGVQKRSRL500 (p906) and 434GDGVITRIR442 (where I (Ile) is the d isomer; p907) were synthesized by Peptides International (Louisville, KY). The underlined residues indicate modifications from the natural TSP1 sequence. Additional CD36 (488VTCGGGVQKRSRL900, p245)- and CD47-binding peptides (1102FIRVVMYEGKK1112, p7N3) derived from TSP1 were available from previous studies. The CD36 antagonist antibody clone FA6–152 was obtained from Immunotech (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The CD36 agonist antibody clone SMΦ was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (FAF BSA), myristic acid, and oleic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. [3H]Myristic acid was also obtained from Sigma. Type I bovine dermal collagen was obtained from Inamed Biomaterials (Santa Barbara, CA). Human vitronectin was obtained from Sigma. Fibronectin was purified from human plasma (28Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4492-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 33-kDa recombinant fragment containing the α5β1 integrin binding site of fibronectin (FN-33) was provided by Dr. Tikva Vogel (29Vogel T. Werber M.M. Guy R. Levanon A. Nimrod A. Legrand C. Gorecki M. Eldor A. Panet A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). cGMP measurement was performed with an immunoassay kit obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The CGK inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs was obtained from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). A CD36 morpholino phosphorodiamidate oligonucleotide targeting the human protein and having the sequence GCCCACAGTTCCGGTCAAGCCCAT was purchased from Gene Tools (Philmoth, OR) along with a 5-base mismatched control morpholino (GCgCAgAGGTTCCGcTCACAcCCgAT). Immunoprecipitation of CD36—HUVEC and HAVSMC were cultured in standard growth medium on 10-cm culture plates to a density of 90% surface saturation and harvested with EDTA. Cell pellets were washed 3× with cold Dulbecco's PBS, and cells were counted. Equal cell numbers were incubated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) (1 mg/100 μl molecular grade water) for 30 min at room temperature and washed again 3× in cold Dulbecco's PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated for 20 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with protein G ferrous beads (Dynabeads, Dynal Biotech, Olso, Norway) and a monoclonal CD36 antibody, clone FA6–152 (Immunotech, Beckman Coulter), overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer 3× and then boiled in sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Protein levels of samples were then determined by MicroBCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were loaded and electrophoresed in 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with PBS and 3% BSA for 1 h, incubated with streptavidin (1:20,000) (Sigma) for 1 h, and then developed with Visualizer Spray & Glow (Upstate, lake Placid, NY). CD36 Knockdown Experiments—HUVEC were treated as per the manufacturer's recommendations in growth medium with the indicated concentrations of CD36 antisense or mismatched control morpholino for 48 h before analysis. Sulfosuccinimidyl Oleate (SSO) Synthesis—SSO was synthesized as described (30Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.25 mmol each of oleic acid and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 0.275 mmol of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide were reacted in 0.5 ml anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide overnight at room temperature. The dicyclohexylurea was crystallized out, and the solution was filtered and chilled. The product was then precipitated out of solution by the addition of cold ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum over phosphorous pentoxide. Working solutions of SSO were prepared immediately before each use. Cell Adhesion—Cell adhesion was carried out in 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark). After precoating wells with type I collagen (3 μg/ml), vitronectin (1 or 2 μg/ml), fibronectin (3 μg/ml), or FN-33 (1.5 or 3 μg/ml), HUVEC, HAVSMC, or CD47 null VSMC were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in EBM or SM-BM containing 0.1% FAF BSA and treatment agents and incubated in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Wells were washed with PBS, and the cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed, and stained with 1% crystal violet for 20 min. Excess stain was rinsed away, the cells were extracted with 10% acetic acid, and the plates were read at 570 nm. Intracellular cGMP Measurement—HUVEC or HAVSMC were plated in 96-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in EGM or smooth muscle cell growth medium plus 2% FCS. After a 24-h incubation, cells were weaned to EBM or SM-BM plus 1% FCS and incubated an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated in EBM or smooth muscle cell growth medium plus 0.1% FAF BSA with myristic acid at the indicated concentrations. After a 5-min incubation, cells were lysed, and intracellular cGMP was determined by immunoassay enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. [3H]Myristic Acid Uptake—The [3H]myristic acid uptake assays were performed using 80–90% confluent HUVEC cells (5 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well culture plates (Nunc, Denmark). Trace amounts of [3H]myristic acid (5 μCi/ml, 0.9 μm) mixed with 9.1 μm nonradioactive myristic acid were dissolved in a FAF BSA solution at a myristic acid/BSA molar ratio of 1:2. Cells were incubated in medium with treatment agents for the indicated time intervals at 37 °C. The uptake was stopped by removal of the solution followed by the addition of chilled 0.9% NaCl with 0.5% BSA. The stop solution was discharged, and the cells were washed again with stop solution. Cells were lysed by adding 0.2 m NaOH (200 μl/well) and incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. On completion of solubilization, 0.2 m HCl in 1.5 m Tris-HCl (200 μl) was added to each well. Radioactivity was determined in 10 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) using a 1900CA liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Detection of Fyn Translocation—HUVEC were plated on 100-mm plates in 2% FCS EGM and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were weaned over 24 h to EBM containing 1% FCS. After weaning, cells were pretreated in EBM containing 0.1% FAF BSA with and without peptide p907 (10 μm) for 15 min, then incubated for 1 h in the presence of myristate (10 μm). After treatment cells were rinsed, scraped in ice-cold STE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)), and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended into 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Na3VO4, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture tablet) and homogenized with 30 strokes in a 1.5-ml Dounce homogenizer. To ensure a complete cell lysis, cells were freeze-thawed twice at –80 °C. The homogenate volume was adjusted to a final concentration of 250 mm sucrose and 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g. The S100 fraction was collected into 4× SDS sample buffer, and P100 was collected into 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-Fyn Ab (BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. 610163) or eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 4 °C overnight and followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the bound antibodies were detected by ECL (Pierce). The membrane was then reprobed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma) for loading control. Detection of Src Family Kinase Phosphorylation—HUVEC were starved overnight in EBM containing 1% FCS, rinsed, and treated with the indicated reagents in EBM with 0.1% FAF BSA. Cells were treated with p907 (10 μm) for 15 min before the addition of VEGF or myristate. VEGF was added at 20 ng/ml for 5 min and myristate (10 μm) for 15 min. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and collected in SDS sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-Src-Tyr416 phosphorylated Ab (Cell Signaling) or anti-Src Ab (Cell Signaling). Membranes were reprobed with anti-actin antibody for loading control. Statistics—All assays were repeated at least in triplicate and are presented as the mean ± S.D. with significance being determined by Student's t test for a p > 0.05. Inhibition of Myristic Acid Uptake by TSP1, CD36-binding Peptides, and SSO—To assess the ability of TSP1 to modulate the fatty acid translocase activity of CD36, HUVEC at ∼80% confluence were transferred into serum-free medium and treated with [3H]myristic acid (10 μm) precomplexed with 0.1% FAF BSA. Myristic acid uptake under these conditions was time-dependent, and 5 min was used for subsequent experiments (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of HUVEC with exogenous TSP1 before incubating for 5 min with [3H]myristic acid at 37 °C dose dependently inhibited up to 60% of myristic acid uptake (Fig. 1B). Recombinant type 1 repeats of TSP1 (3TSR) were less effective, reaching significance only at 483 nm, whereas the CD47 binding C-terminal domain of TSP1 did not significantly inhibit myristic acid uptake (Fig. 1B). This inhibitory activity was specific for TSP1 in that equimolar concentrations of laminin-1 and vitronectin were inactive. Myristate uptake into human aortic VSMC was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TSP1 (Fig. 1C). Myristate uptake in HUVEC was not significantly inhibited by a reported CD36-binding peptide from the third type 1 repeat of TSP1 (p245, VTCGGGVQKRSRL) or a derivative of the same peptide in which the native Cys was substituted with Ala to prevent dimerization (p906, VTAGGGVQKRSRL, Fig. 1D). However, uptake of myristic acid was strongly inhibited in the presence of ≥0.l μm CD36-binding peptide GDGVITRIR derived from the second type 1 repeat of TSP1 by epimerization of Ile438 to the d isomer (11Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Pearce S.F. Schneider A.J. Silverstein R.L. Henkin J. Bouck N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (p907, Fig. 1D). As a further control, a CD47-binding peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of TSP1 also failed to inhibit myristate uptake (Fig. 1E). To further examine the role of CD36 in myristate uptake into HUVEC, we tested the widely used antagonist of CD36 fatty acid translocase activity SSO (30Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSO dose-dependently inhibited up to 80% of [3H]myristic acid uptake in HUVEC, but its IC50 was ∼100-fold higher than for the TSP1-based CD36 ligand p907 (Fig. 1F). We confirmed CD36 expression in both vascular cell types by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Because expression was substantially higher in HAVSMC than in HUVEC, we used the former cells to confirm the role of CD36 in myristate uptake by knocking down CD36 expression using a translation blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotide. Western blotting confirmed efficient suppression of CD36 protein expression at 10 μm morpholino (Fig. 2B), and this concentration decreased myristate uptake by ∼50% (Fig. 2C). Activity of the antisense morpholino was specific in that a 5-base mismatched morpholino did not inhibit myristate uptake. The incomplete inhibition of myristate uptake by CD36 knock down is consistent with previous evidence for both CD36-dependent and CD36-independent uptake of free fatty acids into cells (32Febbraio M.

Myristic Acid Uptake Is Blocked by CD36 “Agonist” but Not by “Antagonist” Antibodies—The ability of different CD36 antibodies to mimic or block the anti-angiogenic activities of TSP1 and its derived peptides was presented as evidence that CD36 mediated this activity of TSP1 (10Dawson D.W.

Here we use selective buffers of nucleoplasmic or cytoplasmic Ca2+ to determine that cell proliferation depends upon Ca2+ signals within the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm. Nuclear Ca2+ signals stimulate cell growth rather than inhibit apoptosis and specifically permit cells to advance through early prophase. Selective buffering of nuclear but not cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals also impairs growth of tumors in vivo. These findings reveal a major physiological and potential pathophysiological role for nucleoplasmic Ca2+ signals and suggest that this information can be used to design novel therapeutic strategies to regulate conditions of abnormal cell growth.

Materials, Reagents, and Cell Lines—SKHep1, HepG2, and HEK-293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were used for all experiments. The cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2:95% O2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, all from Invitrogen. The cells were grown on glass coverslips overnight in the absence of serum before infection with each parvalbumin (PV) 2The abbreviations used are: PV, parvalbumin; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; NES, nuclear export sequence; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. construct. Generation of Parvalbumin Constructs and Adenoviral Infection—Constructs encoding red fluorescence protein (DsRed) from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and targeted PV proteins (PV-NLS, PV-NES, and PV-NLS-CD) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pShuttle-CMV (kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins) by restriction digestion with XhoI and XbaI to generate pShuttle-CMV-PVNLS-DSR, pShuttle-CMV-PVNES-DSR, and pShuttle-CMV-PVNLS-CD-DSR. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated by transformation of pShuttle-CMV-PV-NLS-DSR into AdEasier-1 cells, a derivative of BJ5183 bacteria already containing the adenovirus backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Positive recombinant adenoviruses (pAd-PV-NLS-DSR, etc.) were screened for resistance to kanamycin (Invitrogen) and restriction enzyme analysis using the PacI enzyme. Parvalbumin adenoviruses were amplified using HEK-293 cells and then purified (10Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M.

Measurement of BrdUrd Incorporation—Cell proliferation was measured by BrdUrd incorporation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SKHep1 cells infected with parvalbumin constructs or HepG2 cells stably transduced with inducible parvalbumin constructs were plated 48 h later in 96-well culture plates (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and treated for 2 h with BrdUrd labeling solution. The cells were then fixed, and anti-BrdUrd antibody was added. A colorimetric substrate was used, and BrdUrd incorporation was measured with a multiplate reader. Cell Counting Assay—SKHep1 cells (104 cells/ml) were plated on 35-mm dishes without serum and infected with targeted PV constructs. The cells were counted with trypan blue (Invitrogen) 24, 48, and 72 h after infection. Apoptosis Assay—Two methods were used for measuring apoptosis. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was assayed using a caspase-3 activity kit with colorimetric detection (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, the cells were loaded with 0.2 μg/ml of the nuclear stain Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and then chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were assessed by confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was induced using 500 nm staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a positive control. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells infected with targeted PV constructs were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed overnight with ice-cold 70% EtOH at 4 °C, and then washed in staining buffer (Dulbecco's PBS with 2% fetal calf serum and 0.01% NaN3). After centrifugation the cells were supplemented with RNase (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at room temperature in the dark. DNA content was determined using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using Flowjo software version 5.5. Immunoblotting—Standard methods were used for immunoblots (8Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed three times with PBS and solubilized in 80 μl of Nonidet P-40 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, and 30 μg of protein was separated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min and then incubated with primary antibody (1:500). Commercially available antibodies for cyclin D1 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), cyclin E, B1, phospho-cdk1 and -cdk1 (BD Biosciences), p15, p21, p27, cdK4, phospho-cdc25c, and total cdc25c (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and p-ERK, total ERK, ERK-5, total AKT, p-AKT, total CREB, and p-CREB (Cell Signaling) were used. Incubations were carried out overnight. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus; Amersham Biosciences). The films were scanned with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Mitotic Index Measurements and Immunofluorescence—The cells were labeled for phospho-histone-3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Chicago, IL) and γ-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) by immunofluorescence and then examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (8Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mitotic figures were scored for cells in each phase of mitosis according to the phospho-histone-3 distribution and DNA condensation (18Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4017-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Establishment of Inducible Tet-On HepG2 Cell Line—The inducible Tet-On HepG2 cell line system was established by using the PV-NLS and PV-NES constructs previously reported (20Gao W. Lam W. Zhong S. Kaczmarek C. Baker D.C. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Lam W. Park S.Y. Leung C.H. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), along with the Tet-On Gene expression system (Invitrogen). Animal Studies—Male 4-week-old NCR nude mice (average body weight, 20 g) were obtained from Taconic Farms (Hudson, NY) and acclimated to laboratory conditions 1 week before tumor implantation. Nude mice were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee procedures and guidelines. HepG2 tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 HepG2 cells/site in each mouse (pcDNA5-TO-PV-NLS-DsRed, PV-NES-DsRed or DsRed). To express PV constructs, 100 μg/ml of doxycycline was added to the drinking water. Tumor measurement began when the tumor dimension reached 5 × 4 mm3 (∼15 days after injection of the cells). HepG2 tumors were measured daily using a caliper, and the body weights of the mice were monitored as well. Tumor volume V was estimated by the formula V = (length) × (width)2/2 (20Gao W. Lam W. Zhong S. Kaczmarek C. Baker D.C. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Lam W. Park S.Y. Leung C.H. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Measurements—Nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ were monitored in SKHep1 cells using time lapse confocal microscopy (8Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). SKHep1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips, incubated for 30 min in the presence of 6 μm Fluo-4/AM to monitor nuclear or cytosolic Ca2+, and then transferred to a perfusion chamber on the stage of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). The cells were maintained in a HEPES-buffered solution during experiments and observed using a 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens. The 488-nm line of a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the dye, and emission signals between 505 and 550 nm were collected. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm vasopressin (Sigma), and the images were acquired at a rate of 2–10 frames/s. Neither autofluorescence nor background signals were detectable at the machine settings used. Statistical Analysis—Changes in proliferation were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Significance of changes in treatment groups relative to controls were determined by t test. Significance of changes in the size of individual tumors over time was determined by two-way analysis of variance. The data are represented as the means ± S.E. Selective Buffering of Nuclear or Cytoplasmic Ca2+—The relative role of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in specific cell functions can be determined by selectively attenuating Ca2+ increases in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. The first studies in this area used microinjection of dextran-linked Ca2+ buffers into either the nucleus or cytoplasm (9Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 22Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), but a more efficient approach was subsequently developed using targeted expression of Ca2+ buffering proteins such as PV or calretinin in these compartments (10Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M. J. Biol.

Calcium Binding Proteins. 2006; 1: 30-35Google Scholar). This approach used constructs encoding PV targeted to the nucleus with a nuclear localization sequence (PV-NLS) or to the cytoplasm with a nuclear export sequence (PV-NES). To examine the effects of targeted Ca2+ buffering in entire cell populations, we delivered these constructs to SKHep1 cells using an adenovirus vector to achieve high transfection efficiencies. The PV constructs were fused to DsRed to monitor expression and subcellular localization, which demonstrated the efficacy of the adenoviral vector (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previously published data (10Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M. J. Biol.

Calcium Binding Proteins. 2006; 1: 30-35Google Scholar) time lapse confocal imaging confirmed that expression of PV-NLS and PV-NES was able to locally attenuate by >50% nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, respectively, in response to stimulation with vasopressin (Fig. 1B). Nuclear Ca2+ Controls Cell Proliferation—To determine the involvement of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ in cell proliferation, SKHep1 cells were synchronized in G0 and then infected with the targeted PV constructs. The cells were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum. BrdUrd uptake was reduced by 63 ± 17% in cells expressing PV-NLS, compared with infected and uninfected cells (p < 0.001), whereas no reduction in BrdUrd uptake was seen in cells expressing PV-NES or in adenoviral infection controls (Fig. 2A). BrdUrd uptake was reduced to an intermediate degree (28 ± 17%; p < 0.001) in cells infected with a mutant PV-NLS in which one of two Ca2+-binding sites was disrupted (Fig. 2A). This PV-NLS-CD mutant is known to have an intermediate effect on inhibition of nuclear Ca2+ signals, relative to PV-NLS (10Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27517-27527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation in response to serum stimulation in PV-NLS- and PV-NES-expressing cells was also measured directly by cell counting. Like BrdUrd uptake, cell proliferation was reduced by buffering nuclear but not cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the apparent decrease in cell proliferation was due in part to an increase in cell death, apoptosis was monitored using caspase-3 activation (24Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A) as well as Hoechst labeling of the nucleus (19Yoon H.S. Ghaleb A.M. Nandan M.O. Hisamuddin I.M. Dalton W.B. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4017-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). No increase in apoptosis was observed in any infected group (Fig. 3B). Together, these findings demonstrate that cell proliferation is dependent upon increases in Ca2+ that occur in the nucleus but not the cytoplasm.FIGURE 3Buffering nuclear or cytoplasmic Ca2+ does not induce apoptosis. A, expression of the indicated PV constructs does not induce apoptosis, as measured by caspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 activity was measured in control and infected SKHep1 cells. The cells were treated with staurosporine (ST; 500 nm) as a positive control. *, p < 0.001 relative to every other group; n = 4 for all groups. B, SKHep1 cells were loaded with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (0.2 μg/ml), and then chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were assessed by confocal microscopy. Hoechst nuclear labeling confirms that apoptosis is not induced by buffering nuclear Ca2+ (n = 4 for each condition). Staurosporine (500 nm) was used as a positive control. *, p < 0.001 relative to every other group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Buffering Nuclear Ca2+ Alters Cell Cycle Kinetics—We used flow cytometry analysis to understand which phases of the cell cycle are regulated by nuclear Ca2+. The cells were synchronized in G0, then released into the cell cycle by addition of serum, infected with adenoviral PV constructs, and then studied 48 h later. In populations expressing PV-NLS, there was a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the fraction of cells in G1 phase (58 ± 2%), but an increase in the fraction of cells in the S (14 ± 1%) and G2/M (27 ± 1%) phases relative to uninfected controls (82 ± 0.3%, 5 ± 0.1%, and 12 ± 0.4% in the G1,S,and G2/M phases, respectively). No such change was observed in cells expressing PV-NES or in infected controls (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that buffering nuclear Ca2+ specifically blocks either the G2/M transition or mitosis (25Santella L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Whitaker M. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Progression through the cell cycle is regulated at various checkpoints by activation of specific complexes of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (27Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 28Jackman M. Lindon C. Nigg E.A. Pines J. Nat.Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These checkpoint proteins ensure that events comprising each phase of the cell cycle have completed before the next phase is initiated (27Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of PV-NLS was specifically affecting the G2/M transition, we examined expression of the G2/M checkpoint proteins cyclin B1 and cdk1. The expression of total cyclin B1 and cdk1 were unchanged, but phosphorylation of cdk1 was decreased (Fig. 4B). Because dephosphorylation activates rather than inhibits cdk1, these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of PV-NLS occur after rather than at the G2/M transition. To confirm that PV-NLS expression does not inhibit progression through earlier phases of the cell cycle, we investigated expression of the G1/S and S/G2 checkpoint proteins cyclins D1/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2, respectively. Buffering nuclear Ca2+ did not alter expression of any of these checkpoint proteins (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly, buffering nuclear Ca2+ was associated with no change in the expression of the cyclin D1/cdk4 inhibitor p15 and decreased expression of the cyclin E/cdk2 inhibitor p27 and the cyclin B1/cdk1 inhibitor p21 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, both expression and phosphorylation of the cdk1 phosphatase cdc25c was decreased in cells expressing PV-NLS (Fig. 4C), even though the net effect in these cells was dephosphorylation of cdk1 (Fig. 4B), which perhaps reflects that multiple factors contribute to the regulation of cdk1 activity (29Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 30Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). As an additional way to examine the effects of nuclear Ca2+ on cell proliferation, the effect of PV-NLS on the growth-related kinases ERK1/2, ERK5, and AKT and the transcription factor CREB were examined. Buffering cytoplasmic rather than nuclear Ca2+ decreased the level of p-ERK1/2, and PV-NLS had no effect on total expression of ERK1/2, ERK5, or AKT (Fig. 4D). However, expression of PV-NLS decreased p-CREB (Fig. 4D), consistent with previous reports that this transcription factor is activated by nuclear rather than cytosolic Ca2+ (9Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that nuclear Ca2+ acts during rather than before mitosis to regulate cell proliferation. Nuclear Ca2+ Controls Progression through Mitosis—To investigate the effects of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ on mitosis, cells were labeled with the mitotic marker phosphohistone-3 and the centrosome marker γ-tubulin 48 h after infection with the various PV constructs. Labeled cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5A) to determine the fraction of cells in mitosis. The mitotic index was doubled in cells in which nuclear Ca2+ was buffered (p < 0.001) and was no different from controls in cells in which cytoplasmic Ca2+ was buffered (Fig. 5B). Examination of the phospho-histone-3 pattern in cells expressing PV-NLS furthermore suggested that these cells were in early prophase, and γ-tubulin staining similarly demonstrated that only a single centrosome was present in these cells (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the phospho-histone-3 staining pattern in all mitotic cells within each treatment group confirmed that expression of PV-NLS induced a block in early prophase (Fig. 5D). Specifically, 27 ± 2% of cells expressing PV-NLS were in prophase, and none were in metaphase or anaphase, whereas in control cells 12 ± 1% were in prophase, 2 ± 0.3% were in metaphase, and 3 ± 0.3% were in anaphase (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that nuclear Ca2+ is necessary specifically for centrosome separation and progression through early prophase. Nuclear Ca2+ Is Needed for Tumor Growth in Vivo—To understand the potential significance of these findings in vivo, we examined the effects of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals on the growth of tumors implanted into nude mice. The HepG2 tumor cell line was stably transfected with PV-NLS-DsRed, PV-NES-DsRed, or DsRed alone, each under the control of a doxycycline-sensitive promoter (Fig. 6A). BrdUrd uptake in these cells was reduced by over 60% (p < 0.001) by expression of PV in the nucleus but not the cytosol (Fig. 6B), similar to what was observed in SkHep1 cells (Fig. 2A). These HepG2 cells were implanted into the subcutaneous space, and then tumor growth was measured over a two-week period with or without administration of doxycycline in the drinking water (20Gao W. Lam W. Zhong S. Kaczmarek C. Baker D.C. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Lam W. Park S.Y. Leung C.H. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of tumors removed 2 weeks after implantation confirmed expression of the targeted PV constructs in doxycycline-treated animals and not in untreated controls (Fig. 6C). Tumor growth was significantly impaired by expression of PV-NLS-DsRed (p < 0.001) but not by expression of PV-NES-DsRed or DsRed alone (Fig. 7). Direct examination of resected tumors (not shown) suggested an even greater inhibition of tumor growth by PV-NLS-DsRed than was appreciated by in vivo measurements, perhaps because caliper measurements include overlying skin and associated tissues as well. These findings confirm the role of nuclear rather than cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in the regulation of cell growth.FIGURE 7Nuclear Ca2+ regulates cell growth in vivo. Nuclear but not cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffers retard tumor growth. HepG2 tumor cells expressing PV-NES-DsRed, PV-NLS-DsRed, or DsRed under the control of a doxycycline-sensitive promoter were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Serial measurements of tumor volume in the presence or absence of doxycycline (100 μg/ml, added to the drinking water) were obtained, starting when tumor volume reached 5 × 4 mm3. The data represent the means ± S.E. of tumor volume over time (n = 5–15 mice in each group), normalized with respect to the initial volume. *, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well appreciated that increases in Ca2+ occur in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Initial evidence suggested that nucleoplasmic Ca2+ passively follows changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (31Lipp P. Thomas D. Berridge M.J.

The significance of this machinery within the nucleus has long been a question. Both growth factors (12Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat.

Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), plus phosphatases such as calcineurin that are important for transcription (41Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relative importance of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ for regulating cell growth has been hypothesized but not proven from these previous studies. The current work directly demonstrates that nuclear but not cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates cell proliferation and that this occurs in multiple cell lines and in vivo as well as in vitro. The current work raises several new issues of fundamental importance. First, our findings suggest a paradigm in which InsP3 formation in the cytoplasm regulates Ca2+-mediated events that are cell type-specific, such as secretion or contraction, whereas InsP3 formation in the nucleus instead regulates the cell cycle. This in turn suggests that regulatory pathways would exist to bypass cytoplasmic InsP3 formation to stimulate nuclear InsP3 formation directly. Therefore, it will be important to understand whether and how InsP3 formation within the nucleus occurs. Second, our findings demonstrate that nucleoplasmic Ca2+ regulates cell cycle progression even in tumor cells. One benefit of these findings is that this effect could be used to directly inhibit the growth of tumors, as was demonstrated here. However, buffering nuclear Ca2+ induces a mitotic block but does not induce apoptosis, so this strategy would not be expected to decrease the overall tumor burden. Therefore an alternative strategy might be to buffer nuclear Ca2+ in tumor cells over a specific time interval to induce and then release the mitotic block in a synchronized fashion. This in turn could synchronize the tumor cells within the cell cycle, rendering them more uniformly susceptible to existing chemotherapeutic agents that destroy only cells at specific phases of the cell cycle (42Gatti L. Zunino F. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 111: 127-148PubMed Google Scholar). As mechanisms for the regulation of nuclear Ca2+ are identified, this may lead to development of new strategies to regulate abnormal growth of cells."

We propose that Golgi fragmentation and reconstitution during cell cycle differentially regulate Numb signaling through changes in ACBD3 subcellular distribution and represent a mechanism for coupling cell-fate specification and cell-cycle progression. Cell-fate determination is often precisely coordinated with cell-cycle progression. This is most apparent during an intrinsically asymmetric cell division, which produces two daughter cells that are already different at birth. In Drosophila melanogaster, for example, sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells divide asymmetrically to produce a IIA and a IIB cell (Gho et al., 1999Gho M. Bellaiche Y. Schweisguth F. Revisiting the Drosophila microchaete lineage: a novel intrinsically asymmetric cell division generates a glial cell.Development. 1999; 126: 3573-3584PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila Numb (d-Numb), a cytosolic signaling protein, distributes symmetrically during interphase but becomes localized to only one-half of the cell membrane after the SOP cell enters mitosis and, consequently, is segregated primarily into the IIB cell (Rhyu et al., 1994Rhyu M.S.

Asymmetric distribution of numb protein during division of the sensory organ precursor cell confers distinct fates to daughter cells.Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This asymmetric d-Numb distribution is essential for distinguishing the two daughter cells; d-Numb loss causes both daughter cells to become IIA, whereas its symmetric inheritance yields two IIB cells. Interestingly, d-Numb loses its ability to specify cell fates shortly after mitosis; although the IIA fate requires its initial absence, newly synthesized d-Numb later accumulates in IIA cells, which then segregate the protein asymmetrically to produce a hair and a socket cell. d-Numb is similarly used by a variety of neural and nonneural precursor cells to generate cellular diversity during development (reviewed in Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004Betschinger J.

The importance of Numb-mediated asymmetric cell division in mammalian development is most clearly demonstrated in the embryonic nervous system, where such divisions are used by progenitor cells to balance the competing needs of self-renewal and neuron production during the extended period of neurogenesis. Direct imaging experiments show that mammalian neural progenitor cells behave like stem cells and can divide asymmetrically to generate a daughter progenitor cell (self-renewal) and a neuron (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A.

Differential expression of mammalian Numb, Numblike and Notch1 suggests distinct roles during mouse cortical neurogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss-of-function studies using mice show that m-numb and Numbl are redundant during neurogenesis, but inactivation of both genes causes progenitor cells to deplete prematurely throughout the embryonic nervous system due to an initial overproduction of neurons at the expense of progenitor cells (Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H.

Progenitor cell maintenance requires numb and numblike during mouse neurogenesis.Nature. 2002; 419: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H. Zou K. Krauss S. Zhong W. Continuing role for mouse Numb and Numbl in maintaining progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings point to a role for mammalian Numb proteins in enabling neural progenitor cells to balance self-renewal and neuron production by segregating asymmetrically to the progenitor daughter cells to specify their fates. However, m-Numb and Numbl proteins quickly appear in the neuronal daughter cells (Zhong et al., 1997Zhong W. Jiang M.-M. Weinmaster G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Differential expression of mammalian Numb, Numblike and Notch1 suggests distinct roles during mouse cortical neurogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their presence is essential for neuronal differentiation (Huang et al., 2005Huang E.J. Li H. Tang A.A. Wiggins A.K. Neve R.L. Zhong W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Targeted deletion of numb and numblike in sensory neurons reveals their essential functions in axon arborization.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 138-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H.

Thus, Numb signaling seems to play two contradictory roles: namely, it promotes progenitor over neuronal fates but is also required for neuronal differentiation. In other words, the ability of mammalian Numb homologs to specify cell fates also appears to be limited to during and/or shortly after mitosis. A major contributor to this coordinated process of cell-fate determination and cell-cycle progression is the cellular machinery that asymmetrically localizes Numb proteins only during mitosis (reviewed in Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004Betschinger J. Knoblich J.A. Dare to be different: asymmetric cell division in Drosophila, C. elegans and vertebrates.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R674-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Prokopendo and Chia, 2005Prokopendo S.N. Chia W. When timing is everything: role of cell cycle regulation in asymmetric division.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 423-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Asymmetric localization, however, is not necessary for Numb to specify cell fates; Numb proteins that distribute uniformly in the cytosol are fully functional, although they force the same fates upon the two daughter cells (Knoblich et al., 1997Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. The N-terminus of the Drosophila Numb protein directs membrane association and actin-dependent asymmetric localization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 13005-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Zhong et al., 1997Zhong W. Jiang M.-M. Weinmaster G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Differential expression of mammalian Numb, Numblike and Notch1 suggests distinct roles during mouse cortical neurogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the asymmetric localization machinery can explain how the two daughter cells become different but not why Numb proteins lose the ability to specify fates after division, raising the possibility that Numb signaling itself is also regulated during cell cycle. The components of Numb signaling, however, remain largely unknown, particularly in mammals. Drosophila studies show that Numb acts by inhibiting the transmembrane receptor Notch (Guo et al., 1996Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Control of daughter cell fates during asymmetric division: interaction of Numb and Notch.Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, Spana and Doe, 1996Spana E.P. Doe C.Q. Numb antagonizes Notch signaling to specify sibling neuron cell fates.Neuron. 1996; 17: 21-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which mediates cell-cell communication in many contexts during metazoan development (reviewed in Artavanis-Tsakonas, 1999Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development.Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4672) Google Scholar). Because Numb also specifies many unrelated fates, it has been postulated that asymmetric Numb presence simply enables the daughter cells to choose differently between two fate options by biasing Notch-mediated cell-cell communication (reviewed in Zhong, 2003Zhong W. Diversifying neural cells through order of birth and asymmetry of division.Neuron. 2003; 37: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whether and how this antagonistic Numb-Notch relationship is conserved in mammals, however, remain unclear (Petersen et al., 2006Petersen P.H. Tang H. Zou K. Zhong W. The enigma of the Numb-Notch relationship during mammalian embryogenesis.Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 28: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cell-cycle progression is accompanied by dramatic changes in the morphology of the Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004Altan-Bonnet N. Sougrat R. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Molecular basis for Golgi maintenance and biogenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Colanzi et al., 2003Colanzi A.

Warren G. Golgi architecture and inheritance.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). During interphase, mammalian Golgi membranes are organized into interconnected stacks of flattened cisternae and confined to the region surrounding the centrioles. When cells enter mitosis, the pericentriolar Golgi stacks undergo extensive fragmentation, and the Golgi fragments are dispersed throughout the cytosol. In this study, we identify a novel mammalian Numb-binding protein, ACBD3, and show that it is an essential Numb partner in cell-fate specification. We also show that the process of Golgi fragmentation and reconstitution regulates the subcellular distribution of ACBD3 and likely represents a novel mechanism for differentially activating intracellular signaling at different phases of the cell cycle. To elucidate the Numb-signaling pathway, we used yeast two-hybrid screen to identify mouse proteins that physically interact with m-Numb and identified a clone (MERRY MAGPIE) encoding an evolutionarily conserved protein (Figure 1A). This protein contains a putative acyl-coenzyme A-binding domain and was later named ACBD3 by the genome project. It was also identified as GCP60 (Sohda et al., 2001Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. Identification and characterization of a novel Golgi protein, GCP60, that interacts with the integral membrane protein giantin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and PAP7 (Li et al., 2001Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z.X. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Identification, localization, and function in steroidogenesis of PAP7: a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor- and PKA (RIalpha)-associated protein.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) due to its ability to bind Giantin, a Golgi membrane protein, and a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, respectively. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 23 amino acids of m-Numb contained the ACDB3-binding (AB) domain; other m-Numb regions, including the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, were incapable of interacting with ACBD3 (Figures 1B and 1D). The AB domain is highly conserved between mouse and d-Numb proteins (Figure 1B), and ACBD3 could also bind to Numbl and d-Numb (Figure 1C). As expected, a fusion protein of Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and the C-terminal 366 amino acids of ACBD3 (ACBD3-C), but not the ACB domain (ACBD3-N), could copurify m-Numb from mouse brain extracts (Figure 1E). We also generated ACBD3 antibodies (Figure 2B) and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to examine whether ACBD3 and m-Numb interact in vivo. Indeed, in extracts from HeLa cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing m-Numb and a myristoylated form of ACBD3 (ACBD3Myr; see Figure 5A below), an m-Numb antibody, but not an unrelated CSN1 antibody (Yang et al., 2002Yang X. Menon S. Lykke-Andersen K. Tsuge T. Di X. Wang X. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Zhang H. Wei N.

Biol. 2002; 12: 667-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was able to coprecipitate both the endogenous ACBD3 and the exogenous ACBD3Myr (Figure 1F). Interestingly, whereas the N-terminal PTB domain (Figure 1B) is essential for Numb activity (Knoblich et al., 1997Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

USA. 1997; 94: 13005-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Yaich et al., 1998Yaich L. Ooi J. Park M. Borg J.P. Landry C. Bodmer R. Margolis B. Functional analysis of the Numb phosphotyrosine-binding domain using site-directed mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10381-10388Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the first 23 amino acids comprising the AB domain are not part of the PTB (Li et al., 1998Li S.C. Zwahlen C. Vincent S.J. McGlade C.J. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Structure of a Numb PTB domain-peptide complex suggests a basis for diverse binding specificity.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further deletion analysis revealed that neither the first 7 amino acids of the AB domain nor the last 16 could mediate binding to ACBD3 by themselves. Surprisingly, although removing all 23 amino acids rendered the rest of the m-Numb protein incapable of binding to ACBD3 in yeast two-hybrid assays, removing only part of the AB domain did not abolish binding (data not shown). To determine whether an intact AB domain is important for m-Numb to specify cell fates, we deleted amino acids 7–23 from m-Numb and expressed the resultant mutant protein (m-NumbΔ7–23) in the Drosophila SOP lineage, which depends on Numb activity to generate the external sensory (ES) organs on the notum (Rhyu et al., 1994Rhyu M.S.

Asymmetric distribution of numb protein during division of the sensory organ precursor cell confers distinct fates to daughter cells.Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type m-Numb or d-Numb in SOP cells, which forces the proteins to segregate into both daughter cells, causes balding of the notum (Figure 1H; Rhyu et al., 1994Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2899-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This phenotype is due to a transformation of the IIA daughter cell, which normally inherits little Numb, into a second IIB cell (Figure 7L). By contrast, m-NumbΔ7–23 overexpression, even from multiple copies of the transgene, caused no such defects, with only occasional bristle loss on the notum (Figure 1I). Similarly, whereas m-Numb can suppress the multisocket phenotype caused by d-numb double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that induces RNA interference (RNAi) in the SOP lineage (Tang et al., 2005Tang H. Rompani S.B. Atkins J.B. Zhou Y. Osterwalder T. Zhong W. Numb proteins specify asymmetric cell fates via an endocytosis- and proteasome-independent pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2899-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), m-NumbΔ7–23 was unable to do so (Figure 1J). The number of ES organs exhibiting the multisocket morphology, which is due to a transformation of the IIB cell into another IIA and of the hair cell into another socket in the absence of d-Numb (Figure 7L), was 30.2 ± 4.4 per notum in numbRNAi flies and 25.5 ± 5.4 per notum in those also expressing m-NumbΔ7–23 (n = 5 each). These findings show that the AB domain is essential for m-Numb to specify cell fates. We point out that m-NumbΔ7–23 also lacked the ability to associate with the cell membrane and to localize asymmetrically in neural precursor cells (data not shown). m-numb and Numbl double-mutant mice exhibit widespread defects in embryogenesis and die shortly after embryonic day (E) 9.5 (Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2006Petersen P.H. Tang H. Zou K. Zhong W. The enigma of the Numb-Notch relationship during mammalian embryogenesis.Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 28: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether ACBD3 loss causes similar phenotypes, we identified two lines of embryonic stem (ES) cells (XE462 and XC653) in which a copy of the ACBD3 gene was mutated due to a gene-trap insertion (Skarnes et al., 1995Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S.P. Capturing genes encoding membrane and secreted proteins important for mouse development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Only the XE462 cells yielded mice carrying the mutation, and we mapped the insertion site to near the middle of the last intron of ACBD3 (Figure 2A). As expected, the wild-type ACBD3 protein was absent in extracts from XE462 homozygous (−/−) embryos, as revealed by ACBD3 antibodies (Figure 2B). Because the gene encoding a β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) and Neomycin phosphotransferase fusion protein (βgeo) in the gene-trap vector contains a splicing acceptance site (Skarnes et al., 1995Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S.P. Capturing genes encoding membrane and secreted proteins important for mouse development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), the XE462 allele produced an ACBD3-βgeo fusion protein lacking the C-terminal 70 amino acids encoded by the last ACBD3 exon. The larger ACBD3-βgeo protein could be identified using an antibody against the N-terminal region of ACBD3 (Figure 2B, right) or a β-Gal antibody (Figure S2). XE462 heterozygous mice were viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. Matings between XE462 heterozygous mice did not yield homozygous mutants postnatally, indicating that ACBD3 is essential for embryogenesis (Figure 2E). At E8.5, XE462 homozygous embryos were a bit smaller in size but morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (Figure 2C). By E10.5, however, the mutant embryos became necrotic and were at various stages of being absorbed. E9.5 XE462 mutants were about one-half to two-thirds the size of the wild-type littermates (Figure 2D), and many were defective in axial turning and neural tube closure (Figure 2D, the embryo on the right). The phenotype exhibited by ACBD3 mutants was stronger than that seen in m-numb or Numbl single mutants (Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H. Zou K. Krauss S. Zhong W. Continuing role for mouse Numb and Numbl in maintaining progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Zhong et al., 2000Zhong W. Jiang M.-M. Schonemann M.D. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mouse numb is an essential gene involved in cortical neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6844-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and more similar to that exhibited by m-numb and Numbl double mutants. The ACBD3 phenotype, however, was more variable and in general less severe. Loss of both m-numb and Numbl causes severe thinning of the neuroepithelium due to premature progenitor cell depletion (Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H. Zou K. Hwang J.K. Jan Y.N. Zhong W. Progenitor cell maintenance requires numb and numblike during mouse neurogenesis.Nature. 2002; 419: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H. Zou K. Krauss S. Zhong W. Continuing role for mouse Numb and Numbl in maintaining progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To examine whether ACBD3 mutation causes similar defects, we analyzed E9.5 mutants that were morphologically similar to the wild-type (Figure 2D, the middle embryo). Indeed, sectioning revealed that the thickness of the neuroepithelium in most ACBD3 mutants (16/18) was less than half of that in their wild-type or heterozygous littermates throughout the developing nervous system (Figures S1 and 2G). Since the vast majority of cells in the wild-type neuroepithelium at E9.5 are progenitor cells, severe thinning of the neuroepithelium in ACBD3 mutants indicates dramatic reductions in progenitor cell numbers. We also analyzed ACBD3 mutants at E8.5, before the onset of neurogenesis. Although the E8.5 mutant neuroepithelium was a bit thinner than that in the wild-type, the mutant neuroepithelial cells expressed Hes5 (Figure 2C), a neural progenitor cell marker (Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H. Zou K. Krauss S. Zhong W. Continuing role for mouse Numb and Numbl in maintaining progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and were able to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Figure 2F; 30 min pulse). BrdU is taken up by proliferating cells during DNA synthesis (S phase). These findings show that neural progenitor cells in ACBD3 mutants are specified and initially capable of proliferation. Thus, the observed thinning of the E9.5 mutant neuroepithelium is likely caused by defects in progenitor cell maintenance. An antibody against cleaved Caspase-3 revealed no marked increases in apoptosis in the mutant neuroepithelium (Figure 2H, in green, between the dashed lines), and similar results were obtained using TUNEL staining (data not shown). On the other hand, BrdU labeling (30 min pulse) revealed that many E9.5 ACBD3 mutants (9/18) contained only a few scattered S phase cells in the neuroepithelium (Figure 2G, dashed lines) even though many such cells were present outside of the nervous system (Figure 2G, arrows). Mitotic cells were also fewer in numbers but could be observed in the mutant neuroepithelium using markers like phospho-Histone H3 (P-H3) and Ki-67 (data not shown). These findings suggest that the failure to maintain neural progenitor cells in ACBD3 mutants is not caused by cell death. It is unclear, however, whether the mutant cells are defective in cell-cycle progression or exit cell cycle to become neurons but fail to differentiate. Staining using β-Tubulin III did not reveal increases in neuron numbers in ACBD3 mutants, but neurons could be observed spanning the entire width of the mutant neuroepithelium in some regions (Figure 2H, boxed areas and arrowheads). Interestingly, E9.5 ACBD3 mutants exhibited dramatic increases in cell death in the trigeminal ganglia (Figure 2H, arrows), a region of the peripheral nervous system normally containing large numbers of neurons. m-numb and Numbl loss also cause neuronal death (Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H. Zou K. Hwang J.K. Jan Y.N. Zhong W. Progenitor cell maintenance requires numb and numblike during mouse neurogenesis.Nature. 2002; 419: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We emphasize that the XE462 allele, which produces a truncated ACBD3 protein (Figure 2B), is likely not a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mutation since heterozygous mice do not exhibit defects. It is also unlikely that the mutant ACBD3 protein causes phenotypes by preventing Numb from binding to other essential partners to indirectly affect Numb activity since reducing m-Numb expression by 90% does not affect mouse neurogenesis even in the absence of Numbl (Petersen et al., 2006Petersen P.H. Tang H. Zou K. Zhong W. The enigma of the Numb-Notch relationship during mammalian embryogenesis.Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 28: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both m-Numb and Numbl proteins were present in ACBD3 mutant embryos, and, conversely, their loss also did not affect the expression and subcellular distribution of ACBD3 (Figure S3). m-numb and Numbl are widely expressed during embryogenesis (Petersen et al., 2004Petersen P.H.

To determine if this is also true for ACBD3, we first examined β-Gal activity in XE462 heterozygous embryos, which would be expected to produce βgeo from the ACBD3 promoter.

In cycling cells the de novo pathway dominates, but in quiescent cells the salvage pathway becomes important. Two forms of active mammalian ribonucleotide reductases are known. Each form contains the catalytic R1 protein, but the two differ with respect to the second protein (R2 or p53R2). R2 is cell cycle-regulated, degraded during mitosis, and absent from quiescent cells. The recently discovered p53-inducible p53R2 was proposed to be linked to DNA repair processes. The protein is not cell cycle-regulated and can provide deoxynucleotides to quiescent mouse fibroblasts. Here we investigate the in situ activities of the R1-p53R2 complex and two other enzymes of the de novo pathway, dCMP deaminase and thymidylate synthase, in confluent quiescent serum-starved human fibroblasts in experiments with [5-(3)H]cytidine, [6-(3)H]deoxycytidine, and [C(3)H(3)]thymidine. These cells had increased their content of p53R2 2-fold and lacked R2. From isotope incorporation, we conclude that they have a complete de novo pathway for deoxynucleotide synthesis, including thymidylate synthesis. During quiescence, incorporation of deoxynucleotides into DNA was very low. Deoxynucleotides were instead degraded to deoxynucleosides and exported into the medium as deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine. The rate of export was surprisingly high, 25% of that in cycling cells. Total ribonucleotide reduction in quiescent cells amounted to only 2-3% of cycling cells. We suggest that in quiescent cells an important function of p53R2 is to provide deoxynucleotides for mitochondrial DNA replication."

BACH1, also known as BRIP1, was recently identified as the gene defective in the J complementation group of Fanconi anemia, FANCJ, (14Litman R. Peng M. Jin Z. Zhang F. Zhang J. Powell S. Andreassen P.R. Cantor S.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although the functions of XPD and its complexes are intensely studied and fairly well understood, much more has to be learned about BACH1/BRP1/FANCJ and its role in the Fanconi anemia pathway and in cancer susceptibility. As related helicases, BACH1 and DinG proteins could be potentially involved in similar aspects of nucleic acids metabolism. Thus, genetic, mechanistic, and structural studies of the quite tractable bacterial DinG protein could shed some light on the function of human BACH1. Recently, we purified the Escherichia coli DinG protein and carried out its biochemical characterization (7Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The DinG protein possesses DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities and, like its eukaryotic counterparts, unwinds DNA duplex with a 5′- → 3′-polarity. In doing so, DinG presumably acts as a monomer (7Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both deletion and overexpression of dinG gene result in a mild but measurable and reproducible effect on cell survival after UV irradiation (7Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated structural requirements for DinG helicase substrates. We found that DinG is capable of unwinding not only DNA·DNA duplexes but also DNA·RNA hybrids. It prefers branched substrates over 5′-tailed duplexes and can unwind structures that model intermediates of replication and homologous recombination. Based on our findings, we discuss possible biological roles of DinG. DNAs and Proteins—All oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared on an Applied Biosystems 380A synthesizer and purified by urea-denaturing PAGE. Synthesis, deprotection, isolation, and handling of 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides were identical to the procedures for unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides. All the synthetic oligonucleotides exploited in this work are listed in Table 1. The T1 oligonucleotide was obtained by ligation of 55T and chemically 5′-phosphorylated 45T in the presence of the Splint T oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides to be joined and the splint 20-mer were annealed in T4 DNA ligase buffer and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Similarly, B1 was created by ligation of 55B and 5′-phosphorylated 45B in the presence of Splint B. Both the T1 and the B1 strands were PAGE-purified after ligation. T1 and B1 are identical to the + and - strands, correspondingly, of the bacteriophage M13 mp18 genome at positions 1741-1840. The 2′-O-methyl-RNA, biotin, and DNA β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites for preparation of both natural and modified oligonucleotides, as well as chemical phosphorylation reagent II, were purchased from Glen Research. The DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of molecules.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study Open table in a new tab The DinG protein was purified as described previously (7Voloshin O.N.

The protein was expressed in the pET30 Xa/LIC vector and contained His6 and S tags (peptide sequence KETAAAKFRQHMDS) at the N terminus. This fusion protein was used throughout all the experiments and is referred to as DinG. The purification of the E. coli RecA protein was described in detail previously (15Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human Dmc1 protein was a kind gift from Dr. R. Pezza and was purified as described (16Masson J.Y. Davies A.A. Hajibagheri N. Van Dyck E. Benson F.E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Substrate Preparation—Oligonucleotide substrates for the unwinding reaction were prepared by thermal annealing. 5 μm 5′-32P-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were premixed in 25 μl of annealing buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2), heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and cooled to room temperature over a 1-1.5-h period. The annealed substrates were purified on a 8% (19:1) non-denaturing Tris/tautine/EDTA polyacrylamide gel. To assure that the correct band was excised from the gel, substrates composed of three or more strands were separated along with all the possible intermediates of annealing. DNA was extracted from the gel slices by passive diffusion overnight into the elution buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) at room temperature with rigorous shaking, precipitated and reprecipitated with ethanol, and washed with 80% ethanol. Substrates were dissolved in annealing buffer and stored at -20 °C. The integrity of the purified substrates was confirmed by rerunning aliquots of the purified material on a gel. Concentrations were determined after counting aliquots of purified radioactive substrates in a scintillation counter and comparing counts with those for the oligonucleotides with known specific activity that were used for substrate annealing in that experiment. D-loops stabilized by superhelicity were prepared after deproteinization of the RecA protein-mediated synaptic complexes formed on supercoiled plasmid DNA. 1 μm oligonucleotide (R3, R4, or R5) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10.4 μm (for oligonucleotide R3) or 25 μm (for R4 and R5) RecA in 50 μl of the solution containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm ATPγS. After 0.25 μm supercoiled pUC19 DNA was added, the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min. RecA was removed by treating the reaction mixture twice with buffer-saturated phenol and with phenol-chloroform. Unincorporated single-stranded oligonucleotides were separated from the D-loops by gel filtration through Chromaspin 400 columns (BD Biosciences), equilibrated with annealing buffer. The deproteinization procedure was performed at 4 °C, and the D-loops were stored at -20 °C. All the substrates used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. In the description of D- and R-loops, the strand annealed to the bubble region is referred to as “invading” or “incoming.” The same terms are used for the oligonucleotide strands forming D-loops on supercoiled plasmid DNA. Helicase Assay—Typically, 2 nm helicase substrate was incubated with DinG in 10 μl of the reaction mixture containing 67.5 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. DinG concentrations are indicated in the figures. When a single concentration of DinG was used through the experiment, it was 15 nm in experiments shown in Figs. 3, 6A, and 8 and 50 nm in experiments shown in Figs. 2C and 6B. Unwinding reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min (or the time indicated in the figure) at 30 °C and were deproteinized by the addition of SDS and EDTA to 1% and 10 mm, respectively. Each set of experiments contained a “positive control” in which the helicase substrate was heat-denatured by incubation for 5 min at 95 °C followed by quick chilling in an ice water bath. Products of the reaction performed with oligonucleotide substrates were separated in 0.4-mm-thick 8% (19:1) Tris/tautine/EDTA-polyacrylamide gels for 1.5-2 h at 5 V/cm. Unwinding of plasmid-based substrates (DR5, DR6, and DR7) was monitored by separating the products in a 1% Tris/acetate/EDTA agarose gel with 3 mm MgCl2 for 1.5 h at 3 V/cm. Agarose gels were fixed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, blot-dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens. Polyacrylamide gels were exposed without prior fixation and drying. Images of the gels were obtained with a BAS 2500 phosphorimaging analysis system (Fuji Medical Systems).FIGURE 6DinG is capable of dismantling model D-loop structures. A, although substrate D3 is resistant to the action of the DinG helicase, the strand annealed to the bubble region can be removed by DinG in substrates D5, D6, and D7. B, kinetics of unwinding of a model D-loop (substrate D5) and a tailed duplex (substrate D1) are very similar. Substrate D2, representing a blunt-ended 100-bp duplex with two nicks in the top strand, cannot be unwound by DinG. The average of three independent experiments is plotted, and error bars represent standard deviations. The arrowhead next to the gel depicts the top of the gel.

The continuous flow buffer contained 20 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (purchased from Biacore). All DNA binding substrates were constructed based on the Bio-T1 oligonucleotide. Bio-T1 was immobilized on the surface of sensor chip SA to give a signal of about 100 response units. Substrates containing two DNA strands (S1, D3, and F1) were made by annealing the second strand to Bio-T1 on the chip surface. The second oligonucleotide (B1, B11, or B8) was injected at the concentration of 400 nm in flow buffer at a flow rate of 2 μl/min over a 20-30-min period at 25 °C. Resonance signals increased and reached the plateau levels expected for the molecular mass of the added oligonucleotide. Substrates F2, F3, and D6 were created by a two-step annealing approach. To prove that this procedure yields completely annealed duplexes and is a valid way to prepare complex immobilized substrates, we made a chip containing immobilized single-stranded oligonucleotides and corresponding duplexes prepared in two different ways. In one case, duplex was prepared by surface annealing; in the second instance, it was preformed in solution and then was immobilized on the chip to the same response units level. We used this chip to investigate the DNA binding activity of human Dmc1 protein that demonstrates clearly different binding properties with respect to ss- and dsDNA. Although different from ssDNA, dsDNA binding by Dmc1 was very similar on both duplexes, proving that the two helixes have similar properties (data not shown). Both DinG·DNA complex formation and dissociation were conducted in flow buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATPγS using the “co-inject” mode of the autoinjector and a flow rate of 10 μ/min. DinG was injected at concentrations of 0, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, and 250 nm. Each experiment contained an “empty” control surface used as a measure for nonspecific binding. The surfaces were regenerated by consecutive injections, 20 μl each, of 0.5% SDS in flow buffer and 2 m NaCl. After baseline normalization, we used BIAevaluation software, version 4.0.1, to fit the experimental sensorgrams to the Langmuir model, which presumes 1:1 binding of the analyte to the ligand. The extracted rate and equilibrium constants of DinG interactions with all the DNA substrates tested are presented in Table 2.TABLE 2The rate and equilibrium constants of DinG intereaction with different DNA substrates Open table in a new tab The DinG Helicase Prefers Bifurcated Substrates—Initial characterization of the DinG helicase activity (7Voloshin O.N.

Here we investigate the specificity of this helicase for different DNA structures using a variety of synthetic substrates depicted in Fig. 1. First, we tested the ability of DinG to unwind bluntended dsDNA. Fig. 2A shows that no unwinding of the 100-mer duplex S1 was observed, even when the DinG concentration was as high as 200 nm. To exclude the possibility that the inability to unwind this 100-mer is a consequence of the low processivity of DinG, we repeated the experiment with a shorter 40-mer substrate, S14. Despite the fact that S14 is less stable then S1, as can be judged from its spontaneous partial melting, it is also not unwound by DinG (Fig. 2B). However, when a 5′-ss extension is added to the same duplex in substrate S8, DinG is capable of unwinding this 40-mer (Fig. 2C). The requirement for a 5′-extension is consistent with the previously described 5′- → 3′-polarity of translocation of the DinG helicase (7Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As expected, DinG shows no helicase activity on substrate S2, which has a 3′-tail but no 5′-extension (data not shown and Fig. 3). Nevertheless, having both 5′- and 3′-single-stranded extensions in substrate S12 results in more efficient unwinding of the same duplex (Fig. 2C). Thus, DinG is more active on bifurcated substrates. DinG Requires an 11-15-nucleotide 5′-Extension for Efficient DNA Duplex Unwinding—Fig. 3 shows that, like blunt-ended S14, substrates S2 and S3, having none or 5-nucleotide 5′-tails, are not unwound by DinG. There is very little, if any, unwinding of substrate S4 carrying a 10-nucleotide 5′-ss extension. Increasing the 5′-over-hang to 15 nucleotides in substrate S5 results in efficient unwinding that is similar to that for substrates S6 and S7. The above result suggests that DinG is capable of binding a stretch of ssDNA as short as 11-15 nucleotides. This finding is in agreement with the observation that DinG is capable of displacing a DNA strand after binding to a duplex with a 15-nucleotide gap (data not shown). The DinG Helicase Is Active on DNA·RNA Hybrid Duplexes—Since the S. cerevisiae homolog of E. coli DinG, Rad3, possesses a DNA·RNA helicase activity (17Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we tested whether DinG is capable of unwinding DNA·RNA duplexes. For these experiments, we used a 2′-OMe modified RNA, commonly used as a functional analog of natural RNA (for review, see Ref. 18Warfield K.L. Panchal R.G. Aman M.J. Bavari S. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2006; 8: 93-103PubMed Google Scholar). RNA composed of 2′-OMe ribonucleotides is conformationally more rigid and chemically more stable than natural RNAs (19Inoue H. Hayase Y. Imura A. Iwai S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6131-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 20Lesnik E.A. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Sasmor H. Zounes M. Cummins L.L. Ecker D.J. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7832-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The 2′-OMe sugar modification does not alter ribose sugar pucker and preserves the canonical right-handed A-form conformation in both RNA·RNA and DNA·RNA duplexes (21Lubini P. Zurcher W. Egli M. Chem. Biol. 1994; 1: 39-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freier S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Nuclease resistance of 2′-OMe RNA (21Lubini P. Zurcher W. Egli M. Chem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) allows much easier manipulations of 2′-OMe RNA-containing oligonucleotides without taking any special precautions. The ability of DinG to unwind a DNA·RNA hybrid duplex was tested on substrate D4-RNA, which is identical to substrate D4, except for the fact that the labeled strand, R4-RNA, consists of 2′-OMe-RNA. Fig. 4 shows that despite the fact that, as a rule, 2′-OMe-RNA·DNA duplexes are more stable than DNA·DNA duplexes, it is proficiently unwound by DinG. Helicase Activity of DinG on Flap Structures—That DinG demonstrates an enhanced DNA helicase activity on bifurcated substrates opens up the possibility that it could be active on another type of branched substrates, flap structures. Flap structure can be viewed as a bifurcated structure with one ss and one ds branch. The ability of DinG to unwind both 5′-flaps and 3′-flaps would argue that it can translocate on both ssDNA and dsDNA. Fig. 5 shows that whereas DinG helicase is active on a bifurcated F1 structure, a 3′-flap structure (substrate F2) is unquestionably resistant to unwinding by the DinG protein. At the same time, the 5′-flap (substrate F3) is easily dismantled by DinG, presumably by removing oligonucleotide B8 first and then unwinding the resulting 5′-tailed duplex. Since flap structures can be considered a model for a replication fork, our results suggest that DinG can use the lagging strand arm to translocate along DNA and unwind duplex ahead of a stalled (or collapsed) replication fork. The Invading Strand Can Be Easily Removed from Model D-loops by the DinG Helicase—D-loops formed upon invasion of ssDNA molecule into the homologous region of a DNA duplex constitute intermediates of RecA-mediated homologous recombination and double-stranded break repair. The DNA damage inducibility of dinG (2Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Van Dyk T.K. DeRose E.J. Gonye G.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5496-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests its possible role in recombinational DNA repair, and thus, its potential interaction with (or an unwinding activity on) D-loops. Such a possibility was tested, and the results are presented in Fig. 6. We found that the bubble structure D3 serving as a basic building block for synthetic D- and R-loops remained intact after treatment with DinG. The inability of DinG to unwind a bubbled duplex cannot be accounted for by weak binding of this substrate by DinG (see below). We can offer two explanations for the lack of helicase activity on substrate D3. First, if only one helicase molecule at a time can be loaded on the bubble region of the substrate, only one duplex can be unwound. The presence of the second intact duplex would significantly facilitate reannealing of the unwound duplex. If the rate of reannealing, which would follow first order reaction kinetics in this case, is higher than the rate of helicase-induced unwinding, DinG would never be able to separate the top and bottom strands from each other. Alternatively, the bubble region can be collapsed and unsuitable for DinG loading. Interestingly, helicases PcrA, PriA, and RecG do not unwind bubble substrates either (23Anand S.P. Khan S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, oligonucleotides complementary to the unpaired region in the bubble, the incoming strands, were efficiently released after the addition of DinG. Since DinG is a 5′- → 3′-helicase that requires an ss tail for its unwinding activity (Fig. 2), we anticipated that only substrate D6 would be unwound. To our surprise, DinG was very proficient in removing the incoming strand from both D5 (without any extension of the invading strand beyond a bubble region) and D7 (having only a 3′-non-homologous extension). Although all D-loop substrates (D5, D6, and D6) were almost completely unwound in 15 min, the possibility exists that the presence of the free 5′-ss tail in substrate D6 would result in its faster unwinding when compared with D5 and D7. Interestingly, we could not see any significant kinetic difference in the unwinding of substrates D1 and D5 (Fig. 6B). Finally, that oligonucleotide R3 could not be displaced from substrate D2 (Fig. 6B) argues against the possibility that a discontinuity in one strand of the DNA duplex is a feature that is responsible for unwinding of substrate D5 by DinG. DinG Binds Different DNA Substrates with Similar Affinity—The lack of helicase activity on blunt-ended dsDNA, a 3′-flap, and a bubble structure could be due to poor DinG binding to those substrates. To examine such a possibility, we measured the rate and equilibrium constants of DinG binding to some of the DNA substrates used in the helicase assays. The binding constants were obtained using surface plasmon resonance technology on a Biacore 3000 instrument. Examples of sensorgrams used to quantify interactions are shown in Fig. 7, and the binding constants for seven representative substrates are presented in Table 2. These data prove that the absence of the helicase activity cannot be accounted for by the instability of DNA·DinG complexes. DinG binds dsDNA, 3-flap, and bifurcated structures with an affinity similar to that for ssDNA with dissociation equilibrium constants close to 200 nm. Nevertheless, substrates S1 and F2, in contrast to F1, cannot be unwound. Moreover, a preferable helicase substrate F3 has the lowest affinity to DinG, whereas the best DinG binder, bubble D3, cannot be unwound at all. Thus, we could not observe a correlation between the stability of DNA·DinG complexes and the inability of DinG to unwind some of the substrates. 2′-OMe-RNA Oligonucleotides Can Be Displaced from R-loop Structures—Since DinG is capable of dismantling synthetic D-loops and unwinds DNA·RNA duplexes, we examined whether it is active on R-loops. The results presented in Fig. 8 demonstrate that the unwinding activity of the helicase on R-loops is very close to that on D-loops. As with the D-loop counterparts, DinG was active on R-loops containing 2′-OMe-RNA without an 5′-extension (Fig. 8, substrates D5-RNA and D7-RNA).

We mapped the yeast RNAPII ubiquitylation sites and found that they play an important role in elongation and the DNA-damage response.

These data reveal the specificity and mechanism of RNAPII ubiquitylation and demonstrate that E2s can play a crucial role in substrate recognition. Protein ubiquitylation has emerged as a crucial and common conduit for the regulation of cellular processes. Protein monoubiquitylation serves to alter the activity of the target protein or to tag it for interaction with other factors. In contrast, multiubiquitylation typically leads to degradation of the target protein by the proteasome (Varshavsky, 1997Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, Pickart, 2001Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation requires the cooperation of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating protein), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) (Pickart, 2001Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). There is only one E1 in eukaryotic cells, but several E2s and innumerable E3s. While the E1 merely activates ubiquitin, the E2 and the E3 form a transient complex, which recognizes and ubiquitylates the protein substrate. E2/E3 complexes of two main types exist (Ardley and Robinson, 2005Ardley H.C. Robinson P.A. E3 ubiquitin ligases.Essays Biochem. 2005; 41: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): those where the E3 recognizes the substrate to allow ubiquitin transfer directly from the E2 (E3s of the RING-finger/U-box families) and those where the E3 both recognizes the substrate and ubiquitylates it. Here, ubiquitin transfer is from the E2 to the E3 and then to the substrate (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus [HECT] domain E3s). Interestingly, although several examples of the effects and importance of ubiquitylation have been reported, key questions about the mechanism of protein ubiquitylation remain unanswered. For example, the manner in which recognition of the substrate and its site-specific ubiquitylation are connected is poorly understood, and detailed examples of the reaction mechanism of different E2-E3 pairs are relatively few. It is generally believed that only the E3 recognizes and positions the substrate for ubiquitylation. The substrate binding sites of E3s are, however, typically quite far from the site of actual ubiquitylation (the E3 active site). Moreover, in the few cases where structural data on an E2-E3 complex is available, the active site of the E2 and the active site of the HECT E3 are also far apart (Huang et al., 1999Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Structure of an E6AP-UbcH7 complex: insights into ubiquitination by the E2-E3 enzyme cascade.Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), necessitating substantial structural rearrangements to occur during substrate recognition and catalysis (Verdecia et al., 2003Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Conformational flexibility underlies ubiquitin ligation mediated by the WWP1 HECT domain E3 ligase.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the cooperation between E2 and E3 during catalysis is crucial to understand protein ubiquitylation. One interesting substrate for protein ubiquitylation is RNAPII, which transcribes all protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes (Boeger et al., 2005Boeger H. Bushnell D.A. Davis R. Griesenbeck J. Lorch Y. Strattan J.S. Westover K.D. Kornberg R.D. Structural basis of eukaryotic gene transcription.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 899-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitylation and degradation of RNAPII was first thought to occur specifically in response to DNA damage (Bregman et al., 1996Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but recent experiments have shown that RNAPII arrested during transcript elongation is generally prone to ubiquitylation and degradation (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that degradation of RNAPII is a “last resort,” used to clear active genes of persistently arrested RNAPII elongation complexes (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We recently reconstituted RNAPII ubiquitylation in vitro with highly purified yeast ubiquitylation factors and showed that the elongating RNAPII form is a much better substrate than the free form (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the explanation for this substrate discrimination by highly purified proteins was not apparent. The HECT E3 among the ubiquitylation factors, Rsp5, binds RNAPII via the flexible C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of the Rpb1 subunit (Huibregtse et al., 1997Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. The large subunit of RNA polymerase II is a substrate of the Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the CTD is absolutely required for RNAPII ubiquitylation, Rsp5-mediated modification occurs in the main body of the Rpb1 subunit (Peng et al., 2003Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The importance for transcription and the DNA-damage response of site-specific RNAPII ubiquitylation has not been addressed. We have now mapped sites of RNAII ubiquitylation to facilitate an understanding of the role of such modification in vivo, with the additional goal of understanding the mechanism of RNAPII ubiquitylation. We discovered two distinct Rpb1 ubiquitylation sites, K330 and K695. Mutation of these sites has important functional consequences for transcript elongation and the DNA-damage response. Remarkably, although these sites are far apart (more than 125 Ångstroms), their modification is coordinated in vitro as well as in vivo, suggesting that an E2/E3/RNAPII complex is assembled that depends on not only the RNAPII CTD but also on the Rpb1 ubiquitylation sites themselves. We have indeed identified such a complex, revealing the mechanistic basis for RNAPII ubiquitylation and also the role of the CTD. We further show that, surprisingly, it is the E2 (Ubc5) that recognizes the sites of modification. In order to map sites of RNAPII ubiquitylation, yeast RNAPII was ubiquitylated in vitro by highly purified ubiquitylation factors (Uba1, Ubc5, and Rsp5) and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. We recently reported that this approach identified an ubiquitylated peptide containing Rpb1 K695 (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which was also independently identified as a target of RNAPII ubiquitylation in vivo (Peng et al., 2003Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Our further analysis uncovered another peptide, in which GG from the C terminus of ubiquitin was linked to “ARLKGKEGR” of Rpb1. This indicated that either K330 or K332 is also a target of ubiquitylation (Figure 1A). The biological relevance of the mapped ubiquitylation sites was first investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis in vivo. In our initial approach, K330 and K332 were comutated, but subsequent experiments indicated that the actual site of ubiquitylation is K330 (or at least that if ubiquitylation also occurs at K332, it has no functional consequence [Figure S1]). Independent mutation of lysine 330, or lysine 695, to arginine did not result in a growth phenotype under normal conditions. In contrast, concomitant mutation of both sites was lethal (Figure 1B). In order to investigate the role of the RNAPII ubiquitylation sites in transcript elongation in vivo, the effect of the elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil (6-AU) on the growth of the single mutants (K330R and K695R) was tested. 6-AU causes a decrease in cellular UTP/GTP levels and thus increases transcriptional arrest (Mason and Struhl, 2005Mason P.B. Struhl K. Distinction and relationship between elongation rate and processivity of RNA polymerase II in vivo.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and references therein). The growth rate of both mutants was significantly affected by 6-AU, suggesting a role for the residues in transcript elongation in vivo (Figure 1C). Moreover, mutation of K330 (but not K695) was lethal in cells lacking the general elongation factor, TFIIS (encoded by DST1) (Figure 1D). Together, these data suggest a role for the ubiquitylatable lysines in transcript elongation. We next investigated the roles of K330 and K695 in RNAPII ubiquitylation in vivo. Following treatment with 6-AU to induce RNAPII arrest and Rpb1 ubiquitylation, the polymerase was immunopurified and subjected to western blotting, using antiubiquitin antibodies (Figure 1E). As expected (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), wild-type (wt) RNAPII became polyubiquitylated under these conditions, but little ubiquitylation was detected with RNAPII from K695R cells, and even less with RNAPII from K330R cells, indicating that the sites are indeed targets for arrest-induced RNAPII ubiquitylation. RNAPII is ubiquitylated and degraded in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and we previously proposed that this represents an alternative to removal of DNA damage by transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Rescue of arrested RNA polymerase II complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar to cells lacking RAD26 (encoding the yeast TCR factor homologous to human Cockayne syndrome B [van Gool et al., 1994van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. RAD26, the functional S. cerevisiae homolog of the Cockayne syndrome B gene ERCC6.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar]), cells carrying mutations in the RNAPII ubiquitylation sites were not UV sensitive. In agreement with the proposed model, however, cells lacking both RAD26 and one of the RNAPII ubiquitylation sites (especially K330) were highly UV sensitive (Figure 2A). Moreover, RNAPII ubiquitylation in response to UV irradiation was dramatically reduced in the K695R mutant (Figure 2B, compare lanes 2 and 6). In K330R, ubiquitylation was almost undetectable, with only a very low level of modification detected in some experiments (Figure 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4; data not shown). RNAPII ubiquitylation was previously shown to result in degradation by the proteasome (Ratner et al., 1998Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Implications for transcription-coupled DNA repair.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5184-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Beaudenon et al., 1999Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, though RNAPII ubiquitylation was reduced in K695R, no reduction in the level of this RNAPII mutant was observed upon UV irradiation. In contrast, the level of the K330R mutant was dramatically reduced (Figure 2C, compare Rpb1 levels in lanes 2 and 3, 7 and 8, and 12 and 13). These data correlate with the UV sensitivity of the mutants observed in the rad26 background and support the idea that cell viability during DNA damage in genes relies on an ability to either perform TCR or degrade RNAPII efficiently so that repair can take place by other mechanisms (Svejstrup, 2003Svejstrup J.Q. Rescue of arrested RNA polymerase II complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The in vivo observations were mirrored by in vitro experiments performed with recombinant ubiquitylation factors and highly purified wt or mutant RNAPII (Figure 2D). Only low levels of ubiquitylation of the mutant polymerases was detected under conditions that yielded efficient polyubiquitylation of wt RNAPII, and even monoubiquitylation was dramatically reduced (Figure 2D, left and right panel; data not shown). Taken together, the data above strongly suggest that Rpb1-K695 and -K330 are indeed relevant and important RNAPII ubiquitylation sites. Moreover, the finding that mutation of either site is sufficient to dramatically reduce overall RNAPII ubiquitylation both in vivo and in vitro was intriguing, as it suggests that modification of the two sites is somehow interdependent. The location of the ubiquitylation sites in the RNAPII crystal structure (Figure 7A; see also Figure S6) led to several conclusions. First, K330 is situated in the so-called switch 2 domain, which is unordered in free RNAPII, but highly ordered in the elongating form of the enzyme (Gnatt et al., 2001Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Structural basis of transcription: an RNA polymerase II elongation complex at 3.3 A resolution.Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). This location may explain the strong preference of ubiquitylation for the elongating form of RNAPII compared to the free form, even in vitro (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar): a major target site for the ubiquitylation machinery adopts a conformation in this form of the enzyme that allows efficient modification. Secondly, the sites are located far apart (about 125 Ångstroms), on opposite faces of RNAPII and far away from the (exit point of the) CTD (Figure 7A), which is also required for ubiquitylation. We investigated the interdependence of the two distant ubiquitylation sites and their spatial relationship with the CTD with the use of our defined ubiquitylation system for studies in vitro. We surmised that the site interdependence would best be explained if establishment of a functional ubiquitylation complex on RNAPII requires binding of the E2 and/or the E3 to the regions around the sites. In this case, if one of the sites were absent, correct RNAPII binding by the ubiquitylation factors might be perturbed and only little ubiquitylation take place. As mentioned, the CTD of RNAPII is required for ubiquitylation (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the E3, Rsp5, is known to bind the RNAPII CTD directly (Huibregtse et al., 1997Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. The large subunit of RNA polymerase II is a substrate of the Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, assembly of the ubiquitylation complex might involve interactions with both the CTD and the region around the ubiquitylation sites. To first investigate whether Rsp5 or Ubc5 require the CTD for interaction with RNAPII, we used immobilized RNAPII-HA, or immobilized RNAPII lacking the CTD (RNAPIIΔCTD-HA; Li and Kornberg, 1994Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Interplay of positive and negative effectors in function of the C- terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and incubated them with either recombinant GST-Rsp5 or GST-Ubc5 (Figure 3). GST-Rsp5 bound well to immobilized RNAPII containing the CTD but failed to interact with CTD-less RNAPII (Figure 3A). Likewise, CTD-containing, but not CTD-less, RNAPII bound immobilized GST-Rsp5 (Figure S2). In contrast, GST-Ubc5 bound to both RNAPII and RNAPIIΔCTD (Figure 3B). Our previous data showed that RNAPII ubiquitylation is inhibited by serine 5 phosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro (Somesh et al., 2005Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Multiple mechanisms confining RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation to polymerases undergoing transcriptional arrest.Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Rsp5-RNAPII binding experiments with purified proteins uncovered the likely mechanistic basis for this, as Rsp5 failed to bind serine 5-phosphorylated RNAPII (Figure 3C, compare lanes 2 and 4). As Ubc5 binds RNAPII in a CTD-independent manner, we investigated binding of this protein to RNAPII carrying point mutations in the Rpb1 ubiquitylation sites. GST-Ubc5 was immobilized on glutathione beads (with GST alone as control), and incubated with wt or mutated forms of RNAPII (Figure 3D). Strikingly, whereas wt RNAPII bound efficiently to beads containing Ubc5, binding of K695R-RNAPII was slightly, but reproducibly, reduced, and binding of RNAPII-K330R was dramatically reduced (compare lanes 5–7, 11–13, and 17–19). To investigate if residual (weak) binding of Ubc5 to K695 still occurred in the RNAPII-K330R mutant and if a detectable reduction in binding could be observed in the RNAPII-K695R mutant, wt and mutant RNAPIIs were now immobilized via their CTD, and incubated with GST-Ubc5 (Figure 3E). Using this experimental approach, we consistently observed reduced binding of Ubc5 to RNAPII-K695R (Figure 3E, compare lanes 10–12 with 4–6). It was also clear that RNAPII-K330R retains some capacity for binding Ubc5 (Figure 3E, compare lanes 7–9 with 4–6 and 1–3 [control]). As expected, point mutation of the Rpb1 ubiquitylation sites had no effect on the RNAPII binding of Rsp5 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that Ubc5, but not Rsp5, recognizes and binds the actual sites of modification in RNAPII. The finding that Ubc5 rather than Rsp5 recognizes the RNAPII ubiquitylation sites was surprising because E2s are generally not believed to be involved in target recognition. In ubiquitylation by HECT family ubiquitin ligases (to which Rsp5 belongs), ubiquitin is transferred from the active site of the E2 to that of the E3, and then to the target. It was therefore relevant to test whether ubiquitin transfer might occur directly from Ubc5 to the polymerase, rather than via Rsp5's active site. If Rsp5 were merely serving a structural role, it might thus be expected that a point mutation in its active site would have no effect on ubiquitylation. As can be seen in Figure 3F, however, the active sites of Rsp5 and Ubc5 were both absolutely required for RNAPII ubiquitylation. This suggests that an Ubc5-Rsp5-substrate complex is established at the ubiquitylation sites, in which ubiquitin is transferred from E2 to E3 to substrate, as is normally observed with HECT E3 ligases. The interdependence of the ubiquitylation sites, the fact that Rsp5 binds RNAPII via the highly repeated C-terminal domain (CTD), and the finding above that point mutation of either ubiquitylation site affects Ubc5 binding could be explained if modification occurs in a multimeric E2/E3 complex, capable of accessing two sites. This prompted us to investigate how many molecules of Rsp5 and Ubc5 bind to RNAPII (Figure 4). This was done by two approaches. First, we titrated increasing amounts of Rsp5 into an RNAPII binding reaction. Scanning of the resulting Coomassie-stained gels suggested that RNAPII binding reached a plateau at two molecules of Rsp5 (Figure S3). In a second approach, increasing amounts of untagged Rsp5 were titrated into a binding reaction containing a constant amount of GST-Rsp5 and RNAPII. Associated proteins were then isolated on glutathione-sepharose beads via the tag on GST-Rsp5 and the beads examined for the presence of untagged Rsp5 (Figure 4A). Untagged Rsp5 only associated with GST-Rsp5 in the presence of RNAPII (Figure 4A, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–5), in agreement with the notion that Rsp5 otherwise behaves as a monomeric protein (data not shown) and indicating that the dimerization sometimes observed with GST-tagged proteins was not a problem in these experiments. Significantly, upon addition of increasing amounts of Rsp5 protein, the level of bound, untagged Rsp5 reached a plateau at a level similar to that of GST-Rsp5, as expected if two molecules of Rsp5 concomitantly bind RNAPII. The same experimental approach was taken to investigate if more than one copy of Ubc5 bind RNAPII (Figure 4B and data not shown). Untagged Ubc5 bound immobilized GST-Ubc5 in an RNAPII-dependent manner, and the amounts of protein bound indicated that at least two Ubc5 molecules bind RNAPII (Figure 4B, compare GST-Ubc5 and Ubc5 in lanes 4 and 5). The above experiments support a model in which Ubc5 molecules bind RNAPII at the sites of ubiquitylation and then allow the recruitment of two copies of CTD bound Rsp5 to trigger site-specific ubiquitylation. The CTD and its linker are presumed to be highly flexible and can, in an extended state, span hundreds of Ångstroms from base to tip. The CTD might, however, alternatively be ordered in a discrete fold that makes the effective length much shorter (reviewed by Meinhart et al., 2005Meinhart A. Kamenski T. Hoeppner S. Baumli S. Cramer P. A structural perspective of CTD function.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Indeed, yeast cells with 10–12 CTD repeats (rather than the normal 26) are only conditionally viable, and a minimum of 10 repeats are required for viability (Nonet et al., 1987Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Functional redundancy and structural polymorphism in the large subunit of RNA polymerase II.Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The distance from the last ordered residue at the base of the CTD linker across the surface of RNAPII to Rpb1 lysine 695 is more than 175 Ångstroms (refer to Figure 7A). In light of the above results it was therefore interesting to investigate if a shorter CTD is capable of supporting RNAPII ubiquitylation. RNAPII with 12 CTD repeats (Nonet et al., 1987Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Functional redundancy and structural polymorphism in the large subunit of RNA polymerase II.Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was therefore purified (Figure 5A) and tested in the ubiquitylation assay. Strikingly, ubiquitylation of RNAPII-12 was dramatically reduced (Figure 5B). Binding experiments showed that RNAPII-12 could still associate with Rsp5, although clearly less efficiently (Figure 5C and data not shown), opening the possibility that the binding of Rsp5 to RNAPII is cooperative. These data indicate a CTD length requirement for a productive RNAPII ubiquitylation complex to form. The results above support the idea that two molecules of Rsp5 associate with the CTD to organize a complex capable of ubiquitylating RNAPII via interaction with Ubc5 molecules bound to the regions surrounding the sites. To further experimentally explore this model, we first investigated whether Ubc5 and Rsp5 directly interact. This was indeed the case (Figures 6A and S4). We next performed gel migration-retardation experiments with preformed RNAPII elongation complexes (Figures 6B and 6C). Addition of the Ubc5 protein alone did not radically affect the migration of the RNAPII/DNA/RNA ternary complex (Figures 6B [lanes 1 and 2] and 6C [labeled “tern.”]). Addition of Rsp5, however, retarded migration dramatically, leading to an extended smear of more slowly migrating RNAPII elongation complexes (Figures 6B [lane 3] and 6C [labeled “tern.”]). The reason for the dramatic difference in mobility between complexes containing Ubc5 and Rsp5 is unknown but might be due to their size difference (16 kDa versus 92 kDa) or, more likely, that Ubc5 binds th"

However, amylomaltases almost exclusively catalyze transglycosylation reactions, whereas α-amylase-like enzymes mostly catalyze hydrolysis. As a result, the amylomaltases perform so-called disproportionation reactions, the net effect of which is that two amylose chains of certain lengths react in such a way that one of the chains (the “donor”) becomes shorter and the other one (the “acceptor”) longer as shown in Reaction 1. Gx+Gy→amylomaltaseGx+n+Gy-nREACTION1 Instead of using two different sugar chains for this reaction, the enzyme can also take the non-reducing end of the donor substrate as the acceptor substrate, which results in the formation of a cyclic glucan product of at least 16 glucose units (8Terada Y.

These properties, amylose disproportionation and the synthesis of large cyclic glucans, make these enzymes interesting biocatalysts for the synthesis of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutically important materials (12Kaper T. van der Maarel M.J.E.C.

Over the years, several incisive studies have contributed to our current understanding of catalysis by α-amylase-type enzymes. Importantly, a structure of a covalent reaction intermediate, obtained by Uitdehaag et al. (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), provided a detailed look into the active site, showing among other things how the (mutated) acid/base catalyst is poised to activate a water molecule for attack on the C1 carbon atom. Since then, two other examples of covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate structures of α-amylase-type enzymes have been published (16Jensen M.H. Mirza O. Albenne C. Remaud-Simeon M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Lovering A.L. Lee S.S. Kim Y.-W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2105-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These structures provided insight into the hydrolysis mechanism, i.e. in the way in which a covalent intermediate is attacked by a water molecule. Three conserved carboxylic acid residues play a central role in the catalytic mechanism (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 19Mosi R. He S. Uitdehaag J.C.

The first carboxylic acid residue acts as an acid/base catalyst that protonates the oxygen atom of the scissile glycosidic bond. Simultaneously, the C1 carbon atom is attacked by the second carboxylate, the nucleophile, which results in the formation of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate through a planar, oxocarbenium ion-like transition state. This covalent intermediate can be broken down through nucleophilic attack on the C1 carbon atom of the sugar, either by a water molecule, resulting in hydrolysis, or by a hydroxyl group of another sugar molecule, the glycosyl acceptor, resulting in the formation of a new glycosidic bond. The third carboxylate binds the sugar in the -1 subsite (for nomenclature of sugar binding subsites see Ref. (21Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar)), distorting it toward a partially planar conformation in the Michaelis complex and contributing to the stabilization of the transition state, all through hydrogen bonds to the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups. However, so far no direct evidence has been obtained for how the covalent intermediate is attacked by another sugar, but amylomaltases seem ideal for studying this, given their low hydrolysis activity. The first amylomaltase structures to become available were of the enzyme from Thermus aquaticus, both uncomplexed and in a complex with two molecules of the pseudo-tetrasaccharide inhibitor acarbose (11Strater N. Przylas I. Saenger W. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Biologia (Bratislava). 2002; 57: 93-99Google Scholar, 22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J.

Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The structures showed the expected (β/α)8-barrel fold and active site build-up of an α-amylase-type enzyme. However, in the acarbose complex two of the catalytic residues, the catalytic nucleophile Asp-293 and the acid/base catalyst Glu-340, were found to point away from the site of cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the substrate, i.e. to have incompetent orientations for catalysis. This was tentatively attributed to the high pH of the soaking experiment (pH 9.0), which was deemed necessary to avoid enzymatic hydrolysis of the inhibitor (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar). The third carboxylate, the transition state stabilizer Asp-395, did bind the 2- and 3-OH groups of the inhibitor in the -1 subsite as expected. Here we report the structure of the amylomaltase from Thermus thermophilus close to the optimum pH, along with a covalent reaction intermediate obtained in a native active site (i.e. without any mutations), also close to the optimum pH, as well as a complex of this covalent intermediate with the acceptor analogue 4-deoxyglucose. Because the Th. thermophilus and Th. aquaticus enzymes differ only in one amino acid, on a surface site remote from the active site (glutamine 27 in the Th. thermophilus enzyme is an arginine in the Th. aquaticus protein), our results can be readily combined with the acarbose complex structure reported previously by Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar, 23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), yielding a step-by-step flip book movie of the entire catalytic cycle in atomic detail, including the attack of the incoming acceptor substrate on the covalent intermediate. The new structures show the reasons for the low hydrolysis activity as well as the binding mode of an acceptor of the glycosyl moiety. Overall, these new structures reveal how the enzyme protects the covalent intermediate from attack by an undesired nucleophile. Protein Preparation—His-tagged Th. thermophilus amylomaltase was purified by heat incubation and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography from Escherichia coli BL21(DE-3) cells containing the pCCBmalq plasmid as described elsewhere (24Kaper T. Leemhuis H. Uitdehaag J.C. van der Veen B.A. Dijkstra B.W. van der Maarel M.J.E.C. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5261-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to an A2801 cm of 22 corresponding to ∼10 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. Crystal Preparation—Removal of the polyhistidine tag proved vital in obtaining high quality amylomaltase crystals. To cleave off the polyhistidine tag, 20 units of bovine thrombin (ICN) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm NaH2PO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl) with 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 4 mm calcium chloride were added to 100 μl of 10 mg/ml His-tagged amylomaltase in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5 or phosphate-buffered saline, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 24 h. Subsequently, thrombin was inactivated by incubation for 10 min in a water bath at 75 °C, which was followed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C and dialysis against 10 mm MES 3The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank. /NaOH, pH 6.5, with 1 mm dithiothreitol. After His tag removal, crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique in which a drop consisting of 3 μl of the protein solution and 1-3 μl of reservoir solution (0.4-0.8 m sodium malonate (25McPherson A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), pH 5.6, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) was equilibrated against reservoir solution at room temperature. Rod-shaped crystals grew in 1 week to maximal dimensions of 1.0 × 0.35 × 0.35 mm3 and were flash-cooled after soaking them briefly in reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol. To obtain a complex with acarbose, a crystal was soaked for 30 min in 500 μl of 0.8 m sodium malonate, pH 5.6, containing 5 mg/ml acarbose (Serva electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany) and then flash-cooled in the soaking solution containing 25% glycerol. A complex with acarbose and 4-deoxyglucose was obtained by soaking a crystal for 30 min in 0.8 m sodium malonate, pH 5.6, containing 5 mg/ml acarbose and 120 mg/ml 4-deoxyglucose (CMS Chemicals Ltd., Abingdon, UK), followed by cryoprotection in the same solution with 26% glycerol and flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data from a native crystal were recorded at the BW7B beam line of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation at the German Synchrotron Research Center in Hamburg, Germany. Data from the acarbose-soaked crystal were collected at the ID14-1 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Data for the acarbose/4-deoxyglucose complex were obtained using CuK-α radiation from a Nonius FR591 rotating anode generator with Osmic mirrors, equipped with a MacScience DIP2030 image plate detector. All data were processed using DENZO and Scalepack (26Otwinowksi Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38234) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution: Native Structure at pH 5.6—The native structure at pH 5.6 was solved by molecular replacement with the program MolRep (28Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4096) Google Scholar), using the native Th. aquaticus amylomaltase structure of Przylas et al. (23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1CWY) as a starting model, followed by refinement with Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13706) Google Scholar). A comparison was made with the structure published by Przylas et al. (23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using the program DynDom version 1.5 (30Hayward S. Lee R.A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Covalent Intermediate Structure—A difference Fourier electron density map was calculated after brief refinement of the native structure at pH 5.6 against the data for the acarbose-soaked crystal. This showed clear difference electron density for sugar residues in the -1, -2, and -3 sites, with the residue in the -1 site covalently bound to Asp-293 (Fig. 1A). To build as unbiased a model as possible, for the next round of refinement three residues of acarbose of which the 6-OH groups had been removed were placed in the density. The carboxylate moiety of Asp-293 was also removed, but the O1 atom of the sugar residue in the -1 site was kept in its axial position. Difference Fourier maps calculated after refinement of this incomplete structure showed unambiguous difference density for the covalent bond between the -1 sugar residue and the side chain of Asp-293 (Fig. 1B), as well as negative difference density for the axial O1, and allowed identification of the various acarbose residues by the presence or absence of density for a 6-OH group. The model could then be completed and refined using Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13706) Google Scholar). Covalent Intermediate/4-Deoxyglucose Complex—The covalent intermediate model was briefly refined using Refmac5 against a dataset recorded from a crystal soaked in acarbose and 4-deoxyglucose, and double difference and difference electron density maps showed the presence of a sugar residue in the +1 site (Fig. 1, C and D). The structure of the complex could then be built and refined using Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13706) Google Scholar) and Xfit (31McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Throughout the refinement of all models, care was taken to use the same set of reflections for the calculation of the free R-factor in each case. Refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. Refined structures and diffraction data were deposited in the PDB under accession codes 2OWW, 2OWC and 2OWX. Crystals of Th. thermophilus amylomaltase were obtained at pH 5.6 in a different crystal form from those reported by Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar) (space group P3121 with a = b = 93 Å, c = 154 Å instead of P64 with a = b = 154 Å, c = 64 Å). The pH 5.6 structure of the Th. thermophilus amylomaltase presented here is very similar to the structures of the Th. aquaticus enzyme reported by Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar), with root mean square differences of 0.8 Å for the 498 equivalent Cα positions. However, in the pH 5.6 structure the protein adopts a more closed conformation (Fig. 2A). This difference, which is seen when comparing any of the structures presented here with the structures of Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar, 23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), can be described as being caused by a hinge-like movement around an axis running close to the catalytic nucleophile, Asp-293, mostly affecting the position of the “250s loop” (residues 247-255, see Refs. (11Strater N. Przylas I. Saenger W. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Biologia (Bratislava). 2002; 57: 93-99Google Scholar, 22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar, 23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). Although the electron density for this loop is poor in the pH 5.6 structure, it is clear that because of the rearrangements in the 250s loop a sugar chain in the acceptor subsites would not be able to continue beyond the +2 site. These considerations apply to all new structures reported here. A comparison of the Th. aquaticus enzyme with other crystal forms of the Th. thermophilus amylomaltase 4T. Kaper, J. C. M. Uitdehaag, T. R. M. Barends, B. W. Dijkstra, M .J. E. C. van der Maarel, and L. Dijkhuizen, manuscript in preparation. also showed that the core of the enzyme is rigid, whereas the surface loops are flexible. N-Succinimide Residue at Position 370-371—In every structure reported here, the residue at position 370, which was expected to be an aspartate, could not be satisfactorily modeled as such. 2mFo - DFc and Fo - DFc electron density maps (32Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) showed that the side chain of Asp-370 had reacted with the main chain amine of Gly-371 to form a succinimide, which was included in the model as such (Fig. 3A). Calculation of the electron density for the amylomaltase-acarbose complex structure of Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar, 23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using the deposited structure factors show that in that case, too, a succinimide was formed from these residues (Fig. 3B) although this was, at the time, not modeled in the deposited structure. Such cyclic amides occur in protein backbones as intermediates in the deamidation of asparagines and in the chemical hydrolysis and rearrangement of the polypeptide chain at Asp/Asn residues. This relatively unusual form of post-translational modification has been observed before in crystal structures, e.g. in lysozyme (33Noguchi S. Miyawaki K. Satow Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Possibly, the formation of the observed cyclic amide in amylomaltase is accelerated by the high temperature step in the purification and may confer extra stability at the high temperatures at which Thermus amylomaltase is active in vivo. Complex Structures—Soaking a Th. thermophilus amylomaltase crystal in acarbose resulted in a covalent intermediate bound to Asp-293 consisting of three sugar residues in the -1, -2, and -3 sites (Fig. 1, A and B). The plane of the ester moiety connecting Asp-293 and the C1 carbon atom of the -1 sugar is approximately perpendicular to the approximate plane of the -1 sugar ring, in contrast with the situation in the covalent intermediate of CGTase (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) where the two planes are nearly parallel. The catalytic acid/base Glu-340 is oriented away from the active site just as in the native structure at pH 5.6 and the acarbose structure of Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar) for Th. aquaticus covalent intermediate, with the +1 site occupied by a 4-deoxyglucose molecule in close proximity to the covalent bond between enzyme and sugar and hydrogen bonded to the Gln-256 side chain. (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2B). Reason for the Formation of the Covalent Intermediate—The observation of a covalent intermediate upon soaking native amylomaltase crystals at pH 5.6 with acarbose was unexpected. Prior structure determinations of covalent intermediates have made use of mutation of the acid/base to impair breakdown of the covalent adduct and of a chemically activated pseudo-substrate like a fluorinated (oligo) saccharide to enable covalent bonding to the nucleophile despite the absence of the acid/base catalyst. In the present case, however, a stable covalent intermediate was obtained without either chemical activation or mutation of any residue. To explain this, the following sequence of events could be imagined. First, acarbose binds in sites -3 to +1, as in the complex structure of Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar). Because the active site residues are all present, the tetrasaccharide is cleaved, leaving a covalent intermediate in sites -3 to -1 while the glucose residue in site +1 diffuses away. To break down this intermediate, only three possibilities exist. First, it could be attacked by a glucose molecule generated by the first half reaction. This is, however, very unlikely, given the volumes and amount of protein that were used; a single protein crystal was soaked in 500 μl of solution, which would lead to a very low concentration of produced glucose (∼1 μm). Moreover, the experiment was performed at room temperature, whereas this is an enzyme from a thermophilic organism. This may have slowed down the reaction and contributed to the accumulation of the covalent intermediate. Second, the intermediate could be attacked by the 4-OH group of another acarbose molecule. Given the acarbose concentration used (∼7.5 mm), this may appear more likely but, in fact, is impossible in this crystal form because the hinging movement has brought the 250s loop in a position precluding the binding of a long acceptor beyond subsite +2. The third possibility would be attack by water, but this is very rare in amylomaltases, as will be explained below. Thus, we thank the kinetics of the experiment, the crystal form, and the properties of the enzyme for the unexpected accumulation of the covalent intermediate in the crystals despite a native active site. Structural Changes during the Reaction Cycle—The available structures allow a detailed view of the changes in conformation of the different reaction partners as they go through the catalytic cycle (Fig. 4). The first structure (Fig. 4A) is the empty active site of amylomaltase at pH 5.6. The nucleophilic Asp-293 side chain points away from the active site into the protein where it hydrogen bonds to Asp-213. In this position, the nucleophile is unable to react with the substrate. In contrast, in the Th. aquaticus pH 7.5 structure of Przylas et al. (23Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) Asp-293 points into the active site, toward the -1 site, as expected for a catalytically competent conformation, showing that this residue can adopt at least two different conformations. The next state along the reaction coordinate is the structure of the Michaelis complex with a substrate. Although such a structure has not yet been solved, the acarbose complex structure reported by Przylas et al. (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B) can serve as a model for this state. In this complex, the nucleophilic Asp-293 is in the same catalytically incompetent orientation, hydrogen bonded to Asp-213, as in our pH 5.6 amylomaltase structure. At the time, this was attributed to the high pH of the soaking experiment (pH 9.0), but the pH 5.6 native structure shows that this conformational state can also be populated close to the pH optimum. Reaction of the enzyme with the substrate leads to the next structure, a covalent intermediate with the leaving group saccharide still in the +1 site, which is represented by the covalent intermediate-4-deoxyglucose complex (Fig. 4C). Upon formation of the covalent intermediate, the α-glycosidic bond between the sugar residues in the -1 and +1 sites is replaced by a β-glycosidic bond to Asp-293 via the Oδ1 atom of this residue. To enable formation of this bond from the state in which Asp-293 points into the active site, a rotation around the Cβ-Cγ bond has to occur, bringing the Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Oδ1 torsion angle from 60° to 168°. From the conformation in which Asp-293 is hydrogen bonded to Asp-213 and points away from the active site a rotation about the Cα-Cβ bond would be required as well. Notably, in the covalent intermediate, the plane of the Asp-293 carboxylate group is more or less perpendicular to the plane of the covalently bound -1 sugar (Fig. 4C). A superimposition of the structure of the amylomaltase-acarbose complex (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar) with that of the covalent intermediate-4-deoxyglucose complex (Fig. 5) shows that the oligosaccharide in subsite -1 has to move ∼1 Å toward Asp-293 to form the covalent intermediate. In the covalent intermediate, the -1 sugar residue has a low energy 4C1 chair conformation (34International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1980; 53: 1901-1905Google Scholar) as was observed for CGTase (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compared with the +1 sugar in the acarbose complex the 4-deoxyglucose has rotated by an estimated 20° in the plane of its ring (Fig. 5). However, because the axial C1-O1 bond still points in approximately the same direction, this would have few consequences for the continuation of a sugar chain toward the +2 substrate binding subsite and beyond. This rotation of the +1 sugar seems correlated with the perpendicular conformation of the ester bond with respect to the -1 sugar plane. Without this rotation, the +1 sugar would collide with the Asp-293 Oδ2 (see Fig. 5.). Indeed, the perpendicular orientation of the ester bond seems to shield the anomeric C1 carbon atom of the covalent intermediate from attack by a nucleophile, both sterically and through charge-charge repulsion, as the Oδ2 has a partially negative charge. Thus, the perpendicular orientation could contribute to the stabilization of the covalent intermediate. The rotation of the sugar in the +1 site also has consequences for its interaction with the protein, most notably for the interactions with the strictly conserved Gln-256. In the acarbose complex, the +1 sugar contacts Gln-256 only with its O6 hydroxyl group, whereas in the covalent intermediate-4-deoxyglucose complex both the O6 and the O5 are hydrogen bonded to the Gln-256 side chain. Thus, the results show that Gln-256 serves to orient a leaving group (or an incoming acceptor, by microscopic reversibility). Indeed, Kaper et al.4 have found that the Q256N substitution especially decreases the disproportionation activity of amylomaltase with small substrates, which is consistent with a role of Gln-256 in interacting specifically with the +1 monosaccharide. The next structure is the covalent intermediate structure (Fig. 4D) in which the +1 and +2 acceptor sites are empty. In the canonical amylomaltase reaction mechanism, the covalent intermediate would then be attacked by an incoming acceptor molecule through a state as represented by the 4-deoxyglucose-bound structure shown in Fig. 4C. As explained above, Gln-256 binds the incoming acceptor, orienting it for attack on the C1 carbon atom of the covalent intermediate. Possibly, its approach could push Asp-293 out of its “perpendicular” conformation into a conformation with its carboxylate plane more parallel to the -1 sugar ring, perhaps allowing it to bind to the neighboring Arg-291 as in CGTase (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in all of the available structures the acid/base catalyst Glu-340 is hydrogen bonded to the loop containing Asp-293. Thus, as pointed out before, this residue is in a catalytically incompetent conformation as its carboxylate oxygen atoms are >4 Å from the glycosidic oxygen atom that Glu-340 should protonate in the cleavage step (22Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that Glu-340 only assumes its catalytic conformation upon binding of an efficacious acceptor, and this may explain why 4-deoxyglucose, which lacks the oxygen that is to be deprotonated in the deglycosylation step, does not trigger the productive conformation of the Glu-340 side chain. In its incompetent conformation, one of the Glu-340 carboxylate oxygens is at only 3 Å distance from the Asp-293 Oδ2. The proposed conformational change of Asp-293 mentioned above would lead to loss of this interaction, possibly helping Glu-340 to leave its “incompetent” conformation, allowing it to abstract a proton from the 4-OH group of the acceptor. This could be a focal point of further research on glycoside hydrolase 77 enzymes. Ultimately, all this results in the formation of a new glycosidic bond as in Fig. 4B, the acarbose complex. After transglycosylation the newly made sugar chain diffuses away, leaving behind an empty, regenerated active site as in panel A. As an alternative to the formation of a new glycosidic bond, the covalent intermediate may be attacked by a water molecule. However, in the specific case of the Thermus enzyme, water is 5000 times less likely to serve as acceptor than maltotriose 4T. Kaper, J. C. M. Uitdehaag, T. R. M. Barends, B. W. Dijkstra, M .J. E. C. van der Maarel, and L. Dijkhuizen, manuscript in preparation., whereas the covalent intermediates in α-amylases are much more prone to hydrolysis. The covalent intermediate structure presented here provides detailed insight into the cause of the very low hydrolytic activity of amylomaltases. In the canonical mechanism for the hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate in α-amylases, a water molecule activated by the catalytic acid/base attacks the C1 carbon atom of the sugar covalently bound to the nucleophile. In contrast, in amylomaltase, the catalytic acid/base Glu-340 is oriented away from the -1 site such that it is unable to activate a water molecule that could attack the C1 carbon atom of the covalent intermediate. The unproductive positioning of the catalytic base is thus one obvious explanation for the low hydrolysis rate of amylomaltase. Conclusions—The amylomaltase structures clarify the role of the conserved Gln-256 as necessary for the correct orientation of an acceptor residue in the +1 subsite. Furthermore, glycosyl transfer in α-amylase-type enzymes benefits from a stabilized covalent intermediate, because this intermediate must be protected from nucleophiles other than the desired acceptor, such as water. The structures presented here show three ways in which amylomaltase stabilizes its covalent intermediate. First, the covalent intermediate adopts a low energy 4C1 chair conformation, enhancing its stability. This conformation of the covalent intermediate was also observed for the transglycosylases CGTase (15Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and amylosucrase (16Jensen M.H. Mirza O. Albenne C. Remaud-Simeon M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but not for the hydrolytic Family 31 α-glycosidase YicI (17Lovering A.L. Lee S.S. Kim Y.-W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2105-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this latter enzyme, the covalent intermediate has a 1S3 skew boat conformation. This supports the hypothesis put forward by Davies et al. (35Davies G.J. Ducros M.-A.V Varrot A. Zechel D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Numao et al.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48074-48083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that transglycosylases use a low energy 4C1 chair conformation to stabilize their covalent intermediates, whereas in glycosidases the covalent intermediate adopts a more strained conformation, such as a skew boat. Second, the acid/base catalyst is moved out of a productive position in the covalent intermediate structure, precluding it from activating a water molecule, thus protecting the intermediate from hydrolysis. Finally, third, the plane of the ester bond between nucleophile and sugar is perpendicular to the plane of the sugar ring, which could serve to make the C1 atom less accessible to an incoming nucleophile because of steric hindrance and charge repulsion by the partially negative Oδ2. These three means of stabilization may also apply to related transglycosylases from glycoside hydrolase families 13, 70, and 77."

Comm. 2001; 280: 183-186Google Scholar). SRCL binds modified low density lipoproteins through these common domains, but the CRD additionally confers a glycan binding function not found in any other scavenger receptors. Recent studies have revealed that the CRD of human SRCL shows remarkably selective binding to glycans containing the Lewisx trisaccharide Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc, along with weaker binding to the closely related Lewisa trisaccharide Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc (3Coombs P.J.

Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1C-7CCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among receptors containing C-type CRDs, only the selectins show specific binding to such a limited set of sugar structures, primarily sialylated and sulfated derivatives of Lewisx and Lewisa (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The endothelial localization of SRCL and its ability to interact selectively with a sugar epitope that is commonly displayed on adhesion molecules on the surface of various types of leukocytes and tumor cells suggest further parallels with the selectins. For example, recognition of Lewisx-containing glycoproteins on a breast cancer cell line by SRCL suggests that it might mediate interactions between tumor cells and endothelia during metastasis (6Elola M.T. Capurro M.I. Barrio M.M. Coombs P.J. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Mordoh J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2007; 101: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SRCL also shares several characteristics with the dendritic cell surface receptor DC-SIGN, which binds to Lewisx and Lewisa-containing glycans as well as to high mannose oligosaccharides (7Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Like DC-SIGN, SRCL has the ability to serve as a cell adhesion molecule as well as being an endocytic receptor. Despite these parallels, the structure of the CRD of SRCL suggests that it must bind Lewisx in a fundamentally different way from the way that the selectins and DC-SIGN bind such fucosylated ligands. In the CRDs of the latter receptors, the disposition of amino acid residues around the conserved Ca2+ generates a primary binding site that is configured to bind monosaccharides in which the 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups have the stereochemistry found in mannose or fucose (8Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 9Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Selective binding of Lewisx and related structures results from interaction of the terminal fucose with this primary binding site and additional interactions of the other terminal residues, such as galactose and sialic acid, with adjacent secondary binding sites on the surface of the CRD. In contrast, the amino acid sequence around the conserved Ca2+ in SRCL is characteristic of galactose-binding C-type CRDs, and it would not be expected to accommodate fucose. In the present studies, human and mouse SRCL are shown to have a similar narrow binding selectivity for LewisX-containing glycans. The structural basis for such selective binding in a galactose-type CRD has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, the molecular basis for ligand release at endosomal pH, required for endocytic function of the receptor, has been determined. Cloning and Expression of Mouse SRCL—The cDNA coding for mouse SRCL was amplified from a mouse lung cDNA library (Clontech). The portion of the DNA coding for the CRD, from residue 603 to the C terminus, was cloned into the pINII-IompA2 expression vector for expression in Escherichia coli as described for the CRD of human SRCL (3Coombs P.J.

Mutations were introduced into the CRD using synthetic oligonucleotides. DNA coding for the extracellular domain of mouse SRCL, starting at residue 60, was fused to codons specifying the dog pre-proinsulin signal sequence and inserted into the vector pED for expression in DXB11 Chinese hamster ovary cells, as described for human SRCL (3Coombs P.J.

Mouse SRCL extracellular domain and wild type and mutant CRDs were expressed and purified as described for human SRCL (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that in some cases, cell lysis was achieved by passing the washed cell suspension 2-3 times through an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin) at a pressure of 10-15,000 psi. For crystallization, the isolated protein was dialyzed against low salt buffer (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2), applied to an anion exchange column (MonoQ; G.E. Healthcare), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 25 to 1000 mm NaCl. Protein which eluted at ∼180 mm NaCl was exchanged back to the low salt buffer and concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml using a spin concentrator. Analysis of Ligand Binding—Fluorescein-labeled extracellular domain of mouse SRCL prepared as described for human SRCL (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used to probe the glycan array following the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. The specificity of wild-type and mutant CRDs for Lewisx and galactose was determined using a solid-phase binding assay with CRDs immobilized to polystyrene wells (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of the CRD from human SRCL were grown at 21 °C, using the hanging drop method (1 μl of protein to 0.5 μl of reservoir in a drop). The protein solution contained 10 mg/ml protein, 8 mm CaCl2, 8 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Lewisx (V-labs, Inc. and Toronto Research Chemicals). The reservoir solution contained 8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m Zn(CH3COO)2, and 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. Crystals were transferred to synthetic mother liquor consisting of all the salts and buffers that were present in the drop, as well as 10 mm Lewisx and 15% ethylene glycol, for 5 min and were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Crystals used for the low resolution data set of this protein were grown at 21 °C (2 μl of protein to 1 μl of reservoir in a drop). The protein solution contained 13 mg/ml protein, 9 mm CaCl2, 9 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.8, 22.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm Lewisx. The reservoir solution contained 9% polyethylene glycol 8K, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m Zn(CH3COO)2. Crystals were transferred to a fresh reservoir solution containing 5 mm Lewisx and 15% methyl pentane diol and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Crystals of the CRD from mouse SRCL were grown at 21 °C (1 μl of protein to 1 μl of reservoir in a drop). The protein solution contained 6 mg/ml protein, 9 mm CaCl2, 9 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 22.5 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Lewisx. The reservoir solution contained 30% polyethylene glycol 8K, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.5. Crystals were transferred to a solution containing all the salts and buffers that are present in the drop, including 5 mm Lewisx, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data Collection—Diffraction data were measured at 100 K on ADSC Q315 CCD detectors, at the Advanced Light Source beam line 8.2.1 (high and low resolution CRD from human SRCL) and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beam line 11-1 (CRD from mouse SRCL). Data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA (10Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—A lower resolution (2.8 Å) data set was measured for the human CRD. These data scaled with P6 symmetry and gave a molecular replacement solution in space group P65 using the program Amore (11Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), with the CRD of DC-SIGNR, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1k9j, as a search model. The best solution gave a correlation coefficient of 42% and an R value of 49% (resolution range 15-3 Å). A partial model for SRCL CRD was built into the electron density map, and although the electron density maps were unambiguous, refinement did not lower the Rfree below 34%. The original data were incomplete along the 00l axis. However, the high resolution data set showed systematic absences along this axis, with significant intensities only for 00l = 3n. This observation is incompatible with space group P65, implying a lower symmetry trigonal space group (P62 and P64, the only hexagonal space groups consistent with these absences, did not give translation function solutions). Molecular replacement for the higher resolution data set was performed with the program COMO (12Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 782-784Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using the partially refined model from the lower resolution data set as a search model. The best solution had two monomers in space group P32, with a correlation coefficient of 42% and R value of 41% in the resolution range 12-3.5 Å. Maximum likelihood amplitude refinement was performed using the program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar), with bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections applied at all stages. Missing loops were built in gradually, and the resolution was increased to 2.5 Å. After several rounds of positional and isotropic temperature factor refinement alternating with manual model adjustment, most of the residues in the two monomers, designated A and B, could be added to the model. Given the presence of 200 mm ZnCl2 in the crystallization medium, several strong difference electron density peaks were modeled as Zn2+, based on the geometry of surrounding ligands and the fact that their refined temperature factors were comparable in magnitude to the surrounding ligands. The human CRDs showed binding to 5 Zn2+ per monomer, but did not show density for Ca2+ or the Lewisx trisaccharide in the expected binding site. Each monomer is cross-linked to its crystallographic symmetry equivalent copy by a Zn2+ (Fig. 1, A and B): His610 from one monomer A and His641 from a symmetry-related monomer A bind to the same Zn2+, and the same holds for monomer B and its symmetry equivalent. Monomers A and B are related to each other by a -60° rotation and a translation of 1/6 along the z-axis. These two monomers are cross-linked to each other by another Zn2+, with His700 from one monomer and Asp616 and Asp733 from another providing the coordination ligands. The six monomers (three A and three B) in the unit cell are related to each other by a 65 screw axis, to form a hexameric “barrel” that surrounds a large central space (Fig. 1, A and C). Electron density outside of monomers A and B was seen in the center of the hexameric barrel, with four large peaks (>6σ) present in an Fo - Fc map of the asymmetric unit. After fixing monomers A and B, a search for an additional CRD was performed in COMO, using a CRD model with the Zn2+ and some loops removed. The search yielded two equivalent solutions related by a 65 screw axis, but which overlap each other (monomers C and D, Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the four large peaks seen in the Fo - Fc map calculated only with monomers A and B fit two Zn2+ positions for both monomers C and D (Zn2+ number 1 and 2, Fig. 2A). One of the Zn2+ cross-links each monomer with its symmetry-related copy in the same manner observed for monomers A and B (Fig. 1B), supporting the validity of the solution for monomers C and D. A 2-fold rotation axis relates monomers A or B to monomers C or D, causing the filament formed by cross-linking C or D to run in the opposite direction from monomers A and B along the z-axis. Note that although monomers C and D are related by a 65 screw axis, their packing is not compatible with space group P65, as application of a -60° rotation and a 1/6 translation along z to either C or D results in overlap with its symmetry mate. Instead, the crystal has the lower symmetry of P32, with the unit cell containing monomers A, B, and either C or D. Presumably, C and D are randomly distributed through crystal to give a statistical mixture that effectively makes them present at 50% occupancy (Fig. 1). To refine the arrangement of molecules in P32, monomers C and D were treated as alternative conformations each with 50% occupancy, i.e. there are three independent copies in the asymmetric unit. Because C and D overlap, the maps around them are not as clear as for monomers A and B, but it appears that they have loop conformations and Ca2+ in similar positions as in the mouse SRCL CRD (see below). Water molecules were added to peaks >3σ in Fo - Fc maps and were within hydrogen bond distance to monomers A and B or to other water molecules. Because the quality of the maps around monomers C and D is not as high as for monomers A and B, the only water molecules that were added in the vicinity of monomers C and D are ligands bound to the Zn2+ or Ca2+. Temperature factor refinement suggested that in some cases Cl- serves asaZn2+ ligand instead of water. The final human CRD model contains residues 606-734 for all protein monomers, 16 Zn2+, 6 Ca2+, 12 Cl-, and 33 water molecules. Molecular replacement for the mouse SRCL CRD data set, using the program COMO and the partially refined model of the human SRCL CRD as a search model, gave a solution for four monomers in the P1 unit cell. The best solution had a correlation coefficient of 31% and an R value of 43% for the resolution range 12-3.5 Å. The rotation between monomers A and C, and between B and D, is almost 180°, whereas the rotation between the A-C pair and the B-D pair is about 80°. The structure was refined in CNS using a maximum likelihood amplitude target, and bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were applied throughout. Test set reflections for calculating Rfree were chosen in thin shells. Strict non-crystallographic symmetry was initially applied, but was released later in the refinement as some side chains showed different conformations among the four independent copies. These loops were built in gradually and the resolution was increased to 1.95 Å. In each of the four monomers, four Ca2+ and one Lewisx molecule were visible. The final model contains residues 606-735 for monomers A and D, 607-698 and 704-738 for monomer B, 607-737 for monomer C, 16 Ca2+, 4 Lewisx trisaccharides, and 357 water molecules. Glycan Ligands for SRCL—To facilitate structural and functional analysis of SRCL, both the human and mouse proteins were investigated. The sequences of human SRCL and mouse SRCL are 91% identical overall, with no insertions or deletions, indicating that this protein is highly conserved between the two species. Soluble fragments of human SRCL consisting of just the CRD or the whole extracellular domain containing the coiled-coil region, the collagen-like region and the CRD have been characterized previously (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For this study, the equivalent fragments of mouse SRCL were produced. The binding specificity of the human receptor was previously characterized by probing a glycan array consisting of biotinylated oligosaccharides immobilized on streptavidin in polystyrene wells (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For comparison, the trimeric extracellular domain of the mouse receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was tested against a second generation glycan array, in which oligosaccharides are covalently immobilized on a glass surface (14Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Despite the difference in the assay format, the results reveal that, like human SRCL, mouse SRCL is highly specific for Lewisx- and Lewisa-containing oligosaccharides and shows some preference for Lewisx compared with Lewisa (Fig. 3A). The mouse receptor also binds to forms of these ligands in which the 6 position of GlcNAc or glucose is sulfated (glycans 274 and 275), but as expected it does not bind forms in which the 3 position of galactose bears sulfate (glycans 28 and 259-262). Thus, this receptor shows partial similarity in specificity to the selectins, which can also bind sulfated ligands (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The fact that the mouse and human receptors show the same restricted specificity for Lewisx and Lewisa is not surprising given that the amino acid sequences of the CRDs of the two proteins are very similar. The CRD sequences are 86% identical overall and in the region shown to form the sugar binding site in other C-type CRDs there is only one amino acid difference between the mouse and human proteins (Fig. 3B). Recognition of Lewisx by SRCL by a Novel Mechanism—With the goal of elucidating the mechanism of SRCL binding to Lewisx, attempts were made to crystallize the carbohydrate recognition domain of human SRCL with bound ligand. These efforts proved unsuccessful, but parallel studies on the mouse CRD resulted in determination of the structure in the presence of Ca2+ and Lewisx trisaccharide. The crystals contain four independent copies, each of which reveals four Ca2+ and a Lewisx molecule. The CRD adopts the typical long form C-type lectin fold (Fig. 2B), including a third β-strand at the bottom of the domain (β0) and a disulfide bond that connects the loops preceding β0 and β1. As predicted from the amino acid sequence of SRCL, the galactose residue in the Lewisx oligosaccharide interacts with the conserved Ca2+ site in the CRD: the equatorial 3- and axial 4-hydroxyl groups form coordination and hydrogen bonds similar to those seen in other galactose-binding C-type CRDs (Figs. 4 and 5). Carbonyl oxygen atoms from the side chains of Gln694 and Asn718 act as Ca2+ ligands, and the amide groups of these side chains serve as hydrogen bond donors to the 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups of galactose. The side chains of Asp696 and Glu706 also serve as Ca2+ ligands and act as hydrogen bond acceptors from the same sugar hydroxyl groups. Interactions of the apolar face of galactose with an aromatic side chain are a hallmark of galactose-binding lectins (15Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). In this case, both C4 and the exocyclic C6 pack against Trp698.FIGURE 5Comparison of galactose-binding sites in C-type CRDs.

In the secondary site, Lys691 forms hydrogen bonds with the 4-hydroxyl group and the ring oxygen of fucose, and there are van der Waals contacts between the exocyclic methyl group of fucose and Cδ1 of Ile712. Changing Ile712 to valine results in a 3-fold loss in selectivity for Lewisx compared with galactose, confirming the importance of this interaction (Table 2). Mutation of Ile712 to Ala results in a reduction in sugar-binding activity. Although this mutant still bound weakly to galactose-Sepharose so that some protein could be purified, binding to the LNFPIII-BSA reporter ligand was too weak to allow quantification of binding in solid phase assays. In addition to contacting the fucose residue, Ile712 also makes contact with Asn718, so reducing the size of the side chain at position 712 probably allows Asn718 to move out of position, disrupting the primary binding site. In previous studies, a mutant CRD in which Lys691 was changed to alanine still showed preferential binding to Lewisx (3Coombs P.J. Graham S.A. Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22993-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Lys691, hydrogen bonds between the fucose oxygens and water are energetically equivalent to the bonds with the amino group of the lysine residue in the wild-type CRD, probably because of the high solvent accessibility of these hydrogen bonds. Finally, Phe720 appears to play a critical role in organizing both the primary and secondary binding sites as it packs against Ile712 as well as main chain and side chain atoms of residues that form the conserved Ca2+-binding site. Mutation of this residue to alanine results in complete loss of sugar binding activity, as shown by the inability of the mutant to bind to galactose-Sepharose.TABLE 2Mouse SRCL binding to saccharide ligandsMutant CRDK1, Lewisx/K1, galactoseaRelative inhibition constants for galactose and Lewisx were determined in binding competition assays in which the reporter ligand 125I-labeled LNFPIII-BSA was bound to CRDs immobilized in polystyrene wells.KD for LNFPIII-BSAbKD values for LNFPIII-BSA were determined in binding assays in which increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled LNFPIII-BSA and unlabeled LNFPIII-BSA bound to CRDs immobilized in polystyrene wells.μg/mlWild type0.0063 ± 0.00021.24 ± 0.0011712V0.03 ± 0.0013.60 ± 0.30a Relative inhibition constants for galactose and Lewisx were determined in binding competition assays in which the reporter ligand 125I-labeled LNFPIII-BSA was bound to CRDs immobilized in polystyrene wells.b KD values for LNFPIII-BSA were determined in binding assays in which increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled LNFPIII-BSA and unlabeled LNFPIII-BSA bound to CRDs immobilized in polystyrene wells. Open table in a new tab The interaction of SRCL with Lewisx is fundamentally different from the way that DC-SIGN and the selectins bind to related glycans, although the conformation of the Lewisx trisaccharide is similar in the DC-SIGN and SRCL complexes (Fig. 4, A-D). When bound to SRCL, the trisaccharide is oriented with the central GlcNAc residue tipped away from the protein so that the terminal fucose residue contacts the protein in the secondary binding site.

Molecular mechanisms linking inflammation and development of epithelial cancer have only recently been provided by utilization of sophisticated in vivo molecular methodologies, in combination with immune-competent mouse models of multistage carcinogenesis (reviewed in de Visser et al., 2006de Visser K.E. Eichten A. Coussens L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar and Karin, 2006Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). These have revealed the significance of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and its activating IκB kinases (IKKα and β) in cancer progression via their ability to differentially regulate cell survival and production of proinflammatory cytokines. According to Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, as recently reported in Nature, IKKα also promotes metastasis. Using a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer in which the SV40 large T antigen is selectively expressed in prostate epithelium (TRAMP mice), Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar have identified IKKα as a key mediator of the interplay between inflammation and metastasis in prostate cancer. To address the functional significance of IKKα, TRAMP mice were crossed with mice harboring an inactive IKKα (IKKαAA/AA/TRAMP). In these mice both the onset of tumors and mortality were delayed, whereas the histopathology and size of the primary tumor was not changed compared to mice with wild-type IKKα. Instead, IKKαAA/AA/TRAMP mice developed significantly fewer metastases in distant organs. This effect was associated with sustained expression levels of the metastasis suppressor maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor). Maspin was first identified as a putative suppressor of metastasis by virtue of its high level of expression in normal mammary epithelial cells as compared to its greatly reduced or absent expression in malignant cells (reviewed in Sheng, 2004Sheng S. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2733-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Due to its structural homology to serine protease inhibitors (serpins), maspin was initially thought to regulate metastasis via inhibition of serine proteases involved in regulating cell-cell and/or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. However, it was later determined that maspin did not inhibit trypsin-like serine proteases, providing compelling evidence that maspin, unlike other serpins, was not a classical serine protease inhibitor. More recent investigations revealed that maspin regulates metastasis, in part, by altering integrin profiles associated with increased cellular adherence to fibronectin, thus reducing ability of cells to move through fibronectin matrices. Although maspin displays antimetastatic properties during mammary and prostate cancer development, its expression is maintained during ovarian, lung, and pancreatic carcinogenesis, indicating that maspin-regulated metastatic potential is tissue specific. Loss of maspin expression during tumor progression was demonstrated to result, in part, from absent Ets and Ap1 transactivation in combination with epigenetic silencing by methylation (Sato et al., 2004Sato N. Fukushima N. Matsubayashi H. Goggins M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar now provide evidence that prior to silencing by methylation, the maspin promoter is transiently repressed by IKKα, which is phosphorylated in response to RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand) binding to its receptor RANK. Furthermore, this function of IKKα is shown to be independent of NFκB. It remains to be determined if IKKα-mediated repression of maspin expression involves Ets and/or Ap1. RANKL is a membrane-bound protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α family of ligands. Thus, activation of its receptor RANK requires close contact between cells or proteolytic cleavage of the RANKL extracellular domain. Prostate cancer cells are known to express and secrete soluble RANKL (sRANKL) (Zhang et al., 2001Zhang J. Dai J. Qi Y. Lin D.L. Smith P. Strayhorn C. Mizokami A. Fu Z. Westman J. Keller E.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar); RANKL is also expressed by lymphoid and myeloid cells; thus, as immune cells are recruited to sites of neoplastic growth, local levels of RANKL increase. The observations presented by Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar demonstrate that in primary prostate cancers, it is indeed infiltrating T lymphocytes and macrophages that express RANKL. Whether these infiltrating cells express soluble RANKL or how membrane-associated RANKL is activated remain undetermined. The ability of macrophages to promote tumorigenesis has been previously reported using a mouse model of mammary carcinogenesis, in which infiltration of macrophages into premalignant mammary tissue is associated with primary tumor progression (Lin et al., 2006Lin E.Y. Li J.F. Gnatovskiy L. Deng Y. Zhu L. Grzesik D.A. Qian H. Xue X.N. Pollard J.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11238-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar and references therein). Depletion of or failure to recruit macrophages into neoplastic tissue does not significantly alter hallmarks of premalignancy but instead significantly delays development of invasive carcinomas (likely through regulation of angiogenesis) and reduces the formation of pulmonary metastasis (Lin et al., 2006Lin E.Y. Li J.F. Gnatovskiy L. Deng Y. Zhu L. Grzesik D.A. Qian H. Xue X.N. Pollard J.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11238-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This indicates that molecules secreted by tissue macrophages, in addition to enhancing primary tumor development via pro-angiogenic mechanisms, also mediate metastatic progression of mammary tumors. Studies by Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar now provide a new mechanism for the promotion of metastasis in which recruited macrophages secrete the proinflammatory cytokine RANKL. This binds RANK and leads to the phosphorylation of IKKα to induce repression of maspin in malignant epithelial cells, therefore enhancing their metastasis (Figure 1). Interestingly, IKKβ does not possess similar ability to promote metastasis in prostate cancer. This is surprising given that it confers survival signals to enterocytes enabling them to evade apoptotic elimination. IKKβ also induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines by myeloid cells that act as paracrine growth factors for the premalignant enterocytes (reviewed in Karin, 2006Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports highlight the significance of IKK family members as important regulators of not only cancer initiation and promotion but now also metastasis and offer insights into potential new therapeutic targets for treatment of metastatic disease, namely RANKL/RANK, IKKα, and maspin. Maspin is an intriguing candidate for new therapies. Indeed, demethylation of the maspin promoter enabling maspin re-expression in malignant cells could represent a viable approach to inhibit metastasis of malignant prostatic epithelial cells and/or stabilize primary disease. Reactivation of maspin expression could be achieved by use of DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase, including specific DNA methyltransferase hairpin antagonists. Alternatively, because these agents lack specificity, RANKL/RANK or IKKα antagonists could prove useful as they might not only diminish prostate cancer metastasis but would also reduce the bone-degrading activity of metastatic prostate cancer cells that is associated with RANKL signaling. It is interesting to speculate that the efficacy of pyrophosphate analogs, such as bisphosphonates, known to reduce osteolysis associated with prostate cancer (Clezardin et al., 2005Clezardin P. Ebetino F.H. Fournier P.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4971-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), may be due in part to regulating RANKL/RANK, IKKα, or maspin bioactivity in malignant tumor cells and/or in infiltrating immune cells. Thus, taken together, identification of this important new pathway by Luo et al., 2007Luo J.-L. Tan W. Ricono J.M. Korchynskyi O. Zhang M. Gonias S.L. Cheresh D.A. Karin M. Nature. 2007; (Published online March 18, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05656Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar offers insight into how immune cells affect metastasis and reveals several new potential targets for anticancer therapy."

The high-resolution structures of both proteins have been determined in their resting states; however, the mechanism that couples ATP hydrolysis to active transport of substrate proteins through the membrane is not well understood. An analysis of the steady-state ATPase activity of the enzyme reveals that there is an allosteric binding site for magnesium distinct from that associated with hydrolysis of ATP. We have demonstrated that this regulation involves a large conformational change to the SecA dimer, which exerts a strong influence on the turnover and affinity for ATP, as well as the affinity for ADP. The strong inhibitory influence of magnesium on the ATPase activity can be countered by cardiolipin and conditions that promote protein translocation.

Chemo-mechanical protein machines have evolved to couple energy derived from chemical reactions to mechanical motion. They have been exploited to drive a number of processes that are central to cell biology, such as protein translocation. Membrane and secretory proteins are targeted to specific membranes before they pass through or into the bilayer. A ubiquitous protein channel is found in the plasma membrane of archaea and bacteria, and also in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. Co-translational and post-translational targeting systems converge on the Sec complex whereupon the unfolded protein substrate is driven through the membrane (1Matlack K.E. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The structure of the protein channel has been determined in its resting state to high resolution (2van den Berg L. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A.

In bacteria, post-translational translocation of secretory proteins requires that they are maintained in an unfolded conformation, before they are passed on to a soluble ATPase SecA (8Hartl F. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Upon receiving the substrate, SecA associates with the protein-conducting channel, the SecYEG complex, where it harnesses the energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to actively push it across the membrane (9Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed for a multistep reaction for the transport of proteins across the membrane (12Economou A. Pogliano J. Beckwith J. Oliver D. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), regulated by distinct ATP binding and hydrolysis events, translocating ∼25 amino acids (2.5 kDa) in each step (13van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, another study estimates that 5 ATP molecules are required to send each amino acid across the membrane (14Tomkiewicz D. Nouwen N. van Leeuwen R. Tans S. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15709-15713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unliganded SecA exists in solution in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (15Ding H. Hunt J.F. Mukerji I. Oliver D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8729-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and is predominantly dimeric (16Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the precise oligomeric state of SecA that binds to the protein channel and drives the translocation reaction has formed the subject of conflicting accounts. Several studies reported that a dimer with two active subunits was required for active translocation (17Driessen A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in support, a later study demonstrated that covalently cross-linked dimers were able to sustain ATP hydrolysis and protein translocation (18de Keyzer J. van der Sluis E.O.

Other investigators showed that acidic phospholipids, detergent, signal peptide, and SecYEG apparently bring about a dissociation of the dimer (20Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Following on from this, a mutant of SecA (Δ11/N95) was constructed with truncations to the N and C termini (Δ2–11 and Δ832–901), which was shown not to form inter-subunit cross-links, and to sediment through sucrose cushions as if it were a monomer (21Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An analysis of complexes formed between SecYEG and SecA by analytical ultracentrifugation showed that in the absence of nucleotide one SecA bound to the channel, whereas two bound in the presence of the ATP analogue AMPPNP 2The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)-triphosphate; C12E9, polyoxyethylene(9)dodecyl ether; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 2The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)-triphosphate; C12E9, polyoxyethylene(9)dodecyl ether; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

Several different structures of SecA have now been determined, five dimers (22Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J.

Tahirov T.H. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These differences obviously add further confusion to our picture of the nature of the oligomeric state and the conformation of the active form of the protein. The monomer structure, and subsequently the latest dimer were found to exhibit a large domain movement, exposing a cleft that has been proposed to form a polypeptide binding site (26Papanikolau Y. Papadovasilaki M. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A.A. Cusack S. Economou A. Petratos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M.

Interestingly, the conformation of the nucleotide binding fold does not seem to be affected by the presence of bound nucleotide (22Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 23Sharma V. Arockiasamy A. Ronning D.R. Savva C.G. Holzenburg A. Braunstein M. Jacobs Jr., W.R.

A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of SecA has to be regulated in some fashion, to prevent futile hydrolysis of ATP during moments of rest. The basal ATPase activity of SecA is partially increased by the presence of acidic phospholipids and then fully stimulated by addition of vesicles containing SecYEG and precursor protein (28Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 29Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21692-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this regulation is not clear. There have been several observations with respect to magnesium and its effects on the regulation of SecA, which have not been adequately explained. Removal of the cation from a binding site, distinct from the nucleotide binding folds, can result in a 10-fold stimulation of ADP release (30Fak J.J. Itkin A. Ciobanu D.D. Lin E.C. Song X.J. Chou Y.T. Gierasch L.M. Hunt J.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7307-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The activity of SecA and the elevated activity found in a complex of SecA and SecYEG were both stimulated by the removal of Mg2+, which also served to stabilize the latter complex in the presence of ATP (or ATPγS) (5Duong F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mg2+ has also been shown to modulate fluorescence anisotropy measurements, as well as the fluorescence observed from intrinsic and extrinsic probes of the enzyme (27Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M.

Despite the fact that the structures of both SecA and SecYEG have been determined, we are still a long way from understanding their concerted mechanism of action. To reach this point, we need to understand the nature and timing of the conformational changes within SecA, and how they are affected by the ATPase cycle. In the light of the conflicting and fragmented accounts of the reaction cycle, we decided to conduct a thorough analysis of the kinetics of the protein translocation process. As a first approach to this characterization we have performed a steady-state analysis of SecA in isolation, together with a study of its oligomeric state by equilibrium and velocity sedimentation using analytical centrifugation. An analysis of the wild-type and proposed monomeric mutant SecA-Δ11/N95 (21Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in this way generated some new findings on the oligomeric state of SecA, its ATPase activity, and the influence of magnesium and lipids. Chemicals and Biochemicals—Escherichia coli polar lipid and E. coli cardiolipin were purchased from Avanti, and were prepared at 10 mg/ml in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl. Polyoxyethylene(9)dodecyl ether (C12E9) was purchased from Anatrace, the EnzChek™ kit from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen), Chelating Sepharose fast flow from GE Healthcare, and all other reagents from Sigma. Overexpression and Purification of SecA and SecA-Δ11/N95—Wild-type SecA was derived from plasmid pT7SecA2 (20Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T.A.

They were expressed in E. coli host cells BL21.19(λDE3) grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 0.8). After 1.5 h of induction the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and ruptured using a cell disruptor (Constant Cell Disruption Systems, Daventry, UK). Membranes and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). Supernatants were applied to a Ni2+-Sepharose column (Chelating Sepharose fast flow), washed in the same buffer with 25 mm imidazole and eluted in 300 mm. Proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q HR 10/10, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR 26/60, GE Healthcare). Purified concentrated protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at –80 °C. ATPase Assays—Steady-state ATPase assays were carried out and monitored at 25 °C, either by the linked pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay, or by using the EnzChek™ Kit (Invitrogen), employing a Lambda 25 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay was used to measure extremely slow turnover accurately by virtue of a regenerating system, and the EnzChek™ kit to investigate the effects of Mg2+, where the former would be inappropriate due to the dependence of pyruvate kinase on this cation. Pyruvate Kinase/Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay—Standard assay components were 1000 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 700 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH in TKM buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2). 0.3 μm SecA or SecA-Δ11/N95 (monomer concentration) was used in each reaction, and the assays were initiated by addition of ATP. EnzChek™ Assay—The standard assay components were 0.2 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside and 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase in TK buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl). 0.3 μm SecA or SecA-Δ11/N95 was used (monomer concentration) in each reaction, and ADP, Mg2+, and E. coli lipids were added to the concentrations indicated in the text, prior to the initiation of the reaction by addition of ATP. Determination of Residual Magnesium Concentration—The amount of Mg2+ contained within the standard assay conditions (TK buffer) was calculated using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, using a Jobin Yvon Horiba Ultima 2 sequential spectrometer fitted with a Bergener Mira Mist Nebulizer and automated with a Jobin Yvon AS421 auto-sampler. Curve fitting and analysis for all kinetic data, including that of the global fits is shown under supplemental materials. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—SecA stock solutions of wild-type and SecA-Δ11/N95 were dialyzed extensively against either TK or TKM buffers. These were subjected to sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments using either an XL-A or XL-I centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with standard Epon centerpieces and an An-60Ti rotor. SecA or SecA-Δ11/N95 (0.4–13 μm) were used and scans were recorded at either 230 or 280 nm. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 25 °C and 130,000 × g. The scans were fitted to a continuous c(s) model, using Ultrascan (34Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. A Comprehensive Data Analysis Software Package for Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, United Kingdom2005: 210-229Google Scholar). The data were then extrapolated to zero concentration to yield s20,w0. Equilibrium scans were taken at 16 and 20 h, at speeds of 3,000, 5,800, and 8,000 × g at 25 °C. The data were analyzed using a variety of models, the data shown are that of a 1-component ideal species model, which yielded the most appropriate fit using Ultrascan (34Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. A Comprehensive Data Analysis Software Package for Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, United Kingdom2005: 210-229Google Scholar). The data were then subjected to a Monte Carlo analysis, to reveal the statistical values for all parameters. In Vitro Translocation Assays—SecYEG was reconstituted into E. coli polar lipid proteoliposomes as described previously (35Collinson I. Breyton C. Duong F. Tziatzios C. Schubert D. Or E. Rapoport T.A. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Translocation of proOmpA into SecYEG proteoliposomes was assayed essentially as described (36van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that protease-protected proOmpA was detected by Western blot using an antibody raised against proOmpA. SecA Activity Is Affected Dramatically by Magnesium Acting at a Location Distinct from the Hydrolytic Site—Steady-state ATPase assays were used in a range of conditions to characterize the kinetics of ATP turnover by both wild-type SecA and the proposed monomeric mutant SecA-Δ11/N95 (21Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In 2 mm Mg2+, ATP binding is tight and substrate turnover is slow (Fig. 1A, Table 1). However, when no Mg2+ was included in the buffer (thus in the presence of only residual magnesium), the behavior of SecA is dramatically altered, the affinity for ATP being weakened by ∼150 fold, and the turnover increased by a factor of 30 (Fig. 1B, Table 1); both wild-type and the SecA-Δ11/N95 behave essentially in an identical manner.TABLE 1Calculated values of the Km[ATP] and Vmax for wild-type SecA and SecA-Δ11/N95 with and without added 2 mm Mg2+Km[ATP] + Mg2+Vmax + Mg2+Km[ATP] - Mg2+Vmax - Mg2+μmmol ATP hydrolyzed mol sA-1 min-1μmmol ATP hydrolyzed mol sA-1 min-1SecA0.32 ± 0.030.56 ± 0.0150.8 ± 3.222.36 ± 0.28SecA — Δ11/N950.40 ± 0.030.96 + 0.0247.7 ± 3.730.16 ± 0.47 Open table in a new tab The residual magnesium concentration in the assay buffer was calculated using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy to be 1 μm, ∼3 times greater than the SecA concentration in the experiment (0.3 μm). Unsurprisingly, addition of EDTA to the reaction inhibited the activity completely (data not shown). Characteristic of all ATPases, SecA uses Mg2+ as a cofactor coordinating the γ-phosphate of ATP required for hydrolysis. Accordingly, the apparent inhibitory effect of Mg2+ was examined in more detail and it was shown to be relatively unaffected by a 10-fold increase in the concentration of ATP (Fig. 2, Table 2). The affinity of Mg2+ for ATP is relatively high (Kd-[Mg2+-ATP] = 20 μm) (37Pecoraro V.L. Hermes J.D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5262-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), therefore the fact that the inhibition is not strongly coupled to the concentration of ATP indicates that the inhibition occurs via Mg2+, and not by Mg2+-ATP. In other words, it is acting at a location distinct from the nucleotide binding site and the effect is allosteric. Moreover, it can be deduced that Mg2+-ATP is not the substrate for SecA, as the Mg2+ required for catalysis must be always bound at the NBD, as hydrolysis can occur when ATP is in great excess over Mg2+ (1 mm ATP to 1 μm Mg2+, Fig. 1B). The actual binding affinity for Mg2+ at this second allosteric site must be much higher than the affinity Mg2+ has for ATP, given the fact that it remains inhibitory when ATP is more than 500 times in excess (Fig. 1B).TABLE 2Calculated values for the apparent Ki(app)[Mg2+] of the ATPase reaction in the presence of 1 mm and 100 μm ATPKi(app)[Mg2+, 1 mm ATP]Ki(app)[Mg2+, 100 μm ATP]μmSecA5.8 ± 0.942.97 ± 0.22 Open table in a new tab The data were fitted according to a global fit, which incorporates a matrix of Mg2+ and ATP concentrations and the respective steady state rate kinetics (Fig. 2B and supplemental materials). This procedure made an adjustment for the chelating effect of ATP on Mg2+ and also incorporated the data for both weak and tight binding of ATP with residual and 2 mm Mg2+, respectively. The fit matched the data well, and a simple model has been proposed to explain the allosteric influence of Mg2+ on the reaction cycle of SecA (Fig. 3). The Competitive Inhibition of SecA by ADP Is Affected by Magnesium—The effects of product inhibition were studied both in the presence and absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4 and Table 3). ADP exhibited a classic competitive inhibition effect with residual Mg2+; there was a 10-fold increase in Ki(app) at a 10-fold higher ATP concentration (Table 3). The affinity of SecA for ADP, given by Kd[ADP], was calculated at different concentrations of ATP and Mg2+, taking into account the increased affinity for ATP at the higher Mg2+ concentration (see supplemental materials and Table 3). As with affinity of SecA for ATP, in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ the affinity for ADP was greatly increased, by ∼200-fold (Tables 1 and 3).TABLE 3Calculated values for the Ki(app)[ADP] determined with different concentrations of Mg2+ and ATPKi(app)[ADP]Kd[ADP]mmμm-Mg2+, 1 mm ATP0.54 ± 0.0626.25 ± 3.09-Mg2+, 100 μm ATP0.051 ± 0.00717.08 ± 2.21+Mg2+, 100 μm ATP0.023 ± 0.0010.1 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab The Inhibitory Effect of Magnesium Can Be Alleviated by Cardiolipin—Preliminary experiments indicated that cardiolipin binds to SecYEG and stabilizes the dimeric conformation, which is proposed to be the active form. 3F. Duong and I. Collinson, unpublished results. Cardiolipin is also known to be a chelator of divalent cations (38Brenza J.M. Neagle C.E. Sokolove P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 4291-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, acidic phospholipids have been shown to be important for protein translocation (39Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the influence of cardiolipin on protein translocation might be an indirect effect mediated by Mg2+, and decided to determine the effect of cardiolipin on SecA activity. The experiment was conducted with and without added 2 mm Mg2+; the detergent C12E9 was used to solubilize the lipid, and was shown to change neither the affinity of SecA for ATP nor the turnover rate (Table 4). In low concentrations of Mg2+, cardiolipin was found to inhibit the ATPase activity (Fig. 5A), presumably due to chelation of the Mg2+ required for the hydrolysis of ATP. At higher concentrations of Mg2+ (100 μm) there was a striking increase in activity peaking at ∼2.4 μm cardiolipin, followed by a gradual reduction (Fig. 5A), indicating that the effect cannot be simply explained by the chelation of Mg2+. The effects of increasing cardiolipin in a yet higher concentration of Mg2+ resulted in a less pronounced rise and fall of ATPase activity. The inhibitory phase of cardiolipin in the presence of added Mg2+ may have been the result of the aggregation of SecA-lipid complexes, because it cannot be the result of Mg2+ chelation at this high a concentration.TABLE 4Calculated values of the Km[ATP] for wild-type SecA in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and 36 μm solubilized cardiolipin, and C12E9 (control)Km[ATP]Vmaxμmmol ATP hydrolyzed mol sA-1 min-1+Mg2+0.32 ± 0.030.56 ± 0.01-Mg2+50.8 ± 3.222.36 ± 0.28+Mg2+; 36 μm cardiolpin10.4 ± 1.011.33 ± 0.26-Mg2+; +0.64% C12E9 (control)61.3 ± 6.418.07 ± 0.40 Open table in a new tab Next, we determined the Km value for ATP binding with high (2 mm) Mg2+ and high (36 μm) cardiolipin (asterisk in Fig. 5, A and B, and Table 4); both the Km and Vmax were characteristic of conditions having only a low concentration of Mg2+. Therefore, we can infer from this data that cardiolipin counteracts the inhibition caused by Mg2+. Total E. coli polar lipids had a less dramatic effect (Fig. 5C). An ∼10-fold higher concentration was required to reach an equivalent enhancement. Therefore, we assumed that this was a result of the cardiolipin (9.8%, w/w) contained in this fraction. Magnesium Alters the Conformation of the SecA Dimer, but Not the Oligomeric State—To determine whether the observed change in activity was affected by a change in the oligomeric state of SecA, sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out by analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation equilibrium revealed unambiguously that SecA is a dimer within a 0.4–13 μm concentration range in equivalent buffers to those used in the ATPase assays (Fig. 6 and Table 5), and also in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (data not shown). Rather surprisingly, SecA-Δ11/N95, previously reported to be a monomer (21Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was found to be a dimer as well. In both cases, the monomers were in such rarity that they could not be detected with sufficient accuracy to determine a dissociation constant, an indication that this value must therefore be in the low nanomolar range.TABLE 5Molecular weight determined by equilibrium velocity centrifugation for wild-type SecA and SecA-Δ11/N95 with and without added 2 mm Mg2+Molecular mass (kDa)Oligomeric state+Mg2+-Mg2++Mg2+-Mg2+SecA (102 kDa)200.1 ± 7.1201.6 ± 6.4DimerDimerSecA-Δ11/N95 (94 kDa)184.6 ± 7.1181.5 ± 8.3DimerDimer Open table in a new tab Subsequently, sedimentation velocity also revealed that there is essentially only a dimeric species present (Fig. 7 and Table 6). However, it could be shown for SecA and SecA-Δ11/N95 that the sedimentation properties, and hence shape, were sensitive to Mg2+.

Moreover, FoxP3 has been demonstrated to occupy the IL-2 promoter to inhibit gene expression by altering histone acetylation levels, thus changing the chromatin structure (38.Chen C. Rowell E.A. Thomas R.M. Hancock W.W. Wells A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36828-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, FoxP3 has been reported to inhibit NFκB activity in transfected 293 cells or T cells (39.Bettelli E. Dastrange M. Oukka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5138-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 40.Grant C. Oh U. Fugo K. Takenouchi N. Griffith C. Yao K. Newhook T.E. Ratner L. Jacobson S. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, others have failed to show such inhibitory effect in human T cells (37.Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M.

Both NFAT and NFκB are also involved in regulating HIV-1 gene expression (41.Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although NFκB activates HIV-1 LTR, the effect of NFAT on LTR is controversial. NFATc1 is reported to up-regulate HIV-1 gene expression by binding to the overlapping NFκB sites (41.Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and NFATc2 has also been shown to up-regulate HIV-1 replication in primary CD4 T cells (42.Cron R.Q. Bartz S.R. Clausell A. Bort S.J. Klebanoff S.J. Lewis D.B. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 94: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In other reports, however, NFATc2 is shown to competitively bind to the LTR NFκB sites and inhibit LTR activity (43.Giffin M.J. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. von Koenig K.D. Hardin J. Chen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44.Macian F. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Given that FoxP3 inhibits T-cell activation and expression of cytokines such as IL-2 via inhibiting NFAT and NFκB, one surprising recent finding reports that Treg cells support higher levels of infection by HIV-1 or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) compared with FoxP3-CD4+ T cells in vitro (13.Oswald-Richter K. Grill S.M. Shariat N. Leelawong M. Sundrud M.S. Haas D.W. Unutmaz D. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E198Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 45.Joshi A. Garg H. Tompkins M.B. Tompkins W.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence have also indicated that HIV-1 infection and replication in Treg cells may be important in vivo. First, recent reports have documented that, although <5% of total CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood are CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells, up to 50% of CD4+ T cells express FoxP3 in mucosal lymphoid organs from HIV-1 (46.Nilsson J. Boasso A. Velilla P.A. Zhang R. Vaccari M. Franchini G. Shearer G.M. Andersson J. Chougnet C. Blood. 2006; 108: 3808-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or SIV (36.Estes J.D. Li Q. Reynolds M.R. Wietgrefe S. Duan L. Schacker T. Picker L.J. Watkins D.I. Lifson J.D. Reilly C. Carlis J. Haase A.T. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) infected human or monkeys, respectively. Therefore, the FoxP3+ Treg cells can provide a significant number of target cells for HIV-1 infection in lymphoid organs. Remarkably, 13% of the FoxP3+ T cells are shown to be productively infected by SIV in the lymphoid organs of acutely infected animals (36.Estes J.D. Li Q. Reynolds M.R. Wietgrefe S. Duan L. Schacker T. Picker L.J. Watkins D.I. Lifson J.D. Reilly C. Carlis J. Haase A.T. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, FoxP3+ Treg cells are important target cells for HIV-1 infection and replication, at least in mucosal lymphoid tissues during acute infection. Treg induction in HIV-1-infected lymphoid organs may contribute to suppressed anti-HIV immunity and establishment of persistent HIV infection. It is therefore critical to investigate how HIV-1 infects and replicates in these T cells for both virological and immunopathogenic reasons.Here we report that FoxP3 enhances HIV-1 LTR but inhibits IL-2 promoter activity. This FoxP3 activity requires both the N- and C-terminal domains and maps to the N terminus (including the proline-rich region) and the C-terminal Forkhead domain and is inactivated by human IPEX mutations. We also demonstrate that FoxP3 enhances HIV-1 LTR via specific NFκB binding sequences in an NFκB-dependent fashion. FoxP3 also enhances a minimal promoter with the NFκB sequences derived from LTR but not from the MHC promoter in Jurkat cells but represses both the HIV-1 LTR and MHC promoter in 293T cells. Interestingly, FoxP3 reduces the acetylation level of the IL-2 promoter but increases acetylation of HIV-1 LTR. Furthermore, FoxP3 enhances NFκB occupancy at HIV-1 promoter in T cells but does not alter NFκB nuclear translocation or levels. The data suggest that FoxP3 modulates gene expression in a promoter sequence-dependent fashion by modulating chromatin structure and NFκB activity. HIV-1 LTR has evolved to both highjack the T-cell activation pathway for expression and to resist FoxP3-mediated suppression of T-cell activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Antibodies, and Cell Lines−FoxP3 was cloned into the HSPG retrovirus vector (47.Coffield V.M. Jiang Q. Su L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LTR linker scanning mutants (48.Zeichner S.L. Kim J.Y. Alwine J.C. J.

Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) were previously reported. Mis-sense mutations identified from IPEX patients (8.Ziegler S.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) (I363V, F371C, A384T, and R397W) were introduced in the FoxP3 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Deletion mutants in FoxP3 were generated by PCR amplification to specifically remove the N terminus (aa 1–189) as in FoxP3-ZFLZFKH, the N terminus, including the zinc finger (aa 1–241) as in FoxP3-LZFKH, or the N terminus, including all domains except Forkhead (aa 333–429) as in FoxP3-FKH. MHC-3XκB-luc and IκB-SR plasmids were provided by A. Baldwin (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and primary human T cells were maintained in Iscove's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. For T-cell activation, mouse anti-CD3 and -CD28 (BD Biosciences) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag) antibodies were used. To determine T-cell purity, anti-human CD25-PE (Miltenyi) and CD4-FITC (BD Biosciences) were used. 7AAD (7-actinomycin D) (Molecular Probes) was used to determine cell viability.Retrovirus Production and Transduction−293T cells were co-transfected with retroviral vector-, VSV-G-, and gag/pol-containing plasmids as previously described (47.Coffield V.M. Jiang Q. Su L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For production of single cycle HIV-Luc reporter virus, 293T cells were transfected with VSV-G and HIV-Luc plasmids by Effectene (Qiagen). For retroviral transduction, Jurkat cells were spin-inoculated with HSPG control or FoxP3 retrovirus to >95% efficiency as measured by GFP expression (47.Coffield V.M. Jiang Q. Su L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and T-cell Purification and Transfection−CD4+ primary T cells were purified from Ficoll-separated PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) by MACS human CD4+ T-cell isolation kit (>95% purity, Miltenyi-Biotech, Auburn, CA). CD4+ T cells were activated by anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody cross-linked by plate-bound anti-mouse IgG as previously described (49.Kovalev G.I. Franklin D.S. Coffield V.M. Xiong Y. Su L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3285-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified cells are stained with anti-CD3 (0.5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) and incubated on plated-bound goat anti-mouse IgG. Purified primary CD4+ T cells were transfected by using the Amaxa nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 5 × 106 unstimulated CD4+ T cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA (>40% efficiency by GFP expression), and cultured for 48 h before infection with the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-luciferase reporter virus and activation by CD3 and CD28 cross-linked with plate-bound IgG. Cells were activated for 48 h, and luciferase was measure by luciferase assay. Alternatively, T cells were transduced with vector or FoxP3 retrovirus (>60% efficiency by GFP) and infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-luciferase virus.IL-2 Measurement by Real-time qPCR and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay−Amaxa-transfected primary CD4+ T cells were sorted for GFP expression and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 as above. IL-2 mRNA levels were determined following activation. 5 × 103 cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and column-purified (RNeasy, Qiagen). cDNA was generated using Cells-to-cDNA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan IL-2 probe/primer set (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was normalized to 18 s. To measure IL-2 production in Jurkat T cells, transduced Jurkat cells were stimulated with PHA (phytohemagglutinin) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 12 h (41.Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and supernatants were collected. Secreted IL-2 was quantitated by the Human IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BD Biosciences).Transfection of Jurkat T Cells and Luciferase Assay−Jurkat cells were transfected using Geneporter transfection reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA), and transfection efficiency was monitored by GFP expression or co-transfection with pAX-βgal reporter plasmid. Cells were lysed, and luciferase expression was determined by Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Experiments were done in triplicates and repeated at least three times.ChIP Assays−Jurkat T cells with a stably integrated HIV-1 LTR were transduced with control or FoxP3-expressing vectors. Sonicated chromatin from the Jurkat cells was immunoprecipitated with control IgG (IgG) or p65 (a kind gift from Al Baldwin) or anti-AcH3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit per the manufacturer's instruction (Upstate, Millipore). Samples were purified and subject to real-time qPCR analysis. The relative p65 binding or acetylation of IL-2 or LTR promoter is expressed with ratios of ChIP-specific signal divided by signals from control 10% input chromatins. IL-2 promoter was analyzed with TaqMan reagents using the following primers: 5′-cac cta agt gtg tgg gct aat gta ac-3′ and 5′-ctg atg act ctt tgg aat ttc ttt aaa cc-3′ and a FAM:TAM probe 5′-aga ggg att tca cct aca tcc att cag tca gtc-3′. This amplicon spans –226 to –133 in the human IL-2 promoter and spans the NFκB and AP-1 sites. HIV-1 LTR was analyzed with SYBR Green reagents (Abgene, UK) using the primers (5′-agc cct cag atc ctg cat ata agc a-3′ and 5′-gtt agc ca gaga gct ccc agg ctc a-3′) that yield an amplicon spanning –44 to +49.EMSA−Standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed (50.Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Briefly, probes containing the NFκB site (GGGATTCCCC) from the MHC gene or HIV-1 LTR were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow. 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with probe. For antibody supershift or blocking, 2 μg of α-p65, α-p50, or control IgG were added to nuclear extract and labeled probe.Western Blot−1 × 106 Jurkat T cells were lysed in 0.5% Non-idet P-40 lysis buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Approximately 25 μg of proteins was used, and FoxP3 was probed with an anti-FoxP3 antiserum (51.Jiang Q. Su H. Knudsen G. Helms W. Su L. BMC Immunol. 2006; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), α-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Statistical Analysis−For statistical analysis, a two-tailed Student t test is employed where p < 0.05 is considered significant.RESULTSFoxP3 Differentially Modulates IL-2 and HIV-1 Gene Expression by Inhibiting IL-2 but Enhancing LTR Promoter Activity−To investigate the mechanism of HIV-1 replication in FoxP3+ T cells, we expressed FoxP3 in the human CD4+ T leukemia (Jurkat) cells. When Jurkat cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 containing luciferase reporter gene, elevated levels of HIV-1 gene expression were detected in both unstimulated and stimulated FoxP3+ T cells (5- to 8-fold, Fig. 1A). Retrovirus-mediated expression of FoxP3 in Jurkat cells inhibited the expression of IL-2 upon activation (>6-fold, Fig. 1B). To determine if FoxP3 similarly regulates expression of IL-2 and HIV-1 in primary CD4+ T cells, we expressed FoxP3 in purified primary CD4+ T cells. HIV-1 gene expression was significantly enhanced in Th cells previously transduced with FoxP3-expressing retroviral vector (Fig. 1C) or by Amaxa nucleofection (data not shown). In contrast, ectopic expression of FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells efficiently suppressed expression from the endogenous IL-2 gene (Fig. 1D). Thus, FoxP3 inhibits IL-2 expression but enhances HIV-1 gene expression in human T cells.To determine if FoxP3 regulates expression of IL-2 and HIV-1 at the promoter level, we transfected IL-2 or HIV-1 LTR promoter constructs driving the luciferase gene into Jurkat T cells. Similar to NL4-luciferase virus infection, FoxP3 also enhanced gene expression from HIV-LTR (Fig. 2A). FoxP3 efficiently suppressed IL-2 gene expression from both the endogenous IL-2 gene (Fig. 1, B and D) and from the transfected IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2B). The HIV-1 LTR co-transfection experiment was performed in the absence of Tat. Therefore, HIV-1 Tat is not required for the FoxP3 activity.FIGURE 2FoxP3 inhibits IL-2 promoter but enhances HIV-1 LTR expression in T cells. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with HIV-1 LTR (A) or IL-2 promoter (B) driven luciferase constructs in the presence of control vector or FoxP3 plasmid. For IL2-luciferase assay, Jurkat cell were non-activated or activated with PMA and ionomycin at 36 h post-transfection. Luciferase gene expression relative to vector control cells was measured at 48 h post-infection. Data represents >5 independent experiments done in triplicates (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Forkhead Domain and N Terminus of FoxP3 Are Critical for FoxP3-mediated Enhancement of HIV-1 LTR−The Forkhead domain and distinct residues in FoxP3 are critical for FoxP3 function as indicated by mutations in the scurfy mouse and in human IPEX patients (8.Ziegler S.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). To define the FoxP3 domains that contribute to this LTR-enhancing activity, we generated FoxP3 deletion mutants and transduced Jurkat T cells. Loss of the N terminus, including the proline-rich region, inhibited FoxP3 enhancement (Fig. 3A), whereas expression of the N terminus alone was not able to enhance LTR activity (data not shown). We also tested the known mis-sense mutations derived from IPEX patients by single site-directed mutagenesis introduction into full-length FoxP3. Interestingly, all four such mis-sense mutations tested also inactivated the FoxP3 activity in enhancing HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 3B). Similar levels of the mutant FoxP3 proteins were expressed (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, the FoxP3 activity in enhancing HIV-1 LTR depends on both the N-terminal domain and critical residues in the forkhead domain, which are also critical for the function of the FoxP3 protein in humans.FIGURE 3A critical activity of FoxP3 is required for LTR enhancement. A, deletion mutants of FoxP3 were made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Jurkat cells transduced with retrovirus containing no insert control (PG), wild type FoxP3 (FP3), FoxP3 C terminus (FP3C, aa 191–420), FoxP3 lacking the N terminus and zinc finger (FP3LZFKH, aa 241–420), or the Forkhead domain of FoxP3 (FP3-FKH, aa 333–420) were infected with the VSV-G NL4-Luciferase virus, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-infection. Proline-rich region (PRR), zinc finger (ZF), leucine zipper (LZ), and Forkhead domain (FKH) are labeled. B, FoxP3 genes with indicated IPEX mis-sense mutations are co-transfected into Jurkat cells with HIV-1 LTR-luciferase (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two NFκB Sites in the LTR Enhancer Core Are Both Required for FoxP3 Enhancement−We have mapped the cis-acting elements in HIV-1 LTR that respond to FoxP3 by employing the 26 linker scanning mutants (LS1–LS26) of HIV-1 LTR (48.Zeichner S.L. Kim J.Y. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2436-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2022814087,"The loss of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 infections is hypothesized to be caused by apoptosis of bystander cells mediated by cell surface-expressed HIV-1 Env glycoprotein. However, the mechanism by which Env mediates this process remains controversial. Specifically, the role of HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4 and CXCR4 versus the fusion process mediated by gp41 remains unresolved. Env-induced apoptosis in bystander cells has been shown to be gp41-dependent and correlates with the redistribution of membrane lipids between Env-expressing cells and target cells (hemifusion). Using a rational mutagenesis approach aimed at targeting Env function via the gp41 subunit, we examined the role of HIV gp41 in bystander apoptosis. A mutation in the fusion domain of gp41 (V513E) resulted in a fusion-defective Env that failed to induce apoptosis. A mutation in the gp41 N-terminal helix (G547D) reduced cell fusion capacity and apoptosis; conversely, an Env mutant with a deletion of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (Ct Del) enhanced both cell-to-cell fusion and apoptosis. Most significantly, an Env mutant containing a substitution in the loop region of gp41 (D589L) mediated transfer of lipids (hemifusion) to bystander cells but was defective in cell-to-cell and to a lesser degree virus-to-cell fusion. This mutant was still able to induce apoptosis in bystander cells. Hence, we have provided the first direct evidence that gp41-mediated hemifusion is both required and sufficient for induction of apoptosis in bystander cells.

As the number of CD4+ T cells lost during HIV infection far exceeds the number of infected cells (1Finkel T.H. Tudor-Williams G. Banda N.K. Cotton M.F. Curiel T. Monks C. Baba T.W. Ruprecht R.M. Kupfer A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), it is believed that HIV induces the death of uninfected bystander cells via apoptosis (2Gougeon M.L. Montagnier L. Science. 1993; 260: 1269-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Env glycoprotein is a good candidate for inducing bystander cell death, as it is expressed on the surface of infected cells and can interact with bystander cells expressing the HIV receptor (CD4) and co-receptors (CXCR4/CCR5). Furthermore, because the depletion of T cells is largely restricted to CD4+ cells, a role for the Env glycoprotein in either direct or indirect killing of bystander cells has been proposed (3Perfettini J.L. Castedo M. Roumier T. Andreau K. Nardacci R. Piacentini M. Kroemer G. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Env glycoprotein of HIV consists of a CD4- and CXCR4-binding gp120 subunit and a membrane fusion-inducing gp41 subunit. Although the role of the Env glycoprotein in inducing bystander cell death is well studied, it remains controversial whether gp120 or gp41 are major players in this process. It is well established that the fusion capacity of HIV gp41 contributes to HIV-induced pathogenesis both in vitro (4LaBonte J.A. Patel T. Hofmann W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10690-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in vivo (5Etemad-Moghadam B. Rhone D. Steenbeke T. Sun Y. Manola J. Gelman R. Fanton J.W. Racz P. Tenner-Racz K.

Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, because HIV Env-induced syncytia formation is not a universal pathogenic feature of HIV infection, it is unclear how HIV gp41 could cause depletion of CD4+ cells in the absence of cell-to-cell fusion. It has been suggested that gp41-mediated autofusion may lead to the death of Env-expressing cells (7Cao J. Park I.W. Cooper A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1340-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, autofusion explains only the death of Env-expressing or -infected cells and not bystanders, even though in HIV infection, the number of apoptotic/dying cells far exceeds the number of infected cells. Alternatively, it has been suggested that gp41-mediated hemifusion between Env-expressing and bystander cells may be involved in the induction of bystander apoptosis by a “kiss and run” mechanism (8Blanco J.

J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hemifusion is a phenomenon in which the outer leaflets of the membrane of the effector and target cells interact transiently without the formation of a fusion pore or progression to syncytia formation (10Blumenthal R. Clague M.J. Durell S.R. Epand R.M. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This process has been well characterized for influenza hemagglutinin (11Kemble G.W.

Hemifusion may result in membrane destabilization, which can be measured by the transfer of lipophilic dyes from effector to target cells and may lead to apoptotic signaling.

Sci. 2000; 926: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the macaque model of acute HIV infection using simian immunodeficiency virus, apoptosis largely correlates with caspase-3 activation (18Li Q. Duan L. Estes J.D. Ma Z.M. Rourke T. Wang Y. Reilly C. Carlis J. Miller C.J. Haase A.T. Nature. 2005; 434: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Also, a recent study shows that bystander apoptosis mediated by HIV-1 in thymus tissue cultures is dependent on gp41 function and is mediated by caspase-3 (19Meissner E.G. Zhang L. Jiang S. Su L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11019-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have also observed previously that HIV gp41 mediates apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and can be inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD (9Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway in HIV infection has been suggested by others both in vitro and in vivo (20Castedo M. Macho A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Uriel J. Kroemer G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Macho A. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Aguilar J.J. Decaudin D. Zamzami N. Girard P.M. Uriel J. Kroemer G.

Sci. 2003; 1010: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that apoptosis mediated by HIV gp41 can be inhibited by the protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, which has been shown to inhibit the adenosine nucleotide translocator in the mitochondria, thereby preventing mitochondrial depolarization (23Weaver J.G. Tarze A. Moffat T.C. Lebras M. Deniaud A. Brenner C. Bren G.D. Morin M.Y. Phenix B.N. Dong L. Jiang S.X. Sim V.L. Zurakowski B. Lallier J. Hardin H. Wettstein P. van Heeswijk R.P. Douen A.

For gp41-mediated apoptosis, it is essential that there be a cell-to-cell interaction between infected and uninfected bystander cells. In the context of HIV infection, the interactions between HIV Env-expressing and uninfected T cells leads to the formation of an actin-dependent virological synapse that facilitates the direct transfer of virus between T cells (24Jolly C. Kashefi K. Hollinshead M. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In fact, a recent study suggests that the majority of HIV transmission occurs via cell-to-cell interaction across the virological synapse (25Sourisseau M. Sol-Foulon N. Porrot F. Blanchet F. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1000-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although this interaction supports HIV replication, it may come at the expense of bystander cell death mediated by gp41. However, we do not know whether fusion or hemifusion is required for the induction of apoptosis via this synaptic type of cell-to-cell contact. HIV gp41 consists of several functional domains, including an N-terminal fusion domain, N- and C-terminal helices joined by a loop region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. Conformational changes induced by gp120 binding to the receptor/co-receptor induce a sequence of events that involve insertion of the gp41 fusion domain into the target cell membrane followed by folding of the helical regions into the 6-helix bundle finally resulting in fusion (26Gallo S.A. Finnegan C.M. Viard M. Raviv Y. Dimitrov A. Rawat S.S. Puri A. Durell S. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Mutational studies indicate that the different regions of gp41 work cooperatively in this fusion reaction (27Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a mutational study of HIV Env-mediated apoptosis has not been conducted. Hence, in this study, we have examined the effect of point mutations in gp41 that alter cell-to-cell fusion capacity on the apoptosis-inducing activity of Env glycoprotein. Using various mutants, we have shown a correlation between HIV gp41-mediated cell-to-cell fusion/hemifusion and the induction of apoptosis. With the help of a hemifusion-restricted mutant (D589L), we have provided the first direct evidence that gp41-mediated bystander cell death is hemifusion-dependent. Virus replication studies suggest an inverse correlation between virus replication and bystander apoptosis-inducing capacity of different mutants. These findings are further supported by the observation that replication of syncytia inducing the wild type (WT) (but not the non-syncytia inducing the W596M mutant) can be altered via a caspase-3 inhibitor. Our findings indicate that, even under conditions of virus replication, bystander cell apoptosis induced by HIV-1 Env may be gp41 fusion/hemifusion-dependent and caspase-3-mediated. Cells and Reagents—SupT1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin streptomycin (5000 units/ml). HeLa and TZM (National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin streptomycin (5000 units/ml). Fusion inhibitors C34, AMD3100, and protease inhibitor Nelfinavir were provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO was obtained from Calbiochem. Plasmid Constructs—Molecular clones of HIV-1 LAI and NL4–3 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. EcoRI-XhoI fragments from the LAI molecular clone were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) making the WT LAI Env construct. The fragment contains open reading frames of env, tat, and rev genes. Point mutations were introduced in the WT Env construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutants were numbered based on the Env sequence of the HXB2 reference strain. All mutant Env regions were also introduced into the NL4–3 molecular clone using the EcoRI-XhoI fragments to generate infectious molecular clones containing mutant LAI Env. Expression of Env Glycoprotein—HeLa cells were transfected in 6-well plates using ExGen 500 (Fermentas Life Science) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and used for either cell-to-cell fusion assay or bystander apoptosis induction in co-culture experiments with target cells. Cell-to-Cell Fusion Assay—HeLa cells transfected with a different Env expression vector (which also expresses HIV-1 Tat) were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well. TZM cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 as well as the Tat-dependent luciferase reporter gene were added at the same amount. The cells were co-cultured for 6 h, following which the luciferase activity was measured by Steadyglo luciferase substrate (Promega). Apoptosis Induction—For induction of apoptosis, co-culture between Env-transfected HeLa cells and SupT1 cells was performed. HeLa cells transfected with either WT or mutant Env constructs were seeded in 24-well plates at 105 cells/well. The cells were allowed to adhere for 4–6 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and SupT cells at 0.5–1 × 106 cells were added. Different inhibitors were added at the time of co-culture. The cells were co-cultured for 24 h, following which the suspension cells were collected, stained with Annexin V (BD Biosciences), and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For some assays, apoptosis was detected by staining with mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye DiOC6 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) followed by flow cytometry. At least 10,000 events were collected and analyzed using Cellquest software. Dye Transfer Assay—Env-transfected HeLa cells were labeled with either cytoplasmic dye CMTMR (10 μm) or lipophilic membrane dye DiI (Vybrant cell-labeling kit, Molecular Probes). The cells were washed and plated in 24-well plates at 105 cells/well. After 4–6 h, unlabeled SupT1 cells were added and co-cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the non-adherent target cells were collected and stained with Annexin V for detection of apoptosis and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Transfer of dye (cytoplasmic or membrane) was acquired in the red channel (FL-2), and the green channel (FL1) was used for apoptosis detection via Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate. This assay determined whether the apoptotic target cells seen in our system had taken up cytoplasmic or membrane dyes from the effector cells. Virus Infection Assay—TZM cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well. The subsequent day, cells were infected with an equal reverse transcriptase value of different Env mutant viruses in the presence of 20 μg/ml DEAE dextran. C34 and AMD3100 were added at the time of virus addition. 24 h post-infection, the luciferase activity was measured using Steadyglo Luciferase substrate. Metabolic Labeling and Radioimmunoprecipitation—For Env expression, HeLa cells were transfected with various Env constructs. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine (250 μCi) (Amersham Biosciences) in RPMI 1640 medium lacking cysteine. The cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with AIDS patient sera (kindly provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by fluorography. The ratio of gp120 to 160 was used to determine Env processing. For determination of Env incorporation into virions, 293T cells were transfected with various molecular clones of virus. The cells were metabolically labeled as described above. Subsequently, the culture supernatants were harvested and ultracentrifuged at 35,000 revolutions/min for 45 min to pellet the virus. The virus pellets were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. The ratio of gp120 to gag was used to determine Env incorporation. Virus Replication Assay—For virus replication assays, virus stocks were prepared by 293T transfection using infectious molecular clones and ExGen 500 transfection reagent. Virus supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection, cleared of cellular components by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. Reverse transcriptase activity was determined, and equal RT values were used for infection of SupT1 cells. The cultures were split 1:3 every other day, and culture supernatants were harvested for determination of RT activity. For certain experiments, caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO was added at 20 μm throughout the culture period. Fusion-defective Env Glycoprotein Fails to Induce Bystander Cell Death—To determine whether gp41 function is required for apoptosis or whether gp120-binding activity is sufficient for apoptosis induction, a point mutation in the gp41 fusion domain (V513E) was introduced that abolishes the fusion activity (28Freed E.O. Delwart E.L. Buchschacher Jr., G.L. Panganiban A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Using this mutant, we found that V513E mutation is not only defective in cell-to-cell (Fig. 1A) and virus-to-cell fusion (Fig. 1C) but is also completely deficient in bystander apoptosis-inducing capacity (Fig. 1B). This effect was unlikely because of the expression or processing of Env glycoprotein, which was similar to the WT (supplemental Fig. 1). As shown previously (9Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), apoptosis mediated via WT Env was also inhibited by fusion inhibitor C34 and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to the same levels as V513E or control-transfected cells. This suggests that the fusion capacity of gp41 is essential for the induction of bystander cell death. Bystander Apoptosis-inducing Potential Correlates with Cell-to-Cell Fusion Capacity but Not Virus-to-Cell Fusion—To further characterize the role of gp41 fusion capacity in apoptosis induction, we examined mutations in gp41 that are known to affect cell-to-cell fusion but have a limited effect on virus infection. One such mutation, G547D, is defective in cell fusion and is also associated with resistance to the fusion inhibitor Enfuvirtide or T20 as well as other fusion-inhibitory peptides such as C34 (29Reeves J.D. Lee F.H. Miamidian J.L. Jabara C.B. Juntilla M.M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Kinomoto M. Yokoyama M. Sato H. Kojima A. Kurata T. Ikuta K. Sata T. Tokunaga K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 (Ct Del) has been known to enhance cell-to-cell fusion capability (31Wyss S. Dimitrov A.S. Baribaud F. Edwards T.G. Blumenthal R. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12231-12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, we found that, although G547D was defective in cell fusion, Ct Del showed enhanced fusion in our assays compared with WT (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, although G547D was less potent at virus fusion than WT, Ct Del was considerably weaker (Fig. 2C) because of poor incorporation of the Env glycoprotein in the virus, as reported previously (32Murakami T. Freed E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). Interestingly, the cell-to-cell fusion capacity of the mutants correlated with the bystander apoptosis-inducing function of gp41 (Fig. 2B) further validated the hypothesis that HIV Env-mediated apoptosis is gp41 function-dependent. We also found that both G547D and Ct Del are less sensitive than WT to the fusion inhibitor C34, consistent with published results (29Reeves J.D. Lee F.H. Miamidian J.L. Jabara C.B. Juntilla M.M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Wyss S. Dimitrov A.S. Baribaud F. Edwards T.G. Blumenthal R. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12231-12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but not to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Fig. 2D). This has implications for the T20-resistant mutants that arise in patients receiving T20 therapy, suggesting that they may have an altered fusion capacity and therefore have a different pathogenesis. Cell-to-Cell Fusion Is Not Required for HIV-1 gp41-mediated Apoptosis—Previously, we and others (8Blanco J. Barretina J. Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Gutierrez A. Armand-Ugon M. Cabrera C. Kroemer G. Clotet B. Este J.A. Virology. 2003; 305: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that gp41-mediated bystander cell apoptosis correlates with gp41-mediated hemifusion. Although these findings are based on dye transfer assays using WT Env, direct evidence of gp41-mediated apoptosis in the absence of syncytia formation (cell-to-cell fusion) is missing. A recent report by Alizon et al. (13Bar S. Alizon M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) describes certain mutations in the loop region that are restricted at the hemifusion state. To address the issue that Env-mediated apoptosis is hemifusion-dependent, we utilized the loop mutations to induce apoptosis in bystander cells. Two mutations in the loop region, W596M and D589L, were used in the study. Although W596M was defective in both cell-to-cell fusion (Fig. 3A) and apoptosis induction (Fig. 3B), it did show virus infection capacity (Fig. 3C). Contrary to this, the other mutant, D589L, was defective in cell-to-cell fusion (Fig. 3A), although still capable of inducing apoptosis (Fig. 3B). This process was gp41-dependent, as it was inhibited by C34, hence providing the first direct evidence that gp41-mediated apoptosis does not require cell-to-cell fusion or syncytia formation. Although both W596M and D589L have been suggested to be associated with hemifusion, we did find considerable differences between these mutants, which have also been reported by Alizon et al. (13Bar S. Alizon M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). D589L was relatively defective in virus infection (Fig. 3C) compared with W596M, suggesting that it is different from W596M. Furthermore, W596M has been reported to replicate efficiently without causing cytopathic effects in cell lines (33Cao J. Vasir B. Sodroski J.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, under our co-culture conditions, D589L was the predominantly hemifusion-restricted Env and therefore used in subsequent experiments. HIV gp41-mediated Apoptosis Correlates with Hemifusion—Hemifusion is a phenomenon whereby the outer leaflets of opposing membranes interact without the formation of a fusion pore. This process can be differentiated from complete fusion by labeling either the membrane or cytoplasm of effector and/or target cells. To determine whether apoptosis mediated via D589L Env is hemifusion-dependent, we utilized a dye transfer assay where the Env-expressing (effector) cells were labeled with either a lipophilic membrane dye (DiI) or cytoplasmic dye (CMTMR). The cells were co-cultured with unlabeled SupT1 cells and apoptosis determined via Annexin V staining. Flow cytometry was used to determine the transfer of lipid or aqueous dye from the effector cells to the apoptotic target cells. As seen in Fig. 4, co-culture of SupT1 cells with Env-expressing cells resulted in apoptosis (AnnexinV+) that was seen in either DiI+ (Fig. 4A) or CMTMR– (Fig. 4B) cell populations. Transfer of DiI (and not CMTMR) to the apoptotic target cells suggests that there was lipid mixing between the effector and target cells but not cytoplasmic content mixing. This phenomenon was seen in both WT and D589L, although the extent of apoptosis was limited in D589L (30%) compared with WT. Furthermore, both apoptosis and dye transfer for WT as well as D589L were inhibited by C34, suggesting that it was gp41-mediated and not nonspecific transfer of dye. This confirms that cell-to-cell hemifusion without progression to complete fusion or syncytia formation is sufficient for bystander apoptosis induction. Hemifusion-induced Apoptosis Is Inhibited by Nelfinavir and Caspase-3 Inhibitor—Previously (9Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have observed that bystander apoptosis mediated by WT HIV Env is inhibited by caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD as well as by the HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir via its action on the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In co-culture experiments using WT Env, a limited number of syncytia are formed, which complicates the assertion that hemifusion-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by Nelfinavir or caspase-3 inhibitor. We wished to address this issue by using the D589L mutant, which mediates gp41-dependent apoptosis in the absence of cell-to-cell fusion or syncytia formation. Interestingly, we found that D589L-mediated apoptosis is also inhibited by both DEVD and Nelfinavir, similar to WT (Fig. 5). This suggests that the apoptotic signaling by WT Env is the same as hemifusion-restricted D589L. Because D589L does not cause cell-to-cell fusion, our data suggest that, even with fusion-competent Env, the apoptosis is likely mediated by the hemifusion phenomenon. Virus Replication Correlates Inversely with Apoptosis Potential of Env Glycoprotein—The fact that the mutants used in this study showed varied cell-to-cell fusion activity, although having significantly less effect on virus cell entry, encouraged us to perform virus replication studies to determine whether the bystander cell death-inducing property had an effect on virus replication. SupT1 cells infected with equal RT values of virus were cultured for 24 days with virus replication determined by RT activity in culture supernatant every alternate day (Fig. 6). Interestingly, WT, W596M, and G547D, although having a different infectivity in a single round of infection, showed efficient replication, suggesting that a threshold Env fusion activity is sufficient for replication. Based on the day of peak replication, an inverse correlation was found between replication kinetics and bystander apoptosis with W596M, which causes the least apoptosis replicating the fastest followed by G547D and WT. Although these differences in peak virus replication seem minor (2 days), they were highly reproducible over several experiments and also consistent with previous kinetics studies of HIV replication, where a 2-day delay in peak virus was associated with a log difference in multiplicity of infection (34Dimitrov D.S. Willey R.L. Sato H. Chang L.J. Blumenthal R. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2182-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hemifusion-restricted mutant D589L replicated slower and to lower levels than WT, probably due to its bystander apoptosis-inducing effect combined with poor virus infection phenotype. The other mutants, V513E and Ct Del, faile"

This role involves cell-cell interactions with intraepithelial lymphocytes that may also play a role in some enteropathies. The discovery of the RGD motif-containing Protein ADAM-15 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease-15) raises the question of its involvement in these cell-cell interactions. Cell adhesion assays were performed using the Jurkat E6.1 T cell line as a model of T lymphocytes and Caco2-BBE monolayers as a model of intestinal epithelia. Our results show that an anti-ADAM-15 ectodomain antibody inhibited the attachment of Jurkat cells on Caco2-BBE monolayers. Overexpression of ADAM-15 in Caco2-BBE cells enhanced Jurkat cell binding, and overexpression of ADAM-15 in Jurkat cells enhanced their aggregation. Mutagenesis experiments showed that both the mutation of ADAM-15 RGD domain or the deletion of its cytoplasmic tail decreased these cell-cell interactions. Moreover, wound-healing experiments showed that epithelial ADAM-15-mediated Jurkat cell adhesion to Caco2-BBE cells enhances the mechanisms of wound repair. We also found that ADAM-15-mediated aggregation of Jurkat cells increases the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA. These results demonstrate the following: 1) ADAM-15 is involved in heterotypic adhesion of intraepithelial lymphocytes to IEC as well as in homotypic aggregation of T cells; 2) both the RGD motif and the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM-15 are involved for these cell-cell interactions; and 3) ADAM-15-mediated cell-cell interactions are involved in mechanisms of epithelial restitution and production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Altogether these findings point to ADAM-15 as a possible therapeutic target for prevention of inappropriate T cell activation involved in some pathologies.

This immunoregulatory role of IEC is mediated through interactions with intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. The interactions between IEC and intraepithelial lymphocytes are thought to mediate T cell recruitment to intestinal epithelia (1Agace W.W. Higgins J.M. Sadasivan B. Brenner M.B. Parker C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In particular, cell-to-cell interactions are believed to stabilize the retention of lymphocytes within intestinal epithelia (2Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russell G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), thus leading to the formation of an immune barrier against intestinal pathogens. However, aberrant cell adhesion has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among immune cells recruited during intestinal inflammation, T lymphocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of various intestinal diseases including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Indeed some intestinal diseases show increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (i.e. celiac disease, lymphocytic colitis, tropical sprue, and giardiasis) and/or phenotypic alteration of intraepithelial lymphocytes (celiac disease, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis) (3Ferguson A.

Thus, it is interesting to consider the cell-cell interactions involved in IBD and possible strategies for therapeutic modulation. Only a few molecular interactions have been identified that are involved in the specific retention of lymphocytes in intestinal epithelia. It has been shown that adherence of T lymphocytes to human epithelial cell lines can be mediated through LFA-1 and ICAM-1 (17Kaiserlian D. Rigal D. Abello J. Revillard J.P. Eur. J.

The ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) proteins, also called MDC (metalloprotease/disintegrin/Cys-rich), are a family of membrane-anchored glycoproteins that present structural similarities with snake venom metalloproteases (29Weskamp G.

Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of ADAM-15 in integrin binding and therefore in cell-cell interactions. It has indeed been shown that the disintegrin domain of ADAM-15 interacts withαvβ3 andα5β1 integrins in an RGD-dependent manner (32Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J.

In addition, overexpression of ADAM-15 in the fibroblastic cell line NIH3T3 has been found to enhance cell-cell interactions (35Herren B. Garton K.J. Coats S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Raines E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ADAM-15 has also been shown to be expressed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as human hematopoietic cell lines, including Jurkat cells (31Kratzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

Driss A. Laboisse C.L. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and very recently we also found that during IBD ADAM-15 is strongly up-regulated and ADAM-15-positive IEC are in close contact with α5β1 integrin-positive leukocytes (39Mosnier J.F. Jarry A. Bou-Hanna C. Denis M.G. Merlin D. Laboisse C.L. Lab. Investig. 2006; 86: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for ADAM-15 in leukocyte transepithelial migration that occurs during IBD. Our aim was therefore to investigate whether ADAM-15 participates in cell-cell interactions between IEC and T lymphocytes. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The Caco2-BBE cell line (40Mooseker M.S. Annu.

The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat E6.1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Caco2-BBE cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's Vogt modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 14 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1.5 μg/ml plasmocin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA). Transfected Caco2-BBE cells were maintained in the same medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Jurkat E6.1 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg/ml plasmocin (Invivogen). Transfected Jurkat cells were maintained in the same medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were kept at 37 °C, in 5% CO2, and 90% humidity. For adhesion assays with Jurkat cells, Caco2-BBE cells were plated on 12-well plates (Costar, VWR, Suwanee, GA), and experiments were performed post-confluency. For aggregation experiments, Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Costar) to a density of 105 cells per 100 μl per well. Normal Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Isolation—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as follow. Whole blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS and centrifuged (400 × g, 25 min, 21 °C) over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). Mononuclear cells were aspirated and washed in PBS (200 × g, 10 min, 21 °C). Cells were then lysed to be processed for Western blot experiments. Western Blot Analysis—For total protein extraction, cells or tissues were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Folin assay (DC protein assay kit, BioRad). Protein extracts were mixed in Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5 min, run on a 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) or an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (VWR, Suwanee, GA), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in blocking buffer and then incubated 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the cytoplasmic tail of human ADAM-15 (1:1,000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the viral tag protein V5 (1:1,000; Invitrogen). After washing, membranes were further incubated 1 h at room temperature with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1,000; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed again, and immunoreactive proteins were detected on film (Denville, Metuchen, NJ) using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane Preparations—For membrane preparations, cells were washed twice in PBS. After centrifugation (400 × g for 5 min), cell pellet was resuspended and carefully homogenized, with a Douncer, in HEPES (5 mm) containing protease inhibitors, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting pellet was suspended in PBS by repeated passage through an 18-gauge needle. Protein concentration in the membrane suspension and in total extracts was quantified with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Caco2-BBE Full-length ADAM-15 cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—Poly(A)+ RNA from Caco2-BBE was isolated with a Micro Fast Track kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The yield of RNA from each preparation was determined by UV spectrophotometry. Two microliters of messenger RNA (about 200 ng) was primed with oligo(dT) and reverse-transcribed with an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (cDNA cycle kit; Invitrogen). A dilution of the reverse transcription reaction was used as a template for amplification by PCR. The full-length ADAM-15 cDNA was cloned by using the following primers: sense, 5′-CGC TGT TCC GCA CTT GCT-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCG GAG AGG TCA GAG GTA GA-3′. After an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min, PCR was carried out for 35 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 4 min, followed by a final cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was electrophoresed on ethidium bromide-stained 1% (w/v) agarose gels in Tris/acetate/EDTA buffer. The PCR product had an apparent size of 2.5 kb. After gel extraction, with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and its ligation into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO/V5 expression vector (Invitrogen), the PCR product was cloned. Plasmids were then purified using the Qiagen Maxiplasmid kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced (Biosynthesis and Sequencing, Baltimore, MD). The pcDNA3.1 TOPO/V5 expression vector encodes the protein of interest fused with the small viral protein V5, which allows the detection of the exogenous expression of the protein of interest by immunoblot analysis with a mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Generation of Mutated ADAM-15 Proteins—Mutated ADAM-15 proteins were generated by PCR. The mutation of the RGD motif of ADAM-15 was performed with the following primers: forward, 5′-GCT GGC AGT GTC GTC CTA CCA GTG TGG ATT GTG ACT TG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAA GTC ACA ATC CAC ACT GGT AGG ACG ACA CTG CCA GC-3′. Once the PCR was completed, the RGD motif became mutated into an SVD sequence. The deletion of the cytoplasmic tail was also performed by PCR, by introducing a stop codon in the cytoplasmic tail coding sequence, with the following primers: forward, 5′-TCC TGG TGA TGC TTG GTG CCA GCT AGT GGT ACC GTG CC-3′; reverse. 5′-GGC ACC AAG CAT CAC CAG GAC CAA-3′. Caco2-BBE and Jurkat cells were further stably transfected with the vector alone as well as with the vector containing the cDNA encoding ADAM-15 protein or its mutants. Transfection of Caco2-BBE Cells—Subconfluent Caco2-BBE cells were transfected with empty vector or with construct encoding ADAM-15, using Trojene™ transfection reagent (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) according to the manufacturer's instructions, for 3–4 h in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). Transfectants were selected in culture medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Transfection of Jurkat Cells—Jurkat cells were transfected with empty vector or with construct encoding ADAM-15, by electroporation, with Multiporator® (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a cell suspension of 106 cells/ml in hypo-osmolar buffer (Eppendorf) was electrophoresed with 20 μg/ml DNA using one pulse of 240 V for 40 μs. Transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Adhesion Assays—Jurkat cells were labeled with 5 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and-6) carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM, Molecular Probes), in culture media for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, these labeled Jurkat cells, as well as confluent Caco2-BBE cells cultured in 12-well plates, were incubated with their respective culture media with or without 10 μg/ml mouse anti-ADAM-15 antibody, raised against the ectodomain (R&D Systems) or 10 μg/ml mouse control antibody with the same isotype (R&D Systems), for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of Caco2-BBE medium, Jurkat cells were added (10 × 106 cells in 400 μl of RPMI medium per well) to confluent Caco2-BBE cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation of Jurkat cells with Caco2-BBE monolayers, the media containing nonattached Jurkat cells were removed, and cells remaining in the wells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in a Triton lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). The fluorescence was then read using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Danbury, CT; excitation wavelength, 492 nm; emission wavelength, 520 nm). Experiments with transfected cells were conducted as described above, except cells were not preincubated with antibodies. Results are expressed as number of attached Jurkat cells on Caco2-BBE monolayers, based on calibration with lysates of labeled Jurkat cells, ±S.E. Homotypic Cell Aggregation Assays—Transfected Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 105 cells in 100 μl per well and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. Images were captured at time point 0, before incubating cells, and then at different time points, with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope with a DS Camera Head DS-5M and a DS Camera Control Unit DS-L1 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). These images were analyzed through a digital imaging system of analysis using the ImagePro Plus® 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Cell aggregates were individually outlined, and the size of the delimited area was measured accounting for the relative size of aggregates. Measurements of cell aggregates from each cell suspension were exported to Excel® for further data analysis. A total of 71–201 cell aggregates per cell suspension were analyzed. Results are expressed as the mean of aggregates size ± S.E. Wound-healing Assays—Wound-healing assays were performed with the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS, Applied BioPhysics) technology (38Charrier L. Yan Y. Driss A. Laboisse C.L. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ECIS model 1600R (Applied BioPhysics) was used for these experiments. The measurement system consists of an 8-well culture dish (ECIS 8W1E plate), with the surface treated for cell culture. Each well contains a small active electrode (area = 5 × 10–4 cm2) and a large counter electrode (area = 0.15 cm2) deposited upon the bottom of each well. A lock-in amplifier, with an internal oscillator, relays to switch between the different wells, and a personal computer controls the measurement and stores the data. The entire system was obtained from Applied BioPhysics. Attachment and spreading of cells on the electrode surface change the impedance in such a way that morphological information of the attached cells can be inferred. Transfected Caco2-BBE cells and Jurkat cells were seeded together in ECIS 8W1E plates coated with 10 μg/ml laminin I (Sigma) at a ratio of 3:1 (Caco2-BBE:Jurkat) in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg/ml plasmocin (Invivogen). Control cell cultures were used, for each experiment, in which Jurkat cells were replaced by 10-μm polystyrene microparticles (Fluka, St. Louis, MO). Once cells reached confluency, basal resistance measurements were performed for at least 1 h using the ideal frequency for Caco2-BBE cells, 500 Hz (38Charrier L. Yan Y. Driss A. Laboisse C.L. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and 1 V for the voltage. For the wound-healing assays, cells were submitted to an elevated voltage pulse of 40-kHz frequency, 4.5-V amplitude, and a 30-s duration that led to death and detachment of cells present on the small active electrode, resulting in a wound that is normally healed by cells surrounding the small active electrodes that have not been submitted to the elevated voltage pulse. Wound healing was then assessed by continuous resistance measurements. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—T cell aggregation assays were performed as described above. After 6 h of incubation, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), reverse-transcribed using the Superscript III first-strand system (Invitrogen), and TNFα cDNA was amplified using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and the real time iCycler sequence detection system (BioRad). TNFα cDNA was amplified at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min with 10 μm gene-specific primers. GAPDH expression levels were used as a reference. The primers used are as follow: TNFα forward, 5′-AGC CCA TGT TGT AGC AAA CC-3′, and TNFα reverse, 5′-TGA GGT ACA GGC CCT CTG AT-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-GTC GGA GTC AAC GGA TTT GG-3′, and GAPDH reverse, 5′-AAG CTT CCC GTT CTC AGC CT-3′. For graphical representation of quantitative PCR data, raw threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained for each transfectant were deducted from the Ct values obtained for internal GAPDH transcript levels using the ΔΔCt method as follows: ΔΔCt = (Ct,TNFα – Ct,GAPDH)transfectant – (Ct,transfectant – Ct,vector)TNFα, and final data were derived from 2–ΔΔCt (44Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Results represent the data obtained from two independent experiments and are expressed as the relative content of TNFα mRNA present in each transfectant ± S.E. Statistical Data—Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance of the data obtained in all assays. The Binding of Jurkat Cells to Caco2-BBE Cells Is Inhibited by an Anti-ADAM-15 Antibody Raised against the Ectodomain—We have previously shown that ADAM-15 is expressed in human normal intestine and in the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2-BBE (38Charrier L. Yan Y. Driss A. Laboisse C.L. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because ADAM-15 has been shown to bind to αvβ3 and α5β1 in an RGD-dependent manner on hematopoietic cells (33Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed the role of ADAM-15 in cell-cell interactions of IEC/T lymphocytes. For this purpose, we performed adhesion assays of Jurkat cells, labeled with the fluorescent dye BCECF on confluent Caco2-BBE cells, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Because human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as human hematopoietic cell lines, including Jurkat, express ADAM-15 (Fig. 1) (31Kratzschmar J.

Labeled Jurkat cells were added to confluent Caco2-BBE cells, and binding of Jurkat cells to Caco2-BBE monolayers was determined by reading the fluorescence after lysis of adherent cells. Fig. 2 shows that anti-ADAM-15 antibody was significantly inhibited by ∼30% Jurkat cell binding to Caco2-BBE cells (413,750 ± 34,855 attached cells versus 608,775 ± 55,760 without antibody). In contrast, the control antibody did not have any significant effect on Jurkat cell attachment (593,590 ± 39,275 attached cells versus 608,775 ± 55,760 without antibody). These results suggest that ADAM-15 is involved in IEC/T lymphocyte interactions.FIGURE 2Anti-ADAM-15 antibody inhibits Jurkat cell attachment on Caco2-BBE cells. Adhesion assays were performed with Caco2-BBE cell line as an adherent monolayer and Jurkat cells as BCECF-AM fluorescent-labeled suspension cells in the presence (ADAM-15 antibody) or absence (ctl) of 10 μg/ml mouse anti-ADAM-15 (ectodomain) antibody or control irrelevant antibody (ctl IgG).

In this study, we have examined its function using a novel monoclonal antibody and showed it to be expressed on the cell surface as a glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored membrane protein. High level expression was observed in human muscular tissues and in myotubes obtained in vitro from RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We observed that RD myotubes incorporated a foreign gene, lacZ, by endocytosis but that expression of the encoded coding product, β-galactosidase, was strongly inhibited. Overexpression of DNase X inhibited endocytosis-mediated gene transfer, whereas knockdown of DNase X with small interfering RNA had the opposite effect. These results reveal that DNase X provides a cell surface barrier to endocytosis-mediated gene transfer. DNase X is the first mammalian DNase to be isolated that is homologous to DNase I.

DNase I is a secretory endonuclease that hydrolyzes DNA to 3′-hydroxyl oligonucleotides in the presence of divalent metal ions, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (1Campbell V.W. Jackson D.A. J. Biol.

Its physiological significance in body fluids has long been unclear; however, a recent study demonstrates that targeted disruption of murine dnase1 increases the generation of anti-DNA antibodies and the development of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome (4Napirei M. Karsunky H. Zevnik B. Stephan H. Mannherz H.G. Moroy T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that DNase I plays an important role in eliminating extracellular DNA that can cause auto-immune diseases in animals. In early investigations, most divalent cation-dependent DNase activities were regarded as being carried out by DNase I. However, more recent studies revealed the existence of several DNase I-like DNases, DNase X/Xib, DNase γ/DNAS1L3, and DNAS1L2 (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). DNASEX is located at q28 of the human X chromosome and was the first gene to be found that encoded a protein homologous to DNase I (6Coy J.F. Velhagen I. Himmele R. Delius H. Poustka A. Zentgraf H. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar, 7Parrish J.E. Ciccodicola A. Wehhert M. Cox G.F. Chen E. Nelson D.L. Hum. Mol.

Gene. 1996; 168: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNase X has an extra hydrophobic stretch at its C terminus, which is regarded as its most outstanding structural feature (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic domain is conserved among mammalian DNase X proteins, suggesting that it has functional importance (9Shiokawa D. Shika Y. Saito K. Yamazaki K. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and that DNase X might play a unique physiological role. In the current study, we have generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; DPBS, Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; SERCA-1, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling; ncRNA, negative control RNA; GM, growth medium; DM, differentiation medium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 3The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; DPBS, Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; SERCA-1, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling; ncRNA, negative control RNA; GM, growth medium; DM, differentiation medium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. specific for human DNase X and used it to characterize the molecule. We have presented evidence that DNase X is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane DNase located on the cell surface and on early endocytic vesicles. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that DNase X hydrolyzes endocytosed extracellular DNA, thereby protecting cells from invasion by foreign genes. Cell Culture—HeLa S3, COS-7, and CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells, obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank of Japan, were maintained in growth medium (GM) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and mg/ml streptomycin). To induce myogenic differentiation, subconfluent cultures grown on collagen type I-coated dishes (Iwaki Scitech) were shifted to differentiation medium (DM) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) and cultured for the indicated number of days with daily medium replacement. Expression Vectors—All expression vectors were constructed using pcDNA3.1 myc-His B (Invitrogen) by subcloning PCR-generated cDNAs. Unless otherwise noted, PCR products were inserted into the EcoRV site in-frame with the C-terminal Myc and His6 tags. cDNA fragments for phDNaseXΔC and pmFasΔC were amplified using the oligonucleotide primers phDNaseXΔC, 5′-CCACCATGCACTACCCAACTGCACTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGGCTCAGCTTCAGCTCCAC-3′ (antisense); pmFasΔC, 5′-CCACCATGCTGTGGATCTGGGCTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCTGGATTGTCATGTCTTCAGC-3′ (antisense). phDNase I-HD was generated by subcloning cDNA fragments for human DNase I and the extra C-terminal stretch of DNase X (amino acid 256-284) containing the hydrophobic domain simultaneously. The primers used were DNase I, 5′-CCACCATGAGGGGCATGAAGCTGCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCAGCATCACCTCCACTGG-3′ (antisense) and hydrophobic domain (HD), 5′-CTGAGCCAGGCGCACAGCGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCAGCAGGGCACAGCTGAGG-3′ (antisense). phDNase X H130A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using an LA PCR in vitro mutagenesis kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression vectors for human DNase I (phDNase I-myc-His), DNase X (phDNase X-myc-His), DNase γ (phDNase γ-myc-His), and DNAS1L2 (phDNAS1L2-myc-His) were generated in a previous study (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). pcDNA 3.1/myc-His/lacZ (placZ), an expression vector for β-galactosidase, was purchased from Invitrogen. Transfection and Endocytosis Assays—Transfection of expression vectors for the indicated DNases and mFasΔC was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (9Shiokawa D. Shika Y. Saito K. Yamazaki K. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). placZ and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled lacZ cDNA fragment (FITC-lacZ) were delivered into the cells using an α-helical cationic peptide, LLKLLLKLWKKLLKLLK (Transome IV, Wako Pure Chemical). FITC-lacZ was PCR-generated from placZ using FITC-labeled primers 5′-FITC-GACGGATCGGGAGATCTCCCG-3′ and 5′-FITC-CGAAAGGAGCGGGCGCTAGGG-3′. The efficiency of endocytosis-mediated gene transfer was evaluated by measuring the β-galactosidase activity expressed from placZ. Cells in 60-mm culture dishes were loaded with 10 μg of placZ precomplexed with Transome IV. Control experiments were also performed using an empty vector to subtract the basal β-galactosidase activity. After 24 h, cells were harvested and β-galactosidase activity was assayed using the Beta-Gro assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total protein in cell lysates was determined with protein assay solution (Bio-Rad). Endocytotic activities were determined by monitoring the uptake of Alexa 594-dextran (D22913, Molecular Probes) or FITC-lacZ-Transome IV complex. Cells maintained on coverslips in 60-mm culture dishes were cultured for 60 min in the presence of 1 mg/ml Alexa 594-dextran or 10 μg of FITC-lacZ precomplexed with Transome IV. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, washed three times in DPBS, and observed with a fluorescence microscope after counterstaining the nuclei with 100 nm Hoechst 33342. Antibodies—A synthetic peptide (RSLLHTAAAFDFPTS-FQL) corresponding to residues 237-254 of human DNase X was conjugated to thyroglobulin through its N-terminal Cys and used as an antigen. BDF1 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 50 μg of peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant and then injected with 50 μg of peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant after 2, 3, and 4 weeks. A final 50-μg peptide booster was delivered by intravenous injection. Four days later, spleen cells were isolated from the mice and fused to X63-Ag8-653 mouse myeloma cells (10Kinebuchi M. Ide T. Lupin D. Tamatani T. Miyasaka M. Matsuura A. Nagai Y. Kikuchi K. Uede T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3721-3728PubMed Google Scholar) using polyethylene glycol. Growing hybridomas were selected in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium, and culture supernatants were screened using 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with the peptide. The resulting hybridomas were cloned twice by limited dilution, and a hybridoma producing monoclonal antibody was established and designated clone 1B1. We used the same method to obtain the hybridoma clone 10A2-producing monoclonal antibody against DNase I, which recognizes the synthetic peptide GAVVPDSALPFNFQAAYG corresponding to residues 245-262 of human DNase I. The subclass of the monoclonal antibodies was determined using mouse monoclonal antibody-isotyping reagents (IBL), and both 1B1 and 10A2 were found to be IgG1 κ. Mouse anti-SERCA-1 mAb (VE121G9) was purchased from Lab Vision, anti-GAPDH (MAB374) from Chemicon, and anti-Myc tag (R950-25) from Invitrogen. The goat polyclonal antibody against GM130 (P-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse Fas (341289) was purchased from Calbiochem, anti-EEA1 (PA1-063) was from Affinity BioReagents, anti-LAMP-1 (H-228) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-calreticulin (C4606) and anti-pan-cadherin (C3678) were from Sigma. Western Blot Analyses—Western analyses were performed using antibodies to DNase X (500 ng/ml), DNase I (100 ng/ml), Myc tag (1:1000 dilution), GAPDH (1:250 dilution), SERCA-1 (1:100 dilution), mouse Fas (1:2000 dilution), and pan-cadherin (1:400 dilution), as described previously (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Sections prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal human tissues were obtained from BioChain. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a cell and tissue staining kit (HRP-DAB, R & D Systems). In brief, the tissue slides, pretreated with an antigen retrieval dewax solution (BioChain), were incubated with anti-DNase X mAb at a concentration of 3 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. The sections were counterstained with Contrast BLUE solution (KPL), and images were captured using a CK40 light microscope system (Olympus). The specificity of each immunostaining procedure was confirmed by a blocking experiment performed in the presence of an ∼10-fold excess (200 ng/ml) of the immunizing DNase X peptide. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described previously with some modifications (9Shiokawa D. Shika Y. Saito K. Yamazaki K. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown on a coverslip were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and permeabilized by incubating in a Cytonin solution (R & D Systems) at room temperature for 30 min. When detecting cell surface targets, the incubation with Cytonin was omitted. The first antibody reactions were performed in a humid sealed chamber overnight at 4 °C. The working concentrations or dilution factors of the antibodies were for DNase X, 3 μg/ml; DNase I, 1 μg/ml; calreticulin, 1:2000; SERCA-1, 1:50; GM130, 1:50; Fas, 1:100; pan-cadherin, 1:400; EEA1, 1:1000; and LAMP-1, 1:100. The cells were then washed in DPBS and incubated with the following species-specific secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature: Alexa 488 chicken anti-mouse IgG, Alexa 594 donkey anti-goat IgG, and Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Double staining with mAbs for DNase X and SERCA-1 was performed using a Zenon Tricolor Mouse IgG1 labeling kit number 2 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol; anti-DNase X and anti-SERCA-1 mAbs were prelabeled with Alexa 488 and 594, respectively, and the antibody reaction was performed for 90 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in DPBS, counterstained with 100 nm Hoechst 33342, and observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus) or confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2, Leica). PI-PLC Treatment—Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed twice with DPBS and incubated in Leibovidz culture medium containing 5 units/ml Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were rinsed twice with DPBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cell surface DNase X, mFasΔC, and cadherin were detected by indirect immunofluorescence as described above. The attached cells were rinsed with DPBS, collected in a 1.5-ml tube, and incubated in 100 μl of 5 units/ml PI-PLC at 37 °C for 20 min. They were then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected in a separate tube (Sup fraction). The cell pellet was washed twice with DPBS by repeated suspension and centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of Leibovidz medium (cell fraction). Identical aliquots of the two fractions were subjected to Western blotting. TUNEL Assay—Cells grown on coverslips were cultured for 30 min in the presence of placZ-Transome IV complex as described above. They were washed twice with DPBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in DPBS at room temperature for 10 min, and the 3′-OH ends produced in the lacZ plasmids were detected by TUNEL using a FlowTACS in situ TUNEL detection Kit (R & D Systems). The overall assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with one exception, FITC-conjugated streptavidin was replaced by Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes). The cells were washed three times in DPBS, the endocytosed DNA counterstained with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 in DPBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus). Capture of DNA Images in Fluorescence Microscopy—Nuclear and/or endocytosed DNAs were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (a cell-permeable fluorescent dye) as described in each section. Observations of the DNA images were performed as follows unless otherwise noted. Images of nuclear DNA were taken through two neutral density filters (U-ND6 and U-ND25, Olympus) because of their strong fluorescence, whereas no neutral density filters were used for observing endocytosed DNA. RNA Interference—Stealth RNA interference for human DNase X and a negative control RNA (ncRNA) duplex were obtained from Invitrogen. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) was directed against the target sequence 5′-CCTGCTTCGAGAACTCAATCGATTT-3′. Subconfluent cultures of RD cells, seeded in 60-mm dishes, were shifted to DM and transfected with 120 pmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The resulting culture was maintained in DM for 4 days with daily medium replacement. We observed no induction of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1b mRNA in siRNA-transfected cells, indicating the absence of detectable interferon responses (data not shown). DNase X Is Expressed during Myogenic Differentiation of RD Cells—To examine DNase X expression at the protein level, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of several human tissues using the newly developed anti-DNase X mAb 1B1 (supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1A, both cardiac muscle cells and skeletal muscle fibers were highly immunoreactive for DNase X, whereas there was little positive staining in the brain. These results are consistent with the gene expression profile determined previously (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Coy J.F. Velhagen I. Himmele R. Delius H. Poustka A. Zentgraf H. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar, 7Parrish J.E. Ciccodicola A. Wehhert M. Cox G.F. Chen E. Nelson D.L. Hum. Mol.

J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and confirm the expression of the DNase X protein in muscle cells. The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD forms myotubes when it is grown under low mitogen conditions (Fig. 1B). To monitor the changes in DNase X expression associated with myogenic differentiation, we performed Western blots and showed that DNase X expression began to increase on day 3 after induction of differentiation, reaching a maximum on day 5 (Fig. 1C, top panel). The induction of a muscle marker protein, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA-1), confirmed the occurrence of myogenic differentiation (Fig. 1C, middle panel). DNase X Is Targeted to the Secretory Pathway and Delivered to the Cell Surface—We analyzed the intracellular distribution of DNase X by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 1D). Colocalization of DNase X with calreticulin and SERCA-1 revealed its association with the endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum, respectively. DNase X immunofluorescence also paralleled that of GM130, a marker of the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that newly synthesized DNase X is directed to the secretory pathway of the cell. To determine its final destination, we immunostained non-permeabilized cells and showed that the surface of multinucleated RD myotubes was strongly positive (Fig. 1E), whereas the surface of undifferentiated cells was only weakly stained (Fig. 1E, white arrowheads). The membrane expression of DNase X was also confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1F). These results demonstrate that newly synthesized DNase X is targeted to the secretory pathway and delivered to the cell surface in RD myotubes. The C-terminal Hydrophobic Domain Is Essential for Cell Surface Localization of DNase X—To determine whether membrane association is a specific hallmark of DNase X, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for DNase X and DNase I, and the membrane distribution of each DNase was analyzed by immunostaining. To locate DNase I, we generated an anti-DNase I mAb, 10A2. A mutant form of the murine Fas antigen (mFasΔC), which is expressed on the cell surface as a transmembrane protein, was co-expressed with the DNases, and its membrane expression was monitored as a marker of transfection (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). Indirect immunofluorescence revealed cell surface localization of the ectopic DNase X (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In contrast, there was no sign of DNase I membrane expression (Fig. 2A, lower panels). DNase X is unique among family members in having a conserved hydrophobic domain at its C terminus; this suggested to us that the hydrophobic domain might play a role in the membrane attachment of DNase X. To evaluate this possibility, we constructed two mutant DNase derivatives and observed their cell surface localization, DNase X with a deleted hydrophobic domain (DNase XΔC) and DNase I C-terminally fused to the hydrophobic domain of DNase X (DNase I-HD). As shown in Fig. 2B, DNase XΔC failed to attach to the plasma membrane, whereas DNase I-HD acquired a membrane location. These results show that cell surface localization is a specific feature of DNase X and that the C-terminal hydrophobic domain is necessary and sufficient for this localization. Membrane Binding of DNase X Is Mediated by a GPI Anchor—Eukaryotic proteins become membrane-anchored by several mechanisms, through being transmembrane proteins, through protein-protein interaction, or through binding to a GPI anchor (11Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Significantly, attachment to a GPI anchor requires a hydrophobic signal sequence located at the C termini of proteins (12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Given that DNase X has a C-terminal hydrophobic domain, we hypothesized that GPI anchoring might account for its membrane association. To evaluate this possibility, we tested the effect of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that releases GPI-anchored proteins, on DNase X membrane association. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that PI-PLC treatment greatly reduced the signal intensity of an exogenous DNase X without affecting that of the co-transfected transmembrane protein mFasΔC (Fig. 3A). The PI-PLC-mediated release of DNase X was further analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, DNase X (but not mFasΔC) was released into the supernatant by PI-PLC treatment. We obtained essentially the same results with the endogenous DNase X of RD myotubes (Fig. 3C); PI-PLC effected the release of DNase X without solubilizing cadherin, a membrane-integrated protein responsible for stable contact between cells (13Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is of note that an anti-Myc antibody failed to detect the ectopic DNase X released by PI-PLC treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the C-terminal hydrophobic domain and the Myc tag had been replaced by the GPI anchor. Based on these results, we conclude that membrane binding of DNase X is mediated by a GPI anchor and that the C-terminal hydrophobic domain serves as a signal sequence for GPI attachment. Endocytosis-mediated Gene Transfer Is Impaired in RD Myotubes—The endocytic activity of eukaryotic cells internalizes various cell surface and extracellular molecules, including foreign genes. Endocytosed genes are usually delivered to lysosomes and degraded by lysosomal acid DNases; however, certain cationic peptides are known to promote the escape of incorporated genes from endosomal degradation, thereby permitting transfer of the incorporated genetic information into the cell (14Balicki D. Putnam C.D. Scaria P.V. Beutler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7467-7471Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Ignatovich I.A. Dizhe E.B. Pavlotskaya A.V. Akifiev B.N. Burov S.V.

Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17951-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As an initial approach to unveiling the function of DNase X, we observed endocytosis-mediated gene transfer in RD myotubes that express DNase X on the cell surface at high levels. We employed an artificial α-helical cationic peptide to evaluate the efficiency of gene transfer by endocytosis (17Niidome T. Ohmori N. Ichinose A. Wada A. Mihara H. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15307-15312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Ohmori N. Niidome T. Kiyota T. Lee S. Sugihara G. Wada A. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RD myotubes incorporated a fluorophore-conjugated transgene, FITC-lacZ, more effectively than undifferentiated cells (Fig. 4A). However, expression of the encoded product, β-galactosidase, in the differentiated cells was <10% of that observed in the undifferentiated cells (Fig. 4B). To explain this finding, we hypothesized that the high level of membrane DNase X expression was responsible for the poor transgene expression in differentiated cells. To test this idea, we examined the association of DNase X with early and late endocytic vesicles in RD myotubes. As shown in Fig. 4C, DNase X immunofluorescence co-localized with that of the early endosomal marker EEA1, whereas there was no detectable overlap with that of LAMP-1, a marker of mature lysosomes. We next performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to detect 3′-OH nick ends on the endocytosed plasmids. This method was originally developed to detect apoptotic DNA fragmentation in situ (19Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that the transgenes incorporated by RD myotubes were positive for TUNEL (Fig. 4D). In view of the fact that DNase X catalyzes a 3′-OH/5′-P type of DNA hydrolysis (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these results suggest that it introduces multiple strand-breaks into the DNA, probably both at the cell surface and within early endocytic vesicles. Overexpression of the Membrane-bound Form of DNase X Suppresses Endocytosis-mediated Gene Transfer—To further address the role of DNase X, we introduced several mutant forms of DNase X into cells possessing a low level of endogenous DNase X activity and observed their effects on endocytosis-mediated gene transfer. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed ectopic DNase X expression on the surface of both HeLa S3 and undifferentiated RD cells (Fig. 5A, DNase X), whereas a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain displayed no specific membrane binding (Fig. 5A, DNase XΔC). These cultures were then loaded with the placZ-cationic peptide complex, and expression of the reporter gene was measured. As shown in Fig. 5B, overexpression of DNase X inhibited β-galactosidase expression by >70% in both HeLa S3 and undifferentiated RD cells, and inhibition was greatly diminished by the C-terminal deletion (Fig. 5B, ΔC). To establish the importance of DNase X activity, we expressed an inactive mutant in the cells and measured endocytosis-mediated gene transfer levels. DNase X H130A, in which one of the two catalytic His residues is replaced by Ala, was expressed normally on the cell surface (Fig. 5A, DNase X H130A); however, it did not inhibit transgene expression (Fig. 5B). The DNA strand breaks produced by the ectopic forms of DNase X were visualized using the TUNEL technique. As shown in Fig. 5C, wild type DNase X lacZ plasmids incorporated by HeLa S3 cells were TUNEL-positive, whereas lacZ plasmids ectopically expressing inactive DNase X were TUNEL-negative. SiRNA-mediated Knockdown of DNase X Reverses Inhibition of Endocytosis-mediated Gene Transfer in RD Myotubes—To establish whether endogenous DNase X acts as an inhibitor of gene transfer, we asked whether down-regulation of endogenous DNase X would reverse the impaired endocytosis-mediated gene transfer in RD myotubes. Fig. 6A shows that the intensity of the DNase X band was greatly diminished in cells treated with an siRNA specific for human DNase X, whereas no such down-regulation was observed with an ncRNA duplex. The suppression of DNase X did not affect SERCA-1 expression (Fig. 6A) or myotube formation (Fig. 6C), indicating that DNase X per se is not essential for myogenic differentiation of RD cells. We next cultured siRNA-treated myotubes in the presence of the placZ-peptide complex and examined the effect of DNase X suppression on endocytosis-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 6B). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNase X stimulated transgene expression >4-fold in differentiated RD cells. Moreover, TUNEL-positive strand breaks, which were apparent in the placZ endocytosed by control cells, were scarcely visible in the plasmids incorporated by siRNA-treated myotubes (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that GPI-anchored membrane DNase X catalyzes the degradation of incorporated foreign genes, thereby acting as a suppressor of endocytosis-mediated gene transfer. Identification of DNase X as a GPI-anchored Membrane Protein—Our results demonstrate that DNase X is expressed on the cell surface and on early endocytic vesicles as a GPI-anchored membrane protein. Surprisingly, the surface of muscle cells is also covered with this GPI-anchored endonuclease. A diverse set of eukaryotic cell surface proteins is anchored to membranes by covalent linkage to GPI (11Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a eukaryotic GPI-anchored ecto-DNase. Post-translational modification with a GPI anchor occurs at the C terminus (ω-site) of proteins after proteolytic cleavage of their C-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences (12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 20Caras I.W. Weddell G.N. Williams S.R. J.

We show here that the C-terminal hydrophobic domain of DNase X is essential for its membrane binding and that membrane DNase X is solubilized by PI-PLC. In a previous study, we observed that ectopic DNase X was found exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum, as determined by immunofluorescence of its C-terminal Myc tag (9Shiokawa D. Shika Y. Saito K. Yamazaki K. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This contradictory observation is explained by the fact that the GPI anchor is attached within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and at the same time, the protein to be anchored is cleaved of its C-terminal propeptide. Thus, the membrane-bound form of DNase X loses its C-terminal tag. Endocytosis-mediated Gene Transfer and DNase X—We observed that endocytosis-mediated gene transfer is strongly suppressed in cells expressing DNase X at high levels and that DNase X activity is responsible for TUNEL-positive strand breaks in the endocytosed DNA. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNase X reverses the impairment of gene transfer in the RD myotubes. Our results thus demonstrate that DNase X protects cells from endocytosis-mediated gene transfer by inactivating the incorporated foreign genes. GPI-anchored proteins are associated with lipid rafts, which are detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (11Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The biological significance of lipid rafts is not yet fully understood, but they have been implicated in diverse cellular activities, including signal transduction, cholesterol trafficking and endocytosis (11Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To date, at least three types of endocytic pathway have been identified in eukaryotic cells, the classical clathrin-mediated pathway, caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis, and constitutive fluid phase endocytosis, also known as pinocytosis (22Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 23Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4707-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The endocytic pathways by which cells take up foreign genes remain unclear. However, the caveolae/raft-dependent and the fluid phase pathways are the most likely candidates, because both mediate nonspecific internalization of micro- and macro-substances from the extracellular environment (24Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Endocytosis. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 25Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Importantly, GPI-anchored proteins are known to be internalized into recycling and early endosomes via the caveolae/raft-dependent and the fluid phase endocytic pathways (26Fivaz M. Vilbois F. Thurnheer S. Pasquali C. Abrami L. Bickel P.E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3989-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a possible reason for DNase X to be a GPI-anchored protein; the GPI anchor directs it to those pathways that support nonspecific endocytosis, thereby making it possible to intercept genetic invaders not only at the cell surface but also within endocytic vesicles. This idea is supported by the observation that the DNA-LL-37 complex is internalized into cells by a raft-dependent endocytic activity (16Sandgren S. Wittrup A. Cheng F. Jonsson M. Eklund E. Busch S. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17951-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Physiological Significance of the DNase X Barrier—It is a known fact that animal cells have the ability to take up foreign genes and express their encoded products, and this has been exploited by the development of transfection procedures suitable for experimental and clinical applications. However, the occurrence of spontaneous gene transfer is apparently harmful to animals, because the frequent integration and unregulated expression of foreign genes disturbs cellular activity and increases the risk of malignant transformation. Thus, suppression of foreign gene transfer by DNase X is probably important in maintaining healthy cell communities in vivo. A basal level of expression of DNase X is seen in several mammalian tissues (5Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Shiokawa D. Shika Y. Saito K. Yamazaki K. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have performed immunohistochemistry on several non-muscular tissues and observed that epithelial cells are generally positive for DNase X (data not shown). This shows that the DNase X membrane barrier is not restricted to muscle cells. A Possible Clinical Application of Breaking through the DNase X Barrier—Skeletal muscle is an attractive target for therapeutic gene transfer for several reasons; it is the most abundant tissue in the human body, it is accessible to many systems of gene delivery, and turnover of its cells is relatively slow so that the effects of transgene expression are long lasting (29Liu F. Liang K.W. Huang L. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 168-172PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, skeletal muscle is rare among tissues in incorporating naked DNA (30Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W. Acsadi G. Jani A. Felgner P.L. Science. 1990; 247: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar). Naked DNA transfer is a method of therapeutic gene delivery in which plasmid vectors are simply injected into a target tissue (31Herweijer H. Wolff J.A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 32Sawamura D. Akiyama M. Shimizu H. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 27: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because of its safety, simplicity, and lack of size limitation, naked DNA transfer is now receiving attention as an attractive gene delivery method for future gene therapies. Naked gene transfer has been tested in mice and shown to deliver genes into skeletal muscle (30Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W. Acsadi G. Jani A. Felgner P.L. Science. 1990; 247: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar); however, it is still of little practical use in humans because of its low efficiency (29Liu F. Liang K.W. Huang L. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 168-172PubMed Google Scholar). Although the factors limiting naked DNA transfer in vivo are not fully understood, our data strongly suggest that DNase X is a major barrier. Based on the results of this study, we propose that artificial control of DNase X activity using a specific inhibitor may provide a way to improve the results of naked gene transfer in future gene therapies.

In contrast with most IclR family members, TtgV, the transcriptional repressor of the TtgGHI efflux pump, exhibits multidrug recognition properties. A three-dimensional model of the effector domain of TtgV was generated based on the available three-dimensional structure of several IclR members, and a series of point mutants was created. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we determined the binding parameters of the most efficient effectors for TtgV and its mutant variants. All mutants bound biaromatic compounds with higher affinity than the wild-type protein, whereas monoaromatic compounds were bound with lower affinity. This tendency was particularly pronounced for mutants F134A and H200A. TtgVF134A bound 4-nitrotoluene with an affinity 13-fold lower than that of TtgV (17.4 ± 0.6 μm). This mutant bound 1-naphthol with an affinity of 5.7 μm, which is seven times as great as that of TtgV (40 μm). The TtgVV223A mutant bound to DNA with the same affinity as the wild-type TtgV protein, but it remained bound to the target operator in the presence of effectors, suggesting that Val-223 could be part of an intra-TtgV signal recognition pathway. Thermodynamic analyses of the binding of effectors to TtgV and to its mutants in complex with their target DNA revealed that the binding of biaromatic compounds resulted in a more efficient release of the repressor protein than the binding of monoaromatics. The physiological significance of these findings is discussed.

The DOT-T1E strain of Pseudomonas putida has the extraordinary capacity to withstand, and even grow in, the presence of high concentrations of organic solvents such as an aqueous solution saturated with toluene, a highly toxic compound (1.Ramos J.L. Duque E. Huertas M.J. Haïdour A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3911-3916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main mechanism underlying this resistance lies in the action of three RND (resistance-nodulation-cell Division) efflux pumps, termed TtgABC, TtgDEF, and TtgGHI (pump encoded by toluene tolerance genes ttgGHI) (2.Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which extrude organic solvents and other toxic compounds from the cells. These three efflux pumps show a high degree of similarity to the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, which is the best characterized member of this family (3.Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E.

Expression of the P. putida efflux pumps is controlled by transcriptional repressors; TtgR controls the expression of the ttgABC operon (8.Duque E. Segura A. Mosqueda G. Ramos J.L. Mol.

Ramos J.L. J. Biol.

D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5058-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Rintoul M.R. Cusa E. Baldoma L. Badia J. Reitzer L. Aguilar J. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5062-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). TtgV is a repressor that operates according to effector-mediated derepression. In the absence of effector, the protein is bound to the promotor DNA region repressing transcription. Effector binding to the TtgV-DNA complex is thought to produce an intramolecular signal that is transmitted to the DNA-binding domain, giving rise to protein dissociation from the operator. The RNA polymerase then accesses the promoter and transcribes the corresponding genes (11.Guazzaroni M.-E. Tera´n W. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The most efficient effectors in vivo are two-ring aromatic compounds such as 1-naphthol (1NL) 2The abbreviations used are: 1NL, 1-naphthol; BN, benzonitrile; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IND, indole; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; 4NT, 4-nitrotoluene; PDB, Protein Data Bank. and indole (IND) and one-ring compounds such as 4-nitrotoluene (4NT) and benzonitrile (BN) (12.Guazzaroni M.-E.

In the framework of structural genomic studies, two research groups reported the three-dimensional structure of two members of the IclR family members, that of the IclR-TM protein isolated from Thermotoga maritima (PDB: 1MKM (18.Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19183-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) and that of a regulator of unknown function purified from Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 (PDB: 2G7U). Both proteins consist of two well separated domains. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain is linked by a long helix to the conserved effector-binding domain. Furthermore, the coordinates of several individual effector-binding domains of IclR family members have been released on the PDB data base. However, none of the structures available forms a complex with a physiologically relevant ligand. A certain body of information is available on the interaction of multidrug-binding transcriptional regulators with effectors (19.Va´zquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20.Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In several cases, affinities do not correlate with the potential of the effectors to release protein in vitro or with their capacity to modulate gene expression in vivo (21.Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22.DiRusso C.C. Tsvetnitsky V. Højrup P. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33652-33659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This raises questions concerning the efficiency of effector-induced intramolecular signal transmission, an issue that has rarely been addressed. From structural studies, it appears that the effector structure determines with which set of amino acids the effector interacts in the binding pocket (23.Schumacher M.A. Millar M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which in turn determines the efficiency of signal transduction (21.Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether this efficiency can also be modulated by mutations in the regulator binding pocket, which would be of relevance for understanding the evolution of multidrug-binding proteins. Based on the three-dimensional homology model of TtgV, we have identified the potential effector-binding pocket of TtgV. Six site-directed alanine replacement mutants of amino acids located in this pocket were generated and characterized in this study. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of four different effectors to the wild type and to all TtgV mutants. Further experiments were aimed at evaluating the impact of the mutations on DNA binding and at characterizing the efficiency of the effector in triggering the release of the bound repressor. Site-directed Mutagenesis−TtgV mutants, in which amino acid residues at positions 118, 134, 140, 200, 204, and 223 were replaced by alanine and valine (positions 134 and 200), were generated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (24.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using plasmid pANA126 (10.Rojas A. Segura A. Guazzaroni M.E. Tera´n W. Hurtado A. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4755-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as a source of the ttgV wild-type allele. For each mutant, three PCRs were carried out. The initial two PCRs involved amplifications using the upstream primer (5′-CGCTCCACCGTTCAGAGAAT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 139–158 of ttgV coding sequence) and a mismatch primer covering the segment to be mutated as well as a PCR amplification using the downstream primer (5′-CTTGTCGACGGAGCTCGAAT-3′, nucleotides 791–810 of the ttgV coding sequence) and an oligonucleotide complementary to the mismatch primer. The following mismatch primers were used, and the mismatch codon is underlined: I118A, 5-AGACAAAGCGTACGTGCTT-3; F134A, 5′-GGTAGTGGCGCCGATTGGTA-3′; V140F, 5′-GTATTAACTTCCCCGCGCA-3′; V140A, 5′-GTATTAACGCGCCCGCCGCA-3′; H200A, 5′-TGGACGAGGCGATTGATGGC-3′; V204A, 5′-ATTGATGGCGCGTGCTCATT-3′; V223A: 5′-CTCGCGATCGCGATGCCGAG-3′. The resulting overlapping PCR products were annealed, supplemented with upstream and downstream primers, and submitted to the third PCR. For the I118A, F134A, and V160A mutations, the final PCR product was cut with BbvCI and BlnI, which produced a 223-bp fragment that was cloned into pANA126 linearized with the same enzymes. For the H200A, H200V, V204A, and V223A mutations, the final PCR product was digested with BlnI and PstI, and the resulting 200-bp fragment was equally cloned into pANA126. Cell Culture and Protein Expression−Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) was transformed with pANA126 bearing the wild-type ttgV allele (10.Rojas A. Segura A. Guazzaroni M.E. Tera´n W. Hurtado A. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4755-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and a series of pANA126 derivatives that encode the six different TtgV mutants. Cells were grown in 2-liter conical flasks with 500 ml of LB supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the culture reached a turbidity at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.7. Cultures were then transferred at 18 °C, and after growth for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 4000 g) and stored at –80 °C. Protein Purification−Cells from a 1-liter culture were suspended in 50 ml of buffer A (25 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing 10 units/ml Benzonase (Novagen, Madrid, Spain) and one tablet of Roche Applied Science Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were broken by two passages through a French press at 1000 p.s.i., and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was filtered and loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating column (GE Healthcare, St. Gibes, UK). His6-TtgV and its mutant variants were eluted with a 45–500 mm gradient of imidazole in buffer A. Protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. For storage at –80 °C, the samples were mixed with 10% (v/v) glycerol. The purity of the protein was between 90 and 95%, as judged from SDS-PAGE gels. Protein samples were aliquoted prior to freezing. All experiments were carried out with a single batch of each protein. Protein aliquots were thawed for immediate use, and excess protein was discarded. ITC−Measurements were made with a VP-Microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. The protein was thoroughly dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2. The buffer used in our initial analysis (12.Guazzaroni M.-E. Krell T. Felipe A. Ruiz R. Meng C. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20887-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in the present study differed in that the buffer used for the assays reported here included 10% (v/v) glycerol, which had a stabilizing effect on the protein, as well as a higher ionic strength and lower pH (7.2 rather than 8.0), which corresponds more closely to physiological conditions. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay. Stock solutions of 1NL, BN, 4NT, and IND at a concentration of 500 mm were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the solutions were diluted with dialysis buffer to final concentrations of 0.5 to 1 mm. The corresponding amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the protein sample. DNA duplex samples were prepared as described by Guazzaroni et al. (12.Guazzaroni M.-E. Krell T. Felipe A. Ruiz R. Meng C. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20887-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each titration involved a single 1.6-μl injection and a series of 4.8-μl injections of effectors into a 34–40 μm protein solution. The mean enthalpies measured from injection of the ligands into the buffer were subtracted from raw titration data prior to data analysis with a model for the binding of a ligand to identical independent sites of a macromolecule (MicroCal). Data analysis with this model produced satisfactory statistical data. Circular Dichroism−The CD spectra of each protein were recorded on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter (Great Dunmow, UK). Spectra in the far UV region (195–260 nm) were recorded in cylindrical quartz cells (0.02-cm path length) at a protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml. All protein solutions were dialyzed against the buffer used for ITC. EMSA−Experiments were carried out as described previously (12.Guazzaroni M.-E. Krell T. Felipe A. Ruiz R. Meng C. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20887-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One nm labeled DNA probe (∼1.5 × 104 cpm) was incubated with increasing concentration of TtgV (10–1500 nm) for 10 min at 30 °C in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2, containing 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Determination of MICs−P. putida DOT-T1E and isogenic mutants lacking one or several Ttg efflux pumps (2.Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25.Mosqueda G. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were grown overnight in LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were diluted 100-fold in LB supplemented with solvents at different concentrations and incubated for 20 h at 30 °C. The MIC value corresponds to the lowest concentration that reduced growth by more than 90%. Results are the average of at least five independent assays. Homology Modeling of TtgV and Identification of Amino Acids in the Effector-binding Site−We have previously shown that the IclR family of regulators comprises more than 500 members and that a distinct signature profile can be derived from the alignment of the whole set of proteins. In contrast with other families of regulators, the region that best defines the IclR family is not the DNA-binding domain but the effector-binding region (13.Molina-Henares A.-J. Krell T. Guazzaroni M.-E. Segura A. Ramos J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25.Mosqueda G. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure of TtgV can be closely aligned to the secondary structure elements found in the three-dimensional structure of the full-length IclR-TM protein of T. maritima (18.Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19183-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The TtgV sequence corresponding to the effector-binding domain was subsequently subjected to homology modeling with Geno3D (26.Combet C. Jambon M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) software. The model was based on the four following templates: T. maritima IclR-TM (PDB: 1MKM (18.Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19183-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), the effector-binding domains of E. coli IclR (PDB: 1TD5), the glyoxylate regulatory protein (PDB: 1TF1), and KdgR (PDB: 1YSP). These templates share 21–29% sequence identity with TtgV. The model obtained was submitted to What_check (27.Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) and was found to have an acceptable geometry. A Ramachandran plot showed that over 97% of the residues were in allowed regions. With the DALI algorithm, it was possible to superimpose the TtgV effector-binding domain model onto its templates with Cα root mean square deviation values between 1.8 and 2.4 Å. A surface representation of this model (Fig. 1A) shows a hydrophobic cavity with a volume of 1200 Å 3W. Tera´n, A. Felipe, M.-E. Guazzaroni, T. Krell, R. Ruiz, J. L. Ramos, and M.-T.

This model proposes that the ligand-binding pocket of TtgV is formed by a long loop connecting S2 with H3 and the β-sheet (Fig. 1B). A number of residues within this cavity were selected for mutagenesis according to two criteria: 1) their location and projection in the binding pocket of the model and 2) their conservation in TtgT, a transcriptional regulator sharing 56% sequence identity with TtgV, which has a very similar effector profile.3 Based on these criteria, 6 residues, Ile-118, Phe-134, Val-140, His-200, Val-204, and Val-233, were chosen (Fig. 1B), and alanine replacement mutants were generated in each position. In the model, 2 amino acids were located on β-strands: Ile-118 on S2 and Val-223 on S4. Residues Phe-134 and Val-140 were located on the loop connecting S2 with H3. The side chain of Phe-134 lies in the lower side of the effector-binding pocket and appears to play a central role in effector binding. Amino acids His-200 and Val-204 were mutated in the upper part of the pocket. Mutations in the predicted effector-binding pocket seemed not to alter the secondary protein structure of the mutant proteins, as deduced from analysis of mutant and wild-type TtgV proteins by far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. The spectra of all proteins could be closely superimposed (Fig. 2), indicating that the amino acid replacements did not significantly affect the protein secondary structure. Most Mutants Show Increased Affinities for Biaromatic Effectors but Bind Monoaromatic Compounds with Lower Affinity−We recently showed that TtgV effectors are primarily monoaromatic and biaromatic compounds (12.Guazzaroni M.-E. Krell T. Felipe A. Ruiz R. Meng C. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20887-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two representatives of each class, which are efficient effectors in vivo, the monoaromatic compounds 4NT and BN and the biaromatic effectors 1NL and IND, were chosen to study their binding parameters to native and mutant proteins using ITC. With this technique, all thermodynamic binding parameters can be determined in a single experiment. Fig. 3A shows the titration of TtgV and the F134A mutant with 4NT. The derived binding parameters are given in Table 1. Binding to the TtgV protein was enthalpy-driven (ΔH = –9.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) and characterized by a KD of 17.4 ± 0.6 μm. When the same experiment was repeated with the F134A mutant, the heat changes were much smaller, and affinity decreased by a factor of almost 13-fold (Fig. 3A and Table 1). An even more dramatic decrease in affinity for 4NT (27-fold) was obtained for the H200A mutant. For both mutants, enthalpy changes were reduced to –3.0 and –3.5 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1), which is consistent with fewer molecular interactions between the effector and these mutants. Affinity of the TtgVV140A, TtgVV204A, and TtgVV223A mutants was reduced by one-half to two-thirds of that of the native TtgV protein (Table 1). We also found that the single mutant TtgV I118A showed 2-fold higher affinity for 4NT than the wild-type protein.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters derived from the microcalorimetric titration of TtgV with one- and two-ring aromatic effectorsProteinEffectorKDKDwt/KDΔHEffectorKDKDwt/KDΔHμmkcal/molμmkcal/molWTaWild-type TtgV protein.4NT17.4 ± 0.61.0-9.7 ± 0.2BN50 ± 31.0-5.7 ± 0.1F134A4NT221 ± 80.08-3.0 ± 0.1BN330 ± 100.15-3.5 ± 0.1F134V4NTNo bindingBNNo bindingH200A4NT470 ± 200.04-3.5 ± 0.1BNNo bindingH200V4NT83 ± 100.2-13 ± 2BNNo bindingI118A4NT8.9 ± 0.42.0-8.6 ± 0.2BN46 ± 21.1-14 ± 1V140A4NT30 ± 10.6-6.6 ± 0.2BN85 ± 30.6-6.3 ± 0.5V140F4NT24 ± 10.7-5.9 ± 0.1BN77 ± 70.6-4.8 ± 0.8V204A4NT41 ± 20.4-14.3 ± 0.1BN71 ± 50.7-13 ± 4V223A4NT59 ± 30.3-6.4 ± 0.4BN58 ± 40.9-10 ± 2WT1NL40 ± 31.0-21 ± 3IND78 ± 71.0-6 ± 2F134A1NL5.7 ± 0.27.0-22.5 ± 0.6IND32 ± 22.4-12 ± 1F134V1NL8 ± 16.7-47 ± 2IND44 ± 61.8-11 ± 1H200A1NL2.9 ± 0.413.8-16 ± 3IND39 ± 32.0-2.9 ± 0.6H200V1NL5.1 ± 0.87.8-26.5 ± 0.1IND49 ± 52.0-13 ± 9I118A1NL24 ± 21.7-16 ± 1IND46 ± 21.7-16 ± 2V140A1NL6.5 ± 0.56.2-22 ± 1IND21 ± 23.7-14 ± 2V140F1NL2.5 ± 0.116-20.5 ± 0.5IND19 ± 24.1-15.7 ± 0.6V204A1NL23.8 ± 0.81.7-23 ± 1IND37 ± 22.1-10 ± 1V223A1NL6.2 ± 0.46.5-16.8 ± 0.6IND35 ± 22.2-9 ± 1a Wild-type TtgV protein. Open table in a new tab The tendency in affinity observed for 4NT was completely opposite when the same experiments were repeated with the biaromatic effector 1NL; all mutants showed a higher affinity than the wild-type protein (Table 1). This is illustrated in Fig. 3B for the wild type and the F134A mutant, which bound 1NL with KD values of 40.1 ± 3 and 5.7 ± 0.2 μm, respectively. All six mutants exhibited affinities for 1NL that were between 1.7- and 13.8-fold higher. Most interestingly, the gain in affinity for 1NL was most pronounced for the mutants that had the lowest affinity for the monoaromatic 4NT, i.e. the F134A and H200A mutants. To establish whether the differential binding behavior of these two effectors is a general phenomenon for mono- and biaromatic effectors, ITC experiments were conducted with two other representative effectors, namely BN (monoaromatic) and IND (biaromatic). In a manner exactly analogous to 4NT, all mutants except I118A had decreased affinity for the monoaromatic compound BN. This reduction in affinity was again particularly pronounced for F134A and H200A (Table 1). In analogy to 4NT, the enthalpic contribution to the binding of BN to F134A was again reduced, and no detectable affinity was observed for the H200A protein. As in the experiments with 1NL, all mutants were found to have increased affinities with respect to IND (Table 1). We hypothesized that the increase in affinity for bicyclic compounds is founded on the increase in the volume of the binding pocket caused by the replacement of bulky amino acids. To further study this unexpected finding, we generated mutants in which Phe-134 and His-200 were replaced by valine. The microcalorimetric titrations also showed that both mutants bound monocyclic compounds with decreased affinity when compared with the wild-type protein (Table 1). Although F134A and H200V bound bicyclic compounds with higher affinity than the parental wild-type protein, affinity was lower than that of the corresponding alanine replacement mutants. Therefore, these results support the above hypothesis. We have also generated the V140F change. In this case, we found that the decrease in the size of the pocket resulted in small changes in affinity for the 4NT, BN, and IND compounds when compared with the V140A mutant. In contrast, 1NL bound with a higher affinity to V140F than to V140A. This indicates that apart from the volume increase, there are other factors, such as the establishment of additional van der Waals interactions between Val-140 and 1-NL, that can influence effector recognition (3.Murakami S.

We also determined the affinity of the wild-type TtgV and its mutant variants when complexed with DNA for mono- and biaromatic effectors. We found, in agreement with previous findings (12.Guazzaroni M.-E. Krell T. Felipe A. Ruiz R. Meng C. Zhang X. Gallegos M.-T. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20887-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), that affinity of TtgV and TtgV mutants for their effectors when bound to DNA was not altered in a significant manner. To illustrate this, we performed experiments involving the titration of free and DNA-bound TtgVV223A with 1NL (Fig. 4). 1NL bound to free and DNA-bound TtgVV223A with similar affinities, as evidenced by their respective dissociation constants of 6.2 ± 0.4 and 4.8 ± 0.1 μm. Effect of Mutations on Affinity for Operator DNA−Subsequent experiments were aimed at elucidating whether the mutations in the effector-binding site altered the DNA binding characteristics of the mutants.

To date, the majority of kinases known to be involved in the early stages of TCR signaling are protein-tyrosine kinases such as Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70. Here we report a constitutive association between the TCR and a serine/threonine kinase, which was mediated through the membrane-proximal portion of CD3 ε. Mass spectrometry analysis of CD3 ε-associated proteins identified G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a candidate Ser/Thr kinase. Transient transfection assays and Western blot analysis verified the ability of GRK2 to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD3 ε within a cell. These findings are consistent with recent reports demonstrating the ability of certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and G proteins to physically associate with the α/β TCR. Because GRK2 is primarily involved in arresting GPCR signals, its interaction with CD3 ε may provide a novel means whereby the TCR can negatively regulate signals generated through GPCRs.

Wucherpfennig K.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Extracellular interactions between the α/β subunits of the TCR and peptide/major histocompatibility complexes initiate an intricate cascade of intracellular signals, which regulate T cell proliferation, effector function, and/or programmed cell death. Signaling events triggered through TCR interactions are controlled by a conserved amino acid motif, termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is found in the cytoplasmic domains of each of the CD3 invariant chains (reviewed in Refs. 2.Pitcher L.A. van Oers N.S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 3.Malissen B. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 7-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following TCR engagement, members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the invariant chain ITAMs (4.Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5.Lysechko T.L. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7807-7814Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bi-phosphorylated ITAMs subsequently associate with the Syk family PTK, ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70), via its tandem Src homology 2 domains (6.Bu J.Y. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Once associated, ZAP-70 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and catalytically activated. It then phosphorylates and/or interacts with additional signaling molecules, such as Vav, LAT, and SLP-76 (reviewed in Ref. 7.Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These initial tyrosine phosphorylation pathways are subsequently channeled into the activation of multiple serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases, including MAPKs, IκB kinases, and PKC family members, which ultimately regulate transcription factor activity. In addition to influencing T cell effector function or proliferation, the association of certain PTKs with the TCR invariant chains has been demonstrated to induce cross-talk between the TCR and certain chemokine receptors, thus enhancing T cell migration (8.Ottoson N.C. Pribila J.T. Chan A.S. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9.Kumar A. Humphreys T.D. Kremer K.N. Bramati P.S. Bradfield L. Edgar C.E. Hedin K.E. Immunity. 2006; 25: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Tyrosine phosphorylation of the invariant chain ITAMs is one of the earliest detectable signaling events to occur upon TCR engagement (10.Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P. Luong E. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18225-18230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent reports have identified a ligand-induced conformational change within the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ε that precedes ITAM phosphorylation and is independent of Src kinase activity (see Ref. 11.Gil D. Schamel W.W. Montoya M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Alarcon B. Cell. 2002; 109: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 12.Alarcon B. Gil D. Delgado P. Schamel W.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms resulting in this conformational change are still being elucidated, it is clear that engagement of the TCR results in the exposure of a proline-rich stretch (PRS) in the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ε, allowing it to complex the Src homology 3 domain-containing adaptor protein Nck (11.Gil D.

Schamel W.W. Immunity. 2007; 26: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to this interaction, CD3 ε is also capable of binding other signaling proteins, such as ZAP-70, CD3 ε-associated signal transducer, nucleolin, and topoisomerase II β (14.Yamazaki T.

Examples include the ability of the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ζ to bind UNC119, whereas the cytoplasmic domains of CD3 γ, δ, and ζ can bind to Fyn and the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (p85) (17.Cen O.

Using a variety of biochemical assays, we found that CD3 ε isolated from unstimulated T cells could constitutively associate with the Ser/Thr kinase, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). We also determined that TCR cross-linking resulted in interactions between CD3 ε and the Ser/Thr kinase hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice−All mice, on a C57BL/6 background, were housed in the specific pathogen-free facility on the north campus at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Buffer B consisted of Buffer A plus 1 m NaCl. Cellular preparations were generated from 6.5 × 109 murine thymocytes. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Pelleted cells were then resuspended in Buffer A supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, using a buffer volume 10 times the pellet size. The cells were Dounce-homogenized with 30 strokes and incubated on ice for an additional 15 min. Supernatants were obtained following a high speed spin (28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C), filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Millex™, Millipore), and applied to a 2.5 × 30-cm anion-exchange column linked to an FPLC™ system (Q-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences).

This was applied to a GST-BRS affinity column. Proteins retained on the affinity matrices were eluted with a linear salt gradient (Buffer B) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Forty five 2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed for kinase activity by GST-BRS pulldowns and kinase reactions as described.Acetone precipitations were performed by adding 15 μl of 20% SDS, 6 μl of dithiothreitol (1 m), 2 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml), and 1 ml of acetone (–80 °C) to 300 μl of sample. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000–15,000 × g. The pellet was air-dried, and silver staining was performed using GelCode® SilverSNAP® Stain Kit II (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Silver-stained bands were submitted to the Protein Chemistry Technology Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis.Transfections and siRNA Knockdown−HEK 293T cells were transfected using a standard CaPO4 method as described (23.Song W. Lahiri D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3609-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNA interference was carried out using a GRK2 human siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described (24.Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol.

All statistical comparisons were performed using a paired, two-tailed Student’s t test.RESULTSCD3 ε Associates with a Kinase Activity Independent of ZAP-70−Several signaling motifs are located in the cytoplasmic domains of the CD3 subunits, including the ITAMs and the PRS (Fig. 1A). These motifs, as well as other less well defined sequences, mediate protein-protein interactions with at least 10 distinct intracellular signaling molecules (2.Pitcher L.A. van Oers N.S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 chains could associate with protein kinases other than ZAP-70 (a PTK known to interact with the bi-phosphorylated ITAMs). Accordingly, GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic regions of CD3 γ, δ, ε, or ζ were used as affinity ligands to pull down associating proteins from unstimulated thymocyte lysates. After washing, the pulldowns were subjected to in vitro kinase reactions in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Associating proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. GST-ε associated with a kinase as indicated by the presence and intensity of a number of 32P-labeled proteins (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Only a modest amount of kinase activity was detected following GST-γ, -δ, or -ζ pulldowns (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 2, and 4).To address whether full-length CD3 ε could associate with a kinase activity in primary cells, CD3 ε was directly immunoprecipitated from murine thymocyte lysates and analyzed by kinase reactions. As seen, full-length CD3 ε also associated with a kinase activity (Fig. 1C, lane 1). A small amount of activity was detected in CD3 ζ immunoprecipitates, likely because CD3 ε and CD3 ζ can co-precipitate (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Importantly, the banding pattern of the 32P-labeled proteins detected in both the CD3 ε and CD3 ζ precipitates were distinct from those observed following ZAP-70 immunoprecipitations, suggesting the CD3 ε-associated kinase was not ZAP-70 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). No substantial kinase activity was observed in either the CD28 immunoprecipitations or in the normal mouse sera controls (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5).To confirm that ZAP-70 was not responsible for the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity, a Jurkat cell line deficient in ZAP-70 expression (P116) was utilized. ZAP-70, CD3 ε, and CD28 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates of unstimulated Jurkat or P116 Jurkat T cells, followed by in vitro kinase reactions in the presence of the exogenous substrate MBP (Fig. 1D). CD28 immunoprecipitations served as controls for background kinase activity. Kinase reactions performed using ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates from Jurkat T cells revealed a substantial level of kinase activity (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 3). This activity was reduced to background levels in the ZAP-70-deficient cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, an equivalent level of CD3 ε-associated kinase activity was detected in both the wild type and ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 5). These results indicated the CD3 ε-associated kinase was distinct and independent of ZAP-70.CD3 ε Constitutively Associates with a Serine/Threonine Kinase Distinct from the PKC, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, and MAPK Families−To determine the effects of TCR engagement on the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity, thymocytes were stimulated with α-CD3 ε for varying time points, followed by CD3 ε precipitations and kinase reactions. The level of CD3 ε-associated kinase activity increased by 16–21% after 10 and 30 min of stimulation, respectively (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). The constitutively associated kinase activity was reduced when cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, lane 4). When cultured cells were stimulated, the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity increased by 62% (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Such findings are in accordance with previously published reports and suggest that the kinase association was constitutive in thymocytes as a consequence of ongoing TCR interactions with self-peptide/major histocompatibility complex (21.van Oers N.S. Tao W. Watts J.D. Johnson P. Aebersold R. Teh H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5771-5780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 2CD3 ε constitutively associates with a serine/threonine kinase. A, thymocytes were either untreated or stimulated immediately ex vivo for 10 or 30 min with anti-CD3 ε mAbs (lanes 1–3). Alternatively, the cells were cultured at 37 °C for 4 h followed by CD3 ε stimulations (lanes 4–6). The cells were washed, lysed, and subjected to in vitro kinase reactions in the presence of MBP. Associated kinase activity was assessed by quantifying the amount of 32P-labeled substrate (MBP). B, indicated molecules were isolated and assayed by in vitro kinase (i.v.k) reactions. Lane 3, MBP was added as an exogenous substrate prior to performing the kinase reaction. C, indicated 32P-labeled bands (bands a–c) were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (n = 5 assays). D, CD3 ε was immunoprecipitated (IP) from murine thymocyte lysates. The samples were then incubated with the indicated kinase inhibitors or media alone (lanes 13 and 14) for 10 min at room temperature, and kinase reactions were performed in the presence or absence of MBP. Phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography (for piceatannol inhibition, n = 4 assays).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To elucidate the type(s) of kinase(s) associating with CD3 ε, the phosphoamino acid content of several of the prominent 32P-labeled bands and/or the exogenous substrate MBP was determined (Fig. 2B). A 1:1 ratio of 32P-serine and 32P-threonine was detected in all the proteins analyzed from CD3 ε immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2C, bands a and c). 32P-Tyrosine was only observed in ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, band b).Kinase reactions were also performed in the presence of selective kinase inhibitors. Piceatannol, a resveratrol analog that blocks the activity of certain Ser/Thr kinases as well as Syk family members, was the only inhibitor that consistently decreased the level of the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6) (25.Wang B.H. Lu Z.X. Polya G.M. Planta Med. 1998; 64: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26.Tsuchida M. Knechtle S.J. Hamawy M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6735-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions in the presence of wortmannin inhibited the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity to a small degree. However, this outcome was not consistent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CD3 ε associated with a Ser/Thr kinase that was distinct from the PKC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MAPK families.The Membrane-proximal BRS of CD3 ε Mediates Interactions between a Kinase Other than HPK1−Next we wanted to identify the region(s) within the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ε responsible for the Ser/Thr kinase association. Several sequence motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ε are known to mediate protein interactions. These include the previously mentioned PRS and ITAM, as well as a region that we termed the basic-rich stretch (BRS) because of its high lysine and arginine content (Fig. 1A; BRS, PRS, and ITAM) (11.Gil D.

GST-BRS was the only fusion protein that associated with the kinase activity (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3The BRS of CD3 ε associates with a kinase distinct from HPK1. A, GST fusion proteins containing the listed amino acid sequences were prepared and quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (CBB)(lower panel). Equivalent amounts of the indicated GST fusion protein were used as affinity ligands with thymocyte WCLs. Following kinase reactions, phosphoproteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography (upper panel). Association between a kinase activity and the BRS are representative of over a dozen independent experiments. B, thymocytes or lymphocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of the indicated mAbs. The cells were then washed, lysed, and HPK1, CD28, or CD3 ε were immunoprecipitated (IP) and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with α-HPK1 mAb. C, various GST fusion proteins were used in pulldown assays with lysates prepared from thymocytes (lanes 2–5) or lymphocytes (lanes 6–9). WCLs (lane 1), and the indicated pulldowns were immunoblotted with α-HPK1 Abs. B and C are representative of 2–3 independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the Ser/Thr kinase interacting with the BRS, Western blot analyses of CD3 ε immunoprecipitates were performed with mAbs against several Ser/Thr kinases known to be involved in TCR-mediated signaling events, including HPK1, PAK, PKG, PKC θ, NIK, MEKK1, ERK 1/2, and p38. Of these, only HPK1 was detected in the CD3 ε precipitate (Fig. 3B and data not shown). However, this interaction required α-CD3 ε stimulations (Fig. 3B, lane 7). Furthermore, HPK1 was not found in GST-BRS pulldowns from either unstimulated or stimulated T cells (Fig. 3C and data not shown). This indicated that another Ser/Thr kinase was constitutively associated with CD3 ε.Identification of GRK2 as a BRS-associated Kinase−Because we were unable to identify a BRS-associated, Ser/Thr kinase by Western blotting, a protein purification approach was used. Murine thymocyte homogenates were applied to a Q-Sepharose™ anion-exchange column. Proteins retained on the column were eluted with a linear salt gradient, and a total of 80 fractions was collected (Fig. 4A). An aliquot from each fraction, including the flow-through, was incubated with GST-BRS, followed by kinase reactions in the presence of MBP (Fig. 4B). PO4-MBP was then measured to determine which fractions contained the highest concentration of the associating kinase. Fractions 27–32 (eluting between 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCl) contained two closely spaced peaks of kinase activity (Fig. 4A, dashed line). These fractions were pooled and applied to a GST-BRS affinity column. Proteins retained on the affinity column were eluted with a linear salt gradient, and fractions containing the BRS-associated kinase activity were identified. This purification approach was found to result in a 137-fold enrichment of the CD3 ε-associated kinase activity (Table 1). Proteins in the affinity-purified fractions containing the enzymatic activity were precipitated with acetone, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained to visualize their protein content. Several protein bands were detected (Fig. 5A). Six bands (Fig. 5A, labeled a–f) were extracted, trypsin-digested, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. One peptide sequence (LLDSLQELYR, derived from band b at 80 kDa) corresponded to a protein known as GRK2 (Fig. 5A and Table 2). GRK2 is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in the negative regulation of GPCRs (reviewed in Ref. 27.Theilade J. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. Curr. Drug. Targets Immune. Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2001; 1: 139-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the affinity column active fractions submitted for mass spectrometry confirmed that GRK2 was present in these samples (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Many of the other proteins identified by mass spectrometry were DNA- or RNA-binding proteins (Table 2). Several of these proteins, such as DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box polypeptide 5, have been shown to be involved in RNA processing and translation, while others, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein L, are involved in CD45 isoform splicing (28.Cordin O.

Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The m7GpppN (cap 0) is formed by sequential action of three enzymatic activities. The 5′ triphosphate of the nacent RNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, the diphosphate end is capped with GMP by guanylyltransferase, and the GpppN cap is methylated at the N-7 position by (guanine N-7) methyltransferase (2.Shuman S.

Kinetoplastid mRNAs possess a unique hypermethylated cap structure called cap 4, which consists of cap 0 with 2′-O-methylations on the first four ribose sugars (AmAmCmUm), and additional base methylations on the first adenine (m6,6A) and the fourth uracil (m3U) (21.Bangs J.D.

These findings suggest that the kinetoplastid capping enzyme is capable of capping pol II as well as selected pol III transcripts, and that the recruitment of the capping enzyme to the site of transcription is likely to be different from other eukaryotes. Earlier studies indicated that the T. brucei capping apparatus resembles that of yeast, with separate triphosphatase (TbCet1), guanylyltransferase (TbCe1), and methyltransferase (TbCmt1) components. TbCet1 is a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase that catalyzes the removal of the terminal phosphate from triphosphate-terminated RNA (29.Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46182-46186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TbCe1 is mechanistically related to other cellular guanylyltransferases except that it contains an amino-terminal extension of 250 amino acids of unknown function (30.Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R.

The amino-terminal portion of TbCgm1 contains the defining sequence motifs of the covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI) involved in GTP binding and catalysis, except that the 139-amino acid interval between motifs I and III of TbCgm1 is slightly longer than that of other cellular guanylyltransferases. Motif I (127KADGTR132) contains the presumptive active site lysine to which GMP becomes covalently linked via a phosphoamide bond (8.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Residues that are essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae guanylyltransferase Ceg1 are conserved in TbCgm1, as well as those residues that make direct contacts with the GTP substrate, as deduced from the Chlorella virus guanylyltransferase-GTP cocrystal structure (8.Wang S.P.

The carboxyl-terminal portion of TbCgm1 contains an AdoMet binding motif (785VADLCSGRGG794), along with a number of key residues that make direct contacts with the GpppA cap as shown in the crystal structure of E. cuniculi methyltransferase (39.Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we show that purified recombinant TbCgm1 is a bifunctional capping enzyme with an amino-terminal guanylyltransferase (amino acids: 1–567) domain and a carboxyl-terminal (guanine N-7) methyltransferase domain (amino acids 717–1050). Each domain can function autonomously in vitro. TbCGM1 is essential for parasite growth. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of TbCGM1 shows reduced levels of cap 4 methylation on SL RNA. In contrast, down-regulation of TbCE1 and TbCMT1 were not essential for viability and did not affect SL RNA capping. Together, these results demonstrate that the bifunctional TbCgm1 is responsible for m7GpppN formation on the SL RNA. TbCGM1 Expression Plasmids−The TbCGM1 gene (accession number XP_840738.1) was PCR amplified from total T. brucei brucei genomic DNA (a gift of Laurie Read, SUNY at Buffalo) and cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of pET28-His-Smt3 vector (a gift of Chris Lima, Sloan-Kettering Institute) to fuse the 1050-amino acid TbCgm1 polypeptide in-frame to the amino-terminal His-Smt3 tag to obtain pET-HisSmt3-TbCGM1. The carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant, TbCGM1-(1–567), was constructed by PCR amplification using sense primer that introduced an NdeI site at a start codon and an antisense primer that introduced an XhoI site immediately downstream of the new stop codon at Glu568. TbCGM1-(717–1050) was constructed by PCR amplification using a sense primer that introduced a translation start codon at Leu716 with an NdeI site at the new start codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and then inserted into pET16b to obtain pET-TbCGM1-(1–567) and pET-TbCGM1-(717–1050), respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TbCgm1−pET-HisSmt3-TbCGM1 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(ROS2). A 1-liter culture amplified from a single transformant colony was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.4. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and incubated at 17 °C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 14,000 × g in a Beckman T14-50 rotor. The soluble lysate was applied to 1.5-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 15 ml of the same buffer and eluted stepwise with 3 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 0, 0.005, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 m imidazole. The recombinant His-Smt3-TbCgm1 was recovered in the 0.2 m imidazole eluate (0.5 mg of proteins per 1-liter culture). Two hundred micrograms of His-Smt3-TbCgm1 polypeptide was incubated with 60 μg of His-tagged ULP1 protease on ice for 1 h to cleave the NH2-terminal His-Smt3 tag. Sample was then diluted to 0.05 m imidazole in Buffer B and applied to 0.5 ml of nickel-agarose equilibrated with Buffer B. The native TbCgm1 protein was recovered in a flow-though fraction and concentrated to 0.17 mg/ml. All enzyme fractions were stored at –80 °C and thawed on ice just prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. TbCgm1-(1–567) and TbCgm1-(717–1050) proteins were expressed in 500-ml cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4. The cultures were adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and 2% ethanol, and incubated for 18 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A. Soluble lysates were prepared as described for full-length TbCgm1 and then applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Columns were washed with 10 ml of Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted stepwise with Buffer B containing 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 m imidazole. Recombinant proteins retained on the column and were recovered predominantly in the 0.2 m imidazole eluate (1.6 mg of TbCgm1-(1–567) and 3.3 mg of TbCgm1-(717–1050) per 500 ml of culture). Guanylyltransferase Assay−Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [α-32P]GTP, and enzyme were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were quenched with SDS loading buffer and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Enzyme-[32P]GMP adduct was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantified by scanning the gel with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Cap Methyltransferase Assay−Triphosphate-terminated poly(A) was synthesized (40.Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then converted to 32P cap-labeled poly(A) (m7GpppA terminated poly(A): boldface indicates radiolabeled phosphate) as described previously (41.Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of cap-labeled poly(A) was between 150 and 250 nt. Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6), 2 mm DTT, 20 μm AdoMet, 67 fmol of 32P cap-labeled poly(A), and either TbCgm1 or TbCgm1-(717–1050) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were adjusted to 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and incubated with 100 ng of nuclease P1 for 60 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (3 μl) were spotted onto a PEI cellulose thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate, which was developed with 0.45 m ammonium sulfate. The extent of methylation (m7GpppA/[m7GpppA + GpppA]) was quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a phosphorimager. RNA Interference, Cell Lines, and Growth Analysis−A SalI-HindIII fragment of TbCGM1 (500 bp, 2089–2587 nt) was cloned into XhoI-HindIII sites of the pZJMβ vector (42.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) to generate pZJM-TbCGM1. DNA fragments specific for TbCE1 (347 bp, 106–453 nt) and for TbCMT1 (410 bp, 565–975 nt) were PCR amplified and each fragment was inserted into XhoI-BamHI sites of the p2T7-177 vector (43.Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), to generate p2T7-TbCE1 and p2T7-TbCMT1, respectively. In all three RNAi constructs, expression of double-stranded RNA is under control of opposing tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters. RNAi constructs were linearized with NotI, phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and electroporated into procyclic T. brucei 29.13 cells, which constitutively express T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor proteins (44.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This procyclic cell line was cultivated in SDM 79 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 15 μg/ml G418. The transfectants were selected with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. For induction of RNAi, transfectants were cultured in medium supplemented with 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were counted at different time intervals under a microscope using a hemocytometer. Growth curves represent the log of the direct cell count multiplied by the dilution factor. Parasite density was maintained between 1 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells/ml. Control parasites were from clonal population of cells not treated with tetracycline but grown in parallel with tetracycline-induced cells. For preparation of whole cell extract, 2 × 108 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Research Product International)). For guanylyltransferase assay, aliquots (12.5 μg) of whole cell extract were incubated in reaction mixtures (16 μl) containing 12.5 mm MgCl2 and 4 μm [α-32P]GTP. The enzyme-GMP complex was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimager. For Western blot analysis, 25 μg of uninduced and induced TbCMT1-RNAi whole cell extracts were resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. TbCmt1 was detected using rabbit polyclonal serum against recombinant TbCmt1 protein (1:500 dilution, prepared by Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, PA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution), and developed using an ECL kit from Pierce. RNA Analysis−Total RNA was purified from 2 × 107 cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Primer extensions were performed with 2 μg of total RNA from both tetracycline induced and uninduced RNAi cells at the indicated time points using 0.1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primers: SL (35.Zamudio J.R.

Extension reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 100 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 90 min at 55 °C. Extension products were separated on a denaturing 20% PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimager. The anti-mouse 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine monoclonal antibody (anti-m2,2,7G) coupled to agarose beads was purchased from Novagen/Calbiochem. Total RNA (20 μg) extracted from both tetracycline-induced and -uninduced RNAi cells at the indicated time points were incubated with anti-m2,2,7G beads (20 μl) in 75 μl of buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 16°C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer D containing 0.2 m NaCl. Bound RNA was resuspended in 75 μl of buffer D. Five microliters of bound and unbound fractions were used for primer extension analysis as described above. For RNase H digestion, SL-(29–50), 5′-GCTTCTCATACCAATATAGTAC, and SL-(18–39), 5′-CAATATAGTACAGAAACTGTTC, oligonucleotides were used in addition to the SL-(35–56), U2, and 5S oligonucleotides listed above. TbCgm1 Is a Bifunctional Capping Enzyme with Guanylyltransferase and Methyltransferase Activities−To determine whether TbCgm1 has an intrinsic capping activity, we expressed the recombinant protein in E. coli as an NH2-terminal His-Smt3-tagged fusion protein to facilitate solubility and purification. The fusion protein was purified from soluble bacterial lysate by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with 0.2 m imidazole (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The native TbCgm1 protein was obtained by cleaving the fusion protein with His-tagged ULP1 protease, followed by removal of the His-smt3 tag by a second round of nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 3). TbCgm1 was further purified away from a ∼65-kDa bacteria contaminant (Fig. 1B, asterisk) by glycerol gradient sedimentation (see below). The guanylyltransferase reaction entails two sequential nucleotidyl transfer steps. In the first step, nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate of GTP results in formation of a covalent EpG intermediate and liberation of PPi. The guanylyltransferase activity of TbCgm1 was evinced by label transfer from [α-32P]GTP to the TbCgm1 polypeptide to form a SDS-stable nucleotidyl-protein adduct that migrated as a 116-kDa species (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Note that three other polypeptides in the range of 60–100 kDa were labeled with GMP to a lesser extent, which suggested that these were proteolytic fragments of TbCgm1. We conclude that TbCgm1 is a covalent nucleotidyltransferase. The methyltransferase activity of TbCgm1 was assayed by conversion of 32P cap-labeled poly(A) to methylated cap-labeled poly(A) in the presence of AdoMet. Digestion by nuclease P1 liberated a labeled species that co-migrated with m7GpppA, generated in a parallel reaction mixture containing purified yeast Abd1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). The activity was dependent on AdoMet and the inclusion of AdoHcy was inhibitory to the reaction (Fig. 1D, lane 4). We further verified that methylation occurs at the terminal guanosine nucleoside by digesting the reaction products with nucleotide pyrophosphatase, a nuclease that cleaves between the γ and β phosphates in the capped structure. Both the TbCgm1 and Abd1 reaction products liberated m7Gp (data not shown). We conclude that TbCgm1 catalyzes methylation at the N-7 position of the terminal cap guanosine to form cap 0. The native size of TbCgm1 was gauged by sedimentation through a 15–30% glycerol gradient and the fractions were assayed for enzyme-GMP formation and methyltransferase activities. The guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities co-sedimented as a 6.7 S peak (Fig. 1E). Based on the predicted molecular weight, we conclude that TbCgm1 is a monomeric protein in solution. The Amino-terminal Domain of TbCgm1 Can Function Autonomously as Guanylyltransferase−To evaluate whether the amino-terminal portion of TbCgm1 constituted an autonomous functional guanylyltransferase domain, we expressed the TbCgm1 segment from residues 1–567 as a His-tagged fusion protein (Fig. 2A). The choice of residue 567 as a domain breakpoint was based on the location of motif VI in TbCgm1, which is situated at residues 491–500 in TbCgm1 (Fig. 1A). In most cellular guanylyltransferases, motif VI is positioned ∼50 amino acids upstream of the carboxyl-terminal end (20.Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol.
