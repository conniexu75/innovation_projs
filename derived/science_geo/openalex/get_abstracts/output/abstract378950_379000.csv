https://openalex.org/W2119043140,"The existence of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function of extracellular miRNAs remain unclear. Here, we show that miRNAs are released through a ceramide-dependent secretory machinery and that the secretory miRNAs are transferable and functional in the recipient cells. Ceramide, whose biosynthesis is regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), triggers secretion of small membrane vesicles called exosomes. The decreased activity of nSMase2 with a chemical inhibitor, GW4869, and a specific small interfering RNA resulted in the reduced secretion of miRNAs. Complementarily, overexpression of nSMase2 increased extracellular amounts of miRNAs. We also revealed that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport system is unnecessary for the release of miRNAs. Furthermore, a tumor-suppressive miRNA secreted via this pathway was transported between cells and exerted gene silencing in the recipient cells, thereby leading to cell growth inhibition. Our findings shed a ray of light on the physiological relevance of secretory miRNAs.

It has been well known that extracellular RNAs circulate in the blood of healthy people and diseased patients with sufficient integrity, although ribonuclease is present in both plasma and serum (1Fleischhacker M. Schmidt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 181-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The spectrum of RNAs whose presence was demonstrated in plasma and other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, extends from housekeeping genes to fetal genes detected in pregnant women and genes overexpressed in a variety of different tumors (2El-Hefnawy T. Raja S. Kelly L. Bigbee W.L. Kirkwood J.M. Luketich J.D. Godfrey T.E. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To explain the stability of circulating RNAs, it was suggested that extracellular RNAs are included within lipoprotein vesicles. Indeed, exogenous RNAs added to plasma or blood are immediately degraded, whereas endogenous plasma RNAs are stable for hours under the same conditions (3Tsui N.B. Ng E.K. Lo Y.M. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Moreover, the treatment of some detergents results in immediate degradation of plasma extracellular RNAs, apparently due to disruption of the lipid vesicles. These findings clearly indicate that extracellular RNAs are packaged in some kinds of secretory particles including apoptotic bodies and exosomes, and thus, they are protected from dominantly existing ribonucleases. Apoptotic bodies are small membranous particles released during programmed cell death (4Hasselmann D.O. Rappl G. Tilgen W. Reinhold U. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 1488-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and exosomes are small intraluminal vesicles (50–100 nm in diameter) of multivesicular bodies (MVB) 3The abbreviations used are: MVBmultivesicular bodiesAlixALG-2 interacting proteinESCRTendosomal sorting complex required for transportmiRNAmicroRNAnSMase2neutral sphingomyelinase 2siRNAsmall interfering RNAQRT-PCRquantitative real time PCRCMconditioned medium. released on exocytic fusion of MVB with plasma membranes (5Cocucci E.

Currently, accumulating evidence suggests that these secretory vesicles can function as intercellular transmitters to convey their contents, in particular, microRNA (miRNA) (6Valadi H. Ekström K.

Recent studies reported that extracellular exosomal miRNAs were transferred into other cells and that apoptotic bodies delivered miR-126 into endothelial cells (9Zernecke A. Bidzhekov K. Noels H.

Han J. Siomi M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Not only do they inhibit translation of their target genes, they also degrade the target mRNAs through recognition of imperfect complementary sites, usually located in the 3′-untranslated regions of the target mRNAs, endowing miRNAs with the capacity to regulate numerous biological processes. Over the past several years, it was evident that dysregulations of many kinds of miRNAs have been linked to the initiation and progression of human cancer (11Croce C.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amounts of secretory miRNAs are up-regulated in the plasma of patients bearing tumors, including B cell lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer (12Lawrie C.H.

Thus, detection and monitoring of tumors are now becoming possible by the evaluation of tumor-derived secretory miRNAs. In this study, we have shown that secretion of miRNAs is controlled by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which is known as a rate-limiting enzyme of ceramide biosynthesis. Furthermore, we provide evidences that miRNAs secreted from donor cells can be taken up and function in the recipient cells. These findings propose a novel mechanism of intercellular communication mediated by secretory miRNAs. Rabbit polyclonal anti-nSMase2 (H-195) (sc-67305), goat polyclonal anti-Alix (Q-19) (sc-49268), and donkey anti-goat IgG (horseradish peroxidase) (sc-2020) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ROCK1 (ab36746) was from Abcam. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin, clone C4 (MAB1501), was from Millipore. Anti-CD63 monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were included in the Amersham Biosciences ECL PLUS Western blotting reagents pack (RPN2124) (GE HealthCare). Synthetic Caenorhabditis elegans miRNA cel-miR-39 was synthesized by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Synthetic hsa-miR-146a (pre-miR-146a) was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The duplexes of each small interfering RNA (siRNA), targeting human nSMase2 mRNA (s30925; target sequences of 5′-GGAGGUGUUUGACAAGCGAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UCGCUUGUCAAACACCUCCtg-3′), and negative control 1 (NC1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems, and an siRNA specific for human ALG-2 interacting protein (Alix) mRNA (target sequences of 5′-GAACCUGGAUAAUGAUGAAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UUCAUCAUUAUCCAGGUUCdTdT-3′) was purchased from Sigma-Genosys. GW4869 was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Cisplatin was obtained from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland). Geneticin was purchased from Invitrogen. HEK293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line (CRL-1573), and COS-7 cells, an African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell line (CRL-1651), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PC-3M-luc cells (Xenogen) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Prior to collection of culture medium, HEK293 and COS-7 cells were washed three times with Advanced RPMI containing antibiotic-antimycotic and 2 mml-glutamine (medium A), and the medium was switched to fresh medium A. After incubation during 3 days, medium A was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. To thoroughly remove cellular debris, the supernatant was centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 35 min at room temperature. Then the conditioned medium was used for miRNA extraction and functional assays as well as exosome isolation. For exosome preparation, the conditioned medium was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with 11 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and after ultracentrifugation, they were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The exosome fraction was measured for its protein content using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Isolation of extracellular and cellular miRNAs was performed using the mirVana isolation kit (Ambion). One hundred μl of conditioned medium or cell lysate was diluted with 200 μl of lysis/binding solution. After a 5-min incubation, 20 μl of miRNA homogenate additive and 1 μl of 1 nm cel-miR-39 were added to each aliquot, followed by vortex for 30 s and incubation on ice for 10 min. Subsequent phenol extraction and filter cartridge work were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of RNAs was performed by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Prior to the analysis, total RNAs were prepared with the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To evaluate whether small RNAs were present inside the exosomes, RNase mixture (Ambion) was added to conditioned medium at a final concentration of 5 units/ml RNase A and 200 units/ml RNase T1 and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Small RNAs were purified using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) as described above. The method for QRT-PCR has been previously described (13Mitchell P.S. Parkin R.K. Kroh E.M. Fritz B.R. Wyman S.K. Pogosova-Agadjanyan E.L. Peterson A. Noteboom J. O'Briant K.C. Allen A. Lin D.W. Urban N. Drescher C.W. Knudsen B.S. Stirewalt D.L. Gentleman R. Vessella R.L. Nelson P.S. Martin D.B. Tewari M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10513-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (6453) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out in 96-well plates using the 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were done in triplicate. All of the TaqMan microRNA assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems. cel-miR-39 and hRNU6 were used as invariant control for conditioned medium and cell, respectively. The concentrations of extracellular miRNAs were calculated based on their Ct values normalized by those of cel-miR-39, which was spiked in each aliquot of QRT-PCR reaction at 1 nm. Conditioned medium was incubated with magnetic beads (Invitrogen) coated with purified anti-CD63 antibody or mouse IgG1 control antibody (Millipore) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, miRNAs were extracted and applied to QRT-PCR. SDS-PAGE gels (SuperSep Ace 5–20%, 194-15021, Wako) were calibrated with Precision Plus protein standards (161-0375) (Bio-Rad), and anti-CD63 (1:100), anti-nSMase2 (1:200), anti-Alix (1:100), anti-ROCK1 (1:200), and anti-actin (1:1,000) were used as primary antibodies. The dilution ratio of each antibody is indicated in parentheses. Two secondary antibodies (peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies) were each used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (RPN2132) (GE HealthCare), and luminescent images were analyzed by a LuminoImager (LAS-3000; Fuji Film Inc.). psiRNA-LucGL3 was purchased from InvivoGen. Primary-miR-143 and primary-miR-146a expression vectors were purchased from TaKaRa BIO. A full-length human nSMase2 cDNA was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech). Primary miRNAs (pri-miR-155, pri-miR-16, and pri-miR-21) were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into the downstream of cytomegalovirus promoter in pIRES2-EGFP. For luciferase-based reporter gene assays, pLucNeo was constructed by inserting a firefly luciferase gene derived from pGL3-control (Promega) into pEYFP-1 vector (Clontech) at the BglII and AflII sites. Sensor vector for miR-146a was constructed by introducing tandem binding sites with perfect complementarity to miR-146a, separated by a four-nucleotide spacer into the NotI site of psiCHECK2 (Promega). The sequences of the binding site are as follows: 5′-AAACCTAGAGCGGCCGCAACCCATGGAATTCAGTTCTCAAAGAATTCTTAACCCATGGAATTCAGTTCTCAGCGGCCGCTGGCCGCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGCGGCCAGCGGCCGCTGAGAACTGAATTCCATGGGTTAAGAATTCTTTGAGAACTGAATTCCATGGGTTGCGGCCGCTCTAGGTTT-3′ (antisense). The “seed” sequence of miR-146a is indicated in bold and italics. In a mutated miR-146a sensor vector, the seed sequence, AGTTCTCA, was displaced with CTGGAGAC. All the plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid transfections to HEK293 and COS-7 cells were performed using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Cell numbers and amounts of plasmids for each transfection were determined according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections of siRNA and miRNA were accomplished with DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amounts of small RNAs for each transfection were equally adjusted by the addition of NC1. Stable HEK293 cell lines expressing firefly luciferase or miR-146a were generated by selection with 300 μg/ml Geneticin. HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pLucNeo vector or pri-miR-146a expression vector at 90% confluency in 24-well dishes using a Lipofectamine LTX reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Twelve h after the transfection, the cells were replated in a 10-cm dish followed by a 3-week selection with the antibiotic. Ten surviving single colonies were picked up from each transfectant and were then cultured for another 2 weeks. The cells expressing the largest amount of firefly luciferase or miR-146a among transfectants were used as luciferase stably expressing cells and miR-146a stably expressing cells, respectively. HEK293 and COS-7 cells were cultured at a density of 5 × 104 and 1 × 104 cells/well, respectively, in 96-well tissue culture plates overnight, and miRNA transfections or the addition of conditioned medium were performed as described under the legend for FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7. The cells were harvested, and Renilla luciferase activity was measured and normalized by firefly luciferase activity(16Takeshita F. Patrawala L. Osaki M. Takahashi R.U. Yamamoto Y. Kosaka N.

All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times, and the most representative results are shown.FIGURE 6Secretory small RNAs can be transferred to recipient cells.A, treatment with conditioned medium enriched in luciferase siRNA down-regulated luciferase activity. HEK293 cells stably transduced with firefly luciferase were incubated with the indicated medium for 3 days. The conditioned medium was prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with psiRNA-LucGL3 or empty vector. The luciferase siRNA was not detected in RPMI medium and control CM as well as miR-146a CM using QRT-PCR, whereas luciferase siRNA (siLuc) CM contained 200 pm luciferase siRNA as calculated under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of miR-146a in miR-146a CM was 123 pm. The cells were harvested and applied to luciferase reporter assay. The values on the y axis are depicted relative to firefly luciferase activity of RPMI medium-treated cells, which is defined as 100%. B, the diagram shows a reporter assay for testing the direct regulation of target gene expression by extracellular miRNAs. C, extracellular miR-146a derived from COS-7 and HEK293 cells suppressed luciferase activity of the sensor vector. COS-7 cells transfected with miR-146a sensor vector were used as recipient cells. The recipient cells were incubated in the conditioned medium containing extracellular miRNAs of the indicated concentrations. After a 2-day incubation, luciferase reporter assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, miR-146a did not reduce luciferase activity from the mutated sensor vector.

Donor COS-7 cells transfected with pri-miR-146a expression vector were incubated in the presence (lane 2) or absence of 10 μm GW4869 for 3 days. The conditioned medium from COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector was used as a control (lane 1). GW4869-untreated conditioned medium enriched in miR-146a was divided into two aliquots, one of which was treated with 10 μm GW4869 (lane 3) and the other of which was not treated (lane 4) before the transfer to recipient cells.

The following day, the cells were transfected with mature miRNAs or were incubated with a conditioned medium. Twenty-four h later, the culture medium of the transfected cells was switched to medium A, whereas the conditioned medium was not changed. After a 3-day culture, cells were harvested for the measurement of firefly luciferase activity. On day 0, HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. The following day, the cells were transfected with nSMase2 expression vector or were treated with 10 μm cisplatin. On day 2, the cells were applied to an Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega). After a 12-h incubation, the fluorescence of each well was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm using Envision (Wallac). To reveal the physiological roles of extracellular miRNAs, we investigated the mechanism of their secretion and whether or not secretory miRNAs can function in cells beyond their own cell origin. Based on the observation that expression patterns of miRNAs in a cell and culture medium are well correlated (7Skog J. Würdinger T. van Rijn S. Meijer D.H. Gainche L. Sena-Esteves M. Curry Jr., W.T. Carter B.S. Krichevsky A.M. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (3730) Google Scholar, 17Gibbings D.J. Ciaudo C. Erhardt M. Voinnet O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that up-regulation of cellular miRNAs leads to an increase of extracellular miRNAs in a conditioned medium. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the amount of extracellular and cellular miRNAs (miR-16, -21, -143, -146a, and -155) in HEK293 and COS-7 cells transfected with each primary miRNA expression vector or empty vector. We avoided the use of synthetic analogues of mature miRNAs for this overexpression experiment because they might persist in the medium and interfere with accurate quantification of extracellular miRNAs. The transfected cells were thoroughly washed prior to the medium change to remove any surplus liposome left by the original transfection. QRT-PCR analysis showed that secretion of the miRNAs was enhanced in proportion to their cellular amounts induced by the transfections of pri-miRNA vectors (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. 1A). To exactly estimate what percentages of the miRNAs were excreted, we re-evaluated cellular amounts of the miRNAs by the same normalization method as the extracellular miRNAs (supplemental Fig. 1B). As a result of the calculations, the amounts of secreted miRNAs were quite lower in conditioned medium than in parental cells. The ratios of secreted miRNAs/cellular miRNAs are shown as follows: endogenous miR-16, 1.21 ± 0.12%; endogenous miR-21, 1.62 ± 0.63%; exogenous miR-143, 2.57 ± 1.03%; exogenous miR-146a, 15.6 ± 1.62%; exogenous miR-155, 1.38 ± 0.84%. Additionally, siRNAs targeting luciferase were also released from the siRNA-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B). We further observed that endogenous miR-16 and -21 as well as overexpressed miR-146a time-dependently accumulated in the conditioned medium during 96 h (Fig. 1C). We observed by microscopic examination that these cells did not suffer from any damage and that they maintained the original cell shape. Moreover, the treatment of an apoptotic inducer, cisplatin, did not increase the miRNA secretion (data not shown). These findings strongly suggest that living cells can actively secrete endogenous and exogenous miRNAs as well as artificial small RNAs. It was revealed that exosomes can transfer some of their contents to other cell types, and importantly, that miRNAs exist in exosomes and are protected from RNases (6Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8980) Google Scholar). First, we isolated exosome fractions from HEK293 cells by the standard ultracentrifugation method. Consistent with the previous investigations, these exosome fractions were positive for a surface marker of exosome, CD63 (Fig. 2A). To characterize the exosomal RNAs, we conducted an electrophoresis of total RNA extracted from conditioned medium, exosomes, and their donor cells. Conditioned medium and exosomes applied to this analysis were prepared from the supernatant of the same numbers of donor cells. The Bioanalyzer 2100 profiles shown in Fig. 2B revealed that conditioned medium and exosome fractions share a very similar size-distribution pattern and expression intensity, which shows the enrichment of small sized RNAs, whereas the cellular RNA profile indicates two conspicuous peaks of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs and a broad peak of small RNAs. These data suggest that small RNAs are preferentially released from the cells and that most of the secreted RNAs are contained in exosome fractions. To evaluate whether extracellular miRNAs are contained inside exosomes, the conditioned medium from HEK293 cells was exposed to RNases before RNA extraction. As a result, endogenous miR-21 still existed even after 30 min of treatment with RNase A and T1 (Fig. 2C). Contrarily, exogenously added synthetic cel-miR-39 was completely decomposed by the same treatment (supplemental Fig. 2). Moreover, immunoprecipitant obtained with an anti-CD63 antibody was enriched in endogenous miR-16 and -155 as well as overexpressed luciferase siRNA (Fig. 2, D and E). These results collectively indicate that extracellular miRNAs are contained within the CD63-positive exosomes and therefore are protected from external RNases by the surrounding membrane. Exosomes are produced in MVB and released from a variety of cells. They are originally thought to function to dispose of cellular garbage, including degraded protein, but now they draw much attention as a cell-cell communication tool (5Cocucci E. Racchetti G. Meldolesi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 43-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of exosomes has appeared to associate with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery because the machinery is highly involved in the exocytosis of some cellular contents and various viruses. On the other hand, Trajkovic et al. (18Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar) reported that exosomes are released independently from ESCRT machinery but triggered by sphingolipid ceramide. Thus, it is still unclear whether many types of exosomal contents, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, are released by the same mechanism. To address the question as to whether miRNA secretion is regulated by the ceramide-dependent pathway or the ESCRT pathway, we first treated HEK293 cells with an nSMase inhibitor, GW4869, which is known to inhibit ceramide biosynthesis (18Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). As a result of this treatment, extracellular endogenous miR-16 and exogenous miR-146a were dose-dependently reduced, whereas their cellular expression levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3A; supplemental Fig. 3). Consistently, exosomal protein was also decreased by the treatment of GW4869 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a reduction in the signals of an exosome marker, CD63, was observed by immunoblotting of exosomes purified from the supernatant of the same number of GW4869-treated HEK293 cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Nevertheless, the amounts of CD63 protein were unchanged in exosomes from GW4869-treated cells when the same amounts of exosomal proteins were analyzed (Fig. 3C, lower panel). These data show that the treatment of GW4869 reduces the amount of exosomes released into the conditioned medium but does not modify exosomal protein composition. We next employed an RNA interference approach to knock dow"

A severe limitation of atom chips, however, is that techniques to control atomic interactions and to generate entanglement have not been experimentally available so far. Such techniques enable chip-based studies of entangled many-body systems and are a key prerequisite for atom chip applications in quantum simulations, quantum information processing, and quantum metrology. Here we report experiments where we generate multi-particle entanglement on an atom chip by controlling elastic collisional interactions with a state-dependent potential. We employ this technique to generate spin-squeezed states of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and show that they are useful for quantum metrology. The observed 3.7 dB reduction in spin noise combined with the spin coherence imply four-partite entanglement between the condensate atoms and could be used to improve an interferometric measurement by 2.5 dB over the standard quantum limit. Our data show good agreement with a dynamical multi-mode simulation and allow us to reconstruct the Wigner function of the spin-squeezed condensate. The techniques demonstrated here could be directly applied in chip-based atomic clocks which are currently being set up."
https://openalex.org/W2075122875,"Human maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) are small intestinal enzymes that work concurrently to hydrolyze the mixture of linear alpha-1,4- and branched alpha-1,6-oligosaccharide substrates that typically make up terminal starch digestion products. MGAM and SI are each composed of duplicated catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal, which display overlapping substrate specificities. The N-terminal catalytic domain of human MGAM (ntMGAM) has a preference for short linear alpha-1,4-oligosaccharides, whereas N-terminal SI (ntSI) has a broader specificity for both alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-oligosaccharides. Here we present the crystal structure of the human ntSI, in apo form to 3.2 A and in complex with the inhibitor kotalanol to 2.15 A resolution. Structural comparison with the previously solved structure of ntMGAM reveals key active site differences in ntSI, including a narrow hydrophobic +1 subsite, which may account for its additional substrate specificity for alpha-1,6 substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2044224053,"The Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial cells, both during development and tumorigenesis. Although KLF4 functions as a tumor suppressor in several tissues, including the colon, the role of KLF4 in breast cancer is less clear. Here, we show that KLF4 is necessary for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype in non-transformed MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. KLF4 silencing led to alterations in epithelial cell morphology and migration, indicative of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistent with these changes, decreased levels of KLF4 also resulted in the loss of E-cadherin protein and mRNA. Promoter/reporter analyses revealed decreased E-cadherin promoter activity with KLF4 silencing, while chromatin immunoprecipitation identified endogenous KLF4 binding to the GC-rich/E-box region of this promoter. Furthermore, forced expression of KLF4 in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell line was sufficient to restore E-cadherin expression and suppress migration and invasion. These findings identify E-cadherin as a novel transcriptional target of KLF4. The clear requirement for KLF4 to maintain E-cadherin expression and prevent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells supports a metastasis suppressive role for KLF4 in breast cancer.

Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). KLF4 is primarily regarded as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, repressing a multitude of genes that promote proliferation while at the same time up-regulating inhibitors of proliferation (2Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). KLF4 also plays a crucial role in differentiation during organogenesis of various tissues such as the skin, colon, and eye (3Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat.

With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells, KLF4 has gained recognition as one of the “pluripotency genes” that can reprogram somatic cells into a stem cell-like state (6Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19041) Google Scholar), acting in the capacity to maintain self-renewal (7Jiang J. Chan Y.S. Loh Y.H. Cai J.

Given its stem cell-promoting activity and its ability to regulate growth and differentiation during development, it is not surprising that KLF4 also plays various roles in tumorigenesis. The frequent loss of KLF4 expression in gastric and colorectal cancers has led to studies revealing a tumor-suppressive role for this factor in these and other tissues (8Dang D.T. Bachman K.E.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of KLF4 in the skin leads to squamous cell carcinoma (14Huang C.C. Liu Z. Li X. Bailey S.K. Nail C.D. Foster K.W. Frost A.R. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the role of KLF4 during the progression of breast cancer is not well defined. Immunohistochemical studies have revealed that KLF4 expression can be increased and undergo altered localization in DCIS of the breast (15Foster K.W. Frost A.R. McKie-Bell P. Lin C.Y. Engler J.A. Grizzle W.E. Ruppert J.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6488-6495PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may act as an oncogene in this tissue. This is further supported by the association of nuclear KLF4 with an aggressive breast cancer phenotype (16Pandya A.Y. Talley L.I. Frost A.R. Fitzgerald T.J. Trivedi V. Chakravarthy M. Chhieng D.C. Grizzle W.E. Engler J.A. Krontiras H. Bland K.I. LoBuglio A.F. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. Ruppert J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, Akaogi et al. reported that a review of nine independent, publicly available gene expression data sets revealed decreased KLF4 mRNA expression in breast cancers when compared with normal breast. In addition, KLF4 was inversely correlated with increasing tumor grade in 15 independent gene expression array analyses of breast cancer samples (17Akaogi K. Nakajima Y. Ito I. Kawasaki S. Oie S.H. Murayama A. Kimura K. Yanagisawa J. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression of KLF4 protein is also relatively low in breast cancer cell lines compared with non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (18Miller K.A. Eklund E.A. Peddinghaus M.L. Cao Z. Fernandes N. Turk P.W. Thimmapaya B. Weitzman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42863-42868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, there is evidence that KLF4 can act in a tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive manner depending on the tissue of study. To reconcile these findings, Rowland et al. proposed a cell type-specific functionality for KLF4, wherein its ability to act as a tumor suppressor versus oncogene is largely context-specific and depends upon the relative expression of p21 and p53 (19Rowland B.D. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Of note, it remains unknown if KLF4 may regulate other properties of tumors, such as metastatic capacity. Furthermore, the specific function of KLF4 in non-transformed mammary epithelium has not been previously addressed. Recent studies identifying transcriptional targets of KLF4 reveal that it promotes the expression of epithelial-specific cytokeratins in colon cancer cells (20Chen X. Whitney E.M. Gao S.Y. Yang V.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may sustain an epithelial phenotype. Many of these keratins are suppressed during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (21Paccione R.J. Miyazaki H. Patel V. Waseem A. Gutkind J.S. Zehner Z.E. Yeudall W.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2894-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a process defined by a loss of epithelial-specific characteristics and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. Although EMT is an essential step during development (22Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3223) Google Scholar, 23Yang J. Weinberg R.A. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 818-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), loss of epithelial characteristics in tumors is associated with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis, implicating EMT as a mechanism for tumor progression and metastasis (24Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin. In fact, silencing of E-cadherin alone in epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a full EMT (25Lehembre F. Yilmaz M. Wicki A. Schomber T. Strittmatter K. Ziegler D. Kren A. Went P. Derksen P.W. Berns A. Jonkers J. Christofori G. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2603-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This loss is functionally significant, because direct suppression of E-cadherin (CDH1 gene) causes a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and increased invasion and motility (26Thompson E.W. Torri J. Sabol M. Sommers C.L. Byers S. Valverius E.M. Martin G.R. Lippman M.E. Stampfer M.R. Dickson R.B. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is the prototypical cadherin, modulating intercellular adhesions and signaling involving catenins (27Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 28Gottardi C.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). While much of the literature ascribes an anti-proliferative function to E-cadherin, there is also a requirement for sustained E-cadherin to maintain proliferation of normal epithelial cells (33Boussadia O. Kutsch S. Hierholzer A. Delmas V. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Liu W.F. Nelson C.M. Pirone D.M. Chen C.S. J.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, loss of E-cadherin has been correlated with a more invasive phenotype and metastatic disease progression. Early loss of E-cadherin is observed during tumor progression in lobular disease, whereas ductal breast carcinomas have more variable expression (36Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Even when primary tumors maintain E-cadherin expression, loss of this protein in metastatic lesions has been observed (37Wu J.M. Fackler M.J. Halushka M.K. Molavi D.W. Taylor M.E. Teo W.W. Griffin C. Fetting J. Davidson N.E. De Marzo A.M. Hicks J.L. Chitale D. Ladanyi M. Sukumar S. Argani P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 1938-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The identification of E-cadherin as a tumor and metastasis suppressor has fueled the discovery of multiple molecular mechanisms controlling E-cadherin expression (38Baranwal S. Alahari S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39Onder T.T. Gupta P.B. Mani S.A. Yang J. Lander E.S. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Herein, we report for the first time that E-cadherin is a direct transcriptional target of KLF4 and that this regulation is necessary to maintain the epithelial phenotype in mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, we show that forced expression of KLF4 in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line restores E-cadherin expression, resulting in reduced migration and invasion. These data indicate that KLF4 may play an important role in restraining metastatic activity of breast cancers. Human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were cultured as either monolayers or in three-dimensional cultures as previously described (40Debnath J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (MP Biomedicals) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were expressed from either the Lentilox 3.7 (ATCC) lentivirus vector or the microRNA-based TMP-tTA retrovirus vector (kind gift from Dr. Ed Stavnezer). For lentiviral knockdown, we used the previously published and validated shRNA sequence 5′-GGA CGG CTG TGG ATG GAA A-3′ (19Rowland B.D. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) to generate the stable shKLF4 line or a scrambled, non-silencing short hairpin RNA (shNS) sequence as the negative control. The sequence designated as shKLF4 targets nucleotides 1592–1610 in the human KLF4 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM004235.3). Lentiviral production and target cell transduction were performed as previously described with slight modification (41Johnson E. Theisen C.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31041-31049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 293FT cells were transfected simultaneously with Lipofectamine 2000 and ViraPower Lentiviral packaging kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected 293FT cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C after which time virus-containing media was harvested. Viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, supplemented with 4 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) and used to transduce target cells at 32 °C overnight. Stable MirKLF4 knockdowns were created using the replication-defective retroviral vector TMP-tTA as previously described (42Zhang H. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2867-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The shRNA sequences targeting human KLF4 were chosen using RNAi Codex. The sequence designated as MirKLF4 targets nucleotides 1834–1852 in the human KLF4 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM004235.3). A scrambled, non-silencing, microRNA based shRNA (MirNS) sequence was used as the negative control. For adenovirus KLF4 (AdKLF4), the 3×FLAG.HA:KLF4 vector was created through two rounds of subcloning using the previous published pcDNA3-KLF4 construct (43Feinberg M.W. Cao Z.X. Wara A.K. Lebedeva M.A. Senbanerjee S. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38247-38258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For the first round of cloning, pcDNA3-KLF4 was digested with BamHI and BstXI. Using a set of primers (oligonucleotides #1 and #2) containing a 5′ BamHI linker, Kozak motif, NheI site, and HA tag, the N terminus of KLF4 was amplified. Both the vector and the amplified PCR fragment were digested with BamHI and BstXI and ligated to create the HA-KLF4 vector. For the second round of subcloning, the 3×FLAG DNA sequence was amplified from the p3×FLAG-CMV vector (Sigma) with a second set of primers (oligonucleotides #3 and #4). Both the HA vector containing KLF4 and the amplified 3×FLAG DNA fragment were digested with BamHI and NheI and ligated in-frame, resulting in the 3×FLAG.HA:KLF4 construct. The authenticity of the 3×FLAG.HA:KLF4 construct was verified by DNA sequencing and verification of established target gene effects. Adenoviral production and purification was performed by Welgen, Inc. The virus titer was calculated at 1012 viral particles per milliliter (vp/ml). Empty vector control adenovirus (AdGFP) containing GFP was also produced and supplied by Welgen, Inc. Cells were infected at multiplicity of infection values ranging from 200 to 1000. Oligonucleotide #1: 5′-ATG CGG ATC CGC CAC CAT GGC TAG CTA CCC CTA CGA CGT GCC CGA CTA CGC CGC TGT CAG CGA CGC G-3′; oligonucleotide #2: 5′-AAT ACC AGG TCT GTG GCC ACG GT-3′; oligonucleotide #3: 5′-ATG CGG ATC CGC CAC CAT GGA CTA CAA GGA C-3′; and oligonucleotide #4: 5′-GTA CGC TAG CCT TGT CAT CGT CGT C-3′. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For real-time PCR, relative gene expression was determined using the StepOne Plus RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. The following TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) were used: KLF4 (Hs00358836_m1) and E-cadherin (Hs001704423_m1). RNA levels were normalized against human TATA box-binding protein. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antibodies used for immunoblotting include: anti-rabbit KLF4 (Millipore), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-E-cadherin and anti-p120 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-N-cadherin, anti-cytokeratin 8/18, and anti-β-catenin (Cell Signaling). For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, permeabilized, and blocked in 0.05% Tween 20/1% bovine serum albumin/1× phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-E-cadherin. Samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield hard set mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and fluorescence was visualized using a Leica inverted microscope. To measure cell growth, cells were trypsinized at the indicated times and counted using a hemocytometer. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation was performed by incubating cells with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 37 °C, prior to fixation and labeling with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Secondary detection with either goat-anti mouse Alexa594 (Molecular Probes) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was performed in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) was used to counterstain nuclei, and cells were counted using a Leica inverted microscope. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry was carried out as previously described (44Montañez-Wiscovich M.E. Seachrist D.D. Landis M.D. Visvader J. Andersen B. Keri R.A. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cell migration was performed using 8.0-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane Transwell inserts in a 24-well plate (Costar). Non-migrated cells were removed with a cotton swab. Inserts were fixed and stained with Hema3 (Fisher Scientific) and migrated nuclei were counted. Invasion assays were performed as above using BD MatrigelTM Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was isolated from MCF-10A cells, and the E-cadherin proximal promoter was PCR-amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-[XhoI]GTG AAA GAG TGA GCC CCA TC-3′ and reverse, 5′-[HindIII]CAC AGG TGC TTT GCA GTT C-3′. Both pGL3basic-luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), and PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and ligated together to form the (−359/+30) Ecad-Luc reporter. Cells were transfected in 6-well dishes, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol, with 0.2 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter vector phRG-TK (Promega) as a control and either 1.0 μg of pGL3basic or 1.0 μg of the Ecad-Luc reporter gene. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as previously described, with modification (45Scacheri P.C. Davis S. Odom D.T. Crawford G.E. Perkins S. Halawi M.J. Agarwal S.K. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Meltzer P.S. Collins F.S. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly MCF-10A or MDA-MB-231 cells were grown to near confluency on 150-mm dishes. Cells were cross-linked and lysed, followed by sonication (Vertis Versonic 300, Output 4, 25 s, 6×) in 3 ml of lysis buffer. After centrifugation, samples were precleared with 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was then divided into aliquots and immunoprecipitated overnight with specific antibodies to KLF4 (H-180, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), or control IgG (normal rabbit IgG or normal mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Supernatant (1/5) from control IgG sample was processed as the input. After washing and reversal of cross-links, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, DNA was resuspended in 65 μl of sterile H2O. PCR was performed using 5 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA as template and the following gene-specific primers corresponding to −170/+10 of the human E-cadherin promoter, based on GenBankTM accession number L34545.1: forward (5′-TAG AGG GTC ACC GCG TCT AT-3′) and reverse (5′-TCA CAG GTG CTT TGC AGT TC-3′). Statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test with p values of <0.05 considered significant. To directly assess the role of KLF4 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, we used lentiviral and retroviral vector-mediated shRNA to create stable MCF-10A cell lines with suppressed KLF4 expression. As previously reported for other cell lines (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), serum deprivation induced KLF4 expression (Fig. 1A). However, KLF4 protein and mRNA were suppressed by >60%, both in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1, A and B), using two different KLF4-specific RNA interference approaches (shRNA and microRNA-based shRNA) that targeted different regions of the KLF4 mRNA. MCF-10A cells grown in monolayer cultures form cobblestone clusters of expanding colonies that become more cuboidal and tightly packed as confluency increases (46Imbalzano K.M. Tatarkova I. Imbalzano A.N. Nickerson J.A. Cancer Cell Int. 2009; 9: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Likewise, cells expressing a non-silencing shRNA (shNS and MirNS) maintained a cobblestone-like morphology (Fig. 1C). In contrast, KLF4 silencing (shKLF4 and MirKLF4) resulted in an elongated, fibroblastic morphology reminiscent of EMT, a process that is also associated with increased migration. To assess this feature of EMT, we performed Transwell migration assays. KLF4 silencing resulted in an increase of approximately 2-fold in migration compared with both the parental and control shNS or MirNS cells (Fig. 1D). In vivo, breast epithelium exists within a complex ductal structure that receives multiple inputs from both nearby epithelial cells as well as the adjacent stroma. This three-dimensional growth can be simulated in vitro using Matrigel or other extracellular matrix supports. MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells grown in three-dimensional cultures proliferate to form polarized acini, and by day 10, the inner cells have undergone apoptosis/autophagy to form a functional lumen (47Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). We used this three-dimensional culture method to determine if loss of KLF4 would alter acinus formation and growth. Although parental and shNS control cells formed multiple acini with hollow lumens, shKLF4 cells rarely formed clusters of more than 4–6 cells (Fig. 2A). By day 4, when acinus formation was clearly visible in the parental and shNS control cells, fewer than 5% of the KLF4 knockdown cells had formed colonies beyond 4 cells (Fig. 2B). KLF4 has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation of skin and colonic epithelium (3Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 48Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it was surprising that loss of KLF4 led to a decrease in acinus formation and growth of MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2, A and B). A similar inhibition of growth was observed in monolayer cultures following KLF4 silencing (Fig. 2C). To determine whether this effect was due to alterations in proliferation, or changes in apoptosis, we used BrdUrd incorporation assays to assess the proliferation rate as well as propidium iodide staining to perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based analysis of the cell cycle. In comparison to control shNS cells, BrdUrd incorporation was reduced over 40% in the shKLF4 and MirKLF4 cells (Fig. 2D and data not shown), with no significant change in percentage of cells in the sub-G1 population (Fig. 2E). Rather, silencing of KLF4 induced a statistically significant G1-block in the cell cycle. Together, these results identify a previously unspecified requirement for KLF4 in maintaining proliferation and G1/S phase progression of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Cadherin-mediated signaling is an integral component of tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis (49Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In the breast, organization of the mammary epithelium is dependent upon maintenance of adherens junctions through homotypic interactions between E-cadherin on adjacent cells (36Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, sustained E-cadherin expression is necessary to maintain basal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells (33Boussadia O. Kutsch S. Hierholzer A. Delmas V. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Liu W.F. Nelson C.M. Pirone D.M. Chen C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inability of cells to organize into acini following KLF4 silencing, as well as the decreased proliferation and acquisition of morphological and migratory changes that are indicative of an EMT, prompted us to evaluate whether expression of E-cadherin, as well as other adherens junction proteins, was altered in the KLF4-silenced cells. Indeed, both protein and mRNA levels of E-cadherin were markedly reduced in both shKLF4 and MirKLF4 cells compared with shNS and MirNS control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Suppression of E-cadherin was further confirmed by the complete lack of membrane staining for this protein in the KLF4 knock-down cells (Fig. 3C). In addition to the loss of E-cadherin, KLF4 silencing resulted in a concomitant appearance of N-cadherin (Fig. 3A). This process, known as “cadherin switching,” is often associated with EMT (50Hazan R.B. Qiao R. Keren R. Badano I. Suyama K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 51Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).

Here we show that in thrombin- and collagen-stimulated platelets, PKA is activated by cAMP-independent mechanisms involving dissociation of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) from an NFκB-IκBα-PKAc complex. We demonstrate mRNA and protein expression for most of the NFκB family members in platelets. From resting platelets, PKAc was co-immunoprecipitated with IκBα, and conversely, IκBα was also co-immunoprecipitated with PKAc. This interaction was significantly reduced in thrombin- and collagen-stimulated platelets. Stimulation of platelets with thrombin- or collagen-activated IKK, at least partly by PI3 kinase-dependent pathways, leading to phosphorylation of IκBα, disruption of an IκBα-PKAc complex, and release of free, active PKAc, which phosphorylated VASP and other PKA substrates. IKK inhibitor inhibited thrombin-stimulated IkBα phosphorylation, PKA-IkBα dissociation, and VASP phosphorylation, and potentiated integrin αIIbβ3 activation and the early phase of platelet aggregation. We conclude that thrombin and collagen not only cause platelet activation but also appear to fine-tune this response by initiating downstream NFκB-dependent PKAc activation, as a novel feedback inhibitory signaling mechanism for preventing undesired platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1979151464,"In atherogenesis, macrophage foam cell formation is modulated by pathways involving both the uptake and efflux of cholesterol. We recently showed that interleukin-10 (IL-10) modulates lipid metabolism by enhancing both uptake and efflux of cholesterol in macrophages. However, the mechanistic details of these properties in vivo have been unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether expression of IL-10 in macrophages would alter susceptibility to atherosclerosis and whether IL-10 exerts its antiatherosclerotic properties by modulating lipid metabolism in macrophages. We utilized a macrophage-specific retroviral vector that allows long-term in vivo expression of IL-10 in macrophages through transplantation of retrovirally transduced bone marrow cells (BMCs). IL-10 expressed by macrophages derived from transduced BMCs inhibited atherosclerosis in LDLR(-/-) mice by reducing cholesteryl ester accumulation in atherosclerotic sites. Experiments with primary macrophages indicated that macrophage source of IL-10 stimulated both the uptake (by up-regulating scavenger receptors) and efflux of cholesterol (by activating the PPARgamma-LXR-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway), thereby reducing inflammation and apoptosis in atherosclerosis. These findings indicate that BMC-transduced macrophage IL-10 production can act as a strong antiatherogenic agent, and they highlight a novel antiatherosclerotic therapy using a simple, yet effective, stem cell transduction system that facilitates long-term expression of IL-10 in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2131527529,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a major regulator of endocrine actions of IGFs, is a p53-regulated potent apoptotic factor and is significantly suppressed in a variety of cancers. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that IGFBP-3 contributes to cancer risk protection in a variety of cancers, and a polymorphic variation of IGFBP-3 influences cancer risk, although other studies vary in their conclusions. Some antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 have been reported to be independent of IGFs, but the precise biochemical/molecular mechanisms of IGF-independent, antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 are largely unknown. Here we report a new cell death receptor, IGFBP-3R, that is a single-span membrane protein and binds specifically to IGFBP-3 but not other IGFBP species. Expression analysis of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3R indicates that the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis is impaired in breast and prostate cancer. We also provide evidence for anti-tumor effect of IGFBP-3R in vivo using prostate and breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice. Further in vitro studies demonstrate that IGFBP-3R mediates IGFBP-3-induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells. Knockdown of IGFBP-3R attenuated IGFBP-3-induced caspase activities and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of IGFBP-3R enhanced IGFBP-3 biological effects. IGFBP-3R physically interacts and activates caspase-8, and knockdown of caspase-8 expression or activity inhibited IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R-induced apoptosis. Here, we propose that IGFBP-3R represents a novel cell death receptor and is essential for the IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis and tumor suppression. Thus, the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis may provide therapeutic and prognostic value for the treatment of cancer."

The structure reveals that the eIF6 binding site involves mainly rpL23 (L14p in Escherichia coli).

https://openalex.org/W2084965902,"Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn), a protein implicated in Parkinson disease, contributes significantly to dopamine metabolism. a-Syn binding inhibits the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. Phosphorylation of TH stimulates its activity, an effect that is reversed by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In cells, a-Syn overexpression activates PP2A. Here we demonstrate that a-Syn significantly inhibited TH activity in vitro and in vivo and that phosphorylation of a-Syn serine 129 (Ser-129) modulated this effect. In MN9D cells, a-Syn overexpression reduced TH serine 19 phosphorylation (Ser(P)-19). In dopaminergic tissues from mice overexpressing human a-Syn in catecholamine neurons only, TH-Ser-19 and TH-Ser-40 phosphorylation and activity were also reduced, whereas PP2A was more active. Cerebellum, which lacks excess a-Syn, had PP2A activity identical to controls. Conversely, a-Syn knock-out mice had elevated TH-Ser-19 phosphorylation and activity and less active PP2A in dopaminergic tissues. Using an a-Syn Ser-129 dephosphorylation mimic, with serine mutated to alanine, TH was more inhibited, whereas PP2A was more active in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of a-Syn Ser-129 by Polo-like-kinase 2 in vitro reduced the ability of a-Syn to inhibit TH or activate PP2A, identifying a novel regulatory role for Ser-129 on a-Syn. These findings extend our understanding of normal a-Syn biology and have implications for the dopamine dysfunction of Parkinson disease."

https://openalex.org/W2071959972,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a leading indication for liver transplantation. HCV infection reoccurs almost universally post transplant, decreasing both graft longevity and patient survival. The immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA) has potent anti-HCV activity towards both HCV replicons and the genotype 2a cell culture infectious virus. Previously, we isolated mutations in the 1bN replicon with less sensitivity to CsA that mapped to both NS5A and NS5B regions of the virus. Mutations in NS5A alone conferred decreased CsA susceptibility regardless of NS5B mutations.We examined the mechanisms by which NS5A mutations contribute to CsA resistance and if they are strain dependent. Using in vitro mutagenesis, the amino acid position 321 mutation of NS5A was restored to the wild-type tyrosine residue conferring partial CsA susceptibility on the mutant replicon. The 321 mutation also alters CsA susceptibility of the JFH cell culture virus. Additionally, we demonstrated a novel CsA-sensitive interaction between NS5A and both cyclophilin A and B. Both the mutant NS5A and wild type NS5A bind cyclophilin in vitro. The NS5A: cyclophilin interaction requires both the NS5A region identified by the resistance mutants and cyclophilin catalytic residues. In cell culture, NS5A from CsA resistant mutant has an enhanced interaction with cyclophilin B. Additionally; NS5B facilitates a stronger binding of mutant NS5A to endogenous cyclophilin B than wild-type in cell culture.Collectively, this data suggests direct interactions between cyclophilins and NS5A are critical to understand for optimal use of cyclophilin inhibitors in anti-HCV therapy."

Using a proteomic approach based on in-cell chemical cross-linking and tandem affinity purification (TAP), we herein identify sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) as a BACE1-associated protein. SNX6, a PX domain protein, is a putative component of retromer, a multiprotein cargo complex that mediates the retrograde trafficking of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) and sortilin. RNA interference suppression of SNX6 increased BACE1-dependent secretion of soluble APP (sAPPbeta) and cell-associated fragments (C99), resulting in increased Abeta secretion. Furthermore, SNX6 reduction led to elevated steady-state BACE1 levels as well as increased retrograde transport of BACE1 in the endocytic pathway, suggesting that SNX6 modulates the retrograde trafficking and basal levels of BACE1, thereby regulating BACE1-mediated APP processing and Abeta biogenesis. Our study identifies a novel cellular pathway by which SNX6 negatively modulates BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP."
https://openalex.org/W2040096438,"Carcinoma are complex societies of mutually interacting cells in which there is a progressive failure of normal homeostatic mechanisms, causing the parenchymal component to expand inappropriately and ultimately to disseminate to distant sites. When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to cancer associated fibroblasts in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. The interaction of tumor cells with stromal fibroblasts influences tumor biology by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Here, we report a role for normal stroma fibroblasts in the progression of invasive tumors to metastatic tumors. Using a coculture system of human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a) and normal murine dermal fibroblasts, we found that medium conditioned by cocultures of the two cell types (CoCM) increased migration and scattering of MCF10CA1a cells in vitro, whereas medium conditioned by homotypic cultures had little effect. Transient treatment of MCF10CA1a cells with CoCM in vitro accelerated tumor growth at orthotopic sites in vivo, and resulted in an expanded pattern of metastatic engraftment. The effects of CoCM on MCF10CA1a cells were dependent on small amounts of active TGF-beta1 secreted by fibroblasts under the influence of the tumor cells, and required intact ALK5-, p38-, and JNK signaling in the tumor cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can modify the acellular component of the local microenvironment such that it induces long-lasting increases in tumorigenicity and alters the metastatic pattern of the cancer cells in vivo. TGF-beta appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-beta pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2020192698,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islet β-cells is dependent in part on pyruvate cycling through the pyruvate/isocitrate pathway, which generates cytosolic α-ketoglutarate, also known as 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). Here, we have investigated if mitochondrial transport of 2OG through the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) participates in control of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Suppression of OGC in clonal pancreatic β-cells (832/13 cells) and isolated rat islets by adenovirus-mediated delivery of small interfering RNA significantly decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. OGC suppression also reduced insulin secretion in response to glutamine plus the glutamate dehydrogenase activator 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid. Nutrient-stimulated increases in glucose usage, glucose oxidation, glutamine oxidation, or ATP:ADP ratio were not affected by OGC knockdown, whereas suppression of OGC resulted in a significant decrease in the NADPH:NADP+ ratio during stimulation with glucose but not glutamine + 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid. Finally, OGC suppression reduced insulin secretion in response to a membrane-permeant 2OG analog, dimethyl-2OG. These data reveal that the OGC is part of a mechanism of fuel-stimulated insulin secretion that is common to glucose, amino acid, and organic acid secretagogues, involving flux through the pyruvate/isocitrate cycling pathway. Although the components of this pathway must remain intact for appropriate stimulus-secretion coupling, production of NADPH does not appear to be the universal second messenger signal generated by these reactions.

Two products of the ICDc reaction are cytosolic NADPH and 2OG, and both of these metabolites have been suggested to function as ATP-independent coupling factors for insulin secretion (7MacDonald M.J.

Consistent with this idea, the most potent fuel secretagogues (including glucose, glutamine, and α-ketoisocaproate) are all capable of generating 2OG. For example, stimulation of β-cells with glutamine plus leucine (leucine is an activator of glutamate dehydrogenase) results in direct conversion of glutamate to 2OG within the mitochondria and robust insulin secretion (20Li C. Allen A. Kwagh J. Doliba N.M. Qin W. Najafi H. Collins H.W. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10214-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of 2OG metabolism to insulin secretion, either via direct influence as a coupling factor or maintenance of flux through various pyruvate cycling pathways, remains to be determined. Similarly, although there is a strong correlation between NADPH generation and GSIS (14Ronnebaum S.M. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S.C. Joseph J.W. Lu D. Stevens R.D. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), direct evidence that NADPH is required for GSIS is lacking, and the potential role of this cofactor in regulating insulin secretion in response to non-glucose fuels remains largely unexplored. One of the possible metabolic fates of 2OG generated in the cytosol by ICDc could be transport into the mitochondria for engagement in a variety of mitochondrial pathways. The mitochondrial 2OG carrier (OGC, SLC25A11) is part of an ∼50-member family (in humans) of mitochondrial transporters that includes the citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC), the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC), and uncoupling proteins (22Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). These proteins share three tandemly repeated ∼100 amino acid peptide domains and are responsible for the facilitated diffusion of solutes across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The OGC is an electroneutral bi-directional antiporter, capable of transporting both 2OG and malate simultaneously in opposite directions, either into or out of the mitochondrial matrix (23Indiveri C. Palmieri F. Bisaccia F. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Palmieri F. Bisaccia F. Capobianco L. Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Iacobazzi V. Zara V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we assessed the role of the OGC in 2OG transport and in the regulation of insulin release in response to several different metabolic fuels. Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments were used to test the hypothesis that 2OG transport through the OGC is necessary for proper regulation of insulin secretion in response to various fuel substrates. We also investigated the effects of carrier suppression on cell metabolism, including ATP and NADPH production after stimulation with glucose or glutamine. Our results indicate that OGC is part of a common pathway of reactions necessary for insulin secretion in response to multiple fuel substrates. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. For overexpression of OGC, the OGC gene was first amplified from rat 832/13 β-cell cDNA with the SuperScriptTM III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq® high fidelity (Invitrogen) using the forward primer AATC GAATTC CAA AGC CGA GGG CCA TCA AG containing an EcoRI restriction site and 4-base leader sequence and reverse primer AATC AAGCTT TGG AAA CCC TGG CAC ACG AG containing a HindIII restriction site and 4-base leader sequence. The PCR product (1020 bases) was then cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII double-digested pAC.CMV plasmid to construct the adenovirus AdCMV-OGC, as described previously (25Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For suppression of OGC, oligonucleotides containing the target sequences GCA ATT CTT GCT GGA CTC A or CTA GCA TCC TGA AGG CAG A were used to generate recombinant adenoviruses Ad-siOGC#1 and Ad-siOGC#2, respectively, by methods described previously (26Bain J.R.

We cloned the annealed OGC oligonucleotides directly into the BglII and HindIII sites of plasmid FF805, an EH006-derived (26Bain J.R. Schisler J.C. Takeuchi K. Newgard C.B. Becker T.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) RNA interference plasmid that contains the human H1 RNA promoter, followed by unique BglII and HindIII sites. To create FF805, a BglII site in the EH006 backbone was destroyed by digestion with BglII, extension with Taq polymerase, and religation. A 232-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragment from pSUPER (26Bain J.R. Schisler J.C. Takeuchi K. Newgard C.B. Becker T.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) containing the H1 RNA interference expression cassette was then inserted, followed by insertion of unique BglII/HindIII cloning sites (annealed oligonucleotides GAT CTG CGT TTA AAC GGA and AGC TTC CGT TTA AAC GCA). Adenovirus-mediated suppression of cytosolic ICDc was accomplished with a previously described Ad-siICDc adenovirus (14Ronnebaum S.M. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S.C. Joseph J.W. Lu D. Stevens R.D.

An adenovirus expressing an siRNA with no known homology (containing the sequence GAG ACC CTA TCC GTG ATT A) was used as control for all siRNA experiments (Ad-siControl). All adenoviruses were purified by the CsCl gradient, and titer was determined by measuring absorbance followed by the plaque formation assay (25Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M.

Insulin secretion studies were conducted in the presence of 2 mm glucose, 12 mm glucose, 12 mm glutamine, or 12 mm glutamine + 12 mm BCH. Insulin release from cells or islets was quantified by the Coat-a-Count radioimmunoassay kit (Siemens, Malvern, PA) (28Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from 832/13 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) or from islets using the RNeasy micro kit, and reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was performed for OGC expression using iTAQ SYBR Green supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad), containing 100 nm forward primer AAA GCC CTG ATT GGC ATG AC and reverse primer ATG GAA GCA GCA GTG GTG AC. Cyclophilin B was used as an internal loading control because its expression levels (CT values) closely matched that of OGC, and its expression did not change with any of the treatments used. Cyclophilin B was amplified using forward primer CGG ACA GCC GGG ACA A and reverse primer TTC GAT CTT GCC ACA GTC TAC AA. Measurements were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Rabbit antisera against the rat OGC peptide fragment IQNMRMIDGKPEYKN was generated by Antagene, Inc. (Mountain View, CA). For immunoblotting, mitochondria were isolated from 832/13 cells using the mitochondria isolation kit for cultured cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) and lysed in CelLyticTM M cell lysis reagent (Sigma) using three freeze-thaw cycles. 50 μg of protein per sample was separated on a 10% BisTris gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked in Tris-buffered saline plus 2% fat-free powdered milk for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-OGC antisera diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween® 20 and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone. Blots were washed, incubated in secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma), and bands visualized using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) on a VersaDoc 4000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Results were normalized to the expression of VDAC-1 (mouse monoclonal Ab14734, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), a commonly used mitochondrial specific loading control protein. The plasma membranes of 832/13 cells were permeabilized with 100 mm KCl, 22 mm NaCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KHCO3 plus the hemolytic reagent saponin (final concentration 26 μg/ml) (“permeabilization buffer”), for 25 min at room temperature (15Joseph J.W.

Cell pellets were then washed twice in permeabilization buffer without saponin and incubated at 37 °C in permeabilization buffer plus 12 mm glutamic acid, 1 mm malic acid, and 6 mm BCH. Conversion of glutamate to 2OG led to transport out of the mitochondria at a rate dependent on the amount of OGC present in the mitochondrial membrane. After 45 min, supernatant containing newly generated 2OG was removed and combined with isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction buffer (40 mm MgCl2, 35 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm Na-HEPES, 10% glycerol, 80 μm NADPH, and 0.25 units/reaction NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme (Sigma)), based on the conditions described for isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymatic assays (30Kanao T. Kawamura M. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this way, OGC transporter activity was measured indirectly via the change in absorbance at 340 nm as NADPH was consumed by NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Glucose usage (glycolytic flux) was determined by incubation in 2 or 12 mm glucose with 0.06 Ci/mol [5-3H]glucose (GE Healthcare) added as tracer, as described previously (31Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose oxidation and glutamine oxidation were measured using a CO2 trapping system (32Kim J.Y. Koves T.R. Yu G.S. Gulick T. Cortright R.N. Dohm G.L. Muoio D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Data were corrected for trapping efficiency, as determined using [14C]sodium bicarbonate. Cell viability and general mitochondrial function were determined using the CellTiter 96® proliferation assay (methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium assay, Promega, Madison, WI). ATP and ADP were measured using a luciferase-based ATP assay (Sigma), as described previously (15Joseph J.W. Jensen M.V. Ilkayeva O. Palmieri F. Alárcon C. Rhodes C.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

For some of these experiments, multifactorial analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the main effects of treatment conditions and interactions. Student's t test was used for individual comparisons between treatments (p < 0.05). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., for n ≥3 separate experiments. To investigate the role of 2OG transport in insulin secretion, we began by constructing two recombinant adenoviruses containing unique siRNA sequences targeting OGC, Ad-siOGC#1 and Ad-siOGC#2. Treatment of 832/13 β-cells with Ad-siOGC#1 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in OGC mRNA levels, as determined by quantitative real time PCR. At the highest dose of Ad-siOGC#1, OGC RNA expression was suppressed by 83 ± 6% (p < 0.001), as compared with treatment with Ad-siControl (which contains an siRNA with no homology to known RNA sequences), matched with the highest viral dose of Ad-siOGC#1 (Fig. 1A). At this dose, Ad-siOGC#1 decreased GSIS by 56.8 ± 10.7% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Similar effects were observed after treatment with Ad-siOGC#2, which caused a 71 ± 10% (p < 0.01) suppression of OGC RNA expression corresponding with a 48.0 ± 14.3% (p < 0.05) reduction in GSIS (data not shown). Suppression of the OGC using Ad-siOGC#1 also resulted in a 52.7 ± 4.3% decrease (p < 0.001) in OGC protein expression, as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this decrease in OGC protein was accompanied by a loss of OGC function, the plasma membrane of target cells was selectively permeabilized by light saponin treatment, and the rate of 2OG production and transport was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” OGC knockdown resulted in a 65 ± 10% decrease (p < 0.01) in the rate of 2OG production and transport out of the mitochondria compared with control cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Effects of OGC suppression on protein expression, transporter activity, and KCl-stimulated insulin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2052475033,"Although it has been shown that the gastric tumor suppressor RUNX3 has a growth inhibitory activity, the precise molecular mechanisms behind RUNX3-mediated tumor suppression remained unclear. In this study, we found that RUNX3 is closely involved in DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 at Ser-15 and acts as a co-activator for p53. The small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX3 inhibited adriamycin (ADR)-dependent apoptosis in p53-proficient cells but not in p53-deficient cells in association with a significant reduction of p53-target gene expression as well as phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. In response to ADR, RUNX3 was induced to accumulate in the cell nucleus and co-localized with p53. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that RUNX3 forms a complex with p53 in cells. In vitro pulldown assays revealed that the COOH-terminal portion of p53 is required for the interaction with RUNX3. Forced expression of RUNX3 enhanced p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Additionally, RUNX3 had an ability to induce the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, thereby promoting p53-dependent apoptosis. Intriguingly, RUNX3 interacted with phosphorylated forms of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated in response to ADR; however, it did not affect the extent of DNA damage. From the clinical point of view, coordinated p53 mutation and decreased expression of RUNX3 in 105 human lung adenocarcinomas were significantly associated with the poor outcome of patients (p = 0.0203). Thus, our present results strongly suggest that RUNX3 acts as a novel co-activator for p53 through regulating its DNA damage-induced phosphorylation at Ser-15 and also provide a clue to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying RUNX3-mediated tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2111866310,"Although biochemical studies suggested a high permeability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for small molecules, proteomics identified few specialized ER transporters. To test functionality of transporters during ER passage, we tested whether glucose transporters (GLUTs, SGLTs) destined for the plasma membrane are active during ER transit. HepG2 cells were characterized by low-affinity ER transport activity, suggesting that ER uptake is protein mediated. The much-reduced capacity of HEK293T cells to take up glucose across the plasma membrane correlated with low ER transport. Ectopic expression of GLUT1, -2, -4, or -9 induced GLUT isoform-specific ER transport activity in HEK293T cells. In contrast, the Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 mediated efficient plasma membrane glucose transport but no detectable ER uptake, probably because of lack of a sufficient sodium gradient across the ER membrane. In conclusion, we demonstrate that GLUTs are sufficient for mediating ER glucose transport en route to the plasma membrane. Because of the low volume of the ER, trace amounts of these uniporters contribute to ER solute import during ER transit, while uniporters and cation-coupled transporters carry out export from the ER, together potentially explaining the low selectivity of ER transport. Expression levels and residence time of transporters in the ER, as well as their coupling mechanisms, could be key determinants of ER permeability.—Takanaga, H., Frommer, W. B.

https://openalex.org/W2065357312,"Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are androgen receptor (AR) ligands that induce anabolism while having reduced effects in reproductive tissues. In various experimental contexts SARMs fully activate, partially activate, or even antagonize the AR, but how these complex activities translate into tissue selectivity is not known. Here, we probed receptor function using >1000 synthetic AR ligands. These compounds produced a spectrum of activities in each assay ranging from 0 to 100% of maximal response. By testing different classes of compounds in ovariectomized rats, we established that ligands that transactivated a model promoter 40-80% of an agonist, recruited the coactivator GRIP-1 <15%, and stabilized the N-/C-terminal interdomain interaction <7% induced bone formation with reduced effects in the uterus and in sebaceous glands. Using these criteria, multiple SARMs were synthesized including MK-0773, a 4-aza-steroid that exhibited tissue selectivity in humans. Thus, AR activated to moderate levels due to reduced cofactor recruitment, and N-/C-terminal interactions produce a fully anabolic response, whereas more complete receptor activation is required for reproductive effects. This bimodal activation provides a molecular basis for the development of SARMs."

Several studies have shown that in response to a variety of stresses HuR promotes the expression of proapoptotic mRNAs, whereas others reported its regulatory effect on antiapoptotic messages.

Here, we show that this cleavage event is dependent on protein kinase RNA (PKR). Surprisingly, although in response to the apoptotic inducer staurosporine PKR itself is not phosphorylated, PKR triggers the cleavage of HuR via its downstream effector FADD that in turn activates the caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway. This effect, however, does not require the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. Additionally, we observed that these HuR-CPs are sufficient to trigger cell death in the absence of activation of the PKR pathway.

Class III cells, the fully reprogrammed induced PSCs (iPSCs), expressed all pluripotency markers, formed teratomas indistinguishable from those of mESCs, and underwent efficient osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Interestingly, whereas the endogenous mTERT gene expression was only moderately increased during reprogramming, the hTERT promoter was strongly activated in class II cells and was further elevated in class III cells. Treatment of class II cells with chemical inhibitors of MEKs and glycogen synthase kinase 3 resulted in their further reprogramming into class III cells, accompanied by a strong activation of hTERT promoter. In reprogrammed human cells, the endogenous telomerase level, although variable among different clones, was dramatically elevated. Only in cells with the highest telomerase were telomeres restored to the lengths in hESCs. Our data, for the first time, demonstrated that the hTERT promoter was strongly activated in discrete steps, revealing a critical difference in human and mouse cell reprogramming. Because telomere elongation is crucial for self-renewal of hPSCs and replicative aging of their differentiated progeny, these findings have important implications in the generation and applications of iPSCs."

To address possible functional redundancies and reveal functional roles of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in postnatal skin, mouse models were developed in which either family member could be acutely ablated alone or together in the epidermis and sebaceous glands of adult mice. Acute removal of either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ alone in adult mouse skin revealed modest to no discernable changes in epidermis or sebaceous glands. In contrast, co-ablation of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in postnatal epidermis resulted in disruption of stratified squamous differentiation characterized by hyperproliferation of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes and a defective basal to spinous keratinocyte transition involving an expanded basal compartment and a diminished and delayed spinous compartment. Acute co-ablation of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in sebaceous glands resulted in severe morphological defects, and sebocyte differentiation was blocked as determined by lack of sebum production and reduced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD3) and melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), two markers of terminal sebocyte differentiation. Specialized sebocytes of Meibomian glands and preputial glands were also affected. Our results indicate that in adult mouse skin, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are critically involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis involving the basal to spinous keratinocyte transition and basal cell cycle withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2085272905,"Phosphorylation of the C-terminal end of histone H2A.X is the most characterized histone post-translational modification in DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is one of the three phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-like family of kinase members that is known to phosphorylate histone H2A.X during DNA DSB repair. There is a growing body of evidence supporting a role for histone acetylation in DNA DSB repair, but the mechanism or the causative relation remains largely unknown. Using bacterially expressed recombinant mutants and stably and transiently transfected cell lines, we find that DNA-PK can phosphorylate Thr-136 in addition to Ser-139 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation reaction is not inhibited by the presence of H1, which in itself is a substrate of the reaction. We also show that, in contrast to previous reports, the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate these residues is not affected by the extent of acetylation of the core histones. In vitro assembled nucleosomes and HeLa S3 native oligonucleosomes consisting of non-acetylated and acetylated histones are equally phosphorylated by DNA-PK. We demonstrate that the apparent differences in the extent of phosphorylation previously observed can be accounted for by the differential chromatin solubility under the MgCl2 concentrations required for the phosphorylation reaction in vitro. Finally, we show that although H2A.X does not affect nucleosome conformation, it has a de-stabilizing effect that is enhanced by the DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation and results in an impaired histone H1 binding.

If improperly repaired, DSBs can have detrimental consequences leading to cancer via chromosomal aberrations such as chromosomal breaks, translocation, and aneuploidy (1Fernandez-Capetillo O. Lee A.

In the eukaryotic cell the repair mechanism requires the participation of chromatin components. One of the chromatin hallmarks involved is the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X at its highly conserved C-terminal SQE motif (Fig. 1A) (2Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar, 3Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Redon C. Celeste A. Nussenzweig A. Bonner W.M. Biochem.

This phosphorylated form of H2A.X is commonly denoted as γ-H2A.X (2Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). It is well known that histone H2A.X is phosphorylated ubiquitously at DNA DSB regardless of the source of the damage and of the pathway used in its repair: homologous recombination or non-homologous-end joining (NHEJ). The enzymes responsible for the DSB-induced H2A.X phosphorylation are all members of the PIKK family, such as the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) (4Li A. Eirín-López J.M. Ausió J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Stiff T. O'Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K. Löbrich M. Jeggo P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The DNA-PK catalytic subunit has been recently shown to play a dominant role in regulating the DNA damage-mediated phosphorylation of H2A.X (6An J. Huang Y.C. Xu Q.Z. Zhou L.J. Shang Z.F. Huang B. Wang Y. Liu X.D. Wu D.C. Zhou P.K. BMC Mol. Biol. 2010; 11: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the yeast H2A.X ortholog, Thr-126 and Ser-129 can be both phosphorylated during DSB in a way that appears to depend on the repair pathway. It has been shown that Thr-126 is important for homologous recombination but dispensable for NHEJ (7Moore J.D. Yazgan O. Ataian Y. Krebs J.E. Genetics. 2007; 176: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The early identification of γ-H2A.X in vertebrates (2Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar) hinted to the possibility that Ser/Thr-136 could also be phosphorylated. However, experimental evidence for this suggestion has been lacking. Determining whether or not this residue is also phosphorylated is important as, in contrast to yeast where homologous recombination is the preferred mechanism of DSB repair, mammalians preferentially use NHEJ (8Mahaney B.L. Meek K. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) where DNA-PK plays a critical role (9Meek K. Dang V. Lees-Miller S.P. Adv. Immunol. 2008; 99: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X, there is a growing body of evidence supporting a role for histone acetylation in DNA DSB repair. Cells with DNA breaks have a transient increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation (10Tamburini B.A. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4903-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Defects in the acetylation of K56 in histone H3 result in sensitivity to genotoxic agents that cause DNA DSBs during replication (11Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It has been found that mutations of multiple acetylate-able lysine residues in the H4 tail (12Bird A.W. Yu D.Y. Pray-Grant M.G. Qiu Q. Harmon K.E. Megee P.C. Grant P.A. Smith M.M. Christman M.F. Nature. 2002; 419: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) or mutations of the TIP60 (human histone acetyltransferase complex that mediates H4 acetylation) (13Murr R. Loizou J.I. Yang Y.G. Cuenin C. Li H. Wang Z.Q. Herceg Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 14Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M.

Cell. 2004; 16: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) confer sensitivity to agents that create DSBs. Although the acetylation of histones is one of the most studied histone modifications and evidence has been provided that histone acetylation enhances phosphorylation of H2A.X by DNA-PK (16Park E.J. Chan D.W. Park J.H. Oettinger M.A. Kwon J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the concerted structural effect, if any, of this histone post-translational modification with that of γ-H2A.X remains to be elucidated. The structural and functional involvement of this highly characteristic H2A.X phosphorylation is not clearly understood. It is yet unclear whether it elicits a change in chromatin structure allowing for access of DNA repair machineries or if it merely acts as part of the “histone code” that recruits such repair machineries (4Li A. Eirín-López J.M. Ausió J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Morrison A.J. Shen X. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These two possibilities need not necessarily be mutually exclusive. As an example of the latter, it has been shown that γ-H2A.X promotes rapid Rad9 (radiation-sensitive 9) recruitment to DSBs in yeast (18Javaheri A. Wysocki R. Jobin-Robitaille O. Altaf M. Côté J. Kron S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A direct role on chromatin conformation was suggested by the decrease exerted in its compaction by the serine/glutamic phosphorylation mimics of yeast H2A.X at Ser-129 (19Downs J.A. Lowndes N.F. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 20Ausió J. Abbott D.W. Wang X. Moore S.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 693-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Arguing against this and against a general role for the C-terminal tail of H2A.X, it was recently shown that yeast Ser/Glu mutants had no effect on chromatin stability and supercoiling or on nucleosome positioning (21Fink M. Imholz D. Thoma F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3589-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we show that mammalian Ser/Thr-136 and Ser-139 of mammalian H2A.X are both substrates of DNA-PK and are phosphorylated within the cell context. Acetylation of core histones does not influence the ability of the phosphorylating enzymes to phosphorylate H2A.X and neither does the presence or absence of linker histones. Finally, we observe that H2A.X slightly de-stabilizes the nucleosome and its DNA-PK- mediated phosphorylation impairs linker histone binding. A plasmid containing human H2A.X prepared as in Siino et al. (22Siino J.S. Nazarov I.B. Svetlova M.P. Solovjeva L.V. Adamson R.H. Zalenskaya I.A. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Tomilin N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was kindly provided to us by Joe Siino, and it was subcloned into a pET11a bacterial expression plasmid. Similar expression vectors consisting of the mutant forms H2A.X-S139A, H2A.X-T136A/S139E, and H2A.X-A138E/S139E were prepared using the appropriate 3′ end primers encompassing these mutations. Constructs containing GFP at the N-terminal end of H2A.X and its mutants were prepared by inserting the coding regions of the previous plasmids into a pEGFP-C1 mammalian expression vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, San Jose, CA). Recombinant human H2A.X and all mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The bacterial pellet was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The cell lysate was dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The recombinant histone was extracted by 0.5 n HCl. The solubilized histones were precipitated overnight at −20 °C with 6 volumes of cold acetone, pelleted, dried, and resuspended in water. The HCl-extracted histones were further purified using a Macro-Prep CM cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad) with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 7 m urea, 10 mm NaOAc (pH 5.2), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA buffer. The eluted histone was dialyzed, lyophilized, and further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Vydac C4 column as described in Ausió and Moore (23Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Native histone H2A-H2B dimmers, H3-H4 tetramers, and histone H1 were purified by a 0–2.5 m NaCl gradient hydroxylapatite fractionation of HeLa S3 (24Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Histone H2B was isolated from histone H2A by Vydac C4 reverse phase HPLC as below. A 146-bp random sequence DNA was obtained from chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particles prepared as described elsewhere (25Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A sequence-defined 208-bp DNA fragment was obtained by RsaI digestion of a 208-12 DNA construct consisting of 12 identical copies of a 208-bp fragment of the 5 S rRNA gene of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus (26Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). After digestion with RsaI, the 208-bp DNA was HPLC-purified using a 75 × 7.5-mm Bio-Gel DEAE-5-PW (Bio-Rad) in 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. An antibody against γ-H2A.X was prepared in house (SCL). H2A.X antibody was purchased from Applied Biological Materials (abm, Richmond, BC). GFP and FLAG antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and from Sigma, respectively. The H2A.X/T136A/T136A-S139E GFP constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using Polyfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON). Transient transfected HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and collected after incubating for 24 h. H2A.X/T136A/T136A-S139E with an N-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 (−) mammalian expression vector. The H2A.X/T136A/T136A-S139E FLAG constructs were transfected into H2A.X−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (kindly provided to us by Andre Nussenzweig) (27Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). The transfected H2A.X−/− MEFs were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and after 24 h of incubation media were replaced with fresh media containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin. The media were replaced again after 1 week with fresh media containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin. After 1 week of incubation, stably transfected MEFs were then collected, and expression of the protein constructs were confirmed by Western blot analysis using GFP and H2A.X antibodies. Proper incorporation into nucleosomes of the histone constructs expressed in transiently and stably transfected cells was carried out as described elsewhere (28Gautier T. Abbott D.W. Molla A. Verdel A. Ausio J. Dimitrov S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HeLa cells or stably transfected MEF cells were subjected to 10 gray irradiation at room temperature using a Varian 6EX medical linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). A calibrated 6 mV x-ray photon beam was used. The beam was directed upwards through a 5-cm-thick slab of water-equivalent material and then through the cell culture dishes to provide uniform irradiation of the cells. A field size of 28 × 28 cm2 was used, and the cells were at a distance of 100 cm from the x-ray target. Maximum uncertainty in the radiation dose was estimated to be ±5%. HeLa S3 cells grown in the presence or the absence of 5 mm sodium butyrate, and nuclei and chromatin fractions were prepared after the protocol previously described (29Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclei from butyrate-treated and non-treated HeLa S3 cells were digested with micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ). The digestion was carried out at 30 units/mg of DNA for 7 min at 37 °C in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 buffer (with or without 5 mm sodium butyrate). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g (4 °C) was designated as fraction S1. The pellet was then resuspended and lysed in 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) to produce, after subsequent centrifugation, a supernatant and a pellet fraction. Stripping of histone H1 from the supernatant fraction was accomplished by treatment with CM-Sephadex C-25 resin in the presence of 0.35 m NaCl as described elsewhere (25Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). All the buffers used for the chromatin preparation of butyrate-treated HeLa S3 cells contained 5 mm sodium butyrate. Recombinant human H2A.X/A138E-S139E or H2A.X phosphorylated with DNA-PK (P-H2A.X) were mixed with HeLa S3 H2B, H3, and H4 histones and reconstituted onto nucleosomes as described previously (23Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Histones in stoichiometric amounts were lyophilized and resuspended at 2 mg/ml in a 6 m guanidinium-hydrochloride, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were dialyzed against distilled and sterilized H2O for 2 h at 4 °C. The dialysis bag was then transferred to another container containing 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C. For the reconstitution of nucleosomes consisting of cold DNA, the histone mixture prepared was mixed with either 146- or 208-bp DNA at a histone to DNA ratio of (1.12:1 w:w) or (0.79:1 w:w), respectively, in 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm EDTA buffer. For the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled nucleosome reconstitution, [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 208-bp DNA was mixed with an ∼10-fold amount of cold 208-bp DNA and mixed with histones at a (0.79:1 w:w) histone:DNA ratio in the same 2 m NaCl buffer (30Maffey A.H.

In all instances nucleosome reconstitution was achieved by a 2 to 0 m NaCl stepwise salt gradient dialysis in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm EDTA buffer as described (23Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes reconstituted in this way were purified as described below and used for subsequent experiments: H1 binding assay, DNA-PK reaction, and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis. Nucleosomes in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm EDTA were loaded onto a 5–20% sucrose gradient in 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm EDTA buffer and centrifuged at 111,081 × g for 19.6 h in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by 4% native PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Native 4% acrylamide PAGE was carried out according to Yager and van Holde (32Yager T.D. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetic acid/urea gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (33Saperas N. Chiva M. Casas M.T. Campos J.L. Eirín-López J.M. Frehlick L.J. Prieto C. Subirana J.A. Ausió J.

Purified H2A.X/A138E-S139E or H2A.X phosphorylated with DNA-PK (P-H2A.X) nucleosomes (300 ng) were titrated with increasing amounts of HeLa S3 histone H1. The H1 to mononucleosomes molar ratios used were: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. The H1 binding reaction was performed in 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The electrophoretic mobility shift resulting from histone H1 binding was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA (0.5 × TBE). Nucleosomes reconstituted with 208- or 146-bp DNA and histone octamers consisting of H2A.X or γ-H2A.X were dialyzed against buffers of varying ionic strength (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m NaCl) and analyzed by sedimentation velocity using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Samples were loaded in double-sector cells with aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces, and runs were performed at 20 °C on an An-55 Al aluminum rotor at 40,000 rpm.

A value of 0.650 cm3/g was used for the partial specific volume of the nucleosome (25Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The DNA-PK catalytic subunit and Ku70/80 subunits of DNA-PK were purified from HeLa cells as described previously (38Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified DNA-PK catalytic subunit (38.1 ng) and Ku (11.9 ng) were incubated in 35 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 or 10 mm MgCl2 (buffer), 10 μg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA, and 0.25 mm ATP containing ∼10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The substrates (histones/nucleosomes) (0.5 μg or 1 μg) were added as indicated. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer for SDS-PAGE or by loading immediately after the reaction for 4% native gel. To prepare γ-H2A.X on a large scale, the reaction was performed in the same way as above with the exception of scaling up substrates and enzymes proportionally and using cold ATP instead of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP. After the reaction, P-H2A.X was filtered through a 0.45-μm Nanosep centrifugal device (Pall, Ann Arbor, MI) and purified with a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac C18 reverse phase HPLC column (Grace Vydac, St. Hesperia, CA) using a gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 0% acetonitrile (ACN) to 60% ACN in 60 min. DNA-PK-phosphorylated H2A.X was analyzed by static manual nanospray using an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex QStar Pulsar I fitted with a Protana/Proxeon Nanospray source. Two microliters of DNA-PK-phosphorylated H2A.X were mixed with 2 μl of 60% methanol, 3% formic acid and pipetted into a fused silica gold/palladium-coated nanoES spray tip (Proxeon). Spray was established by applying a tip voltage of 1200 V and collecting a time-of-flight mass spectrometry survey scan 400–1500 m/z consisting of 300 accumulated 1-s scans. Mass spectrometer parameters used were as follows: declustering potential setting of 65, focusing potential setting of 265, and curtain gas setting of 25. The time-of-flight mass spectrometry spectrum was deconvoluted using Analyst QS 1.1 (MDS Sciex) using the Biotools Bayesian reconstruct software. Processing settings were as follows: start mass of 10,000 Da, stop mass of 20,000 Da, step mass 1 Da, signal/noise threshold of 20, minimum intensity of 3%, hydrogen adduct selected, and 20 iterations were used to generate the parent mass of the charged protein envelope. Chromatin solubility analysis in the presence of MgCl2 (39Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7336-7347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The chromatin samples had an approximate A260 = 0.8. The different MgCl2 concentrations were achieved by mixing equal volumes of the chromatin sample in the 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer with an equal volume of 2 × MgCl2 in the same buffer while vortexing. The sample mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The chromatin aggregates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g. The absorbance of the supernatant at 260 nm was measured and related to the absorbance of the starting sample in the absence of MgCl2. Phosphorylation of mammalian H2A.X of the SQE motif at the C-terminal end of vertebrate H2A.X (Ser-139 in mammals) represents one of the best characterized post-translational modification landmarks associated with double-strand DNA repair. However, other phosphorylatable residues (Ser/Thr) are present in close proximity of the SQE motif targeted by the ATM/ATR and DNA-PK enzymes in many different species. In many vertebrates the SQE sequence is preceded by another potential DNA-PK target motif ((S/T)Q) that is highly conserved (Fig. 1A). Although the potential for phosphorylation of this secondary residue within γ-H2A.X was hinted in the early paper from Bonner and co-workers (2Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar), the demonstration of its existence has remained elusive. To test whether this site is amenable to DNA-PK phosphorylation in vitro, several human recombinant H2A.X histone versions were created in which the phosphorylatable residues of this histone C-terminal end (TQASQEY) were individually or globally mutated to non-phosphorylatable amino acids and subjected to DNA-PK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). As can be seen, the TQA motif preceding SQE can be equally phosphorylated by the enzyme, albeit with lower activity. From here on the in vitro double-phosphorylated form of H2A.X will be referred to as P-H2A.X to distinguish it from the in vivo phosphorylated form referred to as γ-H2A.X (2Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). The ability of the TQA motif to be phosphorylated in vivo was assessed using HeLa cells transfected with GFP versions of the same constructs used for the in vitro characterization. As shown in Fig. 2A, TQA is phosphorylated in non-irradiated transiently transfected HeLa cells, although to a lesser extent than the SQE counterpart. Fig. 2B shows the reactivity of the γ-H2A.X antibody for DNA-PK-phosphorylated versions of the different constructs. The slightly different reactivity of the antibody toward H2A.X selectively phosphorylated at Thr-136 can in part account for the lower phosphorylation observed with the corresponding transfected version. Irradiation of these transiently transfected cells resulted in the complete disappearance of the H2A.X-GFP constructs (results not shown), most likely as a result of DNA damage impinged by the radiation on the expressing plasmids. Given our inability to recover the transiently expressed GFP-versions of H2A.X after irradiation, stable versions of the different FLAG-H2A.X mutants were produced in MEF H2A.X−/− cells (27Celeste A.

The analysis revealed that the zinc finger protein of cerebellum (Zic) family member transcription factor Zic1 was the most up-regulated gene in the lumbar spine (202-fold; P<10(-7)) in comparison with the iliac crest. Software analysis of differential gene expression in the biopsy samples identified the ciliary-related proteins PATCH1 and GLI-Kruppel family members Gli1 and Gli3 as part of a potential molecular network associated with Zic1. RT-PCR confirmed the expression of Zic1, Gli1, and Gli3 and other related key signaling mediators in osteoblastic cells and osteocytes in vitro. Zic1 was immunolocalized in the cytosol and nucleus of the murine osteocyte cell line MLO-Y4 and osteoblast-like cells MC3T3-E1 and in primary rat osteoblasts. MLO-Y4 cells subjected to prolonged oscillatory fluid flow showed increased localization of Zic1 in the nucleus with diminished levels in the cytosol, but no such changes were seen in MC3T3-E1 cells. A shear stress-induced increase in T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional activity was abolished by Zic1 gene silencing. These results suggest that Zic1, perhaps together with Gli1 and Gli3, may act as a link between mechanosensing and Wnt signaling. We conclude that Zic1, a neural developmental transcription factor, plays an important role in shear flow mechanotransduction in osteocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2162884758,"Although feedback on performance is generally thought to promote perceptual learning, the role and necessity of feedback remain unclear. We investigated the effect of providing varying amounts of positive feedback while listeners attempted to discriminate between three identical tones on learning frequency discrimination.Using this novel procedure, the feedback was meaningless and random in relation to the listeners' responses, but the amount of feedback provided (or lack thereof) affected learning. We found that a group of listeners who received positive feedback on 10% of the trials improved their performance on the task (learned), while other groups provided either with excess (90%) or with no feedback did not learn. Superimposed on these group data, however, individual listeners showed other systematic changes of performance. In particular, those with lower non-verbal IQ who trained in the no feedback condition performed more poorly after training.This pattern of results cannot be accounted for by learning models that ascribe an external teacher role to feedback. We suggest, instead, that feedback is used to monitor performance on the task in relation to its perceived difficulty, and that listeners who learn without the benefit of feedback are adept at self-monitoring of performance, a trait that also supports better performance on non-verbal IQ tests. These results show that 'perceptual' learning is strongly influenced by top-down processes of motivation and intelligence."

A null mutation in the VGSC gene SCN8A, which encodes the transmembrane protein Nav1.6, was identified previously in a human family. Heterozygous mutation carriers displayed a range of phenotypes, including ataxia, cognitive deficits, and emotional instability. A possible role for SCN8A was also proposed in studies examining the genetic basis of attempted suicide and bipolar disorder. In addition, mice with a Scn8a loss-of-function mutation (Scn8amed-Tg/+) show altered anxiety and depression-like phenotypes. Because psychiatric abnormalities are often associated with altered sleep and hormonal patterns, we evaluated heterozygous Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants for alterations in sleep-wake architecture, diurnal corticosterone levels, and behavior. Compared with their wild-type littermates, Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants experience more non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, a chronic impairment of REM sleep generation and quantity, and a lowered and flattened diurnal rhythm of corticosterone levels. No robust differences were observed between mutants and wild-type littermates in locomotor activity or in behavioral paradigms that evaluate anxiety or depression-like phenotypes; however, Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants did show enhanced spatial memory.

VGSCs play a critical role in the initiation and propagation of transient depolarizing currents and electrical signaling between cells. Nav1.6, the most abundantly expressed VGSC in the CNS, is localized in somata and dendrites of projection neurons, nodes of Ranvier of both peripheral and CNS neurons, and axonal initial segments (1Caldwell J.H.

A broad effect of Scn8a dysfunction on neuronal excitability has been observed in mice with different Scn8a mutations. The Scn8amed-jo mutation, a threonine-to-alanine substitution in the S4–S5 linker of domain III, causes a 10-mV positive shift in the voltage dependence of activation in Purkinje cells (5Smith M.R. Goldin A.L. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 3027-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and also reduces the resurgent sodium current (6Raman I.M. Sprunger L.K. Meisler M.H. Bean B.P. Neuron. 1997; 19: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), diminishing the repetitive firing of the Purkinje cells. Reduced transient and persistent sodium current was seen in pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex, a site of executive function, in heterozygous Scn8a null mutants (7Maurice N. Tkatch T. Meisler M. Sprunger L.K. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2268-2277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lower sustained and instantaneous firing rates in the initial segment of retinal ganglion cells were also found in heterozygous null mutants (8Van Wart A. Matthews G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7172-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mice with Scn8a mutations display a variety of recessive movement phenotypes. Homozygous Scn8amed mice that carry a loss-of-function mutation exhibit muscle weakness, progressive paralysis, and death by 3–4 weeks after birth (9Burgess D.L. Kohrman D.C. Galt J. Plummer N.W. Jones J.M. Spear B. Meisler M.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Homozygous Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants have a less severe phenotype (10Kohrman D.C. Smith M.R. Goldin A.L. Harris J. Meisler M.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5993-5999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); by 3 weeks of age, these mutants show an unsteady, wide-based gait and rhythmic tremor of the head and neck during movement (11Meisler M.H. Kearney J. Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Sprunger L.K. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, unlike homozygous null mutants, the Scn8amed-jo homozygous mutants often have a normal life span (11Meisler M.H. Kearney J. Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Sprunger L.K. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Closer examination of heterozygous Scn8a mutants has begun to reveal a number of dominant phenotypes. For instance, heterozygous Scn8amed-Tg mice with a loss-of-function mutation display greater avoidance of the center zone during open field exploration, an increased tendency to remain on the dark side of a light/dark box, and increased immobility in the forced swim test compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (12McKinney B.C. Chow C.Y. Meisler M.H. Murphy G.G. Genes Brain Behav. 2008; 7: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that reduced Scn8a expression may be associated with increased anxiety and pronounced stress-induced coping strategies (12McKinney B.C. Chow C.Y. Meisler M.H. Murphy G.G. Genes Brain Behav. 2008; 7: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have found that heterozygous Scn8amed and Scn8amed-jo mutants are more resistant to seizures induced by the chemical convulsants flurothyl and kainic acid compared with WT littermates (13Martin M.S. Tang B. Papale L.A. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Escayg A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, we also observed that heterozygous Scn8amed, Scn8amed-jo, and Scn8a8J mutants display spontaneous spike wave discharges, the hallmark of absence seizures (14Papale L.A. Beyer B. Jones J.M. Sharkey L.M. Tufik S. Epstein M. Letts V.A. Meisler M.H. Frankel W.N. Escayg A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Heterozygous Scn8amed-Tg mutants are also more resistant to electrical kindling (15Blumenfeld H. Lampert A. Klein J.P. Mission J. Chen M.C. Rivera M. Dib-Hajj S. Brennan A.R. Hains B.C. Waxman S.G. Epilepsia. 2009; 50: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A null mutation in the human SCN8A gene has been reported in a small pedigree in which heterozygous mutation carriers exhibited a range of phenotypes, including ataxia, cognitive deficits, and emotional instability (16Trudeau M.M. Dalton J.C. Day J.W. Ranum L.P. Meisler M.H. J. Med. Genet. 2006; 43: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A possible role for SCN8A was also reported in studies examining the genetic basis of attempted suicide (17Wasserman D. Geijer T. Rozanov V. Wasserman J. Am. J. Med. Genet. B. Neuropsychiatr.

These findings suggest that SCN8A dysfunction may contribute to a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurobiological investigations of psychiatric disorders, particularly those involving alterations in anxiety and depression, often take the sleep-wake cycle into consideration. Moreover, disrupted sleep is a key feature of depression, schizophrenia, mental retardation, dementia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (19Bourgeois J.A. Coffey S.M. Rivera S.M. Hessl D. Gane L.W.

To better understand the full range of phenotypes associated with altered Scn8a function, we characterized the sleep-wake architecture and behavioral responses of Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants. Because the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a major role in psychiatric diseases, we also evaluated Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants for alterations in the circadian variation of corticosterone secretion. We found a robust impairment in the generation and maintenance of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in non-REM (NREM) sleep, a lowered and flattened diurnal rhythm of corticosterone secretion indicating hypofunctioning of the HPA axis, and a modest improvement in spatial memory. Male Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on the C57BL/6J background. The mice were housed in ventilated cages under uniform conditions in a pathogen-free mouse facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotyping of Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants was performed using primer pair 8aF (5′-ATGCCACAGAAGTGTCATTCC) and 8aR (5′-GGTATTTCCCAGCAAACAGGT) (10Kohrman D.C. Smith M.R. Goldin A.L. Harris J. Meisler M.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5993-5999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 213-bp PCR product was digested with MslI to produce fragments of 129, 75, and 9 bp from the wild-type allele and 102, 75, 27, and 9 bp from the mutant allele. Under isoflurane anesthesia, 10 male Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants and 9 male WT littermates (3–4 months old) were surgically implanted with ECoG and electromyography (EMG) electrodes for polysomnographic recordings. The implant consisted of four sterile screw electrodes (Vintage Machine Supplies, Medina, OH) that were placed subdurally. Two screws were placed on the right hemisphere (2 mm anterior-posterior (AP) and 1.2 mm lateral to the midline (LM); 1.5 mm AP and 1.2 mm LM). On the left hemisphere, the two other screw placements were 0.5 mm AP and 2.2 LM and 3.5 mm AP and 2.2 mm LM. Fine wire electrodes were inserted into the left and right neck muscles for EMG acquisition. Postsurgical pain management was achieved with the administration of ibuprofen (0.1 mg/kg) in the drinking water for 3 days. After the surgery, the animals were housed in Plexiglas boxes (20 × 20 × 30 cm) and allowed to recover for 14 days. The animals were then connected to the ECoG cable and, following 48 h of habituation, 48 h of continuous ECoG/EMG data were collected. Amplified ECoG and EMG signals were digitally acquired, collected, and processed by the Somnologica sleep-recording software package (Embla Medical, Reykjavik, Iceland). The amount of time spent in each state of vigilance was obtained from 48 h of continuous ECoG base-line sleep recordings and manually scored in 10-s intervals. The time spent in each state of vigilance during the 12-h light and 12-h dark phases from day 1 and day 2 were averaged. To further examine the circadian variation, the average time spent in each state of vigilance during the light and dark phases was also examined in 2-h intervals. The waveforms were classified for wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. A low voltage, high frequency ECoG with elevated and variable EMG was defined as wakefulness. NREM sleep was characterized by an ECoG signal that increased in amplitude and decreased in frequency, with the clear presence of high amplitude delta waves (0.5–4 Hz) and an EMG signal that displayed low regular muscular tone. REM sleep was identified by the presence of regular theta waves (4.5–8 Hz) with a lack of muscle tone and phasic bursts of varying duration and amplitude. For power spectral analysis, all 10-s intervals of NREM sleep were subjected to fast Fourier transformation. The power density in the delta frequency (0.5–4 Hz) was determined by the average for each group. Following the 48 h of base-line ECoG/EMG recordings, Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants and WT littermates were sleep-deprived during the first 6 h of the light phase (7 a.m. to 1 p.m.). Sleep deprivation (SD) was carried out by the introduction of objects into the cage and tapping the cages whenever the animals appeared drowsy. The animals were not touched during SD and were never disturbed during feeding or drinking. SD was immediately followed by 18 h of continuous ECoG recordings during the recovery period (6-h light phase, 12-h dark phase). Blood was collected from the facial vein of 10 male Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants and 10 male WT littermates into Microvette CB 300 EDTA tubes (Starstedt) within 5 min of disturbing the cage at either 7 a.m. or 7 p.m. in order to coincide with the expected nadir and peak of circulating corticosterone levels. The 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. samples from each mouse were collected on consecutive days. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C. Plasma corticosterone levels were assayed using a commercial RIA kit (MP Biomedicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten male Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants and 10 male WT littermates (3–6 months old) were group-housed and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.). All testing was performed during the light phase between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and a period of 1 week was allowed between tests. The same group of animals was subjected to the following sequence of behavioral tests: locomotor activity, light/dark box, open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and object recognition. An experimenter who was blind to the animal's genotype scored videotaped recordings of each test. The animals were individually placed in unfamiliar transparent Plexiglas chambers (40 × 20 × 20 cm). Each chamber was placed on a rack containing seven infrared photobeams spaced 5 cm apart, with each beam 5 cm from the cage wall (San Diego Instruments Inc., La Jolla, CA). Ambulatory activity (consecutive beam brakes) was continuously recorded for 50 h (first 2 h, exploratory activity in response to the novel environment; remaining 48 h, endogenous circadian rhythm). The light/dark box test was performed in a rectangular box that was divided to form a light and a dark compartment. The walls of the light compartment (20 × 14 × 14.5 cm) were covered with white paper. The walls of the dark compartment (10 × 14 × 14.5 cm) were covered with black paper and had a roof constructed of black paper. A removable cardboard partition containing a small square opening at floor level (5 × 5 cm) was used to divide the box into light and dark sides. Each animal was placed into the light side of the box, facing away from the dark side and allowed to explore the apparatus for 5 min. The measurements scored were as follows: time spent in the light and dark sides, latency to enter the dark side, and the number of transitions between each side. The open field apparatus consisted of a circular arena (96.5-cm diameter) with opaque Plexiglas walls (28 cm high). A marker was used to inscribe a smaller circle 18 cm from the walls. Each mouse was placed in the inner circle of the apparatus and allowed to explore for 5 min. The times spent in the inner and outer circles were scored. The elevated plus maze consisted of two open and two closed arms elevated 76 cm above the floor, with each arm projecting 30.5 cm from the center (5 × 5 cm). Each mouse was individually placed in the central area and allowed to explore for 5 min. The measurements scored were as follows: time spent in closed arms, time spent in open arms, and number of entries into open and closed arms. The mice were individually placed into a Plexiglas cylinder (10-cm internal diameter, 50 cm high) filled with water (10-cm deep, 25–26 °C) for 6 min. During the last 4 min of the test, the time spent floating was scored. Floating was defined as immobility or minimal movements necessary to maintain the head above the water. Testing was conducted in an open field box (60 × 60 × 47 cm) constructed of Plexiglas and painted white. In total, four colored ornamental objects were used for testing: a bear, an elephant, a closed bottle, and a dog. The objects were similar in size (∼10 × 6 × 6 cm) but differed in texture. Prior to the test session, the mice were each placed in the empty open field for 5 min on 5 consecutive days (habituation period). The test session consisted of three successive trials, each 5 min in duration, separated by a 20-min intertrial interval. After completing each trial, the animal was returned to the home cage, and the apparatus and objects were wiped with 70% alcohol. In trial 1, the mouse was placed in the empty open field and allowed to freely explore the testing arena. For trial 2, three objects were introduced into the open field, each placed in a separate corner ∼5 cm from the walls. The selection of the objects and their placement within the open field was randomized for each pair of mice. The mice were paired so that one mutant and one WT littermate were examined using the same layout of the objects. Each mouse was placed in the center of the box, facing the unoccupied corner, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded. For trial 3, one object was maintained in the same position as in trial 2 (repeated object), one object from trial 2 was replaced with a novel object in the same location (novel object), and one object from trial 2 was relocated to the previously unoccupied corner of the open field (relocated object). The time spent exploring each object during the 5-min trial was recorded. A mouse was considered to be exploring an object when it was facing the object at a close distance (≤5 mm) or when the mouse's nose or front paws were in contact with the object. The data were reported as means ± S.E. Homogeneity of variance was assessed by the Levene test and normal distribution of the data by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For sleep analysis, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) was used to detect differences between genotypes (mutant versus WT) when the light and dark phases were examined in 12-h periods as well as for each 2-h interval. rANOVA was also used to detect differences within genotypes (base line versus recovery following sleep deprivation) during light and dark phases. Post hoc analysis was performed by Tukey's test. For all the behavior tests except the object recognition test, two-tailed t-tests were used to detect differences between genotypes with significance set at p < 0.05. For the object recognition test, a one-tailed t test was used to analyze differences between genotypes. A value of 50% represented chance performance. Therefore, the one-tailed t test showed whether the performance of each genotype was above 50%. Base-line sleep and circadian rhythm dynamics in Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants were compared with WT littermates. Diurnal rhythms for each state of vigilance (wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep) were present in both genotypes, with expected overall increases in sleep amount during the light phase and increases in wake amount and locomotor activity during the dark phase (Fig. 1). However, sleep and wake amounts and distribution in the mutants differed from WT littermates. The amount of wakefulness observed in mutants and WT littermates was comparable during the light phase. However, the mutants experienced 12% less wakefulness during the dark phase (Fig. 1A). rANOVA detected effects of group (F(1,17) = 9.48, p < 0.01) and time (F(1,17) = 369.9, p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis indicated that the decreased amount of wakefulness during the dark phase was statistically significant (p < 0.01, Tukey's test; Fig. 1A). Although wake amounts during the light phase were not statistically different between genotypes, the mutants did exhibit 14% more NREM sleep during the light phase and 35% more NREM sleep during the dark phase (Fig. 1C). rANOVA detected effects of group (F(1,17) = 23.8, p < 0.0001) and time (F(1,17) = 377.6, p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis revealed that the amounts of NREM sleep observed in the mutants during the light and dark phases were statistically different from corresponding periods in the WT littermates (light, p < 0.05; dark, p < 0.01, Tukey's test). In contrast to the increased amount of NREM sleep, the mutants experienced 55% less REM sleep during the light phase when compared with the WT littermates (Fig. 1E). Surprisingly, during the dark phase, the percentage of time spent in REM sleep was similar between genotypes. rANOVA detected effects of group (F(1,17) = 59.8, p < 0.0001), time (F(1,17) = 205.2, p < 0.0001), and an interaction between group and time (F(1,17) = 47.3, p < 0.0001). The impairment of REM sleep amount in the mutants during the light phase was statistically significant (p < 0.0001, Tukey's test). To perform a more detailed sleep-wake analysis, the different states of vigilance were also analyzed in 2-h intervals. rANOVA followed by post hoc analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences between genotypes in amounts of wake (Fig. 1B) and NREM sleep (Fig. 1D) during the light and dark phases (p > 0.05 for all comparisons, Tukey's test). In contrast, the mutants spent less time in REM sleep during the last 8 h (11 a.m. to 7 p.m.) of the light period (Fig. 1F). rANOVA detected effects of group (F(1,17) = 90.4, p < 0.001) and time (F(5,85) = 5.8, p < 0.001). The amount of REM sleep was statistically different between genotypes during this period (p < 0.01, Tukey's test). However, differences in amount of REM sleep during the dark phase were not statistically significant (p > 0.05, Tukey's test; Fig. 1F). Because no compensatory increase in REM sleep was observed during the dark phase, the mutants appear to be chronically REM sleep-deprived. Representative examples of ECoG waveforms for each state of vigilance are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. To determine whether the mutants have altered sleep-wake cycling, we analyzed the number of transitions (stage shifts) between the different states of vigilance and the mean duration of REM sleep bouts (Table 1). For the stage shifts during the light period, the mutants had fewer transitions from NREM sleep to REM sleep and from REM sleep to wakefulness when compared with WT littermates. rANOVA detected effects of group (F(1,17) = 20.2, p < 0.001), shifts (F(4,68) = 255.07, p < 0.0001), and interaction between group and shifts (F(4,68) = 17.1, p < 0.0001). These differences in the number transitions were statistically significant (p < 0.01 for both comparisons, Tukey's test). No statistically significant differences in stage shifts were observed during the dark phase. The diminished number of transitions between NREM and REM sleep in the mutants contributed to the reduced amount of REM sleep during the light phase.TABLE 1Number of arousals and sleep-wake transitions in Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants and WT littermates during the 24-h base-line recording12-h light phase12-h dark phaseScn8amed-jo/+WTScn8amed-jo/+WTTotal arousals105.9 ± 11.3132.7 ± 7.663.2 ± 5.264.5 ± 7.2Wake to NREM79.6 ± 4.597.4 ± 3.848.5 ± 4.242.9 ± 4.9NREM to wake53.5 ± 3.744.7 ± 437.4 ± 3.630.6 ± 4.4NREM to REM33.8 ± 2.3ap < 0.01, rANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for the stage shift and unpaired Student's t test for REM duration.59.3 ± 3.312.7 ± 1.112.9 ± 1.7REM to NREM7.7 ± 1.76.8 ± 2.22.2 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.2REM to wake26.1 ± 1.9ap < 0.01, rANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for the stage shift and unpaired Student's t test for REM duration.52.6 ± 1.810.5 ± 1.212 ± 1.6REM duration (min)0.93 ± 0.13ap < 0.01, rANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for the stage shift and unpaired Student's t test for REM duration.1.17 ± 0.181.01 ± 0.221.12 ± 0.15a p < 0.01, rANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for the stage shift and unpaired Student's t test for REM duration. Open table in a new tab The average length of each episode of REM sleep was obtained by dividing the total duration of REM sleep by the total number of REM sleep episodes. When compared with WT littermates, REM sleep duration was statistically lower in the mutants during the light phase (Scn8amed-jo/+, 0.93 ± 0.13 min; WT, 1.17 ± 0.18 min; t(17) = 3.11, p < 0.01). However, REM sleep duration was comparable during the dark phase (Scn8amed-jo/+, 1.01 ± 0.2 min; WT, 1.12 ± 0.15 min; t(17) = 1.18, p > 0.05). Therefore, the decrease in overall REM sleep observed during base-line recording is due to a reduction in both the number and duration of REM sleep episodes in the mutants during the light phase. NREM sleep is a restorative phase of sleep that is characterized by slow wave delta oscillations (0.5–4 Hz). The strength of these oscillations, measured as delta power, is positively associated with the duration of prior wakefulness. Consequently, delta power is a quantitative measure of sleep intensity during NREM sleep. Because we observed that Scn8amed-jo/+ mutants are chronically REM sleep-deprived and experience excessive NREM sleep, we sought to determine whether sleep intensity was also altered. Because absolute values of delta power vary substantially between subjects, we performed a within-subject normalization of delta power to allow comparisons between mutants and WT littermates. We accomplished this by averaging the absolute delta power into 2-h intervals for each subject and dividing each 2-h average by the 24-h average (supplemental Fig. 2). rANOVA followed by post hoc analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences between mutants and WT littermates (p > 0.05, Tukey's test). We also compared sleep-wake amounts between mutants and WT littermates following a period of SD. After 6 h of SD, continuous ECoG recordings were obtained for 18 h of the subsequent recovery period (6-h light phase, 12-h dark phase). Because the base-line sleep distribution was different between the two genotypes, analyses were performed within each genotype. The amount of NREM and REM sleep during the recovery period was compared with the equivalent time period during base-line recording. Although 6 h of SD is considered to be mild, increased levels of NREM and REM sleep were expected during the recovery period. The percentage increase in NREM sleep in"

Inhibition of MMP-2 activity or depletion of its levels attenuated 15(S)-HETE-induced HDMVEC migration, tube formation, and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. 15(S)-HETE also induced Fra-1 and c-Jun expression in a Rac1-MEK1-JNK1-dependent manner. In addition, 15(S)-HETE-induced MMP-2 expression and activity were mediated by Rac1-MEK1-JNK1-dependent activation of AP-1 (Fra-1/c-Jun).

https://openalex.org/W2084133814,"Background Because they have air stored in many body compartments, diving seabirds are expected to exhibit efficient behavioural strategies for reducing costs related to buoyancy control. We study the underwater locomotor activity of a deep-diving species from the Cormorant family (Kerguelen shag) and report locomotor adjustments to the change of buoyancy with depth. Methodology/Principal Findings Using accelerometers, we show that during both the descent and ascent phases of dives, shags modelled their acceleration and stroking activity on the natural variation of buoyancy with depth. For example, during the descent phase, birds increased swim speed with depth. But in parallel, and with a decay constant similar to the one in the equation explaining the decrease of buoyancy with depth, they decreased foot-stroke frequency exponentially, a behaviour that enables birds to reduce oxygen consumption. During ascent, birds also reduced locomotor cost by ascending passively. We considered the depth at which they started gliding as a proxy to their depth of neutral buoyancy. This depth increased with maximum dive depth. As an explanation for this, we propose that shags adjust their buoyancy to depth by varying the amount of respiratory air they dive with. Conclusions/Significance Calculations based on known values of stored body oxygen volumes and on deep-diving metabolic rates in avian divers suggest that the variations of volume of respiratory oxygen associated with a respiration mediated buoyancy control only influence aerobic dive duration moderately. Therefore, we propose that an advantage in cormorants - as in other families of diving seabirds - of respiratory air volume adjustment upon diving could be related less to increasing time of submergence, through an increased volume of body oxygen stores, than to reducing the locomotor costs of buoyancy control."

To understand the effects of TTBK1 on tauopathy in vivo, we have developed bigenic mice overexpressing full-length TTBK1 and the P301L tau mutant. The bigenic mice show enhanced tau phosphorylation at multiple sites (AT8, 12E8, PHF-1, and pS422), tauC3-immunoreactive tau fragmentation, and accumulation of tau aggregates in cortical and hippocampal neurons at 12–13 mo of age. However, the phosphorylated tau aggregates were predominantly sarkosyl soluble and migrated in the light sucrose density fraction after discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, which suggests that they form small oligomers. The bigenic mice show significant locomotor dysfunction as determined by both rotorod and grip strength tests, as well as enhanced loss of motor neurons in the L4-L5 spinal cord. This neuronal dysfunction and degeneration was associated with increased levels of tau oligomers, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 activators p35 and p25, and pY216 phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3-β. These data suggest that TTBK1 up-regulation enhances tau phosphorylation and oligomerization, whose toxicity results in enhanced neurodegeneration and locomotor dysfunction in a tauopathy animal model.—Xu, J., Sato, S., Okuyama, S., Swan, R.

The LBD of ERβ is only 60% homologous to that of ERα; these differences allow for the existence of subtype-specific ligands (1Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Radek J.T. Meyers M.J. Nettles K.W.

Ligand binding to the LBDs of ERα and ERβ induces conformational changes within the receptor that influence its ability to homodimerize or heterodimerize and to recognize distinct DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes. The DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of ERα and ERβ also contain weak dimerization modules and are 96% conserved. Of the residues composing the zinc finger domains that directly recognize DNA, 100% of the residues are conserved. Thus, although ERα and ERβ homodimers have been found to regulate common target genes, their abilities to regulate distinct target genes likely account for their opposing cellular functions: ERα promotes cell proliferation, whereas ERβ inhibits it (6Helguero L.A.

Transcriptional regulation by ERs is tightly controlled by a variety of interacting partners, including chaperone proteins belonging to the heat shock protein family. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone protein that regulates signal transduction by NRs and protein kinases. This molecular chaperone associates with the unliganded form of ERs as well as the androgen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor (8Fang Y.

Ligand binding to each NR induces a conformational change within the receptor, causing its dissociation from Hsp90, leading to receptor dimerization, interaction with cofactors, DNA binding, and target gene activation. Thus, molecular chaperoning is an essential initial step in the tightly regulated process of ligand-dependent transcriptional control of ERs. In the ligand-free form, ERα is sequestered and held inactive by a large molecular complex organized around Hsp90, a p23 protein, and one immunophilin (9Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This molecular complex stabilizes ERα, and inhibition of Hsp90 by chemical ligands targets the client ERα to ubiquitination and its subsequent 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation (11Roe S.M.

Whereas the interaction of ERα and other NRs with Hsp90 molecular chaperone complexes is well documented, substantially less data are available on the role of this molecular chaperone in transcriptional regulation by ERβ. Nevertheless, both ERα and ERβ have been shown to interact with Hsp90 in the absence of endogenous and exogenous estrogens, and exposure of cells to Hsp90 inhibitors results in proteasome-mediated degradation of both receptor isoforms (13Gougelet A. Bouclier C. Marsaud V. Maillard S. Mueller S.O. Korach K.S. Renoir J.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, different Hsp90 ligands differentially affect the degradation of ERα and ERβ, suggesting that the stability of the receptor subtypes is differentially regulated by Hsp90 (13Gougelet A.

Upon ligand binding and dissociation from the Hsp90 molecular complex, ERα and ERβ may form DNA-binding homodimers or heterodimers depending on the context of the bound ligand. These estrogen-responsive DNA-binding sequences may be canonical estrogen response elements (EREs) with which ERs directly interact; however, ERs also activate the transcription of other DNA sequences via tethering to other transcription factors such as Sp1 and AP-1. Direct DNA binding to EREs is thought to stabilize ER dimers via the dimerization interface located within the DBD, although this dimerization interface is thought to be substantially weaker than the LBD dimerization interface (14Kuntz M.A. Shapiro D.J.

This weaker dimerization interface located within the DBD has been proposed to be a constitutive dimerization interface, and DNA binding in response to estrogen is thought to stabilize ER dimers via interactions between the two dimerization interfaces located in the DBD and LBD (17Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Because of the fact that the co-presence of ERα and ERβ results in a heterogeneous population of homodimers and heterodimers, many aspects of ERα/β heterodimer signaling and physiological effects have remained elusive. Using highly optimized bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, we have shown previously that ERα is the dominant partner within a heterodimer in that ligand binding to ERα alone, and not ERβ, can induce heterodimerization (18Powell E. Xu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19012-19017Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the role of Hsp90 in ERα/β heterodimer action has not been explored. Furthermore, despite the well recognized mechanism of ER signaling via interaction with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex, ligand binding, interaction with coactivators, and recognition of EREs to activate the transcription of target genes, the order in which these events occur in the cellular context remains controversial. Another controversial area of study in the field of ER biology is whether ER monomers are preloaded on DNA with the Hsp90 complex in the absence of ligand or whether ERs associate with DNA as fully formed dimers. Previous studies have shown that when ER DBDs recognize half-site EREs in the promoter regions of target genes, the dimerization interface within the DBD stabilizes dimerized ERs on the DNA (19Green S. Kumar V. Theulaz I. Wahli W. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Green S. Chambon P.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, the widely accepted notion that ER DBDs do not associate with DNA as monomers but rather only as dimers has been challenged by a few in vitro studies (17Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 22Murdoch F.E. Byrne L.M. Ariazi E.A. Furlow J.D. Meier D.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9144-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and thus remains ambiguous. Moreover, the role of molecular chaperoning by Hsp90 in ERβ estrogen-regulated transcriptional activity is poorly understood, and the sequential process in which estrogenic ligand binding to ERs causes their dissociation from Hsp90, homo- or heterodimerization, and the initiation of target gene transcription is completely unexplored in the case of the ERα/β heterodimer. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of the Hsp90 complex in ER homodimer and heterodimer formation as well as to decipher the role of DNA binding in the crucial initial step of homo- or heterodimerization prior to estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation. We have found that, although functional interaction with Hsp90 is essential for the transcriptional activity of both ERα and ERβ, the requirement of Hsp90 for dimerization is markedly different for different dimer pairs. Specifically, whereas ERα dimerization requires functional Hsp90, this molecular chaperone is not critical for the dimerization potential of ERβ. Hsp90 appears to play a less critical role in ERα/β heterodimerization than in ERα/α homodimerization, although the transcription of non-degraded ERα/α homodimers is able to remain active when Hsp90 is inhibited. Furthermore, ERs appear to associate with DNA after they are dimerized, and DNA recognition appears to play a minor role in stabilizing all three dimer pairs, especially in the case of the ERβ/β homodimer. This is in keeping with previous findings that ERβ/β homodimers maintain a high level of ligand-independent dimerization and transcriptional activation (23Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation by ERs for all three dimer pairs is shared at some steps but differs at other crucial steps. 17β-Estradiol (E2) was obtained from Sigma. 17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) was a kind gift from the laboratory of Dr. Shannon Kenney (University of Wisconsin, Madison). 8-[(Benzylthio)methyl]-(7CI,8CI) (TPBM) was identified in a high throughput screen (25Mao C.

HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cultures were split 1:12 when they reached confluency (∼3 days). One day before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded at a confluency of ∼50% in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum stripped six times with charcoal and dextran (stripped fetal serum). For BRET assays, cells were transfected with 435 ng of total construct DNA using TurboFect transfection reagent (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reporter gene assays, cells were transfected in batches with 2.5 ng of ERα alone, ERβ alone, or ERα + ERβ along with 50 ng of pTK-ERE-Luc plasmid and 15 ng of pCMX-β-gal per well and simultaneously seeded in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% stripped fetal serum in 48-well plates. For Western blots, HEK293 cells were transfected with 625 ng of each ER and treated with the indicated ligands in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% stripped fetal serum. HEK293 cells were either transfected with a single BRET fusion plasmid (pCMX-ERα-RLuc or pCMX-RLuc-ERβ) or cotransfected with Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) BRET fusion plasmids (pCMX-ERα-RLuc + pCMX-YFP-ERβ for ERα/ERβ heterodimers, pCMX-ERα-RLuc + pCMX-ERα-YFP for ERα homodimers, or pCMX-RLuc-ERβ + pCMX-YFP-ERβ for ERβ homodimers) as described above. Empty expression vector pCMX-pL2 was used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline in quadruplicate at ≈50,000 cells/well of a 96-well white-bottom microplate. Cells were incubated with ligand for 1 h in the 96-well format unless alternative treatment times are indicated. For BRET assays that were treated with ligands for >1 h, ligands were diluted in medium, and cells were treated in batches in 6-well plates. The amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle was held constant at 0.6%/well for 1-h treatments and 0.1% for longer time points treated in batches in medium. Cells transfected with pCMX-pL2, pCMX-ERα-RLuc, or pCMX-RLuc-ERβ alone were used as controls and incubated with DMSO under the same experimental conditions as the cotransfected conditions. Coelenterazine h (Promega) was added in phosphate-buffered saline at a final concentration of 5 μm, and 460- and 530-nm emission detection measurements were immediately taken at 0.1 s/wavelength read/well on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences VICTOR3 V plate reader. Although RLuc peaks in the presence of coelenterazine h at an emission wavelength of 470 nm, the closest filter available on the plate reader detected emission at 460 nm. The BRET ratio was calculated as described (29Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1b). HEK293 cells were transfected in batches in 48-well plates using 2.5 ng of each indicated ER and 50 ng of pTK-ERE-Luc vector per well as described above. After allowing 48 h for protein expression and incubating with the indicated ligands for 24 h, cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase emission was detected upon the addition of the firefly luciferase substrate (Promega) on the VICTOR3 V plate reader using a luminescence detection setting. β-Galactosidase was analyzed using the Tropix β-galactosidase detection kit, and emission was detected on the VICTOR3 V plate reader using a luminescence detection setting. Luciferase counts were normalized to β-galactosidase counts in each well. For the side-by-side BRET/firefly luciferase reporter assays, increasing titrations (1, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μg per well of 6-well plates) of the pERE-Luc reporter were cotransfected along with BRET fusions following the BRET transfection protocol described above. The total amount of DNA was kept constant per well using the pCMX-pL2 empty vector. HEK293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates as described above. After allowing 48 h for protein expression and treatment with the indicated ligands for the indicated times, cells were lysed, and total protein lysates was run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and ERα, ERβ, or β-actin (loading control) expression was detected using antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (HC-20 and H-150, for ERα and ERβ, respectively) and Sigma (A5441 for β-actin). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with ERα or ERβ (3 μg/well of each 10-cm dish). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with the indicated ligands by replacing the medium, and cells were lysed 24 h after treatment. Lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibody to endogenous Hsp90 (H-114, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated lysates were then run on an SDS-PAGE system, and Western blotting was performed using an antibody to ERα (HC-20) or ERβ (H-150). To elucidate the role of Hsp90 in the ligand-dependent dimerization of ERα and ERβ, we employed our highly optimized BRET assays (Fig. 1a) (18Powell E. Xu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19012-19017Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This assay detects proximity between two proteins of interest fused to a donor (RLuc) and acceptor (YFP) protein (30Bacart J. Corbel C. Jockers R. Bach S. Couturier C. Biotechnol. J. 2008; 3: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Koterba K.L. Rowan B.G. Nuclear Recept.

Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To eliminate interference dimerization of fusion constructs with endogenous ERs, the ER-negative cell line HEK293 was utilized. The high transfection efficiency (>90%) and low doubling time of this cell line also made it an attractive candidate for use in these studies. HEK293 cells were transfected with either ERα or ERβ fused to either RLuc or YFP. Thus, if a ligand was able to induce ER homodimerization or heterodimerization, depending on the fusion proteins cotransfected, RLuc would be brought into proximity with YFP. Upon the addition of the RLuc substrate coelenterazine h, which causes RLuc to emit at a peak wavelength of 470 nm, energy was transferred to YFP, exciting it at 515 nm and causing it to emit at a peak wavelength of 530 nm. Thus, YFP emission was indicative of dimerization, and the wavelength emissions of RLuc and YFP were used to calculate a BRET ratio to quantify the signal (Fig. 1b) (see Ref. 29Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar for a more detailed explanation). We have previously characterized and optimized this assay and all BRET fusion constructs used (18Powell E. Xu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19012-19017Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); nuclear localization of constructs is shown in Fig. 1c. HEK293 cells transfected with ERα and ERβ fusions to YFP and RLuc were exposed to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, which is a synthetic analog of the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Geldanamycin and its synthetic analogs bind with high affinity to the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, inhibiting its function as a molecular chaperone for NRs. A 2-h treatment with 17-DMAG has been shown previously to be sufficient to release ERs from the Hsp90 complex, but ERs are not yet degraded at this time point (Fig. 2a, inset) (34Beliakoff J. Bagatell R. Paine-Murrieta G. Taylor C.W. Lykkesfeldt A.E. Whitesell L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4961-4971PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were confirmed quantitatively by detecting emission of the RLuc and YFP BRET fusions to ER in the presence of coelenterazine h (for RLuc emission) or YFP excitation (for YFP emission) (data not shown). BRET assays were used to directly examine the dimerization of ERα/α, ERβ/β, and ERα/β (Fig. 2, a and b); 10 nm E2 induced all three dimer pairs, whereas 212 nm 17-DMAG alone did not influence the background BRET ratio for any dimer pair at this time point. The E2-induced dimerization of ERα/α, ERβ/β, and ERα/β was statically significant in both the absence (compare DMSO versus E2) and presence (compare 17-DMAG versus E2 + 17-DMAG) of the Hsp90 inhibitor. However, the combination of 212 nm 17-DMAG and 10 nm E2 resulted in a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.002) in E2-mediated ERα/α homodimerization after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 2a, upper panel), which was not a sufficient amount of time for 17-DMAG-mediated ER degradation (Fig. 2a, inset). We therefore conclude that ERα/α homodimerization is heavily dependent upon the interaction of ERα monomers with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex. In contrast, ERα/β heterodimerization is influenced to a lesser, statistically non-significant extent by Hsp90 inhibition (p = 0.09) than is ERα homodimerization, suggesting that these heterodimers may be less dependent on molecular chaperoning by Hsp90 for their dimerization potential. Similar to ERα/β heterodimers, ERβ/β homodimers were minimally influenced by Hsp90 disruption with a 2-h co-treatment of 212 nm 17-DMAG and 10 nm E2, and this decrease was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). These data suggest that there are inherent differences in the influence of Hsp90 on ER dimer pairs, with ERα/α homodimers being the most heavily dependent on Hsp90 for its dimerization potential. Transfection of HEK293 cells with BRET fusions to ER and co-treatment with E2, 17-DMAG, or the combination of E2 + 17-DMAG for 24 h led to ER degradation (Fig. 2b, inset) (13Gougelet A. Bouclier C. Marsaud V. Maillard S. Mueller S.O. Korach K.S. Renoir J.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Degradation of ERs via Western blotting was confirmed quantitatively by detecting emission of the RLuc and YFP BRET fusions to ER in the presence of coelenterazine h (for RLuc emission) or YFP excitation (for YFP emission) (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2b, a statistically significant decrease in ERα/α homodimerization (p = 0.0005) occurred with a 24-h co-treatment of E2 + 17-DMAG compared with E2 alone, suggesting that the critical Hsp90 transcriptional regulation of ERα homodimers occurs at the initial dimerization step, and this is likely due to the combination of initial ERα/α homodimer abrogation and proteasomal degradation of ERα at this time point. In contrast, a 24-h co-treatment did not drastically reduce ERβ/β homodimerization (p = 0.06), despite the fact that ERβ was partially degraded at this time point (Fig. 2b, inset) (13Gougelet A. Bouclier C. Marsaud V. Maillard S. Mueller S.O. Korach K.S. Renoir J.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is in keeping with previous findings that ERβ maintains a high level of ligand-independent dimerization (18Powell E. Xu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19012-19017Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and transcriptional activity (23Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Because these ligand-independent ERβ/β homodimers are not predicted to be associated with Hsp90, the total population of ERβ/β homodimers is less influenced by Hsp90 inhibition, despite degradation of the ERβ subpopulation that is associated with the chaperone complex. The intermediate statistically significant decrease in ERα/β heterodimerization (p = 0.0008) upon a 24-h co-treatment with E2 and 17-DMAG is likely due to ERα degradation at this time point, which is in keeping with our previous finding that ERα is the dominant heterodimeric partner (18Powell E. Xu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19012-19017Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The decrease in the BRET signal in the presence of 17-DMAG alone compared with the vehicle DMSO is likely due to degradation of these receptors. The transcriptional activity of ERs was significantly decreased by a 24-h treatment with 17-DMAG (p = 0.001, 0.002, and 0.02 for ERα + ERα, ERβ + ERβ, and ERα + ERβ, respectively) (Fig. 3a). However, when comparing DMSO to E2 as well as 17-DMAG to 17-DMAG + E2, the increases in transcriptional activity were statistically significant (p < 0.05), and we thus cannot exclude the possibility that the reduced signal was due to ERα/α degradation resulting from 17-DMAG addition. Indeed, the fold induction of DMSO to E2 and 17-DMAG to 17-DMAG + E2 was similar (9.5-fold versus 7.4-fold, respectively, for ERα/α homodimer transcriptional activity). This is likely the result of transcriptional activity of non-degraded ERs in the presence of the Hsp90 inhibitor. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that E2 and the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, as well as the combination of these ligands, disrupted the ER-Hsp90 interaction (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these results indicate that the contribution of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex differentially regulates ERs at the initial dimerization step. This initial upstream dimerization step is critical to the transcriptional activity of ERs on the regulatory regions of target genes. To elucidate the contribution of DNA binding to this critical process, we first performed BRET assays using a cotransfected pERE-Luc plasmid (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 (right panels) shows that the ERE-luciferase element was transcriptionally activated by cotransfected ER BRET fusions in an estrogen-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Fig. 4 (left panels) shows that the presence of the ERE had a negligible effect on the BRET signal (p > 0.05), indicating that DNA binding has a minor effect on dimerization. However, it is possible that the transfected EREs do not compete with binding of ER fusion proteins to chromatinized EREs of target genes. Therefore, to further examine the effect of DNA binding to dimerization, we treated cells with the compound theophylline (TPBM), which disrupts the ability of ERs to bind DNA (25Mao C. Patterson N.M.

To test this hypothesis, we employed four distinct models.

Obesity is the most prevalent nutrition-related disease in the United States, where 66% of the adult population is classified as overweight or obese (1Khan L. Sobush K. Keener D. Goodman K. Lowry A.

Annual health care costs for treating the overweight and obese population are ∼$100 billion. Thus, maintaining ideal body weight will decrease the incidence of and health care costs associated with obesity.

Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and markers of oxidative stress (e.g. isoprostaglandin (iso-PG) F2α) and atherosclerosis (e.g. C-reactive protein (34Risérus U.

Consistent with these data, CLA supplementation (i.e. equal levels of 9,11- and 10,12-isomers) adversely affects insulin and glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes (35Moloney F. Yeow T.P. Mullen A. Nolan J.J. Roche H.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 80: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that supplementing postmenopausal women with an equal mixture of 10,12- and 9,11-CLA increases serum triglyceride (TG) levels, C-reactive protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urinary levels of iso-PGF2α compared with treatment with the 9,11-isomer alone (32Tholstrup T. Raff M. Straarup E.M. Lund P. Basu S. Bruun J.M. J. Nutr. 2008; 138: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin and tumor necrosis factor-α levels were elevated in the serum and WAT, respectively, of women consuming the CLA mixture compared with the olive oil control subjects (9Raff M.

Similarly, we have demonstrated that 10,12-CLA, but not 9,11-CLA, decreases the TG content of primary cultures of newly differentiated human adipocytes (18Brown J.M. Halvorsen Y.D. Lea-Currie Y.R.

However, 10,12-CLA increases the expression levels of genes and proteins linked to chronic inflammation in these cultures, resulting in adverse metabolic consequences such as insulin resistance (23Brown J.M.

Indeed, chronic inflammation driven by NF-κB and specific mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) antagonize peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activity, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activation of genes needed for glucose and fatty acid uptake and conversion to lipids. Consistent with these data, we have demonstrated that 10,12-CLA suppression of PPARγ activity and target gene expression is linked to the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 (23Brown J.M.

Therefore, 1) the effective and safe use of CLA for weight loss or maintenance remains unclear, 2) the precise mechanism by which 10,12-CLA promotes inflammation and delipidation is unknown, and 3) the cell type in our primary cultures of human adipocytes responsible for mediating the inflammatory effects of CLA is unknown. To better understand the connection between inflammation and delipidation induced by CLA in our cultures, it is important first to identify the cell type in our cultures that is responsible for initiating the inflammatory effects of CLA. Thus, the objective of this research was to identify the role that preadipocytes versus adipocytes play in mediating 10,12-CLA-mediated inflammation in primary cultures of newly differentiated human adipocytes.

PGF2α and AL-8810 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Abdominal WAT was obtained from non-diabetic Caucasian and African American females between the ages of 20 and 50 years with a body mass index ≤ 32.0 who had undergone elective surgery as described previously (23Brown J.M.

These selection criteria allow for reduced variation in gender, age, and obesity status. Institutional Review Board approval was granted through the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital. Stromal vascular (SV) cells from human WAT were isolated via collagenase digestion and subsequently grown as described previously (23Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CLA was administered at a physiological level of 50 μm. Each experiment was repeated at least twice using a mixture of cells from at least three different subjects unless otherwise indicated. Because our previous CLA studies had been conducted in primary cultures of human adipocytes containing ∼50% preadipocytes and 50% adipocytes (36Chung S. Brown J.M. Provo J.N. Hopkins R. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38445-38456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we did not know which cells were instigating inflammation or insulin resistance in response to CLA treatment. To better understand the extent to which preadipocytes and adipocytes initiated inflammation in these cultures, we developed four distinct cell models described below. Four human (pre)adipocyte cell models containing ∼0, 10, 30, and 50% adipocytes (i.e. AD0, AD10, AD30, and AD50) were established by modulating exposure to differentiation medium (DM-1) containing 250 μm isobuthylmethylxanthine and 1 μm rosiglitazone (BRL49653; a PPARγ agonist generously provided by Dr. Per Sauerberg at Novo Nordisk A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). SV cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at 4 × 104 cells/cm2. AD0 cultures received no treatment with DM-1 for 8 d. AD10, AD30, and AD50 cultures were supplemented with DM-1 for 5 h, 3 d, or 6 d, respectively (Fig. 1A). Cells were treated with 50 μm 10,12-CLA for 12 h and harvested on day 8. For MAPK and activating protein-1 (AP-1) activation shown in Fig. 3, cells were treated for 6, 12, and 24 h.FIGURE 3Time-dependent increase in the activation of MAPK and transcription factors in AD50 versus AD0 cultures treated with 10,12-CLA. AD0 and AD50 cultures were treated with 50 μm 10,12-CLA (C lanes) or BSA (B lanes) control for 6, 12, or 24 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed for protein expression via immunoblot. Membranes were probed with antibodies targeting phosphorylated and total ERK, JNK, and p38 (A) and P-c-Jun, c-Jun, ATF3, and GAPDH (n = 2) (B). The data in both panels are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SV cells were grown in 100-mm dishes containing ∼3 million cells and were differentiated to ∼30% adipocytes (AD30). On day 8, cells were treated with 50 μm 10,12-CLA or BSA vehicle for 12 h (Fig. 4). Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and trypsinized with trypsin-like enzyme at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were layered on 6% iodixanol (Optiprep, Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway; ∼1.03 g/ml) in HBSS containing 0.5% BSA in a 15-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 650 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The floating adipocytes were collected from the top of the tube, placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, resuspended in HBSS, and recentrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g to remove any cell debris. The remaining supernatant was removed, and the SV cells were collected from the pellet and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. TriReagent was added to each tube for RNA extraction. SV cells were seeded in cell culture inserts seeded with 0.2 million cells/insert and in 6-well Multiwell™ plates seeded at 4 × 104 cells/cm2. Inserts and wells received either AM-1 until day 8 to achieve AD0 cultures or DM-1 for 6 d to achieve AD50 cultures. At day 8 of differentiation, inserts were transferred over underlying wells, and a recovery period of ∼15 h was allotted to allow for a decrease in potential stress due to the transfer (Fig. 5). Next, both wells and inserts were supplemented with 50 μm 10,12-CLA or BSA vehicle control for 12 h, and inflammatory gene expression was measured via qPCR in cultures harvested from the underlying wells. SV cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at 4 × 104 cells/cm2. Cultures received either AM-1 for 8 d or DM-1 for 6 d to achieve AD0 and AD50 cultures, respectively (Fig. 6). On day 8, cells were treated with 50 μm 10,12-CLA or BSA control for 24 h after which CM was collected and stored at −80 °C for subsequent experiments. Naive AD0 and AD50 cultures were treated with a 1:1 ratio of thawed CM and fresh AM-1 at day 8 of differentiation. Intracellular lipid and nuclei were visualized by staining cultures with ORO and Mayer's hematoxylin, respectively, as described previously (18Brown J.M. Halvorsen Y.D. Lea-Currie Y.R. Geigerman C. McIntosh M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To establish the differentiation model, photomicrographs were taken using an Olympus microscope digital camera, model DP71, to provide micrographs of the degree of lipid accumulation in relation to nuclei in the cultures. In Fig. 1B, three fields were captured per well with three replicates per treatment group (i.e. AD0, AD10, AD30, and AD50). Therefore, a total of nine pictures were taken per treatment group. Data are expressed as the percentage of ORO-stained adipocytes to total cell number. TG levels were determined with a modified commercially available TG assay as described previously (19Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Jensen S.S. Morrison R.F. Storkson J. Lea-Currie R. Pariza M. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To normalize the TG content, DNA was isolated using a DNeasy® blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then quantified using a Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated from cell cultures using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol for reverse transcription-PCR. For real-time qPCR, 2 μg of total RNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA using the Applied Biosystems high capacity cDNA archive kit. qPCR was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix and TaqMan gene expression assays. To account for possible variation-related to cDNA input amounts or the presence of PCR inhibitors, the endogenous reference gene GAPDH was quantified simultaneously for each sample in separate wells of the same 96-well plate. Immunoblotting was conducted as described previously using NuPage precast gels from Invitrogen (23Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were determined using the BioPlex® suspension array system from Bio-Rad following the manufacturer's protocol. PGE2 and PGF2 were measured with a stable isotope dilution gas chromatographic/negative ion chemical ionization/mass spectrometric (GC/NICI/MS) assay (38Awas J.A. Soteriou M.C. Drougas J.G. Stokes K.A. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Pinson C.W. Transplantation. 1996; 61: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, PGE2-d4 (2.12 ng) and PGF2-d4 (0.84 ng) internal standards were added to the media samples. The samples were then acidified to pH 3.0 with 1 n HCl and extracted on a C18 Sep-Pak. PGE2 and PGF2 were eluted with ethyl acetate:heptane and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen (N2). PGE2 and PGF2 in methoxylamine solution were extracted with ethyl acetate and evaporated with N2. The pentafluorobenzyl esters were purified by TLC (PGF2 and PGE2 methyl esters were used as TLC standards) and converted to O-methyloxime pentafluorobenzyl ester trimethylsilyl derivatives, and PGE2 and PGF2 were dissolved in undecane that was dried over a bed of calcium hydride. GC/NICI/MS analysis was performed as described previously with the ions for PGE2 (m/z 526) and [4H2]PGE2 as the internal standard (m/z 528) and the ions for PGF2 (m/z 569) and [4H2]PGF2 as the internal standard (m/z 573). Total F2-IsoPs were measured by GC/MS with selective ion monitoring (39Morrow J.D. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 40Milatovic D. Yin Z. Gupta R.C. Sidoryk M. Albrecht J. Aschner J.L. Aschner M. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 98: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol containing 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene, sonicated, and then subjected to chemical saponification with 15% KOH to hydrolyze bound F2-IsoPs. The cell lysates were adjusted to a pH of 3.0 followed by the addition of 0.1 ng of 4H2-labeled 15-F2α-IsoP internal standard. F2-IsoPs were subsequently purified by C18 and silica Sep-Pak extraction and by TLC. They were then analyzed with pentafluorobenzyl ester, a trimethylsilyl ether derivative, via GC/NICI/MS assay. The release of [14C]oleic acid into CM was measured after a 3-, 9-, or 24-h treatment of (pre)adipocyte cultures with 10,12-CLA or BSA vehicle as described previously (20Chung S. Brown J.M. Sandberg M.B. McIntosh M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 885-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed for data in Figs. 1, B and C, and 9B using one-way ANOVA. Analyses were performed for data in Figs. 2, 4, B and C, 5B, 6B, 7, 8A, and 9A using two-way ANOVA with interaction (JMP, version 6.03, SAS Institute). The data in Fig. 8B were analyzed by a multifactor ANOVA with interaction. Student's t tests were used to compute individual pairwise comparisons of least square means (p < 0.05). Data"

A recent finding that point mutation R33Q leads to lethal catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) implies a crucial role for the N terminus. In this study, we demonstrate that this mutation resides in a highly conserved alternately charged residue cluster (DGKDR; cluster 1) in the N-terminal end of calsequestrin. We further show that this cluster configures itself as a ring system and that the dipolar arrangement within the cluster brings about a critical conformational flip of Lys31-Asp32 essential for dimer stabilization by formation of a H-bond network. We additionally show that Ca2+-induced calsequestrin aggregation is nonlinear and reversible and can regain the native conformation by Ca2+ chelation with EGTA. This study suggests that cluster 1 works as a molecular switch and governs the bidirectional transition between the CASQ2 monomer and dimer. We further demonstrate that mutations disrupting the alternating charge pattern of the cluster, including R33Q, impair Ca2+-CASQ2 interaction, leading to altered polymerization-depolymerization dynamics. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the functional effects of the R33Q mutation and its potential role in CPVT.

Together with GidA, in a heterotetrameric α2β2 complex, it is involved in the modification of the wobble uridine base U34 of the first anticodon position of particular tRNAs. Here we show, using various spin-labeled MnmE mutants and EPR spectroscopy, that GidA binding induces large conformational and dynamic changes in MnmE. It stimulates the GTPase reaction by stabilizing the GTP-bound conformation in a potassium-independent manner. Surprisingly, GidA binding influences not only the GTP- but also the GDP-bound conformation. Thus GidA is a new type of regulator for a G protein activated by dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2136850283,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, and despite improvements in the overall survival rate, it still lacks an effective treatment. Src plays an important role in cancer, and recently high Src activity was documented in medulloblastoma. In this report, we examined the effects of novel pyrazolo-[3,4-d]-pyrirnidine derivative Src inhibitors in medulloblastoma. By MTS assay, we showed that the pyrimidine derivatives indicated as S7, S29, and SI163 greatly reduce the growth rate of medulloblastoma cells by inhibiting Src phosphorylation, compared with HT22 nonneoplastic nerve cells. These compounds also halt cells in the G2/M phase, and this effect likely occurs through the regulation of cdc2 and CDC25C phosphorylation, as shown by Western blot. Moreover, the exposure to pyrimidine derivatives induces apoptosis, assayed by the supravital propidium iodide assay, through modulation of the apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl2, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo in a mouse model. Notably, S7, S29, and SI163 show major inhibitory effects on medulloblastoma cell growth compared with the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and etoposide. In conclusion, our results suggest that S7, S29, and SI163 could be novel attractive candidates for the treatment of medulloblastoma or tumors characterized by high Src activity.—Rossi, A., Schenone, S., Angelucci, A., Cozzi, M., Caracciolo, V., Pentimalli, F., Puca, A., Pucci, B., La Montagna, R., Bologna, M., Botta, M., Giordano, A.

https://openalex.org/W1996836021,"Cdc34 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that functions in conjunction with SCF (Skp1.Cullin 1.F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase to catalyze covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains to a target protein. Here we identified direct interactions between the human Cdc34 C terminus and ubiquitin using NMR chemical shift perturbation assays. The ubiquitin binding activity was mapped to two separate Cdc34 C-terminal motifs (UBS1 and UBS2) that comprise residues 206-215 and 216-225, respectively. UBS1 and UBS2 bind to ubiquitin in the proximity of ubiquitin Lys(48) and C-terminal tail, both of which are key sites for conjugation. When bound to ubiquitin in one orientation, the Cdc34 UBS1 aromatic residues (Phe(206), Tyr(207), Tyr(210), and Tyr(211)) are probably positioned in the vicinity of ubiquitin C-terminal residue Val(70). Replacement of UBS1 aromatic residues by glycine or of ubiquitin Val(70) by alanine decreased UBS1-ubiquitin affinity interactions. UBS1 appeared to support the function of Cdc34 in vivo because human Cdc34(1-215) but not Cdc34(1-200) was able to complement the growth defect by yeast Cdc34 mutant strain. Finally, reconstituted IkappaBalpha ubiquitination analysis revealed a role for each adjacent pair of UBS1 aromatic residues (Phe(206)/Tyr(207), Tyr(210)/Tyr(211)) in conjugation, with Tyr(210) exhibiting the most pronounced catalytic function. Intriguingly, Cdc34 Tyr(210) was required for the transfer of the donor ubiquitin to a receptor lysine on either IkappaBalpha or a ubiquitin in a manner that depended on the neddylated RING sub-complex of the SCF. Taken together, our results identified a new ubiquitin binding activity within the human Cdc34 C terminus that contributes to SCF-dependent ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1983676106,"Glucose is the primary energy substrate for eukaryotic cells and the predominant substrate for the brain. Studies suggest that glucose serves an additional role in the regulation of cellular functions, including viability. Zebrafish is a tractable system for defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms perturbed by impaired glucose transport and metabolism. Previously, we demonstrated a critical role for the facilitative glucose transporter, Glut1, in the regulation of embryonic brain development. In this study, we aim to identify mediators in this Glut1-sensitive process by investigating the role of the antiapoptotic kinase, Akt2. Results show that abrogating expression of akt2 causes a phenotype strikingly similar to that observed when glut1 expression is inhibited. akt2-deficient embryos exhibit increased neuronal apoptosis, impaired glucose uptake, and death by 72 h postfertilization. Similar to what was observed in the glut1 morphants, inhibiting the expression of the proapoptotic protein, bad, in the context of impaired akt2 expression results in the inhibition of apoptosis and rescue of the morphant embryos. Intriguingly, overexpression of glut1 in the akt2 morphants was also able to rescue these embryos. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed decreased glut1 transcript expression in akt2 morphant embryos. Taken together, these data suggest that Akt2 modulates glucose availability by regulating Glut1 expression at the transcript level. These data support a role for akt2 in an integrative pathway directly linking glucose, Glut1 expression, and activation of apoptosis and demonstrate the dependence of akt2 on glucose availability for the maintenance of cellular viability, particularly in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2015156954,"Thyroglobulin (Tg, precursor for thyroid hormone synthesis) is a large secreted glycoprotein composed of upstream regions I-II-III, followed by the ∼570 residue cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain. ChEL has two identified functions: 1) homodimerization, and 2) binding to I-II-III that facilitates I-II-III oxidative maturation required for intracellular protein transport. Like its homologs in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) family, ChEL possesses two carboxyl-terminal α-helices. We find that a Tg-AChE chimera (swapping AChE in place of ChEL) allows for dimerization with monomeric AChE, proving exposure of the carboxyl-terminal helices within the larger context of Tg. Further, we establish that perturbing trans-helical interaction blocks homodimerization of the Tg ChEL domain. Additionally, ChEL can associate with neuroligins (a related family of cholinesterase-like proteins), demonstrating potential for Tg cross-dimerization between non-identical partners. Indeed, when mutant rdw-Tg (Tg-G2298R, defective for protein secretion) is co-expressed with wild-type Tg, the two proteins cross-dimerize and secretion of rdw-Tg is partially restored. Moreover, we find that AChE and soluble neuroligins also can bind to the upstream Tg regions I-II-III; however, they cannot rescue secretion, because they cannot facilitate oxidative maturation of I-II-III. These data suggest that specific properties of distinct Tg ChEL mutants may result in distinct patterns of Tg monomer folding, cross-dimerization with wild-type Tg, and variable secretion behavior in heterozygous patients.

Yoo S.E. Abu Hossain S. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Specifically, although upstream regions I-II-III possess 116 of the 122 Tg cysteine residues (10Lee J. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), ChEL binds to I-II-III, functioning as a molecular chaperone to facilitate I-II-III oxidative maturation (10Lee J. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, ChEL is not only contiguous with I-II-III in Tg, but the ChEL domain remains associated with I-II-III throughout the secretory pathway and after secretion (10Lee J. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As best as is currently known, all Tg mutants causing congenital hypothyroidism are defective for intracellular transport (28Vono-Toniolo J. Rivolta C.M. Targovnik H.M. Medeiros-Neto G. Kopp P. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, until now, no studies have explored the severity of impairment of mutant Tg protein co-expressed in the presence of wild-type Tg, which is the situation found in simple heterozygous patients who are vastly more common than newborns with congenital hypothyroidism from homozygous or compound heterozygous Tg mutations (29Targovnik H.M. Esperante S.A. Rivolta C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for interaction of non-identical Tg partners in trans is a complex problem; for ChEL mutants this requires investigation of both dimerization and chaperone/escort functions. Notably, ChEL is part of a large family of cholinesterase-like proteins such as the neuroligins, which subserve cell adhesion and neuronal interaction functions (30Gilbert M.M. Auld V.J. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2177-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31De Jaco A. Comoletti D. King C.C. Taylor P. Chem. Biol.

In this report we have studied non-identical cholinesterase-like domains, either from structural relatives or from ChEL mutants, to examine interaction in trans with wild-type Tg domains and to examine the extent to which they can substitute for ChEL function in Tg secretion. Such studies shed new light on the folding, dimerization, and export of mutant Tg protein in the presence of co-expressed wild-type Tg.

Chase media were collected and treated with a protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5 ml of the treated media was overlaid atop 11.5-ml 5 to 10% linear gradients of sucrose in 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5. The gradients were spun at 187,000 × g (33,000 rpm) in an SW41 rotor for 18 h at 15 °C. At the conclusion of the velocity gradient centrifugation, 400-μl fractions were collected sequentially by puncture from the bottom of each tube, and each was diluted to 1 ml in 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and fluorography. HEK293 cells (simply called 293 cells) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-well plates at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Plasmids were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected 293 cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys-free DMEM, then pulse-labeled with 180 μCi/ml 35S-amino acids. The cells were then washed with an excess of cold Met/Cys and chased in complete DMEM plus serum. At each time point, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and a protease inhibitor mixture. For immunoprecipitation, anti-Tg antibody was incubated with cell or media samples overnight at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitate was recovered with protein A-agarose. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, lysates prepared in the same lysis buffer lacking SDS were incubated overnight at 4 °C with immunoprecipitating antibodies and protein A- or protein G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates (or co-precipitates) were washed three times before boiling in SDS sample buffer with or without reducing agent, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography or phosphorimaging. For measurement of the catalytic activity of recombinant Tg-AChE and Tg-AChEΔCys, 293 cells expressing each construct to be tested were lysed under native conditions (300 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5). One-sixtieth of each cell lysates was then used directly for colorimetric acetylthiocholinesterase activity as described before (36Ellman G.L. Courtney D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21516) Google Scholar). Activity measurements for each construct were performed at least three times with mean ± S.D. values calculated. Parallel samples of cell lysate from the identical transfections were used for immunoblotting with anti-Tg to examine recombinant protein expression level normalized to cell protein. The specific activity was calculated as enzymatic activity per unit of immunoreactive protein. Cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide and then lysed in buffer containing both 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide and 50 mm glycine to quench residual cross-linker. The lysates were then analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The Tg ChEL domain has 6 Cys residues, which engage in 3 disulfide bonds shown schematically in full-length Tg at the top of Fig. 1A. Related constructs employed or engineered for this study include secretory ChEL (including modifications such as carboxyl-terminal Myc tag, extra unpaired Cys residue, or N-linked glycosylation site), AChE (bearing a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag), FLAG-tagged neuroligins 1, 2, 3, or 4, and a Tg-AChE chimera (bearing or lacking a carboxyl-terminal Cys residue) (Fig. 1A). Amino acid sequence alignment of the first ∼500 residues of the ChEL domains of mouse, rat, and human Tg with rat, mouse, and human AChE and human neuroligins 1–4 reveals areas of identity (Fig. 1B, green) as well as 80 and 60% conservation, respectively (red and yellow).

Léonard N. De Bolle X. Depiereux E. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), supports a shared overall protein architecture between these AChE paralogs. We recently hypothesized that Tg homodimerization may be initiated by noncovalent interactions involving two predicted α-helices at the carboxyl terminus of each ChEL domain, with the potential for Tg to form a 4-helix bundle similar to that reported in the dimerization of AChE (25Lee J. Wang X. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12752-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, upstream regions of Tg, comprising >2000 amino acids, might potentially interfere with accessibility of the α-helices in the ChEL domain. We therefore examined a full-length Tg chimera in which catalytically active AChE replaced ChEL in Tg (14Park Y.N. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17085-17089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), to determine whether, in the context of Tg, these carboxyl-terminal α-helices were available for dimerization with co-transfected monomeric AChE. Formation of an AChE intermolecular disulfide bond engaging an unpaired carboxyl-terminal cysteine, neighboring the α-helices, is a natural reporter of such dimerization (38Kerem A. Kronman C. Bar-Nun S. Shafferman A. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Tg-AChE expressed alone already formed covalent homodimers intracellularly (Fig. 2A). When co-expressed with AChE, more Tg-AChE monomers were consumed (i.e. fewer Tg-AChE monomers were recovered), involving cross-dimerization (i.e. Tg-AChE–AChE) that appeared to compete with Tg-AChE homodimerization (Fig. 2A). The ability to form covalent homodimers or heterodimers was eliminated when expressing the Tg-AChEΔCys chimera that deleted the unpaired cysteine at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2B), proving that the carboxyl-terminal segment must be accessible for the apposition of monomer partners even when conjoined to the large upstream Tg regions I-II-III. We introduced an extra, unpaired Cys residue at the tail of the ChEL domain to create a similar opportunity for covalent dimerization of ChEL monomers (called “ChEL-CD”), while also engineering an N-linked glycosylation site into the first of the two dimerization helices (called “ChELG-CD”) that blocks formation of the intermolecular covalent bond (Fig. 1A) (25Lee J. Wang X. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12752-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, such an assay cannot exclude non-covalent dimerization of ChELG-CD. To obtain stronger evidence of the α-helical contribution to homodimerization of the Tg ChEL domain, we examined the migration of ChEL-CD and ChELG-CD by centrifugation on sucrose velocity gradients. Secretion of ChEL-CD was recovered as a combination of dimers and monomers, and upon analysis of gradient fractions by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, there was perfect correspondence between the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond and recovery in a distinct peak of faster sedimentation (Fig. 3, upper gradient). By contrast, ChELG-CD was not only blocked in formation of the covalent inter-subunit linkage but was also blocked in faster sedimentation in the sucrose-velocity gradient (Fig. 3, lower). These data directly implicate the carboxyl-terminal α-helices in ChEL dimerization, strongly supporting a 4-helix bundle dimerization mechanism similar to that used by AChE and other cholinesterase-like family members (39Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40Comoletti D. Grishaev A. Whitten A.E. Taylor P. Trewhella J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 175: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Such a dimerization mechanism might render it possible to obtain cross-dimerization of related cholinesterase-like proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). We therefore extended our analysis to include secretory versions of human neuroligins (NLs) 1, 2, 3, and 4. FLAG-tagged NL1, NL2, NL3, and NL4 were each secreted slowly but efficiently, with release from cells primarily between 5 and 24 h after synthesis (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Within cells that co-expressed secretory ChEL-Myc and FLAG-tagged neuroligins, after chemical cross-linking, ChEL could be observed to interact with each of the NL proteins as detected upon co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (Fig. 4B, left panel). A similar interaction was observed when secretory ChEL was co-expressed with AChE-Myc (co-precipitated with anti-Tg and immunoblotted with anti-Myc (Fig. 4B, right panel)). Even without cross-linker, from media, secreted FLAG-tagged neuroligins could be co-precipitated with ChEL-Myc (Fig. 4C, left) or with ChEL-HA (Fig. 4C, right). The data underscore the ability of non-identical cholinesterase-like partners (Fig. 1, B and C) to cross-dimerize. Cross-dimerization of non-identical partners could have important physiological consequences, as demonstrated when NL3 was co-expressed with secretory ChEL-HA, resulting in increased release of NL3 to the media (while the intracellular amount decreased), indicating enhanced secretion (Fig. 4D). Congenital hypothyroidism with defective Tg is an autosomal recessive trait; thus heterozygous individuals in the population go largely undetected. Because mutant Tg ChEL is more similar to wild-type Tg ChEL than is AChE or neuroligins, it seemed plausible that cross-dimerization between mutant and wild-type Tg partners also might take place. To test the potential for mutant rdw-Tg to be rescued by wild-type Tg, the two proteins were co-expressed in 293 cells and incubated for 24 h to examine secretion. To distinguish these proteins unequivocally, rdw-Tg was tagged with GFP at the carboxyl terminus. When expressed along with an empty vector, rdw-Tg-GFP was recovered in cells but was undetectable in the medium. However, when co-expressed with wild-type Tg-Myc, rdw-Tg-GFP began to be recovered in the medium (Fig. 5, left panels). To confirm that this reflected authentic secretion, rdw-Tg-GFP was subjected to endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion to assess modification of any of the N-linked glycans of Tg by Golgi glycosylation enzymes. Intracellular rdw-Tg-GFP was endo H-sensitive, indicating failure to reach the Golgi complex, whereas all of the rdw-Tg-GFP molecules recovered from the medium had some of their many N-linked glycans acquire endo H resistance (Fig. 5, middle panel), indicating normal intracellular trafficking through the secretory pathway. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of wt-Tg-Myc from the medium co-precipitated rdw-Tg-GFP (Fig. 5, right panel). The data clearly indicate potential for Tg cross-dimerization, as might occur in states of heterozygosity. The Tg coding sequence links each I-II-III directly to its own contiguous ChEL polypeptide. However, because Tg homodimerizes, there is more than one potential stoichiometry and orientation of ChEL interaction with I-II-III. We proceeded to test the stoichiometry when the two are expressed as separate secretory proteins. After co-transfection of I-II-III-Myc and secretory ChEL, 293 cells were radiolabeled continuously at fixed specific radioactivity with [35S]cysteine in complete medium for 2 days to approach steady state. The medium was then collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc to recover I-II-III-Myc and co-precipitated ChEL. The relative band intensities were quantified from scanned SDS-PAGE fluorograms (Fig. 6). An equimolar ChEL:region I-II-III binding stoichiometry binding should be seen as an intensity ratio of 6:116, reflecting precisely the number of Cys residues in each polypeptide. Indeed, from quadruplicate samples, the molar ratio measured was 1.17 ± 0.28, i.e. an equimolar binding stoichiometry (Fig. 6). ChEL and structurally similar cholinesterase-like family members exhibit potential for cross-dimerization, raising the question of whether such family members could also substitute for ChEL in I-II-III binding. Indeed, AChE-Myc was also found able to associate with I-II-III (Fig. 7A), and this was similarly true for FLAG-NL1, -NL2, -NL3, or -NL4 (Fig. 7B). However, the efficiency of I-II-III interaction, as measured by co-precipitation, was weaker, i.e. only approximately half of that observed for ChEL itself (Fig. 7C). The ability of structurally related cholinesterase-like family members (Fig. 1, B and C) to physically interact with regions I-II-III raised the question of whether such interactions could rescue the secretion of region I-II-III lacking their own ChEL domain (10Lee J. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In side-by-side comparisons, AChE could not promote significantly more I-II-III secretion than was observed with empty vector alone, and indeed, intracellular recovery of I-II-III appeared diminished (Fig. 8, A and B). Likewise, the secretory neuroligins, despite excellent expression, could not promote I-II-III secretion (Fig. 8C). The data suggest that sequence-specific differences among cholinesterase-like family members alter their ability to rescue I-II-III secretion. Why is association of AChE or neuroligins unproductive for Tg? Like full-length Tg, regions I-II-III go through a series of oxidative folding intermediates, including transient mixed disulfides with ER oxidoreductases (termed “A,” “B,” and “C” (41Di Jeso B. Park Y.N. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S. Arvan P. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2034626843,"NF-kappaB transcription factors are key regulators of cellular proliferation and frequently contribute to oncogenesis. The herpesviral oncoprotein Tio, which promotes growth transformation of human T cells in a recombinant herpesvirus saimiri background, potently induces canonical NF-kappaB signaling through membrane recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Here, we show that, in addition to Tio-TRAF6 interaction, the Tio-induced canonical NF-kappaB signal requires the presence of the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), and the activity of its key kinase, IKKbeta, to up-regulate expression of endogenous cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) proteins. Dependent on TRAF6 and NEMO, Tio enhances the expression of the noncanonical NF-kappaB proteins, p100 and RelB. Independent of TRAF6 and NEMO, Tio mediates stabilization of the noncanonical kinase, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). Concomitantly, Tio induces efficient processing of the p100 precursor molecule to its active form, p52, as well as DNA binding of nuclear p52 and RelB. In human T cells transformed by infection with a Tio-recombinant virus, sustained expression of p100, RelB, and cIAP2 depends on IKKbeta activity, yet processing to p52 remains largely unaffected by IKKbeta inhibition. However, long term inhibition of IKKbeta disrupts the continuous growth of the transformed cells and induces cell death. Hence, the Tio oncoprotein triggers noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling through NEMO-dependent up-regulation of p100 precursor and RelB, as well as through NEMO-independent generation of p52 effector."

Whether observed intermediates are productive and obligatory species on the folding reaction pathway or dispensable by-products is a matter of debate. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a small protein domain, SAP97 PDZ2 I342W C378A, and determined its folding pathway. The presence of a folding intermediate was demonstrated both by single and double-mixing kinetic experiments using urea-induced (un)folding as well as ligand-induced folding. This protein domain was found to fold via a triangular scheme, where the folding intermediate could be either on- or off-pathway, depending on the experimental conditions. Furthermore, we found that the intermediate was present at equilibrium, which is rarely seen in folding reactions of small protein domains.

Wolynes P.G. Proteins. 1995; 21: 167-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar), and clearly, intermediates do occur, sometimes as high energy species, which can only be indirectly monitored (5Fersht A.R.

One problem with studying these intermediates is that they are only transiently populated and thus difficult to isolate and characterize. A successful strategy to isolate folding intermediates has been to destabilize the native state by mutation, which works if the intermediate state is less destabilized by the modification (9Jemth P.

Further, general mechanisms of folding may be deduced if several members of a protein family are compared, for example regarding the influence of sequence and topology on the folding reaction (17Clarke J. Cota E. Fowler S.B. Hamill S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the folding reaction of all members investigated so far involves an intermediate, which at least in one case is on-pathway (6Ivarsson Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 8568-8572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), often high energy, but off-pathway and low energy compared with the denatured state for a circularly permutated bacterial PDZ domain (25Ivarsson Y. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Morea V. Brunori M. Gianni S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we describe the folding reaction of SAP97 PDZ2 I342W C378A, referred to as pseudo-wild type PDZ2 (pwPDZ2). A triangular scheme explains the folding of this pwPDZ2. The intermediate in the scheme is of low energy and either on- or off-pathway depending on experimental conditions. The folding reaction of pwPDZ2 thus reflects the plasticity of the energy landscape for protein folding. We also discuss how these data reconcile the folding mechanism within the PDZ domain family, with general implications for the folding of protein domains. The cDNA used for expression of the SAP97 PDZ2 domain coded for residues 311–407 in human SAP97. The construct was cloned into EcoRI/BamHI sites of a modified pRSET vector (Invitrogen). Mutations I342W and C378A were introduced in the original construct as described previously (26Chi C.N. Bach A. Engström A. Wang H. Strømgaard K. Gianni S. Jemth P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7089-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expressed protein contained an N-terminal His tag (MHHHHHLVPRGS) in addition to the I342W/C378A mutations. We have shown previously for other PDZ domains that the His tag does not affect the binding and stability of the PDZ domains (22Chi C.N. Gianni S. Calosci N. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Engström A.

Mutation I342W served as a probe for equilibrium and kinetic experiments, and Cys378 was removed to avoid formation of interdomain S-S bridges. The SAP97 PDZ2 pseudo-wild type construct expressing an N-terminal His tag and mutations I342W and C378A, hereafter referred to as pwPDZ2, was used to transform Escherichia coli BL 21 DE3, pLysS cells. Transformed E. coli cells were selected by growing cells overnight on agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Colonies from the agar plate were taken to initiate a 10-ml preculture and then a 1-liter culture (50 μg/ml ampicillin), each grown at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside when the A600 was ∼0.4. After induction, the culture was grown overnight at 30 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation (7,000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 400 mm NaCl). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, followed by centrifugation (35,000 × g) for 1 h. The supernatant thus obtained was filtered successively through 0.45- and 0.2-μm filters (Sarstedt). Filtered supernatant was loaded onto a nickel (II)-charged chelating Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare); equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 400 mm NaCl; and washed with 300 ml of the same buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.9. The fractions containing the PDZ were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Q column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The protein did not bind to the column and appeared in the unbound fraction. This unbound fraction was concentrated and applied onto a C18 reverse phase FPLC column, equilibrated with buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The bound protein was eluted at 60% buffer B (100% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid). The fractions containing the pwPDZ2 were lyophilized and redissolved in deionized water. The purity of pwPDZ2 was checked by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The mass of the purified PDZ domain was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Alternatively, as a last purification step before crystallization, the Q column flow-through was loaded onto an S column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Elution was performed in a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Fractions containing pwPDZ2 were identified by SDS-PAGE. For crystallization, thrombin digestion was carried out to remove the His tag of pwPDZ2. To remove any remaining His-tagged protein, the digested sample was passed through nickel (II)-Sepharose beads in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mm NaCl. The nonbound fraction contained the cleaved protein, which was further purified over a benzamidine column (GE Healthcare) to remove thrombin. For crystallization purposes the protein was then concentrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm NaCl in a Vivaspin (Vivascience, Sartorius group) concentrator (molecular mass cut-off, 5,000 Da). 3 μl of protein solution (4.5 mg/ml pwPDZ2 without His tag in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm NaCl), and 1 μl of reservoir solution (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, 2.4 m ammonium sulfate) were mixed in a sitting drop vapor diffusion setup. The crystals were observed after 4 days and grew to a size of 100–300 μm within 2 weeks. The crystals were transferred to 105 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, 2.52 m ammonium sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid N2. The data were collected at Beamline I-911-2 at Max-Lab (Lund, Sweden). The data for the pwPDZ2 crystals were collected to a resolution of 1.8 Å, but only data up to 2 Å resolution contained enough information for model building. The data were processed using the program XDS (28Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3228) Google Scholar).

DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Urea-induced equilibrium denaturation experiments were followed on an SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL). Excitation of the engineered Trp residue (I342W) was done at 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 350 nm. The experiments were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 25 and 37 °C. A decrease in Trp emission was observed upon denaturation, and the transition followed a two-state behavior. The data were fitted to the standard equation for solvent denaturation (36Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999Google Scholar). Kinetic folding and unfolding rate constants were measured on an SX-20 MV stopped flow spectrometer (upgraded SX-17) (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). For refolding experiments, 33 μm protein was dissolved in buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) having 6 m urea. Refolding was initiated by 11-fold dilution of protein in buffer-urea solutions. Unfolding experiments were done similarly except that protein was dissolved in buffer without urea and mixed rapidly with buffer-urea solutions. Thus, the final concentration of pwPDZ2 was kept at 3 μm, and the temperature was maintained at either 25 or 37 °C for all of the kinetic measurements. The excitation was done at 280 nm, and the change in fluorescence was monitored at ∼330 nm using an interference filter. To obtain rate constants for the slowest phases, folding kinetics were recorded in the SLM 4800 spectrometer following manual mixing of protein-urea and buffer-urea solutions. Here, emission at 350 nm was monitored. Biphasic kinetics were observed for both unfolding and refolding reactions, and the two observed rate constants were fitted to equations derived from a sequential scenario (on-pathway or off-pathway) (Equation 1) or triangular scheme (Equation 2). λ1andλ2={(kNI+kIN+kID+kDI)±SQRT[(kNI+kIN+kID+kDI)2+4(kIDkNI+kDIkIN+kDIkNI)]}/2(Eq. 1) λ1andλ2={(kND+kNI+kID+kDN+kIN+kDI)±SQRT[(kND+kNI+kID+kDN+kIN+kDI)2+4(kDNkID+kDNkIN+kDNkIN+kNDkDI+kNDkID+kNDkIN+kDIkIN+kDIkNI+kIDkNI)]}/2(Eq. 2) The logarithm of each of the microscopic rate constants in Equation 1 and 2 was assumed to depend linearly on the urea concentration. logki=logkiH2O+mki[urea]forkND,kNIandkID(Eq. 3) logki=logkiH2O-mki[urea]forkDN,kINandkDI(Eq. 4) See Ref. 37Gianni S.

Stopped flow ligand-induced refolding experiments were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 37 °C with different concentrations of peptide (LQRRRETQV) at a constant concentration of pwPDZ2 (3 μm). The binding-induced folding was followed by monitoring the change in fluorescence using the 330-nm interference filter. (excitation λ = 280 nm). The traces thus obtained were fitted to a single exponential equation, and the observed rate constants were plotted against the peptide concentration. Equation 5 (6Ivarsson Y.

To have a fluorescent probe to measure folding, we changed Ile342 to Trp. To rule out any major perturbations of our Trp label on the structure, we solved the crystal structure of this pwPDZ2 (Protein Data Bank entry 2x7z). The pwPDZ2 crystallized in a new space group, P4322, compared with previous SAP97 PDZ2 structures, probably because of a new contact between residues Trp342 and Pro405. Diffraction data to 2.0 Å resolution was collected enabling the structure to be solved by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The pwPDZ2 protein has the expected PDZ domain fold (Fig. 1A). Positive difference electron density for Trp342 was clear after the first refinement cycle in Refmac (Fig. 1B). Comparison with other available structures of SAP97 PDZ2 showed that there were no major conformational changes induced by the I342W mutation. Most of the small differences observed can be explained by crystal packing effects or increased flexibility of a specific region. These regions concern among others the carboxylate-binding loop where the electron density is poor. The high similarity of the crystal structure of pwPDZ2 to the structure of the same protein without the I342W mutation (30von Ossowski I. Oksanen E. von Ossowski L. Cai C. Sundberg M. Goldman A.

These conformational differences were indeed observed when comparing the mutant protein structure to the SAP97 PDZ2 protein in complex with the HPV18 E6 C-terminal peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 2I0L) (39Zhang Y. Dasgupta J. Ma R.Z. Banks L. Thomas M. Chen X.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3618-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pwPDZ2 structure was similar to the structures of SAP97 PDZ2 with GluR-A C-terminal peptide bound (Protein Data Bank entries 2AWW and 2G2L), whereas it was different from the two apo structures (Protein Data Bank entry 2AWU and 2AWX) (30von Ossowski I. Oksanen E. von Ossowski L. Cai C. Sundberg M. Goldman A. Keinänen K. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5219-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, with resolution ranging from 1.8 to 2.44Å, Rwork from 18 to 24.2%, and Rfree values between 25.4 and 32.6%, it appears difficult to make any definite statements about small conformational differences between the different structures of SAP97 PDZ2 (40Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The salt bridge between residues Lys324 and Asp396 that was described for the unliganded SAP97 PDZ2 domain (30von Ossowski I. Oksanen E. von Ossowski L. Cai C. Sundberg M. Goldman A. Keinänen K. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5219-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was not observed in the pwPDZ2 structure. Instead, Lys324 forms H-bonding interactions with the Thr394 side chain and the carbonyl oxygen of Thr394. These interactions were described for the liganded form of SAP97 PDZ2 by von Ossowski et al. (30von Ossowski I. Oksanen E. von Ossowski L. Cai C. Sundberg M. Goldman A. Keinänen K. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5219-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Urea-induced unfolding of pwPDZ2 was followed by the fluorescence of the engineered tryptophan residue, I342W. The experiments were conducted in such a way that the concentration of protein was kept constant (3 μm) at varying urea concentrations. At equilibrium, we have shown that the wild type and pwPDZ2 were stable and folded under the experimental conditions (26Chi C.N. Bach A. Engström A. Wang H. Strømgaard K. Gianni S. Jemth P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7089-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we repeated these equilibrium denaturation experiments to obtain data at both 25 and 37 °C (Fig. 2A and Table 2).TABLE 2Equilibrium parameters obtained in the different experimentsExperimentΔGD-NmD-NΔGI-NΔGD-ImD-Ikcal mol−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1m−1Equilibrium 25 °C (Fig. 2)5.0 ± 1.11.09 ± 0.24Equilibrium 37 °C (Fig. 2)3.3 ± 0.31.26 ± 0.12Chevron 25 °C off-pathway (Fig. 3)4.11.250.60.7Chevron 37 °C triangular (Fig. 3)4.21.751.31.1Ligand-induced folding 37 °C (Fig. 5)1.8 Open table in a new tab The unfolding and refolding kinetic experiments were conducted in 50 mm potassium phosphate at 25 and 37 °C. Both the refolding and unfolding time courses were biphasic at all concentrations of urea (Fig. 2B). Chevron plots, which are semi-logarithmic plots of observed rate constants (refolding/unfolding) as a function of denaturant (urea) concentration are shown in Fig. 3. When double exponential (un)folding is observed there are, in the simplest case, three reaction schemes that may be consistent with the data (8Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These three scenarios are (i) a two-step folding with an on-pathway intermediate, (ii) a two-step folding with an off-pathway intermediate (both scenarios are fitted with Equation 1), and (iii) a triangular scheme where the intermediate is on-pathway but where direct formation of the native state from the denatured state is also possible (Equation 2). It is clear from Fig. 3 that the urea dependence of the slow phase is different at the two temperatures, and in theory the three different scenarios could be distinguished based on the urea dependence of the two rate constants (8Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R.

Whereas the kinetics are best described by a scheme with an off-pathway intermediate at 25 °C, a parallel scheme or an on-pathway scenario fit data best at 37 °C (Fig. 3 and Table 3). In other words, these data suggest that the intermediate switches between being on- and off-pathway depending on the experimental temperature. The fitted rate constants in Table 3 are in good agreement with stability measurements at equilibrium (Table 2), but single-jump kinetics alone is not sufficient to conclusively settle on this mechanism.TABLE 3Best fit folding parameterskDIkIDkDNkNDkINkNImDImIDmDNmNDmINmNIs−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m−1Off-pathway 25 °C0.07 ± 1.60.026 ± 0.0282.1 ± 2.20.002 ± 0.0010.5 ± 50.22 ± 0.091.0 ± 0.130.31 ± 0.05Triangular 37 °C2.5 ± 4.10.020aCalculated from the five fitted rate constants.0.9 ± 6.50.0009 ± 0.0070.11 ± 0.060.014 ± 0.0130.72 ± 0.490.44bCalculated from the five fitted m values.1.4 ± 2.50.39 ± 2.50.30 ± 0.330.37 ± 0.21a Calculated from the five fitted rate constants.b Calculated from the five fitted m values. Open table in a new tab To investigate the formation of the intermediate in more detail, we performed double mixing experiments in the stopped flow spectrometer. Acid-urea denatured pwPDZ2 was first mixed with buffer-urea to induce refolding at 1 m urea. Then after different delay times, the refolding reaction was interrupted by mixing with urea to a final concentration of 5.5 m, and the resulting biphasic unfolding trace was monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the respective phase was plotted against delay time (Fig. 4, B and C). The amplitude of the fast phase (red) reflects formation of the intermediate, and the amplitude of the slow phase (blue) reflects formation of the native state during the delay time (42Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Brunori M. Shastry M.C. Roder H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Kiefhaber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). An on-pathway scenario would predict the native state to form in a single exponential reaction, with an initial lag phase (9Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, because the native state forms in a biphasic manner, it shows that the intermediate is off-pathway (or present in a triangular scheme) both at 25 and 37 °C. An extensive discussion about the differences between the two mechanisms may be found in Refs. 37Gianni S. Ivarsson Y. Jemth P. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 128: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 43Kiefhaber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar. Together with single-jump data, we can thus conclude that the native state is formed mainly through a direct D → N transition at 25 °C (with I being off-pathway) but that the I → N route is opened up at 37 °C. Furthermore, because the intermediate phase is not disappearing at long delay times, it is clear that the intermediate is populated at equilibrium. The rate constants obtained from fitting a double exponential function to the amplitude versus delay time plots agree well with those from the chevron plots (Fig. 3 and Table 4). From the microscopic rate constants, it can be calculated that roughly 10% of the PDZ2 molecules are in the intermediate form at 37 °C.TABLE 4Best fit parameters from interrupted refolding experiments (Fig. 4)Experiment/phaseDouble jump experimentSingle jump at 1 m ureakobs1Amplitude 1kobs2Amplitude 2kobs1kobs2s−1s−1s−1s−137 °C slow phase0.77 ± 0.160.84 ± 0.120.090 ± 0.0131.14 ± 0.120.910.09537 °C fast phase0.77aThe amplitude of the fast phase from the double jump experiment yields large fitting errors upon free fitting.

Open table in a new tab Finally, the presence of the intermediate at equilibrium was corroborated by a ligand-induced folding experiment. pwPDZ2 was mixed with a peptide ligand, and the change in fluorescence was monitored with time. Careful analysis of the binding trace revealed that except for the previously characterized fast binding phases (26Chi C.N. Bach A. Engström A. Wang H. Strømgaard K. Gianni S. Jemth P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7089-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), there was a very slow phase present, which was plotted against ligand concentration (Fig. 5). Both the rate constant and the amplitude of this slow phase displayed a dependence on ligand concentration, which is consistent with a ligand-induced folding reaction (i.e. a slow folding event followed by a faster bimolecular binding reaction, which leads to a decrease of kobs with increasing peptide ligand concentration). The reason that the amplitude changes sign is that the fluorescence yield of the intermediate is slightly different from that of the native state as well as that of the peptide-bound native state. Qualitatively, at low peptide concentration the amplitude of the coupled folding and binding phase is negative because the decrease in fluorescence upon conversion of the intermediate to native dominates over the increase in fluorescence from binding of peptide to the native state. At higher peptide concentration, the equilibrium is shifted such that all intermediate is reacting to the peptide-bound native state with a resulting increase in fluorescence upon binding. The rate constant estimated for the I → N transition in the ligand binding-induced folding experiment, 0.16 ± 0.03 s−1 (Fig. 5B), is in good agreement with that obtained from fitting of the triangular scheme to observed rate constants for (un)folding, 0.11 ± 0.06 s−1 (Fig. 3B and Table 3). The errors in relative populations and fitted rate constants are too large to accurately determine fluorescence yields of the intermediate relative to the native state. We can say, however, that they are fairly similar, which is consistent with data if the fluorescence yield of the intermediate is at least 10% higher than that of the native state. Note that although the kinetic amplitudes were small in this experiment (Fig. 5, A and C), the accuracy is very high because (i) kobs approaches a first order rate constant (0.16 s−1) at high peptide ligand concentration and (ii) the signal-to-noise is high for the kinetic traces (Fig. 5A). The polymeric nature of proteins implies that their folding energy landscapes should be rough. A corollary of such roughness is that folding may involve alternative routes when going from the denatured to the native state. Thus, intermediates are not necessarily obligatory species but rather kinetic traps arising from the ruggedness of the folding landscape. Implicit in this view is the notion of plasticity of the folding trajectory: proteins can be rerouted through the energy landscape by mutational, topological, solvent, or other perturbations. Indeed, in the present work we report parallel folding pathways in pwPDZ2 and observe that the flux through the respective path (Fig. 6) can be modulated by temperature. The intermediate may be mainly off-pathway as observed at 25 °C or follow a triangular scheme where the intermediate is now on-pathway through the opening of a route from I to N (at 37 °C). It is of interest to compare the folding pathway of pwPDZ2 with other previously characterized PDZ domains. We have studied the folding pathways of a number of PDZ domains (6Ivarsson Y.

In fact, none of the PDZs characterized thus far fold in a pure two-state manner. The canonical (mammalian) proteins typically fold via a high energy intermediate (22Chi C.N. Gianni S. Calosci N. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Engström A. Jemth P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and through a structurally conserved second transition state (21Calosci N. Chi C.N. Richter B. Camilloni C. Engström A. Eklund L. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Vendruscolo M. Jemth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19241-19246Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the folding reaction of a circularly permutated bacterial PDZ domain, a low energy off-pathway intermediate is present (25Ivarsson Y. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Morea V. Brunori M. Gianni S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In light of these previous data, the folding of the SAP97 PDZ2 domain may be viewed as a missing link between these two extreme folding pathways and reconciles apparently contrasting results. Because energy landscapes are funneled, folding may occur via alternative folding nuclei (45Haglund E. Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27904-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Oliveberg M. Wolynes P.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 245-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). When and if the forces stabilizing such nuclei are balanced, as in the case of pwPDZ2, small perturbations of reaction conditions may result in rerouting through an alternative folding pathway. Both the single-jump unfolding kinetics (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) and the double-jump experiment (Fig. 4) suggest that the intermediate is present at equilibrium and making up roughly 10% of the total protein. The presence of such a high energy species suggests that SAP97 PDZ2 displays conformational sampling (47Boehr D.D. Wright P.E. Science. 2008; 320: 1429-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the interconversion between the states is slow, and as shown by the ligand binding experiment in Fig. 5, the peptide ligand binds only to the more stable ground state and is not a ligand for the intermediate state. It therefore remains to be shown whether the intermediate plays any functional role by binding to a yet unidentified ligand or whether it is only there as a benign species, which is neither deleterious nor beneficial for the physiological function of SAP97."
https://openalex.org/W2012321301,"PEA-15 is a death effector domain-containing phosphoprotein that binds ERK and restricts it to the cytoplasm. PEA-15 also binds to FADD and thereby blocks apoptosis induced by death receptors. Abnormal expression of PEA-15 is associated with type II diabetes and some cancers; however, its physiological function remains unclear. To determine the function of PEA-15 in vivo, we used C57BL/6 mice in which the PEA-15 coding region was deleted. We thereby found that PEA-15 regulates T-cell proliferation. PEA-15-null mice did not have altered thymic or splenic lymphocyte cellularity or differentiation. However, PEA-15 deficient T cells had increased CD3/CD28-induced nuclear translocation of ERK and increased activation of IL-2 transcription and secretion in comparison to control wild-type littermates. Indeed, activation of the T-cell receptor in wild-type mice caused PEA-15 release of ERK. In contrast, overexpression of PEA-15 in Jurkat T cells blocked nuclear translocation of ERK and IL-2 transcription. Finally, PEA-15-null T cells showed increased IL-2 dependent proliferation on stimulation. No differences in T cell susceptibility to apoptosis were found. Thus, PEA-15 is a novel player in T-cell homeostasis.

The three-dimensional structure of mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 in its binary complex form, with GDP-alpha-D-mannose and Mg(2+), shows a second metal binding site, about 6 A away from the mannose moiety. Kinetic and mutagenesis studies have shown that this metal site plays a role in catalysis. Additionally, Asp(167) in the DXD motif is found within van der Waals contact distance of the C1' atom in the mannopyranose ring, suggesting its action as a catalytic nucleophile, either in the formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate according to the double-displacement S(N)2 reaction mechanism or in the stabilization of the oxocarbenium ion-like intermediate according to the D(N)*A(Nss) (S(N)i-like) reaction mechanism. We propose that either mechanism may occur in retaining glycosyltransferases with a GT-A fold, and, based on the gathered structural information, we identified an extended structural signature toward a common scaffold between the inverting and retaining glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2145759960,"The isomerization of all-trans retinol (vitamin A) to 11-cis retinol in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a key step in the visual process for the regeneration of the visual pigment chromophore, 11-cis retinal. LRAT and RPE65 are recognized as the minimal isomerase catalytic components. However, regulators of this rate-limiting step are not fully identified and could account for the phenotypic variability associated with inherited retinal degeneration (RD) caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. To identify new RPE65 partners, we screened a porcine RPE mRNA library using a yeast two-hybrid assay with full-length human RPE65. One identified clone (here named FATP1c), containing the cytosolic C-terminal sequence from the fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1 or SLC27A1, solute carrier family 27 member 1), was demonstrated to interact dose-dependently with the native RPE65 and with LRAT. Furthermore, these interacting proteins colocalize in the RPE. Cellular reconstitution of human interacting proteins shows that FATP1 markedly inhibits 11-cis retinol production by acting on the production of all-trans retinyl esters and the isomerase activity of RPE65. The identification of this new visual cycle inhibitory component in RPE may contribute to further understanding of retinal pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2155075922,"Loss of the fumarate hydratase (FH) tumor suppressor gene results in the development of benign tumors that rarely, but regrettably, progress to very aggressive cancers. Using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) to model transformation, we found that fh knockdown results in increased expression of the met oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinase receptor through hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) stabilization. MET-in-creased expression was alone able to stabilize hif, thus establishing a feed forward loop that might enforce tumor progression. The fh-defective MEFs showed increased motility and protection from apoptosis. Motility, but not survival, relied on hif-1α and was greatly enhanced by MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor. Met cooperated with a weakly oncogenic ras in making MEFs transformed and tumorigenic, as shown by in vitro and in vivo assays. Loss of fh was not equally effective by itself but enhanced the transformed and tumorigenic phenotype induced by ras and MET. Consistently, the rescue of fumarase expression abrogated the motogenic and transformed phenotype of fh-defective MEFs. In conclusion, the data suggest that the progression of tumors where FH is lost might be boosted by activation of the MET oncogene, which is able to drive cell-autonomous tumor progression and is a strong candidate for targeted therapy.—Costa, B., Dettori, D., Lorenzato, A., Bardella, C., Coltella, N., Martino, C., Cammarata, C., Carmeliet, P., Olivero, M., Di Renzo, M.

The present study reports for the first time the regulatory role of amino acids 102–110, previously shown to represent the “transforming region” of T-ag, corresponding to the binding site (BS) for the tumor suppressor p110Rb protein (retinoblastoma susceptibility factor or Rb) (20DeCaprio J.A.

Using quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in live transfected cells and in an in vitro reconstituted system, we show that the p110Rb binding site (RbBS) inhibits T-ag nuclear import dependent on phosphorylation at Ser106 within the RbBS, a site known to be phosphorylated in infected cells (15Scheidtmann K.H.

Furthermore, we show that the effect is attributable to binding of p110Rb protein to the RbBS, enhanced by negative charge at the Ser106 phosphorylation site. The results have important implications for the regulation of nuclear transport of the many viral proteins of significance that interact with p110Rb, and how this may relate to transformation. All mammalian and bacterial constructs expressing GFP-T-ag fusion proteins were generated using the Gateway™ system (Invitrogen). Primers including the attB1 and attB2 recombination sites were used to amplify the T-ag sequences of interest using plasmid pPR28 (18Rihs H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R.

J. 2006; 398: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of the various GFP-T-ag fusion proteins was investigated using an in vitro reconstituted nuclear transports assay as previously (29Hearps A.C. Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, HTC cells grown on coverslips for 48 h were perforated mechanically, and then inverted onto a microscope slide over a 5-ml chamber of artificial cytoplasm containing reticulocyte lysate (which contains components of the nuclear transport machinery, such as IMPs and Ran), and an ATP-regenerating system, prior to CLSM imaging for up to 30 min. The involvement of the p110Rb protein (present in reticulocyte lysate) in the various GFP-T-ag proteins nuclear import was determined by preincubating the reticulocyte lysate for 15 min at room temperature with a specific mouse monoclonal antibody to p110Rb (OP77-Ab-6; Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) at 47 μg/ml. Anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also preincubated with reticulocyte lysate and added to the system at the same concentration as a control. Endogenously expressed p110Rb was visualized in CV-1 cells following fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, immunostained using the anti-p110Rb (OP77-Ab-6, Calbiochem; 1:25) mouse monoclonal, followed by Alexafluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 1:1000). Samples were mounted on coverslips in 4% propylgallate made up in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol (90% w/v), and imaged using an Olympus Fluorview 1000 CLSM (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), with a Nikon 60× oil immersion lens (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Subcellular localization of GFP-T-ag fusion proteins in living cells was visualized either 8 (COS-7) or 14 h (SAOS-2/SR-40) after transfection by CLSM using a Bio-Rad MRC600 with a ×40 water immersion lens and heated stage.

Traffic. 2007; 8: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereby bleaching of nuclear fluorescence and monitoring of the return of fluorescence to the nucleus enables the nuclear import rate to be determined. Briefly, COS-7 cells transiently expressing GFP-T-ag derivatives were visualized using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope (100× oil immersion lens). Three images were collected using 3% total laser power with excitation at 488 nm (2× zoom, scanned 8 ms/pixel) before photobleaching. To bleach the nucleus, the whole nucleus was selected, and the laser power increased to 100% (10 scans, 12.5 ms/pixel). After bleaching, the cells were immediately scanned and the recovery of fluorescence monitored by acquiring subsequent images at 20-s intervals for 8 min using detector and laser settings identical to those prior to photobleaching. Image analysis was performed as described above. To determine the rate of nuclear import in the nuclear bleaching experiments, the results were expressed in Fn/c over time and analyzed for the initial rate (Fn/c s−1) and fractional recovery of Fn/c expressed as a percent relative to GFP-T-ag-(110–135). GFP fusion proteins (0.5 mm) were incubated with increasing amounts of IMP α/β for 15 min at room temperature in a final volume of 25 μl prior to loading and native gel electrophoresis, as described (36Wagstaff K.M. Dias M.M. Alvisi G. Jans D.A. J. Fluoresc. 2005; 15: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fluorescent bands were visualized using the Wallach Arthur 1422 multiwavelength fluorimager, and quantitative image analysis performed, as previously described (36Wagstaff K.M. Dias M.M. Alvisi G. Jans D.A. J. Fluoresc. 2005; 15: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using the GFP-Trap® (Chromotek, Germany) bead system, according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (10-cm dishes/80% confluent) were harvested 30 h post-transfection and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant adjusted to 750 μl and added to equilibrated GFP-Trap beads for gentle end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min, before washing two times for 15 min in 1 ml of dilution buffer (lysis buffer, minus the Nonidet P-40), centrifuging and discarding the supernatant each time. Proteins were eluted from the beads using 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer (0.2% bromphenol blue; 10% glycerol; 200 mm dithiothreitol; 2% SDS; 100 mm Tris; pH 8.3), 25 μl of the eluate was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel), and the separated proteins then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (26Alvisi G. Jans D.A. Ripalti A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6866-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked in buffer A (5% skim milk powder (w/v) and 1× phosphate-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with buffer B (0.05% Tween 20 and 1× phosphate-buffered saline). Detection of GFP-T-ag fusion proteins was performed by incubating membranes with anti-GFP (Roche; 1:1000) mouse monoclonal primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA; 1:10000). Detection of p110Rb was performed analogously, except that anti-p110Rb (4H1, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA; 1:2000 or OP77-Ab-6, Calbiochem; 1:100) specific antibodies were used. αβ-tubulin was detected using anti-αβ-tubulin (Cell Signaling; 1:1000) rabbit primary antibody and HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (CHEMICON; 1:10000). The immunoblots were incubated with ECL plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer and chemiluminescence captured on a photosensitive film. Band intensity captured on film was analyzed by performing densitometric scans using the NIH image J (V. 1.41o) public domain software, with the membrane background subtracted. Band intensity was then calculated relative the GFP fusion proteins expression level (loading control) as previously described (19Fulcher A.J. Roth D.M. Fatima S. Alvisi G. Jans D.A. FASEB J. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed relative to those for GFP alone. T-ag nuclear accumulation is known to be highly regulated, with phosphorylation adjacent to the NLS playing a key role in enhancing or inhibiting the ability of T-ag to be transported into the nucleus (6Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Hübner S. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This is in part due to the fact that T-ag is able to bind to many host cell proteins during infection, including members of the Rb family, through the RbBS (amino acids 102–110) N-terminal to the NLS (amino acids 126–132). To test whether the RbBS of T-ag may play a role in modulating T-ag nuclear accumulation, we compared the extent of nuclear localization of various GFP-T-ag fusion protein constructs with and without the RbBS (see Fig. 1) using CLSM on living transfected COS-7 cells at the single cell level (Fig. 2). Determination of the relative levels of specific nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence by image analysis of digitized CLSM files revealed that nuclear accumulation of GFP-T-ag-(102–135) and GFP-T-ag-(87–135), both of which contain the RbBS, was significantly lower (p < 0.0058) than that of GFP-T-ag-(110–135) (values for the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, Fn/c, of c. 12 and 15 compared with 27, respectively; Fig. 2B), which lacks the RbBS. Significantly, we noted that the same trend was evident for the NLS mutant derivatives where, even though the maximal nuclear accumulation was markedly less than that for the wild-type constructs, the nuclear accumulation of GFP-T-ag-(102–135:NLSmut) and GFP-T-ag-(87–135:NLSmut) was significantly (p < 0.0001) lower than that of GFP-T-ag-(110–135:NLSmut) (Fn/c of c. 1.3 compared with 1.9; Fig. 2, A and B, right). The clear implication was that the presence of the RbBS reduced T-ag nuclear accumulation, and appeared to function independently of the T-ag NLS.FIGURE 2The Rb binding site (RbBS-T-ag amino acids 102–110) reduces T-ag maximal nuclear accumulation.A, CLSM images of COS-7 cells transfected to express the indicated GFP-T-ag proteins 8 h post-transfection.

Analysis (not shown) for wild-type GFP T-ag-(87-, 102-, and 110–135) proved difficult because of the relatively low amounts of cytoplasmic fluorescence in the transfected cells at steady state, but experimental examination of the GFP-T-ag-(87-, 102- and 110–135) NLS mutant derivatives proved informative (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantification over several experiments showed that the presence of the RbBS in the GFP-T-ag-(87- and 102–135) NLS mutants resulted in significantly (p < 0.012) reduced (>10%) recovery compared with the GFP-T-ag-(110–135) NLS mutant, which lacks the RbBS (Fig. 3C, left); the clear implication was that the presence of the RbBS led to retention in the cytoplasm. The initial rate of nuclear import was not significantly different for these constructs (Fig. 3C, right), indicating that the presence of the RbBS does not alter the rate of nuclear import. This implies that the reduced level of nuclear accumulation of T-ag constructs carrying a functional RbBS is a result of cytoplasmic retention, likely to be via p110Rb binding (see below). To test the role of p110Rb binding to the RbBS in inhibiting T-ag nuclear import, various GFP-T-ag fusion proteins with or without the RbBS, and/or with or without mutations inactivating it (see Fig. 1, Refs. 37Kalderon D.

Science. 1988; 242: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis revealed that GFP-T-ag-(87–135) accumulated to the same extent as GFP-T-ag-(110–135) in the SAOS-2 cell line, but showed significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced accumulation compared with GFP-T-ag-(110–135) in p110Rb-expressing SR-40 cells (see Fig. 4B). No significant difference in nuclear accumulation was evident when comparing the extent of nuclear accumulation of GFP-T-ag-(87–135:Rb mut1) and GFP-T-ag-(87–135:Rb mut2), both of which contain a nonfunctional RbBS, in either SAOS-2 or SR-40 cells (Fig. 4B), in similar fashion to GFP-T-ag-(110–135). The results clearly suggest that the inhibitory effect of the RbBS on T-ag nuclear accumulation requires functional p110Rb binding.FIGURE 5Reconstitution of inhibition of T-ag nuclear import by the RbBS in vitro; modulation by Ser106.A, CLSM images for the indicated GFP-T-ag proteins in mechanically perforated HTC cells in the presence of exogenously added cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system in the presence or absence of anti-p110Rb antibody or control (anti-GST antibody) after 20–30 min at room temperature (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Virology. 1988; 165: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); as a first step to assess if this residue was involved in regulating p110Rb effect, quantitative live cell imaging was performed on point mutants designed to prevent (Ala106) or mimic (Asp106) phosphorylation at the site (Fig. 4, C and D). GFP-T-ag-(102–135) and GFP-T-ag-(102–135:D106) accumulated to the same extent as GFP-T-ag-(110–135) in the SAOS-2 cell line but showed a significantly (p < 0.0021) reduced accumulation compared with GFP-T-ag-(110–135) in the p110Rb-expressing SR-40 line (Fig. 4D). There was no significant difference in nuclear accumulation between SAOS-2 and SR-40 cells; however, for GFP-T-ag-(102–135:A106) or when compared with GFP-T-ag-(110–135) (Fig. 4D), suggesting that negative charge (normally supplied by phosphorylation) at Ser106 may facilitate p110Rb binding to the T-ag RbBS, thus resulting in reduced nuclear accumulation. To confirm these results, we used an established in vitro reconstituted nuclear transport system (40Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

The various proteins were tested for the ability to accumulate in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, and exogenous cytosol, which supplies IMPs/Ran etc., in the absence and presence of specific antibody to p110Rb (see “Experimental Procedures,” Fig. 5A). Nuclear accumulation was followed over time using CLSM, and the results compared with those for GFP-T-ag-(110–135) (Fig. 5). Quantitative analysis revealed that the GFP-T-ag-(102–135) and GFP-T-ag-(102–135:D106) accumulated to a lower extent than GFP-T-ag-(110–135) in the absence of anti-p110Rb antibody, while GFP-T-ag-(102–135:A106) and GFP-T-ag-(102–135:Rb mut1) accumulated to levels simil"
https://openalex.org/W1985103954,"Background Glucose is an important source of energy for living organisms. In vertebrates it is ingested with the diet and transported into the cells by conserved mechanisms and molecules, such as the trans-membrane Glucose Transporters (GLUTs). Members of this family have tissue specific expression, biochemical properties and physiologic functions that together regulate glucose levels and distribution. GLUT4 –coded by SLC2A4 (17p13) is an insulin-sensitive transporter with a critical role in glucose homeostasis and diabetes pathogenesis, preferentially expressed in the adipose tissue, heart muscle and skeletal muscle. We tested the hypothesis that natural selection acted on SLC2A4. Methodology/Principal Findings We re-sequenced SLC2A4 and genotyped 104 SNPs along a ∼1 Mb region flanking this gene in 102 ethnically diverse individuals. Across the studied populations (African, European, Asian and Latin-American), all the eight common SNPs are concentrated in the N-terminal region upstream of exon 7 (∼3700 bp), while the C-terminal region downstream of intron 6 (∼2600 bp) harbors only 6 singletons, a pattern that is not compatible with neutrality for this part of the gene. Tests of neutrality based on comparative genomics suggest that: (1) episodes of natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced diversity downstream of intron 6 and, (2) the target of natural selection may not be in the SLC2A4 coding sequence. Conclusions We propose that the contrast in the pattern of genetic variation between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are signatures of the action of natural selection and thus follow-up studies should investigate the functional importance of differnet regions of the SLC2A4 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2164259881,"Bacteria show a bias in their genomic oligonucleotide composition far beyond that dictated by G+C content. Patterns of over- and underrepresented oligonucleotides carry a phylogenetic signal and are thus diagnostic for individual species. Patterns of short oligomers have been investigated by multiple groups in large numbers of bacteria genomes. However, global distributions of the most highly overrepresented mid-sized oligomers have not been assessed across all prokaryotes to date. We surveyed overrepresented mid-length oligomers across all prokaryotes and normalised for base composition and embedded oligomers using zero and second order Markov models.Here we report a presumably ancient set of oligomers conserved and overrepresented in nearly all branches of prokaryotic life, including Archaea. These oligomers are either adenine rich homopurines with one to three guanine nucleosides, or homopyridimines with one to four cytosine nucleosides. They do not show a consistent preference for coding or non-coding regions or aggregate in any coding frame, implying a role in DNA structure and as polypeptide binding sites. Structural parameters indicate these oligonucleotides to be an extreme and rigid form of B-DNA prone to forming triple stranded helices under common physiological conditions. Moreover, the narrow minor grooves of these structures are recognised by DNA binding and nucleoid associated proteins such as HU.Homopurine and homopyrimidine oligomers exhibit distinct and unusual structural features and are present at high copy number in nearly all prokaryotic lineages. This fact suggests a non-neutral role of these oligonucleotides for bacterial genome organization that has been maintained throughout evolution."

The expression vector was transmitted into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) under 100 μg/ml ampicillin selection (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analysis was performed to confirm that the fusion protein was in-frame with glutathione S-transferase. Use of glutathione S-transferase fusion and a thrombin cleavage site introduced six additional residues at the N terminus. Consequently, the N-terminal amino acid sequence is Gly-Ser-Pro-Gly-Ile-Arg-Met…, where the methionine indicates the start of the native sequence. The transformed BL21 (DE3) strain was grown in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The 50-ml cell culture was seeded into 2 liters of M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl (for U-15N-labeled protein) or 15NH4Cl and 13C6H12O6 (for U-13C,15N-labeled protein) and allowed to grow at 37 °C with shaking until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.7 (15NH4Cl and 13C6H12O6 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA)). The cells were induced to produce protein by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.4 mm for 24 h at room temperature with shaking. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and either used immediately or stored long term at −80 °C. The bacterial cells were suspended in 30 ml of PBS with 5 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA and lysed twice with a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to remove cellular debris. The lysate was loaded (1 ml/min) onto a GSTrap HP column (5 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS at room temperature. The column was washed with PBS until the A280 was at the background level before 150 units of thrombin (GE Healthcare) in PBS was added, and the column was allowed to sit overnight at room temperature. The cleaved protein was eluted from the column and concentrated in a YM10 concentrator (Amicon) to 2 ml in PBS. The salt was removed by dialysis in 3.5-kDa cutoff tubing (Thermo Scientific) against 3× 4 liters double-distilled H2O at 4 °C. The sample was then lyophilized and used to make NMR samples with 2 mm concentration in 10 mm K2PO4, pH 7.8, 5% D2O. The purity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and by Western blot against an antibody raised in a rabbit against AeSCP-2. Mass spectrometry was also used to determine that the AeSCP-2 sample was ligand-free (supplemental material). To prepare the AeSCP-2-PA complex, palmitic acid was dissolved in hexane and added in 10 m excess to a 2 mm solution of [U-13C,15N]AeSCP-2 in an Eppendorf tube and incubated overnight at 37 °C with rocking. The 0.5 mm [U-15N]AeSCP-2 or [U-15N]AeSCP-2-PA samples used for residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements contained 15 mg/ml Pf1 phage cosolvent (ASLA Biotech) in the NMR buffer. All NMR spectra were recorded at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison, WI, on Varian Inova (600 MHz and 900 MHz) spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance cryogenic probes. The temperature of each sample was regulated at 25 °C. Sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments were conducted for AeSCP-2 and AeSCP-2-PA. A series of two- and three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectra were collected for both AeSCP-2 and AeSCP-2-PA containing 2.0 mm U-13C,15N-protein dissolved in NMR buffer with 10 mm phosphate, 95% H2O, and 5% D2O (20Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Mag. Res. Sp. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Raw NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11508) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program XEASY (22Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCO data sets were used to identify the number of spin systems, and these identifications plus three-dimensional HNCACB and three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH data sets were used as input to the PINE server (23Bahrami A. Assadi A.H. Markley J.L. Eghbalnia H.R. PLoS. Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000307Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to determine sequence-specific backbone and CB resonance assignments. Backbone resonance assignments were confirmed on the basis of 15N-resolved 1H-1H NOESY data. Two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC, three-dimensional HBHA(CO)NH, three-dimensional HC(CO)NH, and three-dimensional C(CO)NH experiments were used to assign the side chain and HA resonances. Three-dimensional 15N-edited 1H-1H NOESY (100-ms mixing time) and three-dimensional 13C-edited 1H-1H NOESY (120 ms) experiments were used to derive the distance constraints to determine the three-dimensional structure of protein (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). 13C,15N-filtered/15N-edited 1H-1H NOESY (200 ms) and three-dimensional 13C,15N-filtered/13C-edited 1H-1H NOESY (200 ms) data were collected to observe intermolecular NOE signals between palmitic acid and AeSCP-2 (25Stuart A.C. Borzilleri K.A. Withka J.M. Palmer 3rd, A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5346-5347Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Palmitic acid 1H resonances were assigned using 13C-filtered 1H-1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Standard pulse sequences (26Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) were used to record steady state {1H}-15N NOE and 15N relaxation (T1, T2) data. To determine the 15N T1 values, multiple interleaved NMR spectra were recorded with relaxation delay of 0, 40, 100, 200, 300, 440, 600, 800, 1000, and 1300 ms. To determine 15N T2 values, multiple interleaved NMR spectra were recorded with delay of 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150, 190, and 230 ms. The relaxation rates were calculated by least squares fitting of peak heights versus relaxation delay to one single exponential decay. The reported error estimates are standard deviations derived from fitting the data. Steady state {1H}-15N NOE values were calculated from the ratio of peak heights in a pair of NMR spectra acquired with and without proton saturation. The signal-to-noise ratio in each spectrum was used to estimate the experimental uncertainty. Modelfree analysis has been performed using fast Modelfree and Modelfree version 4.15 (27Cole R. Loria J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer 3rd, A.G. J. Mol.

The one bond scalar coupling (1JN-H) was derived from the shift in position between corresponding peaks in 15NHSQC and transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy spectra (30Lukin J.A. Kontaxis G. Simplaceanu V. Yuan Y. Bax A. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RDC values for N–H bond vectors (1DN-H) were then calculated from the difference between the one bond scalar couplings of Pf1 aligned and isotropic samples. The Q factor was calculated from the equation Q = r.m.s. (Dcal − Dobs)/r.m.s (Dobs), where r.m.s. is root mean square and D = 1DN-H. Chemical shift perturbations (Δδ) were calculated from the equation (Δδ) = ((Δδ1H)2 + 1/5(Δδ15N)2)1/2. For the structure calculation, 15N-resolved 1H-1H three-dimensional NOESY and 13C-resolved 1H-1H three-dimensional NOESY spectra were used to derive the intramolecular distance restraints and 13C/15N-filtered/13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY, and 13C/15N-filtered/15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY were used to derived the intermolecular distance restraints. TALOS+ software (31Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar, 32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) was used in deriving backbone dihedral angle restraints (ϕ and ψ) from 1HA, 15N, 13CA, 13CB, and 13C′ chemical shift values. CYANA software versions 2.1/3.0 (33Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) were used for automatic NOESY peaks assignments and structure calculations. NOESY peaks assigned automatically by CYANA were used as a guide to further refine the structure. RDC refinement was performed using CYANA 3.0, and PALES software was used for analyzing the refinement results (34Zweckstetter M. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Programs MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6484) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (36DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) were used to calculate the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) and graphical analysis. The PSVS server (37Bhattacharya A. Tejero R. Montelione G.T. Proteins. 2007; 66: 778-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) was used to check the quality of the structure. The 15N HSQC spectrum of AsSCP-2 was well dispersed, but signals from a few amino acids exhibited multiple peaks (Fig. 1, left). This indicated the presence of local structural heterogeneity, which could explain the failure to crystallize the ligand-free protein. The NMR data support the presence of three populations with percent occupancy 51:33:16 in part of the protein and two populations with percent occupancy 66:34 in another part of the protein. These results suggest that one domain of the molecule exists as one stable conformation, whereas another domain exists as two interconverting conformations with a subdomain of the latter domain affected by a second conformational equilibrium. As described below, we determined the solution structure of the most abundant species present in solution. We were also able to assign the signals from the minor species to individual amino acids in the protein sequence. The multiple peaks observed with AeSCP-2 were converted into a single set of resonances in the AeSCP-2-PA complex (Fig. 1B). Changes in the positions of 15N HSQC peaks upon formation of the complex identified regions of the protein perturbed by ligand binding. Sequence-specific assignment of these peaks identified the residues involved, and they were found to correspond to residues in the loop joining helix I and strand A. The solution structure of ligand-free AeSCP-2 was derived from 1842 distance constraints, 146 angle constraints from chemical shift analysis by TALOS+ software (31Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar), and 87 orientational constraints from RDCs. The total of 2075 constraints was used in generating 100 refined structures, and the best 20 conformers, those with lowest energy that showed the fewest constraint violations, were chosen to represent the solution structure of AeSCP-2. Refinement against residual dipolar couplings improved the structure significantly; the Q factor was 0.67 before refinement and 0.14 after refinement (Fig. 2, A and B). The r.m.s.d. of 0.41 Å for backbone heavy atoms and 0.9 Å for all heavy atoms of regular secondary structures; 89% of the backbone angles were in most favored and 10% were in additionally favored regions of the Ramachandran plot; and the Z-scores for backbone/all dihedral angles were −0.31/−2.9 (Table 1). These parameters are indicative of a high quality solution structure. The thickness of the backbone trace at a given residue represented in Fig. 3F, which is proportional to the magnitude of the r.m.s.d. for the backbone atoms in the 20 conformers, suggests that the loop between αI and βA is more dynamic than the rest of the backbone.

https://openalex.org/W2094684776,"Our study of the mouse Ate1 arginyltransferase, a component of the N-end rule pathway, has shown that Ate1 pre-mRNA is produced from a bidirectional promoter that also expresses, in the opposite direction, a previously uncharacterized gene (Hu, R. G., Brower, C. S., Wang, H., Davydov, I. V., Sheng, J., Zhou, J., Kwon, Y. T., and Varshavsky, A. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 32559–32573). In this work, we began analyzing this gene, termed Dfa (divergent from Ate1). Mouse Dfa was found to be transcribed from both the bidirectional PAte1/Dfa promoter and other nearby promoters. The resulting transcripts are alternatively spliced, yielding a complex set of Dfa mRNAs that are present largely, although not exclusively, in the testis. A specific Dfa mRNA encodes, via its 3′-terminal exon, a 217-residue protein termed DfaA. Other Dfa mRNAs also contain this exon. DfaA is sequelogous (similar in sequence) to a region of the human/mouse HTEX4 protein, whose physiological function is unknown. We produced an affinity-purified antibody to recombinant mouse DfaA that detected a 35-kDa protein in the mouse testis and in several cell lines. Experiments in which RNA interference was used to down-regulate Dfa indicated that the 35-kDa protein was indeed DfaA. Furthermore, DfaA was present in the interchromatin granule clusters and was also found to bind to the Ggnbp1 gametogenetin-binding protein-1 and to the Abt1 activator of basal transcription that interacts with the TATA-binding protein. Given these results, RNA interference was used to probe the influence of Dfa levels in luciferase reporter assays. We found that DfaA acts as a repressor of TATA-box transcriptional promoters.

This study stems from a serendipitous finding (described below) in our 2006 investigation of the mouse Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), encoded by the Ate1 gene. The Ate1 R-transferase is a component of the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. In eukaryotes, this pathway is a part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (1Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a substrate protein. Among such residues, some are primary destabilizing N-terminal residues, which are recognized directly by ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway, called N-recognins. Other destabilizing N-terminal residues, called secondary or tertiary destabilizing residues, must be modified through deamidation and/or arginylation (6Hu R.G. Sheng J. Qi X. Xu Z. Takahashi T.T.

Alternative splicing of the mouse Ate1 pre-mRNA produces at least six isoforms of R-transferase, a metabolically unstable protein whose enzymatic activity and the in vivo half-life are down-regulated by heme (7Hu R.G.

Science. 2002; 297: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We found that the transcriptional promoter of mouse Ate1 is bidirectional, driving the expression of both Ate1 and an oppositely oriented, previously uncharacterized gene (14Hu R.G. Brower C.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32559-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which was termed Dfa (divergent from Ate1). We wished to explore Dfa because the proximity and head-to-head arrangement of Ate1 and Dfa (Fig. 1A) suggested that the corresponding gene products, R-transferase and Dfa, might be functionally linked, either directly or through belonging to a specific regulatory circuit. This work is the beginning of Dfa studies. We show that Dfa is transcribed from both the bidirectional PAte1/Dfa promoter and other nearby promoters. The resulting transcripts are alternatively spliced, yielding a complex set of Dfa mRNAs that are present largely, although not exclusively, in the testis. A specific Dfa mRNA encodes, via its 3′-terminal exon, a 217-residue protein, termed DfaA. Other Dfa mRNAs also contain this exon (Fig. 1, D–F). DfaA is sequelogous (similar in sequence) (18Varshavsky A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R181-R183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to a region of the previously described human/mouse HTEX4 protein, whose physiological function is unknown. We produced an affinity-purified antibody to the 26-kDa recombinant mouse DfaA, whose apparent molecular mass, upon SDS-PAGE, is 35 kDa. This antibody detected a 35-kDa protein in the mouse testis, in mouse NIH-3T3 cells, and in human HeLa and HEK-293T cells. Experiments in which RNAi 4The abbreviations used are: RNAiRNA interferencePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideHAhemagglutininshshort hairpinRTreverse transcriptionESTexpressed sequence tagIGCinterchromatin granule clusterEGFPenhanced GFPGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsORFopen reading frameDBDDNA-binding domain. was used to down-regulate Dfa in NIH-3T3 cells indicated that the 35-kDa protein (recognized by anti-DfaA antibody) was indeed DfaA. This protein is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Biochemical fractionations suggested an association of DfaA with membranes or other rapidly sedimenting structures. Transient expression of a GFP-DfaA fusion protein indicated that DfaA was present preferentially in the interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). In addition, DfaA was found to interact with specific proteins, including the Abt1 transcriptional activator. Given these results, RNAi was used to down-regulate Dfa in assays with NIH-3T3 cells and a luciferase reporter expressed from a TATA-box transcriptional promoter. We found that DfaA acts as a repressor of this promoter but does not influence the bidirectional PAte1/Dfa promoter, which contains a CpG island and lacks the TATA-box. Contrary to our expectation, no functional or mechanistic connections between the Dfa protein(s) and isoforms of the Ate1 R-transferase were detected so far, apart from the proximity of their head-to-head oriented genes and the antisense orientation of some among the Dfa and Ate1 transcripts (Fig. 1, A and D).

Total RNA from the brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis (C57 mice) was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using the Superscript kit and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). These samples were then used to carry out either standard PCR or 5′-RACE, using Invitrogen GeneRacer kit (catalog no. L1500-01, version J). The following oligonucleotide primers were employed to detect, by RT-PCR, the Dfa cDNA-I (Fig. 1E): forward 5′-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3′ (GeneRacer 5′ Primer); reverse 5′-TTTGCCCAGGCCATTTTCGGC-3′ (CA465465-Rev). The primers for the nested reaction were as follows: forward 5′-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA-3′ (GeneRacer 5′ Nested Primer); reverse 5′-CCTGTTGGAACTTTTGGACTAACAG-3′ (CA465465-Rev2). The primers that yielded the Dfa cDNA-II were as follows: forward 5′-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA-3′ (GeneRacer 5′ Nested Primer); reverse 5′-CCTGTTGGAACTTTTGGACTAACAG-3′ (CA465465-Rev2). The primers that yielded the Dfa cDNA-III were as follows: forward 5′-GCCCTTGTATTCCACCACCG-3′; reverse 5′-TTTGCCCAGGCCATTTTCGGC-3′ (CA465465-Rev). The primers that yielded the Dfa cDNA-IV were as follows: forward 5′-GCCCTTGTATTCCACCACCG-3′; reverse 5′-TTTGCCCAGGCCATTTTCGGC-3 (CA465465-Rev). The primers that yielded the Dfa cDNA-V and cDNA-VI were as follows: forward 5′-CCTCCTCTGCCTGCCAGG-3′; reverse 5′-TTTGCCCAGGCCATTTTCGGC-3′ (CA465465-Rev). 3′-RACE reactions were performed using nested PCRs and Invitrogen GeneRacer kit (version J) according to the manufacturer's protocol and a forward primer specific for the Dfa exon 7, which is shared by Dfa cDNAs characterized so far (Fig. 1E) as follows: 5′-CCGAAAATGGCCTGGGCAAAGG-3′; GeneRacer 3′ Primer 5′-GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACG-3′, and GeneRacer 3′ Nested Primer 5′-CGCTACGTAACGGCATGACAGTG-3′. Northern blots of mRNAs from mouse tissues, containing 2 μg of mouse poly(A)+ RNA per lane (Clontech), were first probed with a 180-bp DNA fragment specific for the Dfa exon 3 (Fig. 1G). This fragment was produced by PCR from the RT-PCR-derived Dfa cDNA III, using primers CB120 (5′-GATGAAGCTGCTGATGCTGC-3′) and CB121 (5′-CTTAGGTTCTCTCACAGAATC-3′). After hybridization with the exon 3-specific probe, the membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a 556-bp DNA probe specific for Dfa exon 7, which is shared by Dfa cDNAs characterized so far (Fig. 1G). This probe was produced by PCR from the RT-PCR-derived Dfa cDNA III, using primers 5′-GAGAGAACCTAAGATTGGCCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-TTTGCCCAGGCCATTTTCGGC-3′. Northern DNA probes were 32P-labeled using the RediprimeII random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization with a DNA probe specific for exon 3 was carried out for 2 h at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech). The blot was then washed once for 30 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, once for 30 min at 55 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once for 30 min at 52 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by autoradiography. Hybridization with a probe specific for exon 7 was carried out for 12 h at 65 °C in ExpressHyb solution. The blot was then washed once for 10 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, once for 30 min at 55 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once for 30 min at 55 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by autoradiography. His10-DfaA, an N-terminally His10-tagged isoform encoded by Dfa cDNA I (Fig. 1E), was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET-16b vector (Novagen, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). Briefly, a 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) was grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6, then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mg/ml lysozyme, plus EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), followed by a 30-min incubation on ice, and one cycle of freeze-thaw. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. Inclusion bodies containing His10-DfaA were solubilized by resuspension in 30 ml of ice-cold 6 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), also containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The resulting solubilized His10-DfaA was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C and was thereafter purified by Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (11Wang H. Piatkov K.I. Brower C.S. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 686-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), except for the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl. Imidazole-eluted, purified His10-DfaA was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10% glycerol, 0.15 m KCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and was thereafter further purified by SDS-12% PAGE. ∼0.9 mg of His10-DfaA that was excised from a 12% preparative-scale polyacrylamide gel was used to inject two rabbits (six times over the course of 3 months) to produce antisera (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Total IgG was isolated by affinity chromatography, using GammaBind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Pooled IgG fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5)) containing 10% glycerol and then passed through a column of Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) with the immobilized (purified) His6-Aat, an unrelated E. coli protein described previously (19Graciet E. Hu R.G. Piatkov K. Rhee J.H. Schwarz E.M. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3078-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction was incubated with Affi-Gel-10 beads conjugated to purified mouse His10-DfaA. After 2 h at 4 °C, with gentle rocking, the sample was loaded into 5-ml disposable columns; the flow-through was collected, and the column was washed with 20 bed volumes of PBS. Anti-DfaA IgG was eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.8) into tubes containing one-third of elution volume of 1 m K2HPO4 (pH 8.5). The resulting fractions were pooled, dialyzed against PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5)) containing 10% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Of the four different Dfa-specific target sequences tested, the most potent microRNA-like short hairpin (sh) RNA that down-regulated Dfa expression targeted the sequence GCCACCCTCACTTGAAATCAAA in exon 7 of Dfa (Figs. 1D and 2A). To construct a corresponding shRNAi-expressing plasmid, termed pEN-DFAsh4, 0.1 ml of the DFAsh4 oligonucleotide (5′-AGCGACCACCCTCACTTGAAATCAAATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATTTGATTTCAAGTGAGGGTGGC-3′), at 50 μm, was mixed with 0.1 ml of 50 μm DFAsh4-rev (5′-GGCAGCCACCCTCACTTGAAATCAAATACATCTGTGGCTTCACTATTTGATTTCAAGTGAGGGTGGT-3′) and incubated for at 95 °C for 10 min. This mixture of single-stranded (unannealed) oligonucleotides was incubated in a water bath at 70 °C for 10 min. The bath was then turned off, and the temperature was allowed to decrease to room temperature overnight. The resulting double-stranded oligo was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated to BfuAI-cut pEN-hU6miR2c (a gift from J. Zavzavadjian, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) (20Shin K.J. Wall E.A. Zavzavadjian J.R. Santat L.A. Liu J. Hwang J.I. Rebres R. Roach T. Seaman W. Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. Proc. Natl.

For use in stable transfections, an NheI-digested fragment containing a floxed PGK-hygromycin cassette (12Brower C.S. Varshavsky A. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was inserted into the single NheI site of pEN-DFAsh4. Whole-testis extract was prepared by homogenizing pooled testes of 60 C57BL/6 mice, using a tissue homogenizer (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) in TMSD Buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)) also containing 0.5 mm PMSF, added from a freshly prepared stock solution in isopropyl alcohol. Nuclear (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was frozen with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The nuclear fraction was washed three times in TMSD, then resuspended in Nuclear Buffer (25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), containing 0.5 mm PMSF), frozen with liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. In the next step, the nuclear fraction was thawed on ice and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, yielding the post-nuclear supernatant. The cytosolic fraction was thawed and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, yielding post-lysosomal supernatant. Before gel filtration, samples of nuclear and cytosolic extracts were dialyzed against Buffer G (10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 0.1 mm PMSF) overnight at 4 °C. The resulting samples were clarified by centrifugation in the SWTi41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at 28,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples obtained were concentrated using Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The resulting samples (5–20 mg of total protein in 1.5 ml) were subjected to gel filtration, using fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus and the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer G, at 0.5 ml/min. 2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed, in particular, by immunoblotting with anti-DfaA antibody. The plasmid pEGFP-DfaA was constructed by ligating the DfaA ORF from cDNA I into KpnI/BamHI-cut pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Poly-d-lysine (1 mg/ml)-coated coverslips were placed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. 1.5 × 105 NIH-3T3 cells were then seeded overnight and transfected with the pEGFP-C1 (control) or pEGFP-DfaA plasmids. The cells were then grown to ∼70% confluence. For GFP localization studies, coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, then washed three times in PBS, and directly mounted using Vectashield H-1500 mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For analyses that also involved immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed in 0.2% Triton X-100, 2% formaldehyde, in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by acetone at −20 °C for 5 min. After fixation, coverslips were washed three times in PBS, blocked by incubation with 1% goat serum for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with an anti-SC35 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at room temperature. For indirect immunofluorescence, the coverslips were then washed in PBS at incubated with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were again washed with PBS, mounted using Vectashield H-1500 mounting medium, and examined by fluorescence microscopy, using Zeiss Axiophot. A colony of SC295 S. cerevisiae that had been transformed with pCB172 (expressing FLAG-tagged mouse DfaA) was inoculated into 2 liters of the plasmid-retaining SD (−Leu) medium, followed by growth at 30 °C to A600 of ∼1.0. An equal volume of YPD medium was then added, and the culture was grown to A600 of ∼4.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold PBS, and frozen in liquid N2. The frozen pellet (∼10 g wet weight) was then ground to a fine powder in liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle and resuspended (6 ml of buffer per 1 g of pellet) in yeast Lysis Buffer (10% glycerol 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m KCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) containing leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin A, and aprotinin, each at 5 μg/ml. The suspension was centrifuged at 11,200 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was mixed, with slow rocking, with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The affinity beads were collected by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge, then washed once with 20 bed volumes of yeast Lysis Buffer containing 0.8 m KCl, twice with 20 bed volumes of yeast Lysis Buffer, then again with 20 bed volumes with Lysis Buffer lacking Nonidet P-40. The antibody-bound FLAG-DfaA was eluted with yeast Lysis Buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and containing FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 0.2 mg/ml. Yeast two-hybrid assay was carried out using the Matchmaker kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, S. cerevisiae AH109 (MATa trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2 URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1) was transformed with pAS2-DfaA, which expressed Gal4DBD-DfaA. The resulting strain (AH109-Dfa2) was mated with S. cerevisiae Y187 (MATα ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 trp1-90 leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ gal80Δ met− URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ MEL1) that had been pre-transformed with a mouse testis cDNA pACT library (Clontech). The resulting diploids were incubated on SC plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and lacking His, Trp, and Leu. The resulting ∼2.5 × 106 Trp+, Leu+, His+ transformants were further assayed for their growth on His-lacking, Ade-lacking media and also for their β-galactosidase activity. Colonies that were Trp+, Leu+, His+, and Ade+ and exhibited β-galactosidase activity were then grown in Leu-lacking, Trp-containing media to facilitate the loss of the pAS2-DfaA plasmid. pACT plasmids were recovered from the resulting cell clones, followed by sequencing of cDNA inserts to identify potential Dfa-binding proteins. Vector “swapping” experiments to verify detected interactions were carried out as follows. The DfaA ORF was excised from pAS2-DfaA, using digestion with BamHI and SalI. In addition, the Abt1 ORF as well as the GgnBP1 ORF were excised from the corresponding pACT2-based plasmids, using digestion with BamHI and XhoI. The excised DfaA ORF was subcloned into pACT2, and the excised Abt1 ORF and (separately) the GgnBP1 ORF were subcloned into pAS2, followed by two-hybrid assays with the resulting plasmids. The mouse DfaA cDNA was amplified from pACT-DfaA using PCR and primers flanked by the BamHI sites. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned at position 1 of the BamHI-cut pET-Duet1 vector (Novagen, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ), yielding pCB157. A triple HA-tagged wild-type mouse Ggnbp1 cDNA was amplified from pcDNA3.1-Ggnbp1 using primers flanked by the NdeI and XhoI sites. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned at position 2 of the NdeI/XhoI-cut pET-Duet, yielding pCB182. A third pET-Duet-based plasmid, pCB183, encoding His6-DfaA at position 1 and Ggnbp1 in position 2, was also constructed to coexpress these proteins in E. coli. 50-ml cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6 in LB containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The cultures were placed on ice for 15 min, followed by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the final concentration of 0.25 mm and incubation for 4 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing lysozyme at 1 mg/ml, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and one freeze-thaw cycle. The resulting suspensions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension in 5 ml of ice-cold 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), also containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The N-terminally His10-tagged DfaA was detected in the soluble and insoluble fractions by SDS-12% PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-DfaA antibody (see above). The N-terminally HA-tagged GgnBP1 was also detected by immunoblotting, using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma). A cDNA encoding the N-terminally triple FLAG-tagged FLAG3-DfaA (f3DfaA) was amplified using a three-PCR strategy in which the DfaA moiety was amplified from the pACT-DfaA plasmid, and a DNA segment encoding an overlapping N-terminal triple-FLAG sequence was amplified by PCR from a separate plasmid (a gift from Dr. K. Piatkov). The final ORF encoding f3DfaA was amplified using primers flanked by the NheI and BamHI sites. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into NheI/BamHI-cut pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), yielding pCB180. Mouse NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with specific plasmids using Lipofectamine-Plus (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice, with frequent mixing, in Lysis Buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9)) also containing leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin A, and aprotinin (each at 5 μg/ml). The extracts was clarified at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. These experiments used anti-FLAGM2 beads (Sigma), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), and the affinity-purified anti-DfaA antibody (see above). Except for experiments that employed anti-FLAGM2 beads, immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating clarified lysates from transfected NIH-3T3 cells with the desired primary antibodies (a"
https://openalex.org/W1966220749,"Deletion analysis of mouse DNMT1, the primary maintenance methyltransferase in mammals, showed that most of the N-terminal regulatory domain (amino acid residues 412-1112) is required for its enzymatic activity. Although analysis of deletion mutants helps to identify regions of a protein sequence required for a particular activity, amino acid deletions can have drastic effects on protein structure and/or stability. Alternative approaches represented by rational design and directed evolution are resource demanding, and require high-throughput selection or screening systems. We developed Regional Frame-shift Mutagenesis (RFM) as a new approach to identify portions required for the methyltransferase activity of DNMT1 within the N-terminal 89-905 amino acids. In this method, a short stretch of amino acids in the wild-type protein is converted to a different amino acid sequence. The resultant mutant protein retains the same amino acid length as the wild type, thereby reducing physical constrains on normal folding of the mutant protein. Using RFM, we identified three small regions in the amino-terminal one-third of the protein that are essential for DNMT1 function. Two of these regions (amino acids 124-160 and 341-368) border a large disordered region that regulates maintenance methylation activity. This organization of DNMT1's amino terminus suggests that the borders define the position of the disordered region within the DNMT1 protein, which in turn allows for its proper function."
