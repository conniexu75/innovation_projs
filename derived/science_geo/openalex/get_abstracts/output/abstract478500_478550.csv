Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by impaired brain development and behavioral, cognitive, and/or physical abnormalities. Several share behavioral abnormalities in sociability, communication, and/or compulsive activity. Most recognized in this regard is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a serious neurodevelopmental condition that is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of stereotypic behavior and deficits in language and social interaction. The reported incidence of ASD has rapidly increased to 1 in 88 births in the United States as of 2008 (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2008 Principal Investigators and CDC, 2012Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2008 Principal InvestigatorsCenters for Disease Control and PreventionPrevalence of autism spectrum disorders—Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 sites, United States, 2008.MMWR Surveill. Summ. 2012; 61: 1-19Google Scholar), representing a significant medical and social problem. However, therapies for treating core symptoms of autism are limited. Much research on ASD has focused on genetic, behavioral, and neurological aspects of disease, though the contributions of environmental risk factors (Hallmayer et al., 2011Hallmayer J. Cleveland S. Torres A. Phillips J. Cohen B. Torigoe T. Miller J. Fedele A. Collins J. Smith K. et al.Genetic heritability and shared environmental factors among twin pairs with autism.Arch. Gen.

The role of immune dysfunction in the pathophysiology of autism.Brain Behav. Immun. 2012; 26: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and additional peripheral disruptions (Kohane et al., 2012Kohane I.S. McMurry A. Weber G. MacFadden D. Rappaport L. Kunkel L. Bickel J. Wattanasin N. Spence S. Murphy S. Churchill S. The co-morbidity burden of children and young adults with autism spectrum disorders.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33224Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) in the pathogenesis of ASD have gained significant attention. Among several comorbidities in ASD, gastrointestinal (GI) distress is of particular interest, given its reported prevalence (Buie et al., 2010Buie T. Campbell D.B. Fuchs 3rd, G.J. Furuta G.T. Levy J. Vandewater J. Whitaker A.H. Atkins D. Bauman M.L.

While the standardized diagnosis of GI symptoms in ASD is yet to be clearly defined, clinical as well as epidemiological studies have reported abnormalities such as altered GI motility and increased intestinal permeability (Boukthir et al., 2010Boukthir S. Matoussi N. Belhadj A. Mammou S. Dlala S.B. Helayem M. Rocchiccioli F. Bouzaidi S. Abdennebi M. [Abnormal intestinal permeability in children with autism].Tunis.

Nutr. 2010; 51: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent multicenter study of over 14,000 ASD individuals reveals a higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other GI disorders in ASD patients compared to controls (Kohane et al., 2012Kohane I.S. McMurry A. Weber G. MacFadden D. Rappaport L. Kunkel L. Bickel J. Wattanasin N. Spence S. Murphy S. Churchill S. The co-morbidity burden of children and young adults with autism spectrum disorders.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33224Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). GI abnormalities are also reported in other neurological diseases, including Rett syndrome (Motil et al., 2012Motil K.J. Caeg E. Barrish J.O. Geerts S. Lane J.B. Percy A.K. Annese F. McNair L.

Bowel Dis. 2009; 15: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The causes of these GI problems remain unclear, but one possibility is that they may be linked to gut bacteria. Indeed, dysbiosis of the microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of several human disorders, including IBD, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (Blumberg and Powrie, 2012Blumberg R. Powrie F.

Based on the emerging appreciation of a gut-microbiome-brain connection, we asked whether modeling some of the behavioral features of ASD in a mouse model also causes GI abnormalities. Several mouse models of genetic and/or environmental risk factors are used to study ASD. We utilize the maternal immune activation (MIA) model, which is based on large epidemiological studies linking maternal infection to increased autism risk in the offspring (Atladóttir et al., 2010Atladóttir H.O. Thorsen P. Østergaard L. Schendel D.E. Lemcke S. Abdallah M. Parner E.T. Maternal infection requiring hospitalization during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorders.J. Autism Dev.

A number of studies link increased ASD risk to familial autoimmune disease (Atladóttir et al., 2009Atladóttir H.O. Pedersen M.G. Thorsen P. Mortensen P.B. Deleuran B. Eaton W.W. Parner E.T.

Modeling MIA in mice by injecting pregnant dams with the viral mimic poly(I:C) yields offspring that exhibit the core communicative, social, and stereotyped impairments relevant to ASD, as well as a common autism neuropathology—a localized deficiency in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Malkova et al., 2012Malkova N.V.

Furthermore, pregnant monkeys exposed to poly(I:C) yield offspring with symptoms of ASD (Bauman et al., 2013Bauman M.D. Iosif A.M. Smith S.E. Bregere C. Amaral D.G. Patterson P.H. Activation of the Maternal Immune System During Pregnancy Alters Behavioral Development of Rhesus Monkey Offspring.Biol.

Although several environmental and genetic risk factors for ASD have been investigated in preclinical models, GI abnormalities have not been reported. We show herein that offspring of MIA mice, which display behavioral abnormalities, have defects in intestinal integrity and alterations in the composition of the commensal microbiota that are analogous to features reported in human ASD. To explore the potential contribution of GI complications to these symptoms, we examine whether treatment with the gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis, demonstrated to correct GI pathology in mouse models of colitis (Mazmanian et al., 2008Mazmanian S.K. Round J.L. Kasper D.L. A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease.Nature. 2008; 453: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) and to protect against neuroinflammation in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (Ochoa-Repáraz et al., 2010Ochoa-Repáraz J. Mielcarz D.W. Ditrio L.E. Burroughs A.R. Begum-Haque S. Dasgupta S. Kasper D.L. Kasper L.H.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 4101-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), impacts ASD-related GI and/or behavioral abnormalities in MIA offspring. Our study reflects a mechanistic investigation of how alterations in the commensal microbiota impact behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of neurodevelopmental disease. Our findings suggest that targeting the microbiome may represent an approach for treating subsets of individuals with behavioral disorders, such as ASD, and comorbid GI dysfunction. Subsets of ASD children are reported to display GI abnormalities, including increased intestinal permeability or “leaky gut” (D’Eufemia et al., 1996D’Eufemia P. Celli M. Finocchiaro R. Pacifico L.

Incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism: a population-based study.Pediatrics. 2009; 124: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We find that adult MIA offspring, which exhibit a number of behavioral and neuropathological symptoms of ASD (Malkova et al., 2012Malkova N.V. Yu C.Z. Hsiao E.Y. Moore M.J. Patterson P.H. Maternal immune activation yields offspring displaying mouse versions of the three core symptoms of autism.Brain Behav. Immun. 2012; 26: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), also have a significant deficit in intestinal barrier integrity, as reflected by increased translocation of FITC-dextran across the intestinal epithelium, into the circulation (Figure 1A, left). This MIA-associated increase in intestinal permeability is similar to that of mice treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), which induces experimental colitis (Figure 1A, left). Deficits in intestinal integrity are detectable in 3-week-old MIA offspring (Figure 1A, right), indicating that the abnormality is established during early life. Consistent with the leaky gut phenotype, colons from adult MIA offspring contain decreased gene expression of TJP1, TJP2, OCLN, and CLDN8 and increased expression of CLDN15 (Figure 1B). Deficient expression of TJP1 is also observed in small intestines of adult MIA offspring (Figure S1A available online), demonstrating a widespread defect in intestinal barrier integrity.Figure S1B. fragilis Treatment Has Little Effect on Tight Junction Expression and Cytokine Profiles in the Small Intestine, Related to Figures 1 and 3Show full caption(A) Expression of tight junction components relative to β-actin in small intestines of adult saline and poly(I:C) offspring.

Gut permeability is commonly associated with an altered immune response (Turner, 2009Turner J.R. Intestinal mucosal barrier function in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). Accordingly, colons from adult MIA offspring display increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA and protein (Figures 1C and 1D) and decreased levels of the cytokines/chemokines IL-12p40/p70 and MIP-1α (Figure 1D). Small intestines from MIA offspring also exhibit altered cytokine/chemokine profiles (Figure S1C). Changes in intestinal cytokines are not accompanied by overt GI pathology, as assessed by histological examination of gross epithelial morphology from hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections (data not shown). Overall, we find that adult offspring of immune-activated mothers exhibit increased gut permeability and abnormal intestinal cytokine profiles. Abnormalities related to the microbiota have been identified in ASD individuals, including disrupted community composition (Adams et al., 2011Adams J.B. Johansen L.J. Powell L.D. Quig D. Rubin R.A.

To evaluate whether MIA induces microbiota alterations, we surveyed the fecal bacterial population by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of samples isolated from adult MIA or control offspring. Alpha diversity, i.e., species richness and evenness, did not differ significantly between control and MIA offspring, as measured by several indices (Figures S2A and S2B). In contrast, unweighted UniFrac analysis, which measures the degree of phylogenetic similarity between microbial communities, reveals a strong effect of MIA on the gut microbiota of adult offspring (Figure 2). MIA samples cluster distinctly from controls by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and differ significantly in composition (Table S3, with ANOSIM R = 0.2829, p = 0.0030), indicating robust differences in the membership of gut bacteria between MIA offspring and controls (Figure 2A). The effect of MIA on altering the gut microbiota is further evident when sequences from the classes Clostridia and Bacteroidia, which account for approximately 90.1% of total reads, are exclusively examined by PCoA (R = 0.2331, p = 0.0070; Figure 2B), but not when Clostridia and Bacteroidia sequences are specifically excluded from PCoA of all other bacterial classes (R = 0.1051, p = 0.0700; Figure 2C). This indicates that changes in the diversity of Clostridia and Bacteroidia operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are the primary drivers of gut microbiota differences between MIA offspring and controls.Figure 2MIA Offspring Exhibit Dysbiosis of the Intestinal MicrobiotaShow full caption(A) Unweighted UniFrac-based 3D PCoA plot based on all OTUs from feces of adult saline+vehicle (S) and poly(I:C)+vehicle (P) offspring.(B) Unweighted UniFrac-based 3D PCoA plot based on subsampling of Clostridia and Bacteroidia OTUs (2003 reads per sample).(C) Unweighted UniFrac-based 3D PCoA plot based on subsampling of OTUs remaining after subtraction of Clostridia and Bacteroidia OTUs (47 reads per sample).(D) Relative abundance of unique OTUs of the gut microbiota (bottom, x axis) for individual biological replicates (right, y axis), where red hues denote increasing relative abundance of a unique OTU.(E) Mean relative abundance of OTUs classified at the class level for the most (left) and least (right) abundant taxa. n = 10/group.

https://openalex.org/W1986316308,Single murine and human intestinal stem cells can be expanded in culture over long time periods as genetically and phenotypically stable epithelial organoids. Increased cAMP levels induce rapid swelling of such organoids by opening the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR). This response is lost in organoids derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Here we use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to correct the CFTR locus by homologous recombination in cultured intestinal stem cells of CF patients. The corrected allele is expressed and fully functional as measured in clonally expanded organoids. This study provides proof of concept for gene correction by homologous recombination in primary adult stem cells derived from patients with a single-gene hereditary defect.

We describe a phenotypically and functionally distinct population of Treg cells that rapidly accumulated in the acutely injured skeletal muscle of mice, just as invading myeloid-lineage cells switched from a proinflammatory to a proregenerative state. A Treg population of similar phenotype accumulated in muscles of genetically dystrophic mice. Punctual depletion of Treg cells during the repair process prolonged the proinflammatory infiltrate and impaired muscle repair, while treatments that increased or decreased Treg activities diminished or enhanced (respectively) muscle damage in a dystrophy model. Muscle Treg cells expressed the growth factor Amphiregulin, which acted directly on muscle satellite cells in vitro and improved muscle repair in vivo. Thus, Treg cells and their products may provide new therapeutic opportunities for wound repair and muscular dystrophies."

Here, we identify induction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression as a common feature of drug-resistant tumors in a credentialed preclinical model, a finding also confirmed in patient samples. GR substituted for the androgen receptor (AR) to activate a similar but distinguishable set of target genes and was necessary for maintenance of the resistant phenotype. The GR agonist dexamethasone was sufficient to confer enzalutamide resistance, whereas a GR antagonist restored sensitivity. Acute AR inhibition resulted in GR upregulation in a subset of prostate cancer cells due to relief of AR-mediated feedback repression of GR expression.

Recently approved drugs that target androgen receptor (AR) signaling such as abiraterone and enzalutamide have rapidly become standard therapies for advanced-stage prostate cancer (Scher et al., 2012Scher H.I.

Despite their success, sustained response with these agents is limited by acquired resistance, which typically develops within ∼6–12 months. Clinical success of kinase inhibitors in other tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma is similarly transient (Sawyers et al., 2002Sawyers C.L. Hochhaus A. Feldman E. Goldman J.M.

Med. 2010; 362: 2380-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (4628) Google Scholar), resulting in numerous efforts to define mechanisms of acquired resistance. One strategy that has proven particularly useful is prolonged treatment of drug-sensitive preclinical models to derive drug-resistant sublines, followed by genome-wide profiling studies to ascertain differences that may play a causal role in conferring drug resistance. A common mechanism that has emerged from these kinase inhibitor studies is reactivation of the signaling pathway targeted by the drug, directly by mutation of the kinase target or indirectly by bypassing pathway inhibitor blockade through amplification of an alternative kinase (Glickman and Sawyers, 2012Glickman M.S. Sawyers C.L. Converting cancer therapies into cures: lessons from infectious diseases.Cell. 2012; 148: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both scenarios have been validated in clinical specimens and are guiding efforts to discover next-generation inhibitors and to develop rational drug combinations. Clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to hormone therapy in prostate cancer have also been elucidated using preclinical models. Hormone therapy, through the use of drugs that lower serum testosterone or competitively block the binding of androgens to AR, has been the mainstay of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer for decades but is not curative. The late stage of disease, which is refractory to hormone therapy, is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We previously examined the molecular basis of progression to CRPC in mouse models and discovered that increased AR expression was the primary mechanism (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Molecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). We then used this observation to screen for antiandrogens that restore AR inhibition in the setting of increased AR levels. These efforts yielded three second-generation antiandrogens: enzalutamide, ARN-509, and RD162 (Tran et al., 2009Tran C. Ouk S. Clegg N.J. Chen Y. Watson P.A. Arora V. Wongvipat J. Smith-Jones P.M.

Cai L. et al.ARN-509: a novel antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Enzalutamide and ARN-509 were further developed for clinical use, culminating in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of enzalutamide in 2012 based on increased survival (Scher et al., 2012Scher H.I. Fizazi K. Saad F. Taplin M.E. Sternberg C.N. Miller K. de Wit R. Mulders P. Chi K.N. Shore N.D. et al.AFFIRM InvestigatorsIncreased survival with enzalutamide in prostate cancer after chemotherapy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). Now, with widespread use, resistance to enzalutamide is a major clinical problem. We and others have recently identified an AR point mutation as one resistance mechanism by derivation of drug-resistant sublines following prolonged exposure to enzalutamide or ARN-509 (Balbas et al., 2013Balbas M.D. Evans M.J. Hosfield D.J. Wongvipat J. Arora V.K. Watson P.A. Chen Y. Greene G.L. Shen Y. Sawyers C.L.

This AR mutation has also been recovered from patients with resistance to ARN-509 but only in a minority of cases (Joseph et al., 2013Joseph J.D. Lu N. Qian J. Sensintaffar J. Shao G. Brigham D. Moon M. Chow Maneval E. Chen I.

Here, we define a potentially more prevalent mechanism of resistance by which tumors bypass AR blockade through upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We previously showed that LNCaP/AR xenograft tumors regress during the first 28 days of treatment with ARN-509 (Clegg et al., 2012Clegg N.J. Wongvipat J. Joseph J.D. Tran C. Ouk S. Dilhas A. Chen Y. Grillot K. Bischoff E.D. Cai L. et al.ARN-509: a novel antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), enzalutamide, or RD162 (Tran et al., 2009Tran C. Ouk S. Clegg N.J. Chen Y. Watson P.A. Arora V. Wongvipat J. Smith-Jones P.M. Yoo D. Kwon A. et al.Development of a second-generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.Science. 2009; 324: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). In a pilot study to explore mechanisms of acquired resistance to these drugs, we treated mice continually and harvested tumors after progression (mean 163 days, Table S1A available online). Tissue from 15 resistant tumors obtained from long-term antiandrogen-treated mice (n = 6 ARN-509, n = 9 RD162) and from 3 control tumors from vehicle-treated mice were analyzed by expression array. Aggregated data from resistant and control tumors in this pilot cohort were compared to identify expression changes commonly associated with resistance (Figure 1A). Among the most upregulated genes in the resistant tumors was the GR (gene symbol NR3C1), which shares overlapping target specificity with AR (Mangelsdorf et al., 1995Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. The nuclear receptor superfamily: the second decade.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6064) Google Scholar). Of note, several of the most differentially expressed genes were known androgen-regulated genes (confirmed by transcriptome analysis of short-term dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated LnCaP/AR cells in vitro [Table S1B]), but they were altered in directions that did not reflect restored AR signaling. On the one hand, SGK1 (Serum Glucocorticoid Induced Kinase 1), a known AR- and GR-induced target gene, was among the most upregulated genes, but several other androgen-induced genes (PMEPA1, SNAI2, KCNN2, LONRF1, and SPOCK1) were among the most repressed. Conversely, several androgen-repressed genes (UGT2B15, PMP22, CAMK2N1, and UGT2B17) were among the most upregulated (Figure 1A). These findings indicated that resistance in this model system is unlikely to be mediated by simple restoration of AR activity and raised the possibility that GR may play a role. To explore this question further, we generated an independent set of drug-resistant tumors (the validation cohort), focusing on the two second-generation antiandrogens in clinical use, enzalutamide and ARN-509 (Figure 1B). GR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in resistant tumors were substantially higher compared to control (median 26.9-fold increase) or 4 day treated tumors (Figure 1C). Of the tissues analyzed by RT-qPCR, most were also analyzed for GR expression by western blot, based on availability of protein lysates (control, n = 6; 4 day, n = 5; resistant, n = 13). No GR was detected in control samples, minimal expression was noted in 4 day treated samples, and substantial expression was found in most resistant tumors in a pattern that tended to correlate with GR mRNA levels (Figure 1D). There was no correlation between GR expression and the specific antiandrogen treatment used (Table S1C). In contrast to GR, AR RNA or proteins levels were not consistently different across the treatment groups (Figures 1C and 1D). To explore AR and GR signaling in more detail, we established cells lines from control and drug-resistant tumors by adaptation to growth in vitro. LREX′ (LnCaP/AR Resistant to Enzalutamide Xenograft derived) was derived from an enzalutamide-resistant tumor with high GR expression, and CS1 was derived from a vehicle-treated tumor. We also developed a flow cytometry-based assay to measure GR expression on a cell-by-cell basis. In both LNCaP/AR and CS1, most cells showed no evidence of GR expression, with the exception of a small subpopulation (black arrow, discussed later) (Figure 1E). In contrast, essentially all LREX′ cells expressed GR. Intracellular AR staining confirmed that AR levels in LREX′ did not notably differ from control cells (Figure S1A). Having established the LREX′ model as representative of high GR expression, we next confirmed that these cells maintain a resistant phenotype in vivo. LREX′ or control cells were injected into castrated mice that were then immediately initiated on antiandrogen treatment. LREX′ showed robust growth, whereas LNCaP/AR or CS1 lines were unable to establish tumors in the presence of antiandrogen (Figures 2A and 2B ). Strong expression of GR was confirmed in multiple LREX′ xenograft tumors by western blot and by IHC (Figures S2 and S1B). As expected, untreated LNCaP/AR tumors were negative for GR expression with the exception of rare GR-positive cells (Figure 2C). Although many of these GR-positive cells had morphologic features of stromal or endothelial cells (blue arrows), some appeared epithelial (black arrow), which is consistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1E, black arrows). To determine whether GR expression is required to maintain the drug-resistant phenotype, LREX′ cells were infected with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-targeting GR (shGR), and stable knockdown of GR protein was confirmed (Figure 2F). Tumor growth of shGR-infected LREX′ cells was significantly delayed relative to nontargeted (shNT)-infected cells in castrated mice treated with enzalutamide (Figure 2D). In contrast, shGR had no impact on the growth of GR-negative CS1 xenografts, diminishing the possibility of an off-target effect (Figure 2E). Of note, shGR LREX′ xenografts harvested on day 49 showed decreased GR protein knockdown compared to the preimplantation levels, which is indicative of selective pressure against GR silencing in the setting of enzalutamide treatment (Figure 2F). These findings provide direct evidence that GR drives enzalutamide resistance in vivo. To determine whether GR expression is a feature of clinical antiandrogen resistance, we evaluated GR expression in bone metastases from patients receiving enzalutamide. Bone marrow samples were obtained prior to enzalutamide treatment (baseline) and again after 8 weeks of treatment, as previously reported in a cohort of abiraterone-treated patients (Efstathiou et al., 2012Efstathiou E. Titus M. Tsavachidou D. Tzelepi V. Wen S. Hoang A. Molina A. Chieffo N. Smith L.A. Karlou M. et al.Effects of abiraterone acetate on androgen signaling in castrate-resistant prostate cancer in bone.J. Clin. Oncol. 2012; 30: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Using a GR immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay optimized for use in bone marrow samples, we quantified the percentage of GR-positive tumor cells and dichotomized the data based on clinical response. Patients who continued to benefit from therapy for greater than 6 months were defined as good responders, whereas those in whom therapy was discontinued earlier than 6 months due to a lack of clinical benefit were classified as poor responders (Figure 3A). Consistent with the designation of good versus poor clinical response based on treatment status at 6 months, 11 of 13 good responders but only 1 of 14 poor responders had a maximal PSA decline greater than 50% (Figure 3B). Akin to the findings in the preclinical model, GR positivity at baseline was low—3% of tumor cells in good responders and 8% in poor responders. Of note, 3 of 22 tumors had evidence of high GR expression at baseline (≥20% of tumor cells), and all three had a poor clinical response (Figures 3C and 3D). At 8 weeks, the mean percentage of GR-positive cells was higher than baseline levels in both response groups but was more significantly elevated in poor responders (29% versus 8%, p = 0.009). In addition, the percentage of GR-positive cells at 8 weeks was significantly higher in poor compared to good responders (29% versus 10%, p = 0.02) (Figures 3C and 3D), and similar results were obtained when the analysis was limited to patients from whom matched baseline and 8 week samples were available for analysis (Figure 3E). Furthermore, when GR IHC data were dichotomized based on PSA decline instead of clinical response, GR induction was also associated with a limited PSA decline (Figure S2). These findings establish a correlation between GR expression and clinical response to enzalutamide and raise the possibility that AR inhibition may induce GR expression in some patients. The fact that poor PSA decline also correlates with GR expression raises the question of whether transcriptional regulation of a canonical AR target gene may be regulated by GR.Figure S2GR Induction Dichotomized Based on PSA Response, Related to Figure 3Show full captionGR IHC scores in matched baseline and 8 week samples (same as in Figure 3E) dichotomized based on maximal PSA response ± SEM.

Having implicated GR as a potential mediator of antiandrogen resistance, we next asked whether restored AR pathway activity also plays a role by comparing the mRNA transcript levels of 74 direct AR target genes in control, 4 day, and resistant tumors from the validation cohort (Figure S3), as well as eight LREX′ tumors (Figure 4A) (see Experimental Procedures and Table S2 for details on gene selection).Figure 4Variable Expression of AR Target Genes in LREX′ In Vivo and after Glucocorticoid Treatment In VitroShow full caption(A) Normalized expression array signal (Illumina HT-12) of a suite of 74 AR target genes in control (n = 10), 4 day (n = 8), and LREX′ (n = 8, right) xenograft tumors.

See also Figures S3 and S4. Consistent with the data generated in the pilot cohort (Figure 1A), some AR target genes in resistant tissues showed elevated levels relative to control (SGK1 and STK39), whereas other genes (NDRG1, TIPARP, and PMEPA1) showed no evidence of restored expression. To examine restoration of AR signaling across the entire set of 74 target genes, we calculated a fractional restoration value using log 2 transformed expression values and the equation (resistant – 4 day)/(control – 4 day). With this approach, a gene whose expression in resistant tissue equals the expression in control tumors calculates as 1, whereas a gene whose expression in resistance equals its expression after 4 days of antiandrogen treatment equals 0. (Values greater than one indicate hyperrestoration in resistance relative to control, and values below zero suggest further inhibition as compared to acute treatment.) These data confirmed that the pattern of restoration varied gene by gene, but this pattern was consistent in LREX′ xenografts and in the validation cohort tumors (Pearson r 0.64, p = 7.54 × 10−10; Figure 4B). This finding is most consistent with a model in which AR remains inhibited in drug-resistant tumors, but expression of certain AR target genes is restored by an alternative transcription factor, possibly GR. The fact that restoration values were somewhat higher in the LREX′ analysis correlates with higher GR expression in these tumors (Figure 4C). To determine whether GR can drive expression of this subset of AR target genes, we compared, in vitro, DHT-induced (AR) and dexamethasone (Dex)-induced (GR) expression of seven AR targets that represent the spectrum of restoration noted in the in vivo analysis, as well as PSA (Figure 4D). All eight genes were regulated by DHT as expected, and this regulation was blocked by enzalutamide. Thus, AR signaling remains intact and can be inhibited by antiandrogens in these drug-resistant cells, making an AR-dependent mechanism of drug resistance less likely. In contrast to DHT, the effect of Dex on these same target genes was variable but closely matched the pattern observed in drug-resistant xenografts. For example, Dex strongly induced SGK1 and STK39 but did not induce TIPARP, NDRG1, and PMEPA1. Of note, KLK3 (PSA) was comparably induced by either DHT or Dex, providing evidence that persistent PSA expression in patients responding poorly to enzalutamide could be driven by GR. As expected, enzalutamide did not notably affect Dex activity. To confirm that this pattern of GR-dependent gene expression is not unique to LREX′ cells, we introduced a GR-expressing retrovirus into parental LNCaP/AR cells and observed a similar pattern of DHT- versus Dex-induced gene expression (Figures S4A and S4B). To be sure that the effects of Dex in these models are mediated through GR, we cotreated cells with a previously described competitive GR antagonist that lacks AR binding called compound 15 (Wang et al., 2006Wang J.C. Shah N. Pantoja C. Meijsing S.H. Ho J.D. Scanlan T.S. Yamamoto K.R. Novel arylpyrazole compounds selectively modulate glucocorticoid receptor regulatory activity.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Compound 15 significantly decreased expression of Dex-induced genes, confirming that Dex activity in the LREX′ model is GR dependent (Figure S4C). Lastly, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments targeting AR confirmed that AR is not necessary for Dex-mediated gene activation (Figure S4D). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that GR is able to drive expression of certain AR target genes independent of AR. To explore AR and GR transcriptomes in an unbiased fashion, we performed expression profiling after short-term treatment of LREX′ cells with DHT or Dex in the presence or absence of enzalutamide. AR and GR signatures were respectively defined as all genes with absolute expression change greater than 1.6-fold (FDR < 0.05) after 1 nM DHT or 100 nM Dex treatment (Table S3). Of the 105 AR signature genes and 121 GR signature genes, 52 were common to both lists (Figure 5A). An even larger proportion of AR or GR signature genes (>80%) showed evidence of regulation by the reciprocal receptor using different thresholds for expression differences (Table S3). Heatmap analysis of these genes confirmed significant overlap in DHT- versus Dex-induced gene expression and showed that Dex-induced gene expression is not impacted by enzalutamide treatment (Figure 5B). These findings support the hypothesis that GR activity can bypass enzalutamide-mediated AR inhibition by regulating a distinct but significantly overlapping transcriptome. We next addressed the question of whether transcriptomes of enzalutamide-resistant tumors are more likely to be explained by AR- or GR-driven gene expression using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). To define gene sets that distinguish AR and GR activity, expression of AR and GR signature genes was first evaluated by GSEA in the DHT- and Dex-treated samples from which they were derived. As expected, GR signature genes were enriched in the Dex-treated samples, and AR signature genes were enriched with DHT treatment (Figure 5C). Because several of the genes did not distinguish AR and GR status due to their overlapping transcriptional activities, we refined the lists into AR selective genes (defined as the AR-induced signature genes that were also more highly expressed in DHT-treated samples relative to Dex treated samples, n = 39) and GR selective genes (defined as the converse, n = 67) (Table S3). GSEA analysis of these selective gene lists revealed that GR selective genes were strongly enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant LREX′ tumors, whereas AR selective genes were strongly enriched in the control tumors (Figure 5D). These data provide compelling, unbiased evidence that drug resistance is associated with a transition from AR- to GR-driven transcriptional activity. One prediction of this model is that GR should occupy a substantial portion of AR binding sites in drug-resistant cells. To address this question, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments to define AR and GR DNA binding sites in LREX′ cells after DHT and Dex treatment, respectively. Of note, 52% of the AR binding sites identified after DHT treatment were bound by GR after Dex treatment (Figure 5E). We examined the remaining 48% of AR peaks more closely to be sure that these peaks were not scored as GR negative simply because they fell just below the threshold set by our peak calling parameters. When we plotted the average AR and GR signal as a measure of the relative strength of AR and GR peaks, we found little evidence of GR binding at the AR unique sites (Figure S5A), confirming that these peaks were indeed unique to AR. Next we conducted motif analysis to explore potential differences between AR/GR overlap versus AR unique sites. The core ARE/GRE consensus sequence was present in both groups (66% and 68% of peaks), but AR/GR overlap peaks were relatively enriched for the FoxA motif (64% versus 45% of peaks; p = 2.2 × 10−16) (Figure 5E). Similar analysis of the GR cistrome defined GR unique and AR/GR overlap peaks and revealed that a higher proportion of GR binding sites were unique to GR. Interestingly, GR unique peaks were highly enriched for the FoxA motif (Figure 5F), whereas the classic ARE/GRE was not reported by the motif discovery algorithm (MEME) and was found only 25% of the time. Although these cistrome studies provide evidence of substantial overlap between AR and GR binding sites in enzaluamide-resistant cells, several lines of evidence indicate that the transcriptional differences in DHT- versus Dex-induced gene expression cannot be explained solely by DNA binding. For example, ChIP RT-qPCR experiments showed significant AR and GR DNA binding at genes induced by both receptors (SGK1, FKBP5, PSA) but also at genes such as NDRG1 that are transcriptionally activated by DHT, but not Dex (Figure S5B). Integrative ChIP-seq and transcriptome analysis provided further evidence that DNA binding is not sufficient to determine transcriptional competence. Of the 56 AR signature genes found to have an AR binding peak, 49 showed at least some transcriptional regulation by GR (1.2-fold expression change, p < 0.05). 38 of these 49 GR regulated genes (78%) had an overlapping AR/GR binding peak, confirming substantial overlap at coregulated genes. But GR peaks were also found in three of the seven AR targets genes (43%) with no apparent GR transcriptional regulation (Figure S5C). Others have reported evide"

EEG/MEG signals can play an important role in providing measures of functional and effective connectivity in the brain. After a brief description of the foundations and basic methodological aspects of EEG/MEG signals, the relevance of the signals to obtain novel insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive processes is surveyed, with emphasis on neuronal oscillations (ultra-slow, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and HFOs) and combinations of oscillations. Three main functional roles of brain oscillations are put in evidence: (1) coding specific information, (2) setting and modulating brain attentional states, and (3) assuring the communication between neuronal populations such that specific dynamic workspaces may be created. The latter form the material core of cognitive functions."

Thus, our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hiPSC-based disease models. Late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) are becoming a growing burden to society due to the gradual increase in life expectancy. The incidence of PD will likely continue to rise because it is estimated that by 2050, 21.8% of the projected world population (approximately two billion people) will be over 60 years of age (Lutz et al., 2008Lutz W. Sanderson W. Scherbov S. The coming acceleration of global population ageing.Nature. 2008; 451: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology where patient-derived skin cells can be reprogrammed back to a pluripotent state and then further differentiated into disease-relevant cell types presents new opportunities for modeling and potentially treating currently intractable human disorders (Bellin et al., 2012Bellin M.

However, there is a concern as to how well iPSC-derived cells can model late-onset diseases where patients do not develop symptoms until later in life, implicating age as a necessary component to disease progression. Several iPSC studies have demonstrated a loss of particular age-associated features during iPSC induction (reviewed in Freije and López-Otín, 2012Freije J.M. López-Otín C.

For instance, there is evidence for an increase in telomere length (Agarwal et al., 2010Agarwal S. Loh Y.H. Mcloughlin E.M. Huang J. Park I.H. Miller J.D. Huo H. Okuka M. Dos Reis R.M.

In addition to the apparent loss of age-associated features in iPSCs, the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is known to yield immature, embryonic-like cell types that often require months of maturation to establish robust functional properties (Liu et al., 2012aLiu G.H.

Technical challenges in using human induced pluripotent stem cells to model disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Protracted differentiation is thought to reflect the slow timing of human development. For example, human midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons, a cell type affected in PD, require months of differentiation to develop mature physiological behaviors and to rescue dopamine deficits in animal models of PD (Isacson and Deacon, 1997Isacson O.

These in vitro differentiation data argue for a species-specific, intrinsic “clock-like” mechanism that prevents the rapid generation of mature, and aged, cells posing a challenge for human iPSC-based modeling of late-onset disorders. A key problem in addressing global aspects of aging and rejuvenation during cell reprogramming is the identification of markers that reliably measure age in vitro. Candidate age-related cellular markers have been described in fibroblasts derived from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2005Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Reversal of the cellular phenotype in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Nat. Med. 2005; 440: 440-445Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar, Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). HGPS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature aging of various tissues resulting in early death (Hennekam, 2006Hennekam R.C.M. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: review of the phenotype.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2006; 140: 2603-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Mutations in LMNA, the gene coding for the nuclear envelope protein lamin A, result in the activation of a cryptic splice site that produces a shorter transcript known as progerin. Progerin protein aberrantly accumulates in the nuclear membrane, preventing at least some of the normal scaffolding functions of lamin A, which in turn interferes with multiple processes in the nucleus, including chromatin organization, heterochromatin formation, the DNA-damage response, cell cycle, gene transcription, and telomere maintenance (reviewed in Dechat et al., 2008Dechat T. Pfleghaar K. Sengupta K. Shimi T. Shumaker D.K. Solimando L. Goldman R.D. Nuclear lamins: major factors in the structural organization and function of the nucleus and chromatin.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 832-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Interestingly, low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals, and a similar age-associated profile has been observed in fibroblasts from normally aged donors (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Here, we utilize a set of markers that correlates with fibroblast donor age, including markers of nuclear morphology and expression of nuclear organization proteins as well as markers of heterochromatin, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such age-associated markers, present in old fibroblasts, were lost during reprogramming and were not reacquired during the subsequent differentiation, indicating that iPSC-derived cells do not maintain a memory of their age. Importantly, we could induce tissue-specific age-associated markers in both iPSC-derived fibroblasts (iPSC-fibroblasts) and iPSC-derived mDA neurons (iPSC-mDA neurons) following short-term progerin exposure. The ability to rapidly induce features associated with cellular age was captured to improve modeling PD in vitro and upon transplantation of iPSC-mDA neurons in vivo. We observed several age- and disease-related phenotypes not seen in previous iPSC studies, including evidence of dendrite degeneration, the formation of age-associated neuromelanin, AKT deregulation, reduction in the number of TH+ neurons, and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial swelling and inclusion bodies. Induced aging presents a paradigm for iPSC studies that may be applicable to other cell types and disease pathologies to address the contribution of genetic and age-associated factors in late-onset disorders. In order to validate a marker profile that could be followed during reprogramming and redifferentiation, we compared 12 passage-matched fibroblast populations from apparently healthy young donors (age 11), middle-aged donors (ages 31–55), old donors (ages 71–96), and prematurely aged patients with HGPS (ages 3–14) (Table S1 available online). We observed a significant correlation of donor fibroblast age with age-associated markers (Figures 1A–1C and S1A), including markers previously described in HGPS fibroblasts (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from old donors resembled HGPS fibroblasts supporting previous findings by Misteli and colleagues (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2005Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Reversal of the cellular phenotype in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Nat. Med. 2005; 440: 440-445Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar, Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). More specifically, old donor fibroblasts showed nuclear morphology abnormalities (i.e., folding and blebbing), loss of the nuclear lamina-associated protein 2α (LAP2α), global loss of the heterochromatin markers trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 γ (HP1γ), as well as an increase in DNA damage and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels when compared to fibroblasts from younger donors. Importantly, marker expression in old donor fibroblasts was comparable to HGPS fibroblasts despite expressing low levels of progerin, the mutant protein involved in HGPS (Figure S1B; Table S2). These data suggest that age-associated markers can faithfully stratify young versus old donor fibroblasts. To address the effects of reprogramming on markers of cellular age, we selected fibroblasts from young (age 11), old (age 82), and HGPS (age 14) donors and transduced them with Sendai vectors expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Fusaki et al., 2009Fusaki N. Ban H. Nishiyama A. Saeki K. Hasegawa M. Efficient induction of transgene-free human pluripotent stem cells using a vector based on Sendai virus, an RNA virus that does not integrate into the host genome.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2009; 85: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C). The use of the cytoplasmic RNA viruses allowed for the derivation of integration-free iPSCs by 25–40 days posttransduction. All iPSC clones demonstrated pluripotent properties and marker expression (Figures S1D–S1F) and had a normal karyotype (data not shown), and iPSCs derived from HGPS patient fibroblasts maintained the disease mutation (Figure S1G). We next reassessed the age-associated molecular markers shown above to distinguish between young and old fibroblasts. iPSCs were not assessed prior to passage 10 to ensure loss of the exogenous Sendai virus (Figure S1D). Following reprogramming, iPSCs that were derived from old donor fibroblasts were indistinguishable from young donor-derived iPSCs with respect to expression of lamin A, LAP2α, H3K9me, and HP1γ (Figures 1D and 1E). Furthermore, all iPSCs displayed minimal levels of DNA damage or mtROS (Figure 1F), suggesting a reset of phenotypic age. However, the age-associated signature could be dependent on progerin expression (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), and the absence of an age-related phenotype in iPSCs may simply reflect the fact that pluripotent cells do not express A-type lamins including progerin (Constantinescu et al., 2006Constantinescu D. Gray H.L. Sammak P.J. Schatten G.P. Csoka A.B. Lamin A/C expression is a marker of mouse and human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis for all A-type lamin isoforms showed expression restricted to cells undergoing spontaneous differentiation at the periphery of iPSC colonies (Figure 1D, left column). HGPS iPSCs demonstrated a comparable loss of age-associated markers at the pluripotent stage, (Figures 1B, 1C, 1E, and 1F). However, despite the loss of age-related markers, our data do not rule out the possibility that reprogramming selects for cells with low levels of age-related marker expression (a “young” cell) among the old donor fibroblasts rather than truly resetting age. Interestingly, clonal growth of primary donor fibroblasts resulted in cultures that reestablished a distribution of age-related markers comparable to the original fibroblast population within 2 weeks (data not shown). Therefore, it was not possible to obtain fibroblast populations homogeneous in the expression of age-related markers. Nevertheless, regardless of the mechanism, our results demonstrate that iPSCs, independent of donor age or HGPS status, lack expression of age-associated markers. We next tested whether old donor-derived iPSCs may retain a memory of their donor age that is transiently suppressed at the pluripotent stage. We differentiated iPSCs back into fibroblast-like cells using serum-containing medium (Figure S2A) for 30 days followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for CD13+/HLA-ABChi (Papapetrou et al., 2009Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M.J. Chambers S.M. Mica Y. Reed E. Menon J. Tabar V. Mo Q. Studer L. Sadelain M.

Identification of the human fibroblast surface glycoprotein (FSH) as aminopeptidase M.FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B). The purified cells were expanded for an additional 30 days prior to characterization for the fibroblast marker vimentin and absence of the neural precursor marker nestin (Figure S2C). iPSC-fibroblasts showed expression of lamin A and progerin at levels similar to those observed in primary donor fibroblasts (Figure S2D). However, differentiation did not reestablish the age-associated marker profile in old donor iPSC-fibroblasts (Figures 2A–2C) that closely matched the profile of passage-matched young donor iPSC-fibroblasts. These data demonstrate that age-associated markers in primary fibroblasts from aged, apparently healthy donors are reset following reprogramming and are not reestablished upon differentiation into iPSC-fibroblasts. Thus, age is lost after reprogramming, giving rise to phenotypically young iPSC-fibroblasts that may require years of in vitro culture to reestablish their age. In contrast, HGPS iPSC-fibroblasts did spontaneously reestablish expression of age-associated markers upon differentiation (Figures 2B and 2C) as reported in iPSC-based models of HGPS (Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H.

We next sought to determine whether progerin overexpression is sufficient to induce age-associated markers in apparently healthy young or old donor iPSC-fibroblasts.

Daily transfection of modified-RNA for 3 days (Figure 3A) induced progerin expression to levels similar or higher than those in HGPS iPSC-fibroblasts (Figure S2F, arrows). Strikingly, overexpression of GFP-progerin but not nuclear-GFP in young and old donor iPSC-fibroblasts induced nuclear morphology abnormalities, loss of LAP2α expression, formation of DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX), loss of heterochromatin markers (H3K9me3 and HP1γ), and increased mtROS (Figures 3B–3D). These progerin-induced features were indistinguishable from those observed in primary fibroblasts from aged donors (Figures 1A–1C and S1A). Aging in mitotic cells is typically associated with the shortening of telomeres to a critical point when the cell undergoes senescence, reaching Hayflick’s limit (Hayflick, 1965Hayflick L. The limited in vitro lifetime of human diploid cell strains.Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured telomere lengths using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Canela et al., 2007Canela A. Vera E. Klatt P. Blasco M.A. High-throughput telomere length quantification by FISH and its application to human population studies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5300-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in transfected iPSC-fibroblasts to determine whether progerin can induce telomere shortening. Following progerin overexpression, iPSC-fibroblasts demonstrated a decrease in overall length and an increase in the percentage of short telomeres with progerin overexpression (Figure S2G). This result was further corroborated by an increase in senescence-activated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining (Figure S2H). All progerin-induced changes in iPSC-fibroblasts were independent of donor age. Our observations indicate that progerin overexpression is sufficient to rapidly induce phenotypes in iPSC-fibroblasts that phenocopy aspects of normal aging. We next tested whether progerin overexpression also induces age-like phenotypes in a postmitotic cell type. Therefore, we differentiated young and old donor iPSCs into mDA neurons, a cell type affected in PD, using our previously established protocol (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). Within 13 days, differentiated iPSCs had converted into LMX1A/FOXA2-positive midbrain floor plate precursors, an early stage of mDA neuron development (Figure S3B). Immature mDA neurons at day 32 of differentiation were transiently treated with mitomycin C to eliminate remaining proliferating progenitors (Figure S3C). iPSC-mDA neurons that were matured for an additional 6 weeks (day 70) continued to express mDA markers such as FOXA2 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in all iPSC clones independent of donor age (Figures S3D and S3E). Interestingly, iPSC-mDA neurons spontaneously showed evidence of low-level nuclear folding concomitant with the onset of endogenous lamin A expression (Figure S3F). To achieve similar expression levels of progerin in iPSC-mDA neurons as in the iPSC-fibroblasts, we extended modified-RNA exposure to 5 days (Figure 4A), which induced progerin levels exceeding the levels of endogenous lamin A (Figure 4B, arrows). Following progerin overexpression, GFP+ cells showed evidence of enhanced nuclear folding and blebbing and accumulation of DNA damage (Figure 4C) and mtROS (Figure 4D). However, in contrast to iPSC-fibroblasts (Figure 3), we did not observe significant changes in LAP2α, H3K9me3, or HP1γ in neurons (Figure 4E). Positive SA-β-gal staining, a marker of senescence, was also not detected in iPSC-mDA neurons. These data demonstrate both shared and cell-type-specific responses of iPSC-fibroblasts and mDA neurons to our in vitro aging paradigm. To further examine cell-type-specific responses to progerin exposure, we investigated parameters associated with neuronal aging in vivo such as degenerative changes in dendrite branching (Hof and Morrison, 2004Hof P.R. Morrison J.H. The aging brain: morphomolecular senescence of cortical circuits.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 607-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Remarkably, 5 days of progerin exposure in differentiated (day 65) mDA neurons was sufficient to induce a degenerative phenotype resulting in the breakdown of established neurites (Figure 5A). No degeneration was observed in cells transfected with nuclear-GFP mRNA. We next assessed expression of MAP2, which specifically labels dendrites (Bernhardt, 1984Bernhardt R. Light and electron microscopic studies of the distribution of microtubule-associated protein 2 in rat brain: a difference between dendritic and axonal cytoskeletons.J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 226: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis showed a marked reduction in average dendrite length following progerin exposure in mDA neurons from both young and old donor iPSCs (Figure 5B). Importantly, the percentages of iPSC-mDA neurons expressing the dopamine neuron markers NURR1 and TH remained unchanged, suggesting that the addition of progerin did not simply induce toxicity (Figures S4A and S4B), in contrast to the treatment with mitochondrial toxins such as CCCP that rapidly induced mDA neuron marker loss (data not shown). To further characterize the age-like phenotype in iPSC-mDA neurons following progerin overexpression, we performed gene expression analysis by RNA-seq. Principle component analysis confirmed a reset in gene expression following reprogramming and illustrated the similarity between iPSC-mDA neurons from donors of different ages (Figure 5C). Furthermore, progerin overexpression induced highly similar (p < 2.93 × 10−321) changes in young and old donor iPSC-mDA neurons (Figures 5C and S4C). Many of the overlapping progerin-induced expression changes (Figure S4C; Table S3) have been previously associated with processes involved in neuronal aging, including axon degeneration/regeneration (TMSB10, TMSB4X, CCDC126, TSNAX, NOSTRIN, and LAMC3), protein misfolding and aggregation (NEDD8, PSMB3, PPIB, and UBC), oxidative stress (ENHO, NDUFB6, ATP5L, PRDX4, FTL, ATOX1, and TNIP3), DNA damage (NOP10 and TCEAL7), cell-cycle induction (PCNA and MIR663A), and chromatin modification (PRDM1) (Figure 5D). Induction of transcripts associated with age-like processes was confirmed by analysis of gene ontology (Figure S4D). Among the differentially expressed transcripts, we also found several uncharacterized genes and noncoding RNAs (Figure 5E) reminiscent of recent observations in the aging rat brain (Wood et al., 2013Wood S.H. Craig T. Li Y. Merry B. de Magalhães J.P. Whole transcriptome sequencing of the aging rat brain reveals dynamic RNA changes in the dark matter of the genome.Age (Dordr.). 2013; 35: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A key motivation for manipulating age in iPSC-neurons is the need for developing faithful models of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Several groups have established iPSC-based disease models of PD.

We hypothesized that the lack of a neurodegenerative phenotype in those studies may be a result of the age reset during reprogramming. Similar to patients with PD who do not exhibit disease symptoms until later in life, PD iPSC-mDA neurons may be too “young” to mimic the degenerative phase of the disease. Therefore, we tested whether progerin overexpression may reveal disease-associated phenotypes that cannot be currently modeled in PD iPSC studies. We derived mDA neurons from PD iPSCs with homozygous mutations (Figure S5A; Table S2) in PINK1 (Q456X) or Parkin (V324A). PINK1 and Parkin are thought to act in a common pathway to promote the autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria (Dodson and Guo, 2007Dodson M.W. Guo M.

However, so far there have not been reports of use of this system for efficient correction of a genetic disease. Here we show that mice with a dominant mutation in Crygc gene that causes cataracts could be rescued by coinjection into zygotes of Cas9 mRNA and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the mutant allele. Correction occurred via homology-directed repair (HDR) based on an exogenously supplied oligonucleotide or the endogenous WT allele, with only rare evidence of off-target modifications. The resulting mice were fertile and able to transmit the corrected allele to their progeny. Thus, our study provides proof of principle for use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct genetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051981831,"Neural circuits for essential natural behaviors are shaped by selective pressure to coordinate reliable execution of flexible goal-directed actions. However, the structural and functional organization of survival-oriented circuits is poorly understood due to exceptionally complex neuroanatomy. This is exemplified by AGRP neurons, which are a molecularly defined population that is sufficient to rapidly coordinate voracious food seeking and consumption behaviors. Here, we use cell-type-specific techniques for neural circuit manipulation and projection-specific anatomical analysis to examine the organization of this critical homeostatic circuit that regulates feeding. We show that AGRP neuronal circuits use a segregated, parallel, and redundant output configuration. AGRP neuron axon projections that target different brain regions originate from distinct subpopulations, several of which are sufficient to independently evoke feeding. The concerted anatomical and functional analysis of AGRP neuron projection populations reveals a constellation of core forebrain nodes, which are part of an extended circuit that mediates feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2163430198,"The complex, interconnected architecture of cell-signaling networks makes it challenging to disentangle how cells process extracellular information to make decisions. We have developed an optogenetic approach to selectively activate isolated intracellular signaling nodes with light and use this method to follow the flow of information from the signaling protein Ras. By measuring dose and frequency responses in single cells, we characterize the precision, timing, and efficiency with which signals are transmitted from Ras to Erk. Moreover, we elucidate how a single pathway can specify distinct physiological outcomes: by combining distinct temporal patterns of stimulation with proteomic profiling, we identify signaling programs that differentially respond to Ras dynamics, including a paracrine circuit that activates STAT3 only after persistent (>1 hr) Ras activation. Optogenetic stimulation provides a powerful tool for analyzing the intrinsic transmission properties of pathway modules and identifying how they dynamically encode distinct outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1998070636,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Despite sharing the common property of pluripotency, hESCs are notably distinct from epiblast cells of the preimplantation blastocyst. Here we use a combination of three small-molecule inhibitors to sustain hESCs in a LIF signaling-dependent hESC state (3iL hESCs) with elevated expression of NANOG and epiblast-enriched genes such as KLF4, DPPA3, and TBX3. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis confirms that the expression signature of 3iL hESCs shares similarities with native preimplantation epiblast cells. We also show that 3iL hESCs have a distinct epigenetic landscape, characterized by derepression of preimplantation epiblast genes. Using genome-wide binding profiles of NANOG and OCT4, we identify enhancers that contribute to rewiring of the regulatory circuitry. In summary, our study identifies a distinct hESC state with defined regulatory circuitry that will facilitate future analysis of human preimplantation embryogenesis and pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2076407458,"TET proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) on DNA and play important roles in various biological processes. Mutations of TET2 are frequently observed in myeloid malignance. Here, we present the crystal structure of human TET2 bound to methylated DNA at 2.02 Å resolution. The structure shows that two zinc fingers bring the Cys-rich and DSBH domains together to form a compact catalytic domain. The Cys-rich domain stabilizes the DNA above the DSBH core. TET2 specifically recognizes CpG dinucleotide and shows substrate preference for 5mC in a CpG context. 5mC is inserted into the catalytic cavity with the methyl group orientated to catalytic Fe(II) for reaction. The methyl group is not involved in TET2-DNA contacts so that the catalytic cavity allows TET2 to accommodate 5mC derivatives for further oxidation. Mutations of Fe(II)/NOG-chelating, DNA-interacting, and zinc-chelating residues are frequently observed in human cancers. Our studies provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of TET-mediated 5mC oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2118404419,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a fundamental component of all eukaryotic cells that facilitates nucleocytoplasmic exchange of macromolecules. It is assembled from multiple copies of about 30 nucleoporins. Due to its size and complex composition, determining the structure of the NPC is an enormous challenge, and the overall architecture of the NPC scaffold remains elusive. In this study, we have used an integrated approach based on electron tomography, single-particle electron microscopy, and crosslinking mass spectrometry to determine the structure of a major scaffold motif of the human NPC, the Nup107 subcomplex, in both isolation and integrated into the NPC. We show that 32 copies of the Nup107 subcomplex assemble into two reticulated rings, one each at the cytoplasmic and nuclear face of the NPC. This arrangement may explain how changes of the diameter are realized that would accommodate transport of huge cargoes."
https://openalex.org/W1983275536,"Bacteria that cause disease rely on their ability to counteract and overcome host defenses. Here, we present a genome-scale study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that uncovers the bacterial determinants of surviving host immunity, sets of genes we term ""counteractomes."" Through this analysis, we found that CD4 T cells attempt to contain Mtb growth by starving it of tryptophan--a mechanism that successfully limits infections by Chlamydia and Leishmania, natural tryptophan auxotrophs. Mtb, however, can synthesize tryptophan under stress conditions, and thus, starvation fails as an Mtb-killing mechanism. We then identify a small-molecule inhibitor of Mtb tryptophan synthesis, which converts Mtb into a tryptophan auxotroph and restores the efficacy of a failed host defense. Together, our findings demonstrate that the Mtb immune counteractomes serve as probes of host immunity, uncovering immune-mediated stresses that can be leveraged for therapeutic discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2088358935,"Both circuit and single-cell properties contribute to network rhythms. In vitro, pyramidal cells exhibit theta-band membrane potential (subthreshold) resonance, but whether and how subthreshold resonance translates into spiking resonance in freely behaving animals is unknown. Here, we used optogenetic activation to trigger spiking in pyramidal cells or parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons (PV) in the hippocampus and neocortex of freely behaving rodents. Individual directly activated pyramidal cells exhibited narrow-band spiking centered on a wide range of frequencies. In contrast, PV photoactivation indirectly induced theta-band-limited, excess postinhibitory spiking in pyramidal cells (resonance). PV-inhibited pyramidal cells and interneurons spiked at PV-inhibition troughs, similar to CA1 cells during spontaneous theta oscillations. Pharmacological blockade of hyperpolarization-activated (I(h)) currents abolished theta resonance. Inhibition-induced theta-band spiking was replicated in a pyramidal cell-interneuron model that included I(h). Thus, PV interneurons mediate pyramidal cell spiking resonance in intact cortical networks, favoring transmission at theta frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1998069891,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a central regulator of adult stem cells. Variable sensitivity of Wnt reporter transgenes, β-catenin's dual roles in adhesion and signaling, and hair follicle degradation and inflammation resulting from broad deletion of epithelial β-catenin have precluded clear understanding of Wnt/β-catenin's functions in adult skin stem cells. By inducibly deleting β-catenin globally in skin epithelia, only in hair follicle stem cells, or only in interfollicular epidermis and comparing the phenotypes with those caused by ectopic expression of the Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor Dkk1, we show that this pathway is necessary for hair follicle stem cell proliferation. However, β-catenin is not required within hair follicle stem cells for their maintenance, and follicles resume proliferating after ectopic Dkk1 has been removed, indicating persistence of functional progenitors. We further unexpectedly discovered a broader role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in contributing to progenitor cell proliferation in nonhairy epithelia and interfollicular epidermis under homeostatic, but not inflammatory, conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2124312641,"Carriage and density of gametocytes, the transmission stages of malaria parasites, are determined for predicting the infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes. This measure is used for evaluating interventions that aim at reducing malaria transmission. Gametocytes need to be detected by amplification of stage-specific transcripts, which requires RNA-preserving blood sampling. For simultaneous, highly sensitive quantification of both, blood stages and gametocytes, we have compared and optimized different strategies for field and laboratory procedures in a cross sectional survey in 315 5-9 yr old children from Papua New Guinea. qRT-PCR was performed for gametocyte markers pfs25 and pvs25, Plasmodium species prevalence was determined by targeting both, 18S rRNA genes and transcripts. RNA-based parasite detection resulted in a P. falciparum positivity of 24.1%; of these 40.8% carried gametocytes. P. vivax positivity was 38.4%, with 38.0% of these carrying gametocytes. Sensitivity of DNA-based parasite detection was substantially lower with 14.1% for P. falciparum and 19.6% for P. vivax. Using the lower DNA-based prevalence of asexual stages as a denominator increased the percentage of gametocyte-positive infections to 59.1% for P. falciparum and 52.4% for P. vivax. For studies requiring highly sensitive and simultaneous quantification of sexual and asexual parasite stages, 18S rRNA transcript-based detection saves efforts and costs. RNA-based positivity is considerably higher than other methods. On the other hand, DNA-based parasite quantification is robust and permits comparison with other globally generated molecular prevalence data. Molecular monitoring of low density asexual and sexual parasitaemia will support the evaluation of effects of up-scaled antimalarial intervention programs and can also inform about small scale spatial variability in transmission intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2171946863,"For efficient coding, sensory systems need to adapt to the distribution of signals to which they are exposed. In vision, natural scenes above and below the horizon differ in the distribution of chromatic and achromatic features. Consequently, many species differentially sample light in the sky and on the ground using an asymmetric retinal arrangement of short- (S, ""blue"") and medium- (M, ""green"") wavelength-sensitive photoreceptor types. Here, we show that in mice this photoreceptor arrangement provides for near-optimal sampling of natural achromatic contrasts. Two-photon population imaging of light-driven calcium signals in the synaptic terminals of cone-photoreceptors expressing a calcium biosensor revealed that S, but not M cones, preferred dark over bright stimuli, in agreement with the predominance of dark contrasts in the sky but not on the ground. Therefore, the different cone types do not only form the basis of ""color vision,"" but in addition represent distinct (achromatic) contrast-selective channels."
https://openalex.org/W2063634360,"Progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex sequentially generate distinct classes of projection neurons. Recent work suggests the cortex may contain intrinsically fate-restricted progenitors marked by expression of Cux2. However, the heterogeneity of the neocortical ventricular zone as well as the contribution of lineage-restricted progenitors to the overall cortical neurogenic program remains unclear. Here, we utilize in vivo genetic fate mapping to demonstrate that Fezf2-expressing radial glial cells (RGCs) exist throughout cortical development and sequentially generate all major projection neuron subtypes and glia. Moreover, we show that the vast majority of CUX2⁺ cells in the VZ and SVZ are migrating interneurons derived from the subcortical telencephalon. Examination of the embryonic cortical progenitor population demonstrates that Cux2⁺ RGCs generate both deep- and upper-layer projection neurons. These results identify Fezf2⁺ radial glial cells as a multipotent neocortical progenitor and suggest that the existence, and molecular identity, of laminar-fate-restricted RGCs awaits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2081977041,"To investigate the mechanisms through which economic decisions are formed, I examined the activity of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex while monkeys chose between different juice types. Different classes of cells encoded the value of individual offers (offer value), the value of the chosen option (chosen value), or the identity of the chosen juice (chosen juice). Choice variability was partly explained by the tendency to repeat choices (choice hysteresis). Surprisingly, near-indifference decisions did not reflect fluctuations in the activity of offer value cells. In contrast, near-indifference decisions correlated with fluctuations in the preoffer activity of chosen juice cells. After the offer, the activity of chosen juice cells reflected the decision difficulty but did not resemble a race-to-threshold. Finally, chosen value cells presented an ""activity overshooting"" closely related to the decision difficulty and possibly due to fluctuations in the relative value of the juices. This overshooting was independent of choice hysteresis."
https://openalex.org/W2091136244,"The cyanobacterial circadian clock generates genome-wide transcriptional oscillations and regulates cell division, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that the response regulator RpaA serves as the master regulator of these clock outputs. Deletion of rpaA abrogates gene expression rhythms globally and arrests cells in a dawn-like expression state. Although rpaA deletion causes core oscillator failure by perturbing clock gene expression, rescuing oscillator function does not restore global expression rhythms. We show that phosphorylated RpaA regulates the expression of not only clock components, generating feedback on the core oscillator, but also a small set of circadian effectors that, in turn, orchestrate genome-wide transcriptional rhythms. Expression of constitutively active RpaA is sufficient to switch cells from a dawn-like to a dusk-like expression state as well as to block cell division. Hence, complex global circadian phenotypes can be generated by controlling the phosphorylation of a single transcription factor."

Entomol. 2010; 47: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, mosquitoes that lack the coreceptor orco, and so lack functional Or receptors, are still attracted strongly to human skin odor with CO2 (DeGennaro et al., 2013DeGennaro M. McBride C.S. Seeholzer L. Nakagawa T. Dennis E.J. Goldman C. Jasinskiene N. James A.A. Vosshall L.B. orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET.Nature. 2013; 498: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that other receptors may also play a role in skin attraction. Here, we show that the CO2-sensitive, Gr-expressing cpA olfactory neurons on the maxillary palps of mosquitoes are also sensitive detectors of human skin odor, a function conserved in A. aegypti and A. gambiae. We use a novel chemical strategy to selectively knock down cpA responses to skin odor and demonstrate that this neuronal pathway is also important for attraction to skin odor in a wind tunnel. The role of this neuron class in host-seeking behavior toward both CO2 and skin odor establishes it as the key target for behavioral intervention. We screen ∼0.5 million compounds in silico to identify new receptor ligands that modify mosquito behavior, including a cpA antagonist that reduces attraction to skin and an agonist that lures mosquitoes as effectively as CO2. We demonstrate in Drosophila melanogaster that neuronal response and aversive behavior to a structurally diverse panel of odorants depends on the highly conserved CO2 receptor. Our analysis of the CO2 neuron ligand space provides a foundation for understanding mosquito host-seeking behavior and the chemical basis of host attractiveness and identifies odors that are safe, pleasant, and affordable for immediate use in mosquito control. As reported previously (DeGennaro et al., 2013DeGennaro M. McBride C.S. Seeholzer L. Nakagawa T. Dennis E.J. Goldman C. Jasinskiene N. James A.A. Vosshall L.B. orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET.Nature. 2013; 498: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we find that orco mutant female A. aegypti mosquitoes without functional Ors retain strong attraction to a human skin odor source (Figures S1A and S1B available online), suggesting that other receptors may participate in attraction to skin odor. Since the CO2 receptor neuron cpA is the only known ORN class in mosquitoes whose activity closely correlates with behavioral attraction, we hypothesized that volatiles from human skin may activate cpA. Indeed, human foot odor collected directly onto glass beads activates cpA in A. aegypti (Figure 1B). This corroborates a previously unexplained observation that cpA activity increases when a human hand is placed nearby (Kellogg, 1970Kellogg F.E. Water vapour and carbon dioxide receptors in Aedes aegypti.J. Insect Physiol. 1970; 16: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test whether cpA activation by human odor is important for attraction, we devised a novel chemical-based strategy to shut down the CO2 receptor in A. aegypti. Butyryl chloride is a reactive volatile compound related to two of the strongest known inhibitors of the CO2 receptor, butyraldehyde and butyric acid (Turner et al., 2011Turner S.L. Li N. Guda T. Githure J. Cardé R.T. Ray A. Ultra-prolonged activation of CO2-sensing neurons disorients mosquitoes.Nature. 2011; 474: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). A single puff of 1% butyryl chloride inhibits cpA from firing in response to subsequent CO2 stimuli (data not shown). We experimentally determined that a 3 min exposure to a small quantity (100 μl, 10−2) of butyryl chloride allowed to volatilize in an upended glass dish completely abolished cpA’s subsequent responses to 1% CO2 (Figures 1D and 1E) or exhaled breath (∼4% CO2; data not shown) when tested ∼5–20 min after exposure. CpA responses to butanone, a known ligand found in human skin odor (Turner et al., 2011Turner S.L. Li N. Guda T. Githure J. Cardé R.T. Ray A. Ultra-prolonged activation of CO2-sensing neurons disorients mosquitoes.Nature. 2011; 474: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), were also substantially reduced after pre-exposure (Figures 1D and 1E). Odor-evoked responses of the other two neurons in the same sensillum (cpB and cpC), which express members of the Or gene family, were not reduced by the treatment (Figure 1F). In fact, these neurons slightly increased in activity, as expected due to release of ephaptic inhibition between cosensillar ORNs (Su et al., 2012Su C.-Y. Menuz K. Reisert J. Carlson J.R. Non-synaptic inhibition between grouped neurons in an olfactory circuit.Nature. 2012; 492: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The inhibition of cpA is long-lasting and even after only a 60 s exposure requires between 12–24 hr to recover to control levels (Figure 1G). Most importantly, the response of cpA to foot odor is completely lost after butyryl chloride exposure (Figure 1H). This effect is specific to the cpA neuron of the palp. The low response of the cpB and cpC neurons to foot odor is not affected by exposure (Figure 1I). Likewise, the summed response of antennal neurons to foot odor or to a synthetic blend of human odorants, measured by electroantennograms (EAG), did not change with butyryl chloride treatment (Figure 1J). Antennal responses to individual skin odorants were also unaffected by butyryl chloride pretreatment (Figures S1C and S1D). While it is challenging to unambiguously identify specific antennal neuron classes, odorant responses of ORNs in individual sensilla can be compared before and after a puff of butyryl chloride. We find that odorant responses in many antennal trichoid sensilla are largely unchanged after butyryl chloride exposure (Figure S2). The ability to specifically shut down cpA responses to human skin odor provides an ideal way to test whether the neuron is involved in attraction using a behavior assay where we can track many aspects of navigation. A. aegypti females will take off, navigate upwind, and land on a dish of foot-odor-laden beads in a wind tunnel even in the absence of a CO2 plume (Lacey and Cardé, 2011Lacey E.S. Cardé R.T. Activation, orientation and landing of female Culex quinquefasciatus in response to carbon dioxide and odour from human feet: 3-D flight analysis in a wind tunnel.Med. Vet. Entomol. 2011; 25: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). In 5 min assays, substantially fewer mosquitoes landed on the odor-laden beads after pre-exposure to butyryl chloride (Figure 2B). Analysis of flight videos showed that the proportion of pre-exposed, “cpA-off” mosquitoes that took off from the release cage was greatly reduced (Figure 2C, Movies S1, S2, S3, and S4). Most sham-treated control mosquitoes took off relatively quickly toward foot odor, but the cpA-off mosquitoes that did take off did so with more delay (Figure S3). CpA-off mosquitoes that took off from the release cage showed no deficit in ability to fly (Figure S3 and Movie S4). Of these, less than half successfully navigated to the beads; the behavior of others resembled that of no-odor controls (Figures 2D and S3). Residual landing behavior observed in treated mosquitoes is likely mediated by short-range cues detected by ORNs other than cpA such as the Or- and IR-expressing neurons. In a separate control assay, pre-exposure to butyryl chloride did not impair mosquitoes’ ability or preference for resting at the top of a small cage, or the increase in this preference when a warm, moist stimulus was introduced above the cage (Figures S4A and S4B), making general physical or behavioral deficits unlikely. Taken together, these results show that the highly conserved CO2 receptor-containing neuron detects and participates in attraction toward human skin odor.Figure S3Wind Tunnel Behavior Assay, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Details of wind tunnel behavior assay.

In order to identify individual odorants from human skin that activate the cpA neuron, we first searched the literature for human-associated odorants other than CO2 that interact with this neuron. We found two reports of such odorants: cyclohexanone (Lu et al., 2007Lu T. Qiu Y.T. Wang G. Kwon J.Y. Rutzler M. Kwon H.-W. Pitts R.J. van Loon J.J.A. Takken W. Carlson J.R. Zwiebel L.J.

Neither study explored possible connections with skin odor, but we used them and other known nonhuman ligands of the CO2 neuron (Lu et al., 2007Lu T. Qiu Y.T. Wang G. Kwon J.Y. Rutzler M. Kwon H.-W.

Over 35% of these odorants activated the neuron robustly (>30 spikes s−1) in A. aegypti (Figure 3A). Although the anthropophilic A. aegypti and A. gambiae belong to divergent mosquito subfamilies, their CO2 receptor genes are highly conserved (Robertson and Kent, 2009Robertson H.M. Kent L.B. Evolution of the gene lineage encoding the carbon dioxide receptor in insects.J. Insect Sci. 2009; 9: 19PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we find that cpA responses to this panel of odorants are similar between these two species (Figure 3A), suggesting a conserved role in detecting host odor. CpA’s responses to these skin-derived odorants are dose-dependent (Figure 3B) and have similar temporal response profiles to CO2 (Figure 3C). In its natural environment, a mosquito at a distance from a potential host will encounter plumes containing mixtures of CO2 and skin odor at low concentrations. To test whether a mosquito would respond more sensitively to a combined stimulus, we measured cpA responses to binary mixtures of the two types of activators, CO2 and skin odorants. We find that cpA’s response to a mixture of CO2 and skin odorant is additive, the response to the combined stimulus being significantly greater than its response to either stimulus alone (Figure 3D). This contrasts with Or-expressing neurons, where mixtures of two activating odorants do not elicit stronger responses than the stronger activator by itself (Münch et al., 2013Münch D. Schmeichel B. Silbering A.F. Galizia C.G. Weaker ligands can dominate an odor blend due to syntopic interactions.Chem. Senses. 2013; 38: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The additive effect is consistent with previous behavioral observations that anthropophilic mosquitoes are more attracted to a combination of skin odor and CO2 than to either lure alone (Costantini et al., 1996Costantini C. Gibson G. Sagnon N. Della Torre A. Brady J. Coluzzi M. Mosquito responses to carbon dioxide in a west African Sudan savanna village.Med. Vet.

Carbon dioxide instantly sensitizes female yellow fever mosquitoes to human skin odours.J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Prior exposure to CO2 or skin odorants, however, does not change neural responses to following stimuli (Figure S4C). Since the CO2 receptor (Gr1, Gr2, and Gr3)-expressing neuron cpA is critical for attraction to both exhaled CO2 and skin odor, it is a high-priority target for manipulation of host-seeking behavior. In previous proof-of-principle experiments we identified cpA agonists, ultraprolonged agonists, and antagonists (Turner et al., 2011Turner S.L. Li N. Guda T. Githure J. Card"
https://openalex.org/W2036735052,"Cellular behavior is frequently influenced by the cell’s history, indicating that single cells may memorize past events. We report that budding yeast permanently escape pheromone-induced cell-cycle arrest when experiencing a deceptive mating attempt, i.e., not reaching their putative partner within reasonable time. This acquired behavior depends on super-assembly and inactivation of the G1/S inhibitor Whi3, which liberates the G1 cyclin Cln3 from translational inhibition. Super-assembly of Whi3 is a slow response to pheromone, driven by polyQ and polyN domains, counteracted by Hsp70, and stable over generations. Unlike prion aggregates, Whi3 super-assemblies are not inherited mitotically but segregate to the mother cell. We propose that such polyQ- and polyN-based elements, termed here mnemons, act as cellular memory devices to encode previous environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2021633769,"The ability to switch flexibly between aversive and neutral behaviors based on predictive cues relies on learning driven by surprise or errors in outcome prediction. Surprise can occur as absolute value of the error (unsigned error) or its direction (signed errors; positive when something unexpected is delivered and negative when something expected is omitted). Signed and unsigned errors coexist in the brain and were associated with different systems, but how they interact and form across large networks remains vague. We recorded simultaneously in the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of monkeys performing a reversal aversive-conditioning paradigm and quantified changes in interregional correlations when contingencies shift. We report that errors exist in different magnitudes and that they differentially develop at millisecond resolution. Our results support a model where unsigned errors first develop in the amygdala during successful learning and then propagate into the dACC, where signed errors develop and are distributed back to the amygdala."

How catalysis works within the viscous, water-excluding, two-dimensional membrane is unknown. We developed an inducible reconstitution system to interrogate rhomboid proteolysis quantitatively within the membrane in real time. Remarkably, rhomboid proteases displayed no physiological affinity for substrates (K(d) ~190 μM/0.1 mol%). Instead, ~10,000-fold differences in proteolytic efficiency with substrate mutants and diverse rhomboid proteases were reflected in k(cat) values alone. Analysis of gate-open mutant and solvent isotope effects revealed that substrate gating, not hydrolysis, is rate limiting. Ultimately, a single proteolytic event within the membrane normally takes minutes. Rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis is thus a slow, kinetically controlled reaction not driven by transmembrane protein-protein affinity. These properties are unlike those of other studied proteases or membrane proteins but are strikingly reminiscent of one subset of DNA-repair enzymes, raising important mechanistic and drug-design implications."
https://openalex.org/W2138455845,"Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is the main phospholipid component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and is usually noted as a marker of several human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer and diabetes. Some studies suggest that oxLDL modulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. However, effector molecules that are present in oxLDL particles and can trigger TLR signaling are not yet clear. LPC was previously described as an attenuator of sepsis and as an immune suppressor. In the present study, we have evaluated the role of LPC as a dual modulator of the TLR-mediated signaling pathway.HEK 293A cells were transfected with TLR expression constructs and stimulated with LPC molecules with different fatty acid chain lengths and saturation levels. All LPC molecules activated both TLR4 and TLR2-1 signaling, as evaluated by NF-қB activation and IL-8 production. These data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of NF-қB translocation in isolated nuclei of peritoneal murine macrophages. However, LPC counteracted the TLR4 signaling induced by LPS. In this case, NF-қB translocation, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were blocked. Moreover, LPC activated the MAP Kinases p38 and JNK, but not ERK, in murine macrophages. Interestingly, LPC blocked LPS-induced ERK activation in peritoneal macrophages but not in TLR-transfected cells.The above results indicate that LPC is a dual-activity ligand molecule. It is able to trigger a classical proinflammatory phenotype by activating TLR4- and TLR2-1-mediated signaling. However, in the presence of classical TLR ligands, LPC counteracts some of the TLR-mediated intracellular responses, ultimately inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype; LPC may thus play a role in the regulation of cell immune responses and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1987692937,"Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation are governed by a broad-ranging regulatory network. Although the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved have been investigated extensively, posttranscriptional regulation is still poorly understood. Here we describe a critical role of the THO complex in ESC self-renewal and differentiation. We show that THO preferentially interacts with pluripotency gene transcripts through Thoc5 and is required for self-renewal at least in part by regulating their export and expression. During differentiation, THO loses its interaction with those transcripts due to reduced Thoc5 expression, leading to decreased expression of pluripotency proteins that facilitates exit from self-renewal. THO is also important for the establishment of pluripotency, because its depletion inhibits somatic cell reprogramming and blastocyst development. Together, our data indicate that THO regulates pluripotency gene mRNA export to control ESC self-renewal and differentiation, and therefore uncover a role for this aspect of posttranscriptional regulation in stem cell fate specification."

Here, we show that modulation of circadian glucocorticoid oscillation by enhancing its amplitude leads to anxiolytic-like behavior. We observed that mice with adrenal subcapsular cell hyperplasia (SCH), a common histological change in the adrenals, are less anxious than mice without SCH. This behavioral change was found to be dependent on the higher amplitude of glucocorticoid oscillation, although the total glucocorticoid secretion is not increased in these mice. Genetic and pharmacologic experiments demonstrated that intermediate opioid peptides secreted from SCH activate CXCR7, a β-arrestin-biased G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), to augment circadian oscillation of glucocorticoid levels in a paracrine manner. Furthermore, recapitulating this paracrine axis by subcutaneous administration of a synthetic CXCR7 ligand is sufficient to induce anxiolytic-like behavior. Adrenocortical β-arrestin-biased GPCR signaling is a potential target for modulating circadian glucocorticoid oscillation and emotional behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2016460345,"When stimuli are presented over headphones, they are typically perceived as internalized; i.e., they appear to emanate from inside the head. Sounds presented in the free-field tend to be externalized, i.e., perceived to be emanating from a source in the world. This phenomenon is frequently attributed to reverberation and to the spectral characteristics of the sounds: those sounds whose spectrum and reverberation matches that of free-field signals arriving at the ear canal tend to be more frequently externalized. Another factor, however, is that the virtual location of signals presented over headphones moves in perfect concert with any movements of the head, whereas the location of free-field signals moves in opposition to head movements. The effects of head movement have not been systematically disentangled from reverberation and/or spectral cues, so we measured the degree to which movements contribute to externalization.We performed two experiments: 1) Using motion tracking and free-field loudspeaker presentation, we presented signals that moved in their spatial location to match listeners' head movements. 2) Using motion tracking and binaural room impulse responses, we presented filtered signals over headphones that appeared to remain static relative to the world. The results from experiment 1 showed that free-field signals from the front that move with the head are less likely to be externalized (23%) than those that remain fixed (63%). Experiment 2 showed that virtual signals whose position was fixed relative to the world are more likely to be externalized (65%) than those fixed relative to the head (20%), regardless of the fidelity of the individual impulse responses.Head movements play a significant role in the externalization of sound sources. These findings imply tight integration between binaural cues and self motion cues and underscore the importance of self motion for spatial auditory perception."

LMD requires the function of pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) in four s-LNv neurons and its receptor PDFR in two LNd neurons per hemisphere, as well as the function of neuropeptide F (NPF) in two neurons within the sexually dimorphic LNd region and its receptor NPFR1 in four s-LNv neurons per hemisphere.

In contrast, rod bipolar cells, which utilize the same glutamate receptor to contact rods, are unaffected by dark rearing. Underlying the physiological changes, we find the localization of metabotropic glutamate receptors within cone bipolar, but not rod bipolar, cell dendrites is a light-dependent process. Furthermore, although cone bipolar cells share common cone partners, each bipolar cell type that we examined depends differentially on sensory input to achieve mature connectivity. Thus, visual experience differentially affects maturation of rod versus cone pathways and of cell types within the cone pathway."

Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in particular correlate with protein elimination, which positively affects their transcription. We show that the nuclear receptor corepressor NCoR1 is a key target of proteolysis and physically interacts with the transcription factor CREB. Proteasome inhibition stabilizes NCoR1 in a site-specific manner and restrains mitochondrial activity by repressing CREB-sensitive genes.

Patients with MDD or panic disorder were not found to differ significantly from healthy controls in the pattern of methylation of the SLC6a2 gene promotor. While significant correlations between methylation levels at some CpG sites and physiological measures were identified, overall the variation in DNA methylation between patients was small, and the significance of this variation remains equivocal. No significant changes in SLC6a2 promoter methylation were observed in response to antidepressant treatment. Further in-depth analysis of alternative mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the SLC6a2 gene in human health and disease would be of value."

Vaccinated VAD pigs had higher diarrhea severity scores compared to vaccinated VAS pigs, which coincided with lower serum IgA HRV antibody titers and significantly lower intestinal IgA antibody secreting cells post-challenge in the former groups suggesting lower anamnestic responses. A trend for higher serum HRV IgG antibodies was observed in VAD vs VAS vaccinated groups post-challenge. The vaccinated VAD (non-vitamin A supplemented) pigs had significantly higher serum IL12 (PID2) and IFNγ (PID6) compared to vaccinated VAS groups suggesting higher Th1 responses in VAD conditions. Furthermore, regulatory T-cell responses were compromised in VAD pigs. Supplemental vitamin A in VAD pigs did not fully restore the dysregulated immune responses to AttHRV vaccine or moderate virulent HRV diarrhea. Our findings suggest that that VAD in children in developing countries may partially contribute to more severe rotavirus infection and lower HRV vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2020504704,"Ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate mRNAs into proteins. The synthesis of ribosomes is therefore a fundamental cellular process and consists in the ordered assembly of 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) into a small 40S and a large 60S ribosomal subunit that form the translating 80S ribosomes. Most of our knowledge concerning this dynamic multi-step process comes from studies with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which have shown that assembly and maturation of pre-ribosomal particles, as they travel from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, relies on a multitude (>200) of biogenesis factors. Amongst these are many energy-consuming enzymes, including 19 ATP-dependent RNA helicases and three AAA-ATPases. We have previously shown that the AAA-ATPase Rix7 promotes the release of the essential biogenesis factor Nsa1 from late nucleolar pre-60S particles. Here we show that mutant alleles of genes encoding the DEAD-box RNA helicase Mak5, the C/D-box snoRNP component Nop1 and the rRNA-binding protein Nop4 bypass the requirement for Nsa1. Interestingly, dominant-negative alleles of RIX7 retain their phenotype in the absence of Nsa1, suggesting that Rix7 may have additional nuclear substrates besides Nsa1. Mak5 is associated with the Nsa1 pre-60S particle and synthetic lethal screens with mak5 alleles identified the r-protein Rpl14 and the 60S biogenesis factors Ebp2, Nop16 and Rpf1, which are genetically linked amongst each other. We propose that these 'Mak5 cluster' factors orchestrate the structural arrangement of a eukaryote-specific 60S subunit surface composed of Rpl6, Rpl14 and Rpl16 and rRNA expansion segments ES7L and ES39L. Finally, over-expression of Rix7 negatively affects growth of mak5 and ebp2 mutant cells both in the absence and presence of Nsa1, suggesting that Rix7, at least when excessively abundant, may act on structurally defective pre-60S subunits and may subject these to degradation."

Examination of regulatory frameworks across five countries suggests that balancing the demands of research with clinical freedom has created structural weaknesses that are being exploited. Autologous adult stem cells (ASCs) are being administered by physicians for indications that have not been demonstrated as safe and effective in formal clinical trials. Examination of regulatory frameworks across five countries suggests that balancing the demands of research with clinical freedom has created structural weaknesses that are being exploited. Although well-supported clinical applications of stem cells remain relatively few in number (Daley, 2012Daley G.Q. Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the use of autologous adult stem cells (ASCs) in advance of evidence from clinical trials has become increasingly prevalent (Bianco, 2013Bianco P. Nature. 2013; 499: 255Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Once mostly limited to countries lacking the regulatory infrastructure to monitor and control the claims made by healthcare professionals and institutions operating within their borders (Kiatpongsan and Sipp, 2008Kiatpongsan S. Sipp D. Nature Reports Stem Cells. 2008; (Published online December 3, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/stemcells.2008.151Crossref Google Scholar), these practices have also emerged in places such as the US, Australia, and Japan (Lysaght et al., 2013Lysaght T. Kerridge I. Sipp D. Porter G. Capps B.J. Global bionetworks and challenges in regulating autologous adult stem cells.Am. J. Med. 2013; 126: 941-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The global proliferation of these practices raises serious concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable patient populations, the regulation of novel cell-based therapeutics, and the governance of medical professionals. However, these practices appear less prevalent in some countries with similar standards in healthcare, scientific investment, and economic structure to the US, Australia, and Japan—Singapore and the UK are examples. The disparity suggests that there may be differences in regulatory systems that oversee clinical uses of autologous ASCs in these countries that may be encouraging or discouraging their use outside the context of clinical trials. To investigate this assertion, we compared the regulatory regimes of the US, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and the UK (as a Member State of the European Union) with the aim of identifying similarities and differences in how autologous ASCs are regulated and governed within clinical contexts. We found that while there are many technical differences in language and implementation, broad similarities in the general regulatory approach suggest that there is no one explanation as to why these practices are more prevalent in some countries with apparently well-developed regulatory frameworks. All five countries examined have generally supportive environments for basic scientific research using stem cells, with some differences for lines derived from human embryos (Ishii et al., 2013Ishii T. Pera R.A. Greely H.T. Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More importantly, they have all adopted risk-based approaches that regulate the use of stem cells in clinical research as either biological drug products or as medical procedures. In all of these countries, cell and tissue-based products (CTPs) that are regulated as drugs and/or biologics fall within the jurisdiction of a centralized government agency that controls the marketing of drugs, medical devices, and biologics within each jurisdiction (listed in Table 1 along with relevant laws and regulations). Such products are controlled through mandated premarket testing for safety and efficacy in specified indications, which usually involves a sponsor obtaining an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation and conducting a series of registered multiphase (I–III) clinical trials. Subsequent market authorization may include additional requirements for postmarket surveillance.Table 1Agencies that Regulate Medicinal Drug ProductsJurisdictionRegulatory AgencyJurisdictional Laws and RegulationsUnited StatesFood and Drug Administration (FDA)Public Health Services Act (42 USC §§262, 264, 271); Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR §1271)JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)Medical Practitioners Law, Law No. 201 of 1948; Practice Notice: Conducting Regenerative and Cellular Medicine Using Autologous Cells and Tissues at Medical Institutions (2010); Regenerative Medicine Law (draft)Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA)Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, Law No. 145 of 1960, as amendedAustraliaTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)Therapeutic Goods Act (1989) and Regulations (1990) (Cth); Australian Regulatory Guidelines for BiologicalsSingaporeMinistry of Health (MOH)Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (1980, revised 1999)Health Sciences Authority (HSA)Medicines Act (1975, revised 1985); Medicines (Clinical Trials) Regulations (1978, revised 2000); Health Products Act (2007)United KingdomMedicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)The Medicines Act (1968); Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916)European Medicines Agency (EMA)Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation (EC No 1394/2007) and Directive (2001/83/EC) Open table in a new tab Yet, these requirements only apply to products that are assessed as having higher than minimal risks, the definition of which varies across jurisdictions. Each country has exemptions that exclude from regulation autologous cells that have not been manipulated extensively or combined with other articles, are intended for homologous use in functionally compatible tissues, and/or are harvested and transplanted as part of the same surgical procedure. For example, hematopoietic stem cell transplants using autologous grafts for the reconstitution of bone marrow function are not regulated as biological drugs in any of these jurisdictions. Details about the level of manipulation and intended use of the cells vary across jurisdictions, and the definitions used to described these processes are often ambiguous or undefined, but there is a general consensus that these products do not pose serious safety problems and are thus subject to relatively limited regulatory oversight. However, what constitutes “homologous use” is not clearly defined in any of the regulations listed in Table 1, and examples of processes that constitute “nonsubstantial” or “minimal” manipulation, where stated, are not exhaustive and differ from country to country. Variations may therefore arise in which cells are classified as “minimal risk” and which are categorized as requiring greater regulation in different countries. Even for highly manipulated products that are regulated as drugs, clinical trial sponsors and registered practitioners may apply to special programs that speed the approvals process or provide patients in exceptional circumstances with access to medicinal products that lack the evidence necessary for market licensing. These programs differ in name and some of the conditions vary across jurisdictions. For example, so-called “compassionate use” or “special access” provisions, such as the Expanded Access Program in the US, provide patients with access to experimental agents that are the subject of an active IND, and personal importation policies such as the Named Patients Access program in Japan allow, in exceptional cases, importation for individual use of drugs that have been approved in an another country. In contrast, no such restrictions apply for the Special Access Scheme in Australia or the Specials Scheme and the Hospital Exemption Scheme in the UK. Singapore does not have a formal access program but, as indicated below, registered practitioners operating in licensed hospitals may, at least in theory, offer unlicensed drugs to patients under their care. The use of CTPs that are excluded from regulation as drugs (i.e., minimally manipulated autologous cells intended for homologous use), along with registered products that are prescribed off-license or off-label, are regulated as medical practice, rather than medicinal products. In all five countries, the practice of medicine is not overseen by a central regulatory agency, but is regulated separately under complex frameworks of medical licensing boards, health departments and ministries, professional accreditation bodies, third party payers, and negligence laws (Taylor, 2010Taylor P.L. Overseeing innovative therapy without mistaking it for research: a function-based model based on old truths, new capacities, and lessons from stem cells.J. Law Med. Ethics. 2010; 38: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, while the laws around advertising medicines vary in each country, practitioners may lawfully prescribe CTPs for indications that have not received premarket approval within the discretion of their professional judgment. Where an intervention falls outside the accepted standard of care, practitioners generally need adequate justification and may require special permission from an institutions’ clinical practice or governance board. If the intervention is prescribed as part of a research protocol, then they may also need approval from an institutional review board (IRB). However, no permission or oversight is required from the authorities that regulate the marketing of the medicinal drugs in any of these jurisdictions. In addition, four of the five countries have laws that explicitly allow the manufacture of CTPs under the supervision of registered practitioners. In compliance with Article 3(7) of the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Directive (2001/83/EC) of the EU, the UK excludes from regulation any CTP that is “prepared on a nonroutine basis” for use in a hospital under “the exclusive responsibility of a medical practitioner […] for an individual patient.” This “hospital use exemption” applies to other EU Member States, but has been implemented differently according to local interpretations of key terms, such as “nonroutine,” leading to the exemption being applied more liberally in some countries (Mahalatchimy et al., 2012Mahalatchimy A. Rial-Sebbag E. Tournay V. Faulkner A. The legal landscape for advanced therapies: material and institutional implementation of European Union rules in France and the United Kingdom.J. Law Soc. 2012; 39: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The European Commission is thus currently considering the scope and application of the directive (European Commission, 2013). The UK has also enabled the Specials Scheme under the Medicines Act (1968) and the Human Medicines Regulations (2012), which provides exceptions for medicinal products, including CTPs, that are manufactured under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner, or by external vendors under a “specials” license that is obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Singapore has similar exemptions in the Medicines Act (1975, revised 1985) for the preparation of medicinal products by or under the supervision of registered practitioners operating within hospitals licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (1980, revised 1999). In Australia, autologous cells that are manufactured and administered by a registered practitioner (or under their supervision) for a patient under their care are excluded from regulation under the Therapeutic Goods Act (1989) in the Therapeutic Goods (Excluded Goods) Order No. 1 of 2011. In Japan, drugs that are administered within the scope of a “physician’s discretion” in medical practice fall under the Medical Practitioners Law (1948) and are not regulated by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency. Practitioners using autologous ASCs need to observe the Practice Notice: Conducting Regenerative and Cellular Medicine Using Autologous Cells and Tissue in Medical Institutions (2010), but this only requires approval from an internal review board. A new law is currently being proposed that will clarify the extent of freedom licensed physicians have to prescribe unlicensed CTPs within their “physician’s discretion.” If enacted, medical institutions that offer these products will be required to register with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. However, following a risk-based approach, the law will only require full ministerial approval for pluripotent stem cells while IRB approval will suffice for somatic stem-cell-based products. In these contexts, the manufacture of CTPs must generally comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (or Good Tissue Practice if not classified as drugs), but their use is otherwise regulated as clinical practice, not research. The exception is the US, where the manufacturing of biological drugs is controlled solely by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has no such exemptions for medical practitioners to make and supply their own drugs. However, the FDA’s jurisdiction only applies to products, or ingredients that make up those products, that are shipped across state borders; the question of whether this authority extends to products made with ingredients sourced and delivered entirely within state borders, but which compete with products sold in other states, remains unresolved (Koustas and Fleder, 2011Koustas, W.T., and Fleder, J.R. (2011). FDA Continues Efforts to Expand Power Over Intrastate Commerce (FDA Law Blog) http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2011/10/fda-continues-efforts-to-expand-power-over-intrastate-commerce.html.Google Scholar). Regulation of these products presumably falls under the jurisdiction of the medical boards and health departments in each American state. Despite the many technical differences in implementation and nomenclature, the general approach in all five countries is to provide a clear evidence-based pathway for CTPs that are regulated as medicinal drugs while allowing patients to access low-risk interventions with autologous ASCs under the supervision of their physician. This approach is designed to provide protections for research subjects while maintaining clinical autonomy for medical professionals and their patients. To support these goals, all five jurisdictions have implemented risk-based approaches to the regulation of CTPs, giving regulators a degree of flexibility in determining the level of oversight and standards of evidence that should apply before these products are introduced onto the market. However, as their use in clinical practice is largely unregulated, the approach also creates structural weaknesses that may be exploited by unscrupulous operators. A key challenge that regulators face in addressing these weaknesses is ensuring that patients have the freedom to access novel interventions while accommodating the inherent uncertainties of clinical research. While uncertainty is a key characteristic of science—and regulations, ethical guidelines, and governance processes can be designed to minimize harms that may arise from it—regulating clinical decisions in the face of such uncertainty is often more difficult. Across all five jurisdictions, regulators and policymakers are generally reluctant to interfere in decisions that many would argue should remain within the doctor-patient relationship. Yet, while historically this has been politically and culturally acceptable, few would agree that physicians should be permitted carte blanche authority in their practice of medicine, unchecked by accountability to their patients or to the social systems that ultimately provide their healthcare. Balancing professional and patient autonomy with the need to provide therapies that are evidence-based, yield a meaningful benefit, and are affordable to the community may, therefore, create a potentially intractable problem for regulators and policy-makers. Regulators do have power to control unethical and illicit clinical practices, however, and a number of mechanisms may be employed to control the use of autologous ASCs outside clinical trials without infringing on clinical freedoms or stifling innovation in clinical care. Some countries have already activated these mechanisms by sanctioning offending practitioners. In 2010, the British General Medical Council deregistered Dr. Robert Trossel for unjustifiably administering an allogeneic cellular preparation (also found to contain bovine neural cells) to patients affected by multiple sclerosis at a clinic in Rotterdam (General Medical Council, 2010). The Singapore Medical Council has previously sanctioned four of its practitioners for offering various stem cell products without evidence of efficacy, but has since withdrawn two following an appeal (Low Chia Ling v Singapore Medical Council, 2012; Singapore Medical Council, 2009, 2010). Florida’s Board of Medicine has also revoked the license of Dr. Zannos Grekos following the death of two patients after or during procedures intended for the delivery of autologous stem cell products, a decision which is now under appeal (Department of Health v Zannos Grekos, 2013). These enforcement actions may not have deterred physicians from routinely offering unproven interventions with stem cells outside clinical trials, at least not the US, although they are unlikely to have harmed innovative practice in any of these countries. While these actions are commendable, additional measures clearly need to be taken over and above the sanctioning and deregistration of individual practitioners. For instance, better guidance is needed to clarify the circumstances in which autologous ASCs may be administered to patients before sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy has been established in clinical trials. The Texas Medical Board, 2012Texas Medical Board (2012). Texas Administrative Code, Title 22, Part 9.Google Scholar has introduced rules on the investigational use of human stem cells that appear to provide an alternative to the IND pathway by allowing physicians to seek IRB approval to prescribe agents not approved by the FDA in their practice. These guidelines have been the subject of extensive criticism, principally because they appear to substitute formal regulatory oversight with IRB approval (Levine, 2012Levine A.D. Improving oversight of innovative medical interventions in Texas, USA.Regen. Med. 2012; 7: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), even though US federal manufacturing standards supersede state laws. The Practice Notice in Japan also attempts to provide guidance for physicians who use autologous cells in their practice by encouraging ethics approval. Where regulators can take greater action is to enforce the existing laws that regulate the advertising of medicinal products. All five countries have tort laws in place for medical negligence and consumer protection legislation that restrict false advertising and the provision of misleading information in medical practice. Practitioners, healthcare providers, and manufacturers who create websites and advertise the routine use of interventions with autologous ASCs that have not been established as an accepted standard of care, or provide misleading information about the effectiveness of such interventions, should be prosecuted under the relevant laws. These laws can be activated without infringing on the autonomy of patients or practitioners who use innovative biomedicines responsibly and in the best interests of those under their care. Given our comparative analysis of regulatory frameworks in the five countries studied, it remains unclear why autologous ASCs are being prescribed outside clinical trials more often in Australia, Japan, and the US than in Singapore and the UK. Although we found technical differences in how key terms are defined within the regulations, as well as ambiguities that could be interpreted differently across jurisdictions, these do not sufficiently account for why the use of autologous ASCs has proliferated in some countries and not others. All of these countries clearly regulate clinical practice with an emphasis on evidence-based medicine, while allowing clinicians to develop innovative care in a limited, responsible manner and allowing patients to access CTPs that lack the level of evidence necessary for market authorization or reimbursement from public and private health insurers. While this approach may support research and, in some cases, work in the interests of patient autonomy and access to care, it also creates structural weaknesses that may be exploited by commercial interests who either willfully misinterpret ambiguous definitions in the regulation of drug research or ignore them altogether. In discouraging the exploitation of vulnerable patient populations while still ensuring scientific and clinical innovation, relevant authorities should work together in standardizing the terminology and scientific processes used to define and classify CTPs as minimal risk and exclude them from regulation. The difficulties seen in harmonizing regulations across EU countries, however, suggest that standardization across diverse jurisdictions will be even more challenging, as key terms may still be interpreted and acted upon differently according to national interests and the local needs of patients. Scientific definitions and evaluations of risk are also contestable. Thus, the solution is unlikely to come from simply clarifying and standardizing nomenclature, although this could help regulators improve the transparency of drug designations. In our opinion, the structural weaknesses described above manifest in the separation of research regulation from clinical governance, and solutions must address how novel therapeutics are introduced into the practice of medicine. Safety alone is not sufficient to justify routine clinical use of ASCs as even low risk products should show compelling evidence of efficacy before they are introduced into healthcare systems and accepted as the standard of care. While we can activate and enforce existing consumer protection laws and prohibitions on false and misleading advertising in medical practice, these are post hoc mechanisms where the burden is placed on adequately resourced patients and authorities to demonstrate evidence of wrongdoing, and in taking such action, plaintiffs may potentially be exposed to countersuits for libel. Medical authorities also need to take a more proactive role in sanctioning practitioners whose conduct falls outside accepted professional standards and provide better guidance for those who want to prescribe innovative biomedicines responsibly before evidence of efficacy has been established in clinical trials. However, the impetus of these actions remains with the medical profession, and the lack of sanctions against practitioners who continue to prescribe autologous ASCs without evidence of their efficacy suggests that the self-regulatory model of clinical governance is becoming outdated. New models are needed to oversee the introduction of novel CTPs into clinical contexts in ways that acknowledge and allow for scientific uncertainties while enabling patient access to novel treatments and ensuring that rigorous and responsible research is unimpeded by commercial interests.

Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify whether SSRI therapy can induce hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia. Fifty-five patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in this study. Serum prolactin and macroprolactin levels were measured at a single time point (i.e., in a cross-sectional design). All patients had received SSRI monotherapy (escitalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline) for a mean of 14.75 months. Their mean prolactin level was 15.26 ng/ml. The prevalence of patients with hyperprolactinemia was 10.9% for 6/55, while that of patients with macroprolactinemia was 3.6% for 2/55. The mean prolactin levels were 51.36 and 10.84 ng/ml among those with hyperprolactinemia and a normal prolactin level, respectively. The prolactin level and prevalence of hyperprolactinemia did not differ significantly within each SSRI group. Correlation analysis revealed that there was no correlation between the dosage of each SSRI and prolactin level. These findings suggest that SSRI therapy can induce hyperprolactinemia in patients with MDD. Clinicians should measure and monitor serum prolactin levels, even when both SSRIs and antipsychotics are administered."

As the mitochondrial genome is associated with the process of aging in many species and bivalves are known to possess a peculiar mechanism of mitochondrial genome inheritance including doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI), we aimed to assess the genomic variability of the A. islandica mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of A. islandica specimens from three different sites in the Western Palaearctic (Iceland, North Sea, Baltic Sea). We found the A. islandica mtDNA to fall within the normal size range (18 kb) and exhibit similar coding capacity as other animal mtDNAs. The concatenated protein sequences of all currently known Veneroidea mtDNAs were used to robustly place A. islandica in a phylogenetic framework. Analysis of the observed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns on further specimen revealed two prevailing haplotypes. Populations in the Baltic and the North Sea are very homogenous, whereas the Icelandic population, from which exceptionally old individuals have been collected, is the most diverse one. Homogeneity in Baltic and North Sea populations point to either stronger environmental constraints or more recent colonization of the habitat. Our analysis lays the foundation for further studies on A. islandica population structures, age research with this organism, and for phylogenetic studies.

https://openalex.org/W1993346386,"Francisella tularensis is an infectious, gram-negative, intracellular microorganism, and the cause of tularemia. Invasion of host cells by intracellular pathogens like Francisella is initiated by their interaction with different host cell membrane receptors and the rapid phosphorylation of different downstream signaling molecules. PI3K and Syk have been shown to be involved in F. tularensis host cell entry, and both of these signaling molecules are associated with the master regulator serine/threonine kinase mTOR; yet the involvement of mTOR in F. tularensis invasion of host cells has not been assessed. Here, we report that infection of macrophages with F. tularensis triggers the phosphorylation of mTOR downstream effector molecules, and that signaling via TLR2 is necessary for these events. Inhibition of mTOR or of PI3K, ERK, or p38, but not Akt signaling, downregulates the levels of phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets, and significantly reduces the number of F. tularensis cells invading macrophages. Moreover, while phosphorylation of mTOR downstream effectors occurs via the PI3K pathway, it also involves PLCγ1 and Ca2+ signaling. Furthermore, abrogation of PLC or Ca2+ signaling revealed their important role in the ability of F. tularensis to invade host cells. Together, these findings suggest that F. tularensis invasion of primary macrophages utilize a myriad of host signaling pathways to ensure effective cell entry."
https://openalex.org/W2145664044,"Growing evidence demonstrates that various large DNA viruses could encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate host and viral genes to achieve immune evasion. In this study, we report that miR-homoHSV, an miRNA encoded by Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), can attenuate SGIV-induced cell death. Mechanistically, SGIV miR-homoHSV targets SGIV ORF136R, a viral gene that encodes the pro-apoptotic lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α (LITAF)-like factor. miR-homoHSV suppressed exogenous and endogenous SGIV LITAF expression, and thus inhibited SGIV LITAF-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-homoHSV expression was able to attenuate cell death induced by viral infection, presumably facilitating viral replication through the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene SGIV LITAF. Together, our data suggest miR-homoHSV may serve as a feedback regulator of cell death during viral infection. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of SGIV replication and pathogenesis."

We used linear mixed effects models to assess the associations of HRV indices with indoor PM2.5 exposures and coffee consumption.We observed the inverse association between indoor PM2.5 exposures and HRV indices, with a decrease in all HRV indices with increased indoor PM2.5 exposures. However, the decrease was most pronounced during nighttime, where a 1 interquartile range (IQR) increase in indoor PM2.5 at 4-hr time-weighted moving average was associated with a change of -4.78% 5-min standard deviation (SD) of normal-to-normal intervals for 5-min segment (SDNN) and -3.23% 5-min square root of the mean squared differences of successive intervals for 5-min segment (r-MSSD).

https://openalex.org/W2067646046,"Eukaryotic organisms employ a variety of mechanisms during meiosis to assess and ensure the quality of their gametes. Defects or delays in successful meiotic recombination activate conserved mechanisms to delay the meiotic divisions, but many multicellular eukaryotes also induce cell death programs to eliminate gametes deemed to have failed during meiosis. It is generally thought that yeasts lack such mechanisms. Here, we show that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, defects in meiotic recombination lead to the activation of a checkpoint that is linked to ascus wall endolysis – the process by which spores are released in response to nutritional cues for subsequent germination. Defects in meiotic recombination are sensed as unrepaired DNA damage through the canonical ATM and ATR DNA damage response kinases, and this information is communicated to the machinery that stimulates ascus wall breakdown. Viability of spores that undergo endolysis spontaneously is significantly higher than that seen upon chemical endolysis, demonstrating that this checkpoint contributes to a selective mechanism for the germination of high quality progeny. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of a checkpoint linking germination to meiosis and suggest that analysis solely based on artificial, enzymatic endolysis bypasses an important quality control mechanism in this organism and potentially other ascomycota, which are models widely used to study meiosis."

After parthenogenetic activation (PA) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), the cleavage rate of reconstructed oocytes in the IVF group (CR-IVF group, 36.4 ± 3.2%) and PA group (CR-PA group, 50.8 ± 4.2%) were significantly lower than that of control groups in which normal MII oocytes were subjected to IVF (MII-IVF group, 75.8 ± 1.5%) and PA (MII-PA group, 86.9 ± 3.7%). Unfertilized rates was significantly higher in the CR-IVF group (48.6 ± 3.3%) than in the MII-IVF group (13.1 ± 3.4%). The blastocyst formation rate was 8.3 ± 1.9% in the CR-PA group, whereas no blastocyst formation was observed in the CR-IVF group. To produce tetraploid parthenogenetic embryos, intact MII stage oocytes injected with PB1chromosomes were electrically stimulated, treated with 7.5 μg/mL cytochalasin B for 3 h (MII oocyte + PB1 + CB group), and then cultured without cytochalasin B. The average cleavage rate of reconstructed oocytes was 72.5% (48 of 66), and the blastocyst formation rate was 18.7% (9 of 48). Chromosome analysis showed similar proportions of haploid and diploid cells in the control (normal MII oocytes) and CR groups after PA; overall, 23.6% of blastocysts were tetraploid in the MII oocyte + PB1 + CB group. These results demonstrate that chromosomes in PB1 can participate in normal pre-implantation embryonic development when injected into enucleated MII stage oocytes, and that tetraploid PA blastocysts are produced (although at a low proportion) when PB1 chromosomes are injected into intact MII stage oocytes."

If the ability to regenerate complex tissues such as the heart or the limb has evolved once, why should it not be retained throughout evolutionary time? At a fundamental level, we assume that developmental and regenerative mechanisms are indeed universal.

They approach the question of whether proliferative cells that provide the raw material for regeneration arise from a population of resident stem cells or from dedifferentiation of mature cells. Significant advances have been made in understanding the cellular strategies used during reparative organ regeneration, which occurs with ease in salamanders such as axolotls and newts. Following amputation of the limb, for example, the epidermis rapidly heals the wound and underlying mesodermal cells accumulate to form a structure known as the blastema, which resembles a limb bud. The blastema proliferates and replaces the missing tissue by redifferentiation. The key to this type of reparative regeneration is the generation of proliferating mesodermal cells, which arise by a process of dedifferentiation whereby fully differentiated cells shed their characteristic genetic program of, for example, myosin synthesis or collagen synthesis and return to an undifferentiated, stem-cell-like state and begin to proliferate. This process is readily observable histologically and in muscle was well established by earlier electron microscopic observations (Hay, 1959Hay E.D. Dev. Biol. 1959; 1: 555-585Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) where multinucleate myofibers could be seen fragmenting into single cells and entering the blastema. The dedifferentiation, fragmentation, and proliferation of newt muscle fibers is also readily seen in vitro (Tanaka et al., 1999Tanaka E.M. Drechsel D.N. Brockes J.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 792-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and when fluorescently labeled newt myotubes are implanted into a blastema their progeny can be seen in regenerated tissues, demonstrating the cell-intrinsic ability of such processes (Lo et al., 1993Lo D.C. Allen F. Brockes J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). An entirely different strategy for reparative regeneration is employed by invertebrates such as planarians who maintain a large population of stem cells known as neoblasts throughout their bodies. These cells migrate to the site of damage and replace the lost tissues. Since the discovery of reservoirs of stem cells throughout the tissues of the mammalian body, it has been assumed that mammalian reparative regeneration would be promoted by the “multiply your stem cells” route (like planarians) rather than the “dedifferentiate, proliferate, redifferentiate” route (like axolotls and newts). The existence of these stem cell pools means that there is no need to be able to dedifferentiate since regeneration could presumably rely solely on stem cells. But what of stem cells in axolotls and newts? Who needs stem cells if you can dedifferentiate? Recent studies in salamanders clearly demonstrated the presence of stem cells in the ependymal lining of the brain (Maden et al., 2013Maden M. Manwell L.A. Ormerod B.K. Neural Dev. 2013; 8: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Berg et al., 2010Berg D.A. Kirkham M. Beljajeva A. Knapp D. Habermann B. Ryge J. Tanaka E.M. Simon A. Development. 2010; 137: 4127-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or Pax7+ satellite cells in muscle (Morrison et al., 2006Morrison J.I. Lööf S. He P. Simon A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but the expectation from such studies was that regenerated muscle would arise by dedifferentiation, fragmentation, and proliferation of myotubes and that satellite cells would play only a minor role. The paper by Sandoval-Guzmán et al. now explains the relevance of Pax7+ satellite cells to muscle regeneration during the regeneration of the limb and comes to a very surprising conclusion about species differences underlying regenerative mechanisms. The authors genetically labeled muscle fibers through electroporation of several vectors into the limb, including a muscle-specific Cre, which generated fluorescently labeled myonuclei while leaving the Pax7+ satellite cells, which reside outside the basement membrane of the fiber, unlabeled. When newts were used for experiments and limbs were amputated through the upper arm, fluorescently labeled nuclei could be seen along the entire length of the regenerated muscle, indicating that labeled mature cells had contributed to regenerating the new muscle through a dedifferentiation process. In striking contrast, when the same experiment was done in the axolotl, no labeled nuclei were seen in the regenerated muscle, indicating that instead new muscle fibers had arisen from unlabeled Pax7+ satellite cells. The second paper, by Tata et al., concerns the epithelium of the mouse trachea, which contains several cell types including secretory cells, ciliated cells, neuroendocrine cells, and basal stem cells. This tracheal epithelium can readily regenerate after acute injury in which case proliferation of the stem cells is enhanced and redifferentiation replaces missing secretory and ciliated cells (Rock et al., 2009Rock J.R. Onaitis M.W. Rawlins E.L. Lu Y. Clark C.P. Xue Y. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12771-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Since there is a defined stem cell population, one would not expect to observe newt-like dedifferentiation in this system. However, when CK5-expressing basal stem cells are genetically ablated following inhalation delivery of doxyclycine, a 2-fold increase in the proliferation of secretory cells (marked by SCGB1A1) is observed. Under these circumstances, Tata et al. posed the question of whether one secretory cell could proliferate and directly make another secretory cell or whether dedifferentiation was taking place. When secretory cells were lineage labeled with YFP and the basal stem cells were ablated, Tata et al. observed some cells that were YFP labeled and morphologically indistinguishable from basal stem cells and that expressed several basal cell markers (including CK5), thus showing that they had dedifferentiated back to stem cells before generating new secretory and ciliated cells. In vitro experiments using spheres generated from pure secretory or basal cells showed the same result—spheres clonally derived from secretory cells contained a proportion of cells that expressed the CK5 stem cell marker. When clonally derived spheres from the two different cell types, secretory or basal, were cultured together in the same well, there was no inhibition of dedifferentiation from basal-cell-derived spheres, suggesting that direct cell contact (not a secreted factor) normally inhibits dedifferentiation in the multilayered tracheal epithelium in order to maintain the relative proportions of different cell types. This mouse study reveals two unexpected newt-like behaviors. First, differentiated mammalian cells can dedifferentiate, become proliferative, and then redifferentiate into several cell types. Second, the proportionality of cell types within a tissue is homeostatically regulated by cell contact with the stem cell—a behavior also seen in the newt brain with regard to the maintenance of dopaminergic neurons (Berg et al., 2010Berg D.A. Kirkham M. Beljajeva A. Knapp D. Habermann B. Ryge J. Tanaka E.M. Simon A. Development. 2010; 137: 4127-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is a striking example of universality of mechanisms and suggests a deep evolutionary origin for this cell behavior. But what of the apparent lack of universality between newts and axolotls, at least with regard to muscle regeneration? Perhaps it doesn’t matter how you generate undifferentiated blastemal cells, and any source of proliferating cells will do. However, these findings implicate fundamental differences in regenerative mechanisms between two closely related species. Do we now have to go back and repeat newt experiments on axoltols and vice versa, and does this mean regeneration has evolved multiple times? Finally, if one salamander uses a mammalian strategy involving stem cells and another uses a dedifferentiative strategy, this immediately poses the question of whether other fundamental aspects of limb regeneration are also divergent, for example the neurotrophic control mechanisms. If so, then I believe that this is good news for the eventual goal of induction of mammalian regeneration, because there may be more than one way to achieve success.

Published online December 5, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239730Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar) now show that Wnt signaling promotes proliferation in both stem cell populations, revealing new insights into regeneration of both skin compartments. The periodic regeneration of the hair follicle contrasts with the ongoing requirement to replace the sloughed layers of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), and it has therefore been postulated that distinct regulatory mechanisms must control stem cell reconstitution of these two compartments. Until recently, the phenotypes resulting from inactivation of beta-catenin (Ctnnb1) throughout the skin epithelium seemed to support this idea (Huelsken et al., 2001Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Hair follicles from these mice failed to regenerate, and putative stem cells were lost over time while the interfollicular epidermis was hyperproliferative. This phenotype along with other work demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling activates follicular stem cells and is required for the differentiation of their progeny. However, the apparently opposite effect on epidermal stem cells has remained controversial, in part because Wnt signaling was not detected in the epidermis, and in part because any perturbation that disrupts the integrity of the skin’s barrier function may lead to a hyperproliferative regenerative response in the epidermis. It seemed possible that expansion of the epidermis in such models was an indirect consequence of inflammation or barrier disruption caused by degeneration of the follicle. To address these discrepancies, two recent papers, one in this issue of Cell Stem Cell (Choi et al., 2013Choi Y. Zhang Y. Xu M. Yang Y. Ito M. Peng T. Cui Z. Nagy A. Hadjantonakis A. Lang R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13 (this issue): 720-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and another in Science (Lim et al., 2013Lim X. Tan S. Koh W. Chau R. Kuo C. Chau R. Yan Kuo C. Amerongen R. Klein A. Nusse R. Science. 2013; (in press. Published online December 5, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239730Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar), employed cell-type-specific genetic manipulation and clonal analysis to provide new insight on the role of Wnt signaling in regenerative replacement in the skin. “Epidermal stem cell” and “follicular stem cell” are applied in the literature to varying and overlapping subsets of cells in the context of evolving models of skin stem cell biology. In the epidermis, it was proposed that the basal epidermis was composed of distinct stem cells surrounded by “transit amplifying (TA) cell” progeny committed to differentiation and reconstitution of the upper layers of the skin (Potten, 1975Potten C.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1975; 65: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Lim et al. extend and confirm an analysis of clone dynamics that disputes this model of epidermal stem cells and instead supports the functional equivalence of most basal cells in the epidermis (Lim et al., 2013Lim X. Tan S. Koh W. Chau R. Kuo C. Chau R. Yan Kuo C. Amerongen R. Klein A. Nusse R. Science. 2013; (in press. Published online December 5, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239730Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H. Nature. 2007; 446: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Changes in the distribution of clone sizes and composition over time fit a mathematical model that assumes an equivalence between basal cells rather than a model that assumes two sets of clones derived from distinct stem and TA cells. Here, and in both papers discussed, the term “epidermal stem cell” refers to most keratinocytes in the basal layer of the skin rather than a hypothetical rare stem cell at the base of this lineage (Figure 1). In the hair follicle, relatively quiescent cells in the follicular bulge were proposed as stem cells of both follicle and epidermis (Fuchs et al., 2001Fuchs E. Merrill B.J. Jamora C. DasGupta R. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Experimental analysis in vivo has undermined the model in which follicular regeneration is initiated by asymmetric division of the “bulge stem cell” that generates TA cells of more restricted potential. “Bulge stem cells” are not the source of epidermal stem cells during normal homeostasis (Levy et al., 2005Levy V. Lindon C. Harfe B.D. Morgan B.A. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 855-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), their activation is not the initial step in follicle regeneration, and the cells themselves are not required for follicular regeneration (Rompolas et al., 2013Rompolas P. Mesa K.R. Greco V. Nature. 2013; 502: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The cells in the secondary germ are often considered a TA population subordinate to bulge stem cells (Figure 1). However, analogous to the situation in epidermis, basal cells throughout the lower follicle appear to exhibit a functional equivalence of intrinsic properties, although their activity is influenced by their local environment. Millar’s group selectively deleted either beta-catenin or Wntless (Wls), a gene required for secretion of Wnts, in the bulge and secondary germ of the hair follicle. This, as well as blockade of Wnt signaling by expression of Dkk1, showed that canonical Wnt signaling is not directly required for maintenance of follicular stem cells, but is required for activation of the secondary germ cells to regenerate the follicle. Whether Wnt signaling had an opposite effect in epidermal stem cells remained unclear. Both of the new papers demonstrate that a direct role for canonical Wnt signaling in suppressing epidermal stem cell activity suggested by the beta-catenin and Wls deletion studies (Myung et al., 2013Myung P.S. Takeo M. Ito M. Atit R.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2013; 133: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is plausible. They detected a low level of beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity in these cells. However, the Dkk1-mediated suppression of Wnt signaling reduced proliferation in epidermis rather than promoted it. Deletion of beta-catenin in hairless skin also caused decreased proliferation, suggesting that the hyperproliferative phenotypes might result from follicular degeneration. Both groups exploited the expression of Axin2, a Wnt responsive gene, in the IFE to delete beta-catenin selectively in epidermis without disrupting hair follicles. Axin2-creERT2 is not a perfect tool. The target gene is also deleted in other tissues and impairs the health of the animal. However, the Millar group confirmed that the effect was specific to stem cells that could not activate the canonical Wnt pathway by comparing proliferation between regions with or without beta-catenin in back skin of the same mosaicly deleted animals. Based on the similarity in behavior of clones labeled with Axin2-creERT2 compared to randomly induced clones, Lim et al. concluded that Wnt signaling does not alter the likelihood of self-renewal or differentiation, thereby dismissing another trivial explanation that the stem cells had all differentiated. Thus the groups come to the same conclusion, that Wnt signaling promotes proliferation of stem cells in both compartments, similar to that observed in other epithelia. In the hair follicle, coordinated activation of Wnt signaling in the secondary germ and its dermal niche, the dermal papilla, is required for regeneration (Figure 1). The more sensitive detection of Axin2 expression also reveals a low level of activity in the superficial dermis. This finding might explain the observation that deletion of Wls results in epidermal hyperproliferation (Myung et al., 2013Myung P.S. Takeo M. Ito M. Atit R.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2013; 133: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Perhaps this proliferation is also an indirect result of inflammation, but it is also possible that epidermal stem cells can regulate their niche through Wnt expression. In this feedback model, a dearth of epidermal stem cells mimicked by Wls deletion would decrease signaling to the IFE niche, which would in turn promote a hyperproliferative epidermal response to repair the defect. The hair follicle is used to study the periodic and coordinated activation of stem cells. Both the stem cells and their niche integrate signals originating from each other, surrounding follicles, and other cell types in the skin and beyond to orchestrate replacement of the hair coat (Plikus et al., 2011Plikus M.V. Baker R.E. Chen C.C. Fare C. de la Cruz D. Andl T. Maini P.K. Millar S.E. Widelitz R. Chuong C.M. Science. 2011; 332: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Millar and colleagues show that when released from blockade of Wnt signaling, hair follicles rapidly reenter the growth phase. This novel approach to freezing the stem cells and their niche in an arrested, early activation state may prove helpful in the effort to identify other signals that regulate regeneration in this system.
