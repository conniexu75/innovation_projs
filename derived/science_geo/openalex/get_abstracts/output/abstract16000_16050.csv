https://openalex.org/W2041270901,All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has previously been shown to modulate the transcriptional properties of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). The inability of all-trans RA to bind to RXR suggests that it may be metabolized to a more active high affinity ligand. We report here an experimental approach that has identified 9-cis RA as an RXR ligand. It is up to 40-fold more potent than all-trans RA in transfection assays and binds with high affinity. The production of 9-cis RA in cultured cells and the identification of this molecule in liver and kidney demonstrates the existence of this molecule in living organisms. The discovery of this novel hormone points to the key role retinoid metabolism may have in generating new signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1987040411,"Cellular responsiveness to retinoic acid and its metabolites is conferred through two structurally and pharmacologically distinct families of receptors: the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR). Here we report that the transcriptional activity of RAR and RXR can be reciprocally modulated by direct interactions between the two proteins. RAR and RXR have a high degree of cooperativity in binding to target DNA, consistent with previous reports indicating that the binding of either RAR or RXR to their cognate response elements is enhanced by factors present in nuclear extracts. RXR also interacts directly with and enhances the binding of nuclear receptors conferring responsiveness to vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone T3; the DNA-binding activities of these receptors are also stimulated by the presence of nuclear extracts. Together these data indicate that RXR has a central role in multiple hormonal signalling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2102082802,"We have purified and cloned a HeLa cell nuclear protein that strongly stimulates binding of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (RARs and TRs) to response elements. The purified protein is a human retinoid X receptor beta (hRXR beta). Three murine members of the RXR family (mRXR alpha, beta, and gamma) have also been cloned, and their interactions with RARs and TRs have been investigated. Under conditions where RAR, RXR, and TR bound poorly as homodimers to various response elements, strongly cooperative RAR-RXR and TR-RXR binding was observed. The binding efficiency was dependent on the sequence, relative orientation, and spacing of the repeated motifs of response elements. We show also that unstable RAR-RXR heterodimers were formed in solution, and that C-terminal sequences and the DNA-binding domains of both receptors were required for efficient formation of stable heterodimers on response elements. These findings suggest a convergence of the signaling pathways of some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W1965824265,"In man, Hodgkin's disease (HD) represents the most frequent lymphoma entity whose pathogenesis is still unknown. In order to contribute to the characterization of the molecular mechanisms of this disease, cDNAs coding for the HD characteristic antigen CD30 were cloned from expression libraries of the human HUT-102 cell line using the monoclonal antibodies Ki-1 and Ber-H2. The open reading frame of the cDNA that can be translated from two mRNA species of 2.6 kb, and 3.8 kb, respectively, predicts a 595 amino acid protein with leader, extracellular, single transmembrane, and intracellular domains. When expressed in COS-1 cells, the cDNA presented properties comparable to native CD30 antigen. The CD30 extracellular domain proved to be homologous to members of the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. Six cysteine-rich motifs could be recognized within the putative ligand-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2122043314,"The product of the proto-oncogene Jun inhibits myogenesis. Constitutive expression of Jun in myoblasts interferes with the expression and the function of MyoD protein. In transient transfection assays Jun inhibits transactivation of the MyoD promoter, the muscle creatine kinase enhancer, and a reporter gene linked to MyoD DNA-binding sites. Conversely, MyoD suppresses the transactivation by Jun of genes linked to an AP-1 site. We demonstrate that both in vivo and in vitro MyoD and Jun proteins physically interact. Mutational analysis suggests that this interaction occurs via the leucine zipper domain of Jun and the helix-loop-helix region of MyoD."

https://openalex.org/W1983986068,"Resident luminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins carry a targeting signal (usually KDEL in animal cells) that allows their retrieval from later stages of the secretory pathway. In yeast, the receptor that promotes this selective retrograde transport has been identified as the product of the ERD2 gene. We describe here the properties of a human homolog of this protein (hERD2). Overproduction of hERD2 improves retention of a protein with a weakly recognized variant signal (DDEL). Moreover, overexpression of KDEL or DDEL ligands causes a redistribution of hERD2 from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. Mutation of hERD2 alters the ligand specificity of this effect, implying that it interacts directly with the retained proteins. Ligand control of receptor movement may limit retrograde flow and thus minimize fruitless recycling of secretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2031168303,"The a mating type locus of the phytopathogenic fungus U. maydis controls fusion of haploid cells and filamentous growth of the dikaryotic mycelium. The a locus exists in two alleles, termed a1 and a2, which are defined by nonhomologous DNA regions comprising 4.5 kb for a1 and 8 kb for a2, flanked by identical sequences. Based on functional assays, mutants, and sequencing, we demonstrate that the mating type in each allele is determined by a set of two genes. One encodes a precursor for a lipopeptide mating factor, and the other specifies the receptor for the pheromone secreted by cells of opposite mating type. Thus, U. maydis employs a novel strategy to determine its mating type by providing the primary determinants of cell-cell recognition directly from the mating type locus."
https://openalex.org/W2036647778,"The E2F transcription factor has been found in association with the cyclin A protein, and this complex accumulates during the S phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that E2F may play a role in cell cycle control. In independent studies, cyclin A has been shown to be associated with two other proteins, the Rb-related p107 protein and the cdc2-related p33 cdk2 protein kinase. Through an analysis of the E2F-cyclin A complex, we now find that both the p107 protein and the cdc2-related p33cdk2 kinase are components of the previously described complex. Moreover, the complex possesses H1 kinase activity. These results thus define a cyclin A-cdk2 kinase complex that possesses sequence-specific DNA binding activity. This suggests that the cdk2 kinase may phosphorylate other DNA-bound substrates, and that one role of the E2F factor may be to localize this protein kinase to the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2147631014,"One major aim of studies of vertebrate embryology has been to determine the mechanisms by which signals generated by one group of cells control the fate of neighboring cells, the process generally referred to as embryonic induction (Spemann, 1938; Jacobson, 1986; Gurdon, 1987). Inductive interactions involve two primary components: a signal that is generated by the inducing cell and a receptive system that directly or indirectly controls gene expression in the responding cell (Figure 1). The ligands that constitute inductive signals can be anchored to the cell surface or secreted from cells. Thus, the extent of induction can be controlled by regulating ligand production or by limiting its range of action (Figure 1). The competence of cells to respond to the ligand also contributes to the extent of induction. Competence may be controlled by modifying the expression or function of the appropriate receptors, the intracellular signal transduction pathway, or the transcription of target genes (Figure 1). Inductive signals can also control multicellular pattern if the response of similar cells to different concentrations of the same signal results in different cell fates. In this article we review recent studies on the role of diffusible inductive signals in the differentiation and patterning of cells in vertebrates. We consider induction in broad terms including, as examples, interactions that control the differentiation and patterning of cells within epithelial sheets, as in mesodermal and neural induction; the control of the differentiation of migrating cells such as those of the neural crest and hematopoietic lineages; and the regulation of specific cellular phenotypes, focusing on transmitter choice in neurons (Figures 2 and 3). We also discuss the mechanisms by which the transmission of inducing signals is regulated in the embryo in light of recent studies suggesting that differences in the extent of diffusion of ligands can affect induction processes."
https://openalex.org/W2041958488,"Many populations of vertebrate neurons have a membrane component that binds alpha-bungarotoxin and cholinergic ligands. Despite the abundance of this component and its similarities to nicotinic receptors, its function has remained controversial. Using a fluorescence assay, we show here that activation of the component elevates the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+, demonstrating a receptor function for the toxin-binding component. Whole-cell voltage-clamp and intracellular recordings did not detect a significant current resulting from receptor activation, possibly because the currents were small or the receptors rapidly desensitized. The rise in intracellular free Ca2+ caused by the receptor was prevented by Ca2+ channel blockers. This suggests a signaling cascade likely to have important regulatory consequences for the neuron."
https://openalex.org/W1983153323,"The mechanism by which thrombin induces neurite retraction was studied in NB2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. The rapid effect of thrombin (completed within minutes) appears to involve an interaction between its anion-binding exosite and the thrombin receptor. Structural alterations of this site increase the EC50 for thrombin-mediated retraction, and a hirudin C-terminal peptide that blocks this site inhibits the response. The thrombin effect was mimicked by a 14 amino acid peptide starting with Ser-42, at the proposed cleavage site of the human thrombin receptor. The protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H-7 blocked thrombin-induced retraction. It is therefore proposed that thrombin-mediated neurite retraction is caused by cleavage-induced activation of the thrombin receptor and involves stimulation of a protein kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2090554343,"Studies on bacterial RNA polymerases have divided the initiation pathway into three steps, namely (i) promoter binding to form the closed complex; (ii) DNA melting to form an open complex, and (iii) messenger RNA initiation. Potassium permanganate was used to detect DNA melting by mammalian RNA polymerase II in vitro. Closed complexes formed in a rate-limiting step that was stimulated by the activator GAL4-VP16. Adenosine triphosphate was then hydrolyzed to rapidly melt the DNA within the closed complex to form an open complex. Addition of nucleoside triphosphates resulted in the melted bubble moving away from the start site, completing initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2155578952,"Paramyotonia congenita (PMC), a dominant disorder featuring cold-induced myotonia (muscle stiffness), has recently been genetically linked to a candidate gene, the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene SCN4A. We have now established that SCN4A is the disease gene in PMC by identifying two different single-base coding sequence alterations in PMC families. Both mutations affect highly conserved residues in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop, a portion of the sodium channel thought to pivot in response to membrane depolarization, thereby blocking and inactivating the channel. Abnormal function of this cytoplasmic loop therefore appears to produce the Na+ current abnormality and the unique temperature-sensitive clinical phenotype in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1488805493,"Abstract Receptor binding studies were performed with 125I-labeled trypsin-activated insecticidal toxins, CryIA(a) and CryIA(c), from Bacillus thuringiensis on brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from Bombyx mori larval midgut. Bioassays were performed by gently force feeding B. mori with diluted toxins. CryIA(a) toxin (LD50; 0.002 micrograms) was 200 times more active against B. mori larvae than CryIA(c) toxin (LD50; 0.421 micrograms) and showed high-affinity saturable binding. The Kd and the binding site concentration for CryIA(a) toxin were 3.5 nM and 7.95 pmol/mg, respectively. CryIA(c) toxin (Kd, 50.35 nM; Bmax, 2.85 pmol/mg) did not demonstrate high-affinity binding to B. mori BBMV. Control experiments with CryIA(a) and CryIA(c) toxins revealed no binding to mouse small intestine BBMV and nonspecific binding to pig kidney BBMV. These data provide evidence that binding to a specific receptor on the membrane of midgut epithelial cells is an important determinant with respect to differences in insecticidal spectrum of insecticidal crystal proteins. To locate a B. mori receptor binding region on the CryIA(a) toxin, homologous and heterologous competition binding studies were performed with a set of mutant proteins which had previously been used to define the B. mori domain on this toxin (Ge, A. Z., Shivarova, N. I., and Dean, D. H. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 4037-4041). These mutant proteins have had regions of their genes reciprocally exchanged with the cryIA(c) gene. A B. mori receptor binding region on CryIA(a) toxin includes the amino-terminal portion of the hypervariable region, amino acids 332-450, which is identical to the previously described B. mori specificity determining region. These data provide direct evidence that delta-endotoxins contain a tract of amino acids that comprise a binding region and as a results determines the specificity of a toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1516689988,"Sphingosine kinase was partially purified and characterized from rat brain microsomes. A new assay, utilizing octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and sphingosine mixed micelles, was developed to quantitate formation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate product. The assay was proportional with respect to time and protein, displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and was subject to surface dilution in regard to the sphingosine substrate. Investigations into substrate specificity showed that the enzyme is specific for the erythro-enantiomers of sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine. Neither of the threo-enantiomers were phosphorylated in this system, but both were found to be potent competitive inhibitors of sphingosine kinase activity. Human platelet sphingosine kinase activity displayed substrate and inhibitor specificities similar to the rat brain enzyme. A mixture of DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine competitively inhibited sphingosine kinase activity in a dose dependent manner in isolated platelets. DL-Threo-dihydrosphingosine caused a prolongation of the inhibition of thrombin-induced protein kinase C-dependent 40 (47)-kDa protein phosphorylation in platelets. D-, L-, or DL-Threo-dihydrosphingosine may be useful as a tool to investigate D-Erythrosphingosine metabolism and the function of sphingosine-1-phosphate in signal transduction processes."
https://openalex.org/W2052480517,"The presence and primary structure of a novel subunit of the mouse glutamate receptor channel, designated as γ2, have been revealed by cloning and sequencing the cDNA. The γ2 subunit has structural characteristics common to the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family and shares a high amino acid sequence identity with the rat KA-1 subunit, thus constituting the γ subfamily of the glutamate receptor channel. Expression of the γ2 subunit together with the β2 subunit in Xenopus oocytes yields functional glutamate receptor channels selective for kainate."
https://openalex.org/W1506509855,"Insulin increases phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human insulin receptor (Ruderman, N. B., Kapeller, R., White, M. F., and Cantley, L. C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1411-1415). The subcellular distribution of PI-3-kinase has not been investigated, and it is unclear if insulin has a stimulatory effect on PI-3-kinase in a nonproliferating target tissue, and, if so, whether this effect is subject to counter-regulation. To address these questions, we studied the effect of insulin on PI-3-kinase activity in isolated rat adipocytes. Activity was measured in plasma membranes, intracellular membranes, and cytosol of control and insulin-treated adipocytes, and in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates prepared from these fractions and from whole cell lysates. Treatment of adipocytes with insulin (200 nM) caused a half-maximal increase in anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable PI-3-kinase activity in whole cell lysates within 2 min. This effect was concentration-dependent, and it was sensitive to inhibition by norepinephrine. In insulin-stimulated cells, 75% of anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable PI-3-kinase activity was found in the low density microsomes. This fraction also exhibited the highest specific activity of PI-3-kinase, and insulin caused a further increase in this activity. Anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable PI-3-kinase activity was also found in the plasma membranes of insulin-treated cells, but this accounted for only a minor portion of the total and anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable PI-3-kinase activity. The majority of PI-3-kinase activity (90%) in control cells was cytosolic, but this was not increased in response to insulin nor was it anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable. These data demonstrate that insulin increases the activity of PI-3-kinase in adipocytes and this effect is subject to inhibition by a physiological antagonist of insulin action. The data also indicate that the effect of insulin to increase PI-3-kinase activity is expressed primarily in the low density intracellular membranes and to a lesser extent in the plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1593897992,"Bacillus thuringiensis produces a variety of delta-endotoxins which bind to specific receptors in insect larval midguts. Following insertion into the membrane there is an alteration of ion flux culminating in osmotic lysis. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were used to define regions in one of these toxins involved in specificity and toxicity. One region is highly conserved among all toxins sequenced to date and many mutations resulted in loss of toxicity for three test Lepidoptera. The mutant toxins had lost the capacity to inhibit K(+)-dependent amino acid transport into larval midgut vesicles, but there was no effect on their ability to compete with wild type toxin for binding. The results are consistent with this amphiphilic helical region of the toxin being essential for toxicity. A second mutagenized region overlapped a portion of another potential amphiphilic helix. Mutations of only 2 residues, Ala-92 and Arg-93, resulted in loss of toxicity for two lepidopteran larvae but some activity remained for a third. The A92D mutant toxin competed with the wild type toxin for binding to vesicles prepared from midguts from the sensitive but not from the insensitive larvae. Decreased toxicity was also found when this mutation was transferred to two other related protoxin genes. A number of mutations of each of these residues was analyzed and selective loss of toxicity correlated with the absence of a positive charge. Despite being distal from the presumptive specificity domain, 1 or both of these residues must have an important role in the specific binding of toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2074903637,"Activation of maturation-promoting factor at the onset of mitosis requires the tyrosine dephosphorylation of one of its components, the cdc2 protein kinase. cdc25 is the specific tyrosine phosphatase that activates cdc2. We find that Xenopus oocytes contain a relative of cdc25, p72. In Xenopus embryos the abundance of p72 does not oscillate during the cell cycle. However, p72 directly associates with cdc2-cyclin B in a cell cycle-dependent manner, reaching a peak at M phase. The M phase kinase that associates with p72 is catalytically active. These results suggest that the mechanism by which cdc25 triggers cdc2 activation involves a periodic physical association between cdc25 and the cyclin B-cdc2 complex and also that mitotic control can be affected by mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation of the cdc25 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1484685406,"The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([free Ca2+]i) was measured simultaneously with the Ca2+ extrusion from single isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells placed in a microdroplet of extracellular solution using the fluorescent probes fura-2 and fluo-3. The extracellular solution had a low total calcium concentration (15-35 microM), and acetylcholine (ACh), applied by microionophoresis, therefore only evoked a transient elevation of [free Ca2+]i lasting about 2-5 min. The initial sharp rise in [free Ca2+]i from about 100 nM toward 0.5-1 microM was followed within seconds by an increase in the total calcium concentration in the microdroplet solution ([Ca]o). The rate of this rise of [Ca]o was dependent on the [free Ca2+]i elevation, and as [free Ca2+]i gradually decreased Ca2+ extrusion declined with the same time course. Ca2+ extrusion following ACh stimulation was not influenced by removal of all Na+ in the microdroplet solution indicating that the Ca2+ extrusion is not mediated by Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange but by the Ca2+ pump. The amount of Ca2+ extruded during the ACh-evoked transient rise in [free Ca2+]i corresponded to a decrease in the total intracellular Ca concentration of about 0.7 mM which is close to previously reported values (0.5-1 mM) for the total concentration of mobilizable calcium in these cells. Our results therefore demonstrate directly the ability of the Ca2+ pump to rapidly remove the large amount of Ca2+ released from the intracellular pools during receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1602737952,"Polyethylene glycol has been shown to bind to the molten globule intermediate on the bovine carbonic anhydrase B folding pathway. The mechanism of this interaction has been extensively probed. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) binds weakly to the molten globule first intermediate as measured by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, but PEG does not bind to either the native state or the second intermediate. The binding of PEG to the molten globule has been confirmed with both intrinsic fluorescence and fluorescence quenching experiments which indicate a single PEG-binding site on the molten globule. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies with nitroxide-labeled PEG also indicate a single binding site. Additional electron paramagnetic resonance studies with spin-labeled carbonic anhydrase B suggest that a conformational change occurs in the molten globule intermediate after PEG binds to the surface. The formation of a PEG-molten globule complex results in a reduction in self-association of this compact hydrophobic structure. PEG-molten globule complex formation is analogous to the observed interaction between chaperonins and a molten globule intermediate (Martin, J., Langer, T., Boteva, R., Schramel, A., Horwich, A.L., and Hartl, F.U. (1991) Nature 352, 36-42)."
https://openalex.org/W1535027644,"A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association."
https://openalex.org/W1584368056,"2',3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddC) is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus replication in vitro and shows beneficial effects in AIDS therapy. The compound inhibits mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis at a clinically relevant concentration, which could be responsible for the side effects of ddC observed in the clinic. Thymidine (dThd), one of the substrates of mitochondrial deoxypyrimidine kinase (dPyd kinase), was not able to reverse the mitochondrial toxicity of ddC in CEM cells. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd kinase)-deficient CEM cells were highly resistant to the mitochondrial toxicity of ddC. These data suggest a critical role for cytoplasmic dCyd kinase in the mitochondrial toxicity of ddC. The metabolites of ddC, but not ddC itself, were able to inhibit mtDNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria. The potency of the inhibitory effect was in the order of ddCTP greater than ddCDP greater than ddCMP greater than ddC. The lack of inhibition by ddC of mtDNA synthesis could be due to the inefficient ddC phosphorylation in mitochondria. Although the mitochondrial dPyd kinase was reported to phosphorylate ddC, the phosphorylation of ddC in isolated mitochondria was not detectable. The data suggest that ddC is phosphorylated to ddCTP in the cytoplasm and then transported into mitochondria to exert its inhibitory effect on mtDNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1538819561,"How heparin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration has not been established. We have investigated the hypothesis that heparin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration by interfering with the expression and activity of proteases such as plasminogen activators. In an in vitro mitogenesis model, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) mRNA and protein increase in baboon smooth muscle cells stimulated with fetal bovine serum or phorbol esters. Heparin inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and suppresses the induction of tPA mRNA and protein while it has little effect on the mRNA of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type I, and a number of genes that are also modulated by serum and phorbol esters. The inhibitory effect on tPA mRNA is specific to heparin-like molecules and does not depend on the anticoagulation activity of heparin. The increase in tPA mRNA is due to increased transcription, which is suppressed by heparin. The induction of tPA by serum and phorbol esters is diminished by protein kinase C inhibitors such as H7 or staurosporine and by protein kinase C depletion. Since heparin suppresses the induction of the tPA gene by phorbol esters, these results suggest that heparin may interfere with the protein kinase C pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1500755125,"9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) is an analogue of adenosine and deoxyadenosine with potent anti-tumor activity. The mechanism of action for this compound has been elucidated as the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, induction of DNA fragmentation, and genetic damage. This study demonstrated that DNA ligase I, an enzyme involved in DNA replication, is a target for the drug action. F-ara-adenine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP) at 80 microM inhibited the activity of DNA ligase I by more than 90%. In contrast, eight other related nucleoside analogues showed no effect on the enzyme activity at 200 microM. F-ara-ATP inhibited DNA ligation in two distinct ways. First, F-ara-ATP directly interacted with DNA ligase I and inhibited the formation of the ligase-AMP complex. This inhibition could not be reversed when free F-ara-ATP was eliminated from the treated enzyme; however, the addition of pyrophosphate, followed by gel filtration chromatography, restored enzyme activity, indicating that F-ara-ATP bound to the enzyme and altered the AMP-binding site. Secondly, the activity of DNA ligase I was inhibited when F-ara-ATP was incorporated into the 3' terminus of the DNA substrate. The dual mode of inhibition of DNA ligase I by F-ara-ATP indicates that its effect on DNA ligation may be important in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the cytotoxicity of F-ara-A."

The extent to which these regulatory molecules participate in the growth control of differentiated epithelial cells like hepatocytes is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the expression of G1 (E, C, and D) and G2/M (A, B1, and B2) cyclin mRNAs, the relative levels of cyclin A- and B1-associated histone H1-kinase activity, and the appearance of cyclin-associated kinases (p32/p33cdk2 and p33/p34cdc2) in regenerating rat liver and in control tissues from sham hepatectomized rats. To do this, we exploited a battery of human cyclin cDNAs and cyclin antisera that recognize rat molecules. The results suggest an apparent sequence of regeneration-specific changes: 1) elevated and induced expression of cyclins E (2.1 kilobases (kb)) and C (4 kb), and D mRNAs (4 kb), within 12 h, respectively; 2) induction of cyclins A (3.4 and 1.8 kb), B1 (2.5 and 1.8 kb), and B2 (1.9 kb) mRNAs at 24 h; 3) induction of cyclin A- and B1-associated nuclear histone H1 kinase at 24 h; and 4) enhanced levels of PSTAIRE-containing proteins of Mr approximately 32-33 and 33-34 kDa in nuclear extracts from 24-h regenerating liver that co-immunoprecipitate with cyclin A and B1 antisera, respectively. These observations provide an intellectual framework that unifies the biology of hepatocyte mitogenesis, proto-oncogene expression, and the machinery of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1566215621,"Abstract In a recent model developed to explain the apparent quantal nature of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-induced Ca2+ release from specific intracellular stores, it was proposed that Ca2+ release from the stores may itself be modulated by intraluminal levels of Ca2+, possibly via an action at a binding site on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor/Ca2+ channel complex. Essential predictions of this model include a specific effect of intraluminal Ca2+ levels on the sensitivity of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release and a non-exponential decay of passive Ca2+ loss from the store following inhibition of the Ca2+ pump on the store. However, in measurements of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release and passive Ca2+ loss in permeabilized preparations of a model exocrine cell under conditions of thapsigargin-induced store depletion, we found that neither of these predicted behaviors could be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1498257141,"Receptor-activated Ca2+ influx was investigated in PC12 cells clones loaded with fura-2. Cells were stimulated in a Ca(2+)-free medium and studied after reintroduction of the cation or addition of Mn2+ into the medium. A first influx component, independent of receptor activation and sustained by depletion of the intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate sensitive Ca2+ store (store-dependent Ca2+ influx, SDCI), was identified by experiments with carbachol followed by atropine and with agents that induce store discharge without polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis: thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity; ryanodine and caffeine, activators of the ryanodine receptor. A second component of Ca2+ influx, induced by carbachol and rapidly blocked by atropine, relies on receptor-effector coupling via G protein(s) different from that (those) involved in phospholipase C activation. SDCI and receptor-coupled influx are similar in their voltage dependence and insensitivity to forskolin and phorbol esters but they differ with respect to their Mn2+ permeability and their sensitivity to the SC 38249 imidazole blocker. The two components might play different roles. SDCI might act as a safety device to prevent Ca2+ store depletion whereas receptor-dependent influx might control physiological functions such as secretion and growth."

Fractionation of the venom by liquid chromatography shows that this inhibitory activity is associated primarily with a diverse class of peptide toxins called omega-agatoxins (omega-Aga). Using binding inhibition as an assay, we purified and identified the novel, 76-amino acid toxin, omega-Aga-IIIA. Inhibition of 125I-omega-CgTx binding to chick synaptosomal membranes by omega-Aga-IIIA and omega-Aga-IIA is correlated with block of potassium-stimulated 45Ca entry into synaptosomes; omega-Aga-IA neither inhibits 125I-omega-CgTx binding nor 45Ca entry under identical conditions. omega-Aga-IIA and omega-Aga-IIIA are 20-30-fold more potent than omega-CgTx as antagonists of synaptosomal calcium channels. However, whereas omega-CgTx completely blocks 45Ca entry into synaptosomes at saturating concentrations, the omega-agatoxins maximally block only 60-70% of 45Ca entry. Pretreatment of synaptosomes with omega-Aga-IIIA occludes block of 45Ca entry by omega-CgTx. The results indicate that, while the omega-agatoxins bind to the entire population of omega-CgTx-sensitive calcium channels in chick synaptosomal membranes, they exert only a partial block of 45Ca flux. Such block could occur via two distinct mechanisms. Toxin binding may alter the kinetics of a homogeneous population of channels, resulting in lower overall conductance upon depolarization. Alternatively, the omega-agatoxins may bind to two distinct channel subtypes, only one of which is blocked as a result of toxin occupation."
https://openalex.org/W1569465625,"Regulation of thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHr) mRNA accumulation as compared with two other thyroid differentiation markers (thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase (TPO] has been investigated by Northern blot. In dogs in vivo, chronic stimulation of the thyroid TSHr mRNA although it increased the levels of thyroglobulin and TPO mRNA. In dogs treated with thyroxin, the quiescent thyroids expressed normal levels of TSHr and TPO mRNA but depressed levels of thyroglobulin mRNA. In primary cultures of dog thyrocytes, dedifferentiation of the cells by treatment with epidermal growth factor or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate led to decreased TSHr mRNA levels and nearly abolished thyroglobulin and TPO gene expression. However, TSHr mRNA was always present, compatible with the fact that these cells, when treated by TSH, reexpress differentiation. Treatment of the cells with TSH or forskolin transiently increased the TSHr mRNA level after 20 h, an effect inhibited by cycloheximide. This up-regulation was confirmed at the protein level: forskolin-treated cells showed an enhanced cAMP response to TSH and an increased binding of labeled TSH to their membranes. Long term TSH treatment led to a slight down-regulation of TSHr mRNA in dog thyrocytes, but in human thyroid cells no marked down-regulation was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1990407337,"Binding of cAMP by the five neuronal isoforms (N1-5) of the regulatory (R) subunit of the Aplysia cAMP-dependent protein kinase is diminished in sensory neurons stimulated to produce long-term presynaptic facilitation. To determine how the cAMP-binding activity of the R subunits is lost, we isolated cDNAs encoding N4, which is a homolog of mammalian RI. Immunoblots with antisera raised against the R protein overexpressed in E. coli show that the diminished binding activity, which occurs in long-term facilitation, results from coordinate loss of R protein isoforms. No change was detected in the amount of transcripts for R subunits, suggesting that the down-regulation results from enhanced proteolytic turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1573515835,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic biomodulator and an important inducer of certain pathophysiologic immune reactions such as granuloma formation, cachexia, and septic shock. The production of TNF by astrocytes, which may figure prominently in the development of immune responses within the central nervous system, is subject to post-transcriptional regulation. We have previously shown that in virus-stimulated astrocytes, inhibition of protein kinase C results in a specific, 10-fold decrease in TNF mRNA half-life. Here we show that the decay of TNF messages induced in the macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 by either virus or lipopolysaccharide was subject to similar regulation, and that this pathway influenced the amount of TNF protein released by stimulated cells. Using a modified RNase protection assay, we demonstrate that inhibition of protein kinase C significantly enhanced the rate of poly(A) removal from TNF mRNA, thus facilitating an early event in the process of mRNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1519326483,"Abstract The first fluorescently labeled phenylalkylamine, DMBODIPY-PAA (5-(3-[3-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-3a, 4a-diaza-4-bora-indacen-3-yl)propionamido] phenethyl-N-methylamino)-2-isopropyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-valer onitrile) has been introduced for L-type Ca2+ channel research. DMBODIPY-PAA binds reversibly to L-type Ca2+ channels purified from rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes by wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography. In this preparation DMBODIPY-PAA labels 412 pmol of phenylalkylamine receptors/mg of protein with a Kd of 6.82 nM and a favorable signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore DMBODIPY-PAA has a higher affinity for purified Ca2+ channels than the commonly employed radioligands and consequently has assisted in channel purification after prelabeling by simply monitoring receptor-bound fluorescence. (+)-PN200-110 (which is stimulatory for (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil binding to purified Ca2+ channels) inhibits DMBODIPY-PAA labeling. Since these drug interactions are reciprocal, the phenylalkylamine and dihydropyridine binding sites of the alpha 1-subunit are tightly coupled. Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies with (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil and DMBODIPY-PAA show that phenylalkylamine binding to L-type Ca2+ channels is dependent on Ca2+. Chelation of divalent metal ions converts phenylalkylamine receptors into a very low affinity state. This conversion is temperature- and time-dependent and completely reversible (K0.5 for free Ca2+ = 58 nM). This study demonstrates the utility of fluorescent ligands for binding studies with L-type Ca2+ channels and provides evidence for coupling between Ca2+ binding sites and phenylalkylamine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1587612987,"The v-sis oncogene product p28v-sis and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B chain share 92% homology with each other and over 50% homology with the PDGF A chain. Exogenously added homodimers of PDGF A and PDGF B and of p28v-sis are potent mitogens but only PDGF B and p28v-sis induce transformation when endogenously expressed with a strong promoter. Because exogenous PDGF AA and PDGF BB both initiate a full mitogenic response, understanding the mechanisms underlying the difference in their transforming potential may clarify how growth factor genes act as oncogenes. In this work, we compared cells expressing high levels of PDGF A and v-sis. We observed that transformation by v-sis correlated directly with the rapid degradation (t1/2 approximately 20 min) of the alpha and beta PDGF receptors, with a failure of either the alpha or beta receptor to be fully processed and with the association of high levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with immunoprecipitates of the PDGF receptors. In contrast, in cells expressing essentially equal levels of PDGF A, transformation was not detected, alpha and beta PDGF receptor processing was normal, and association of PI 3-kinase with receptors in immunoprecipitates was not found above control values. The ability of v-sis to autoactivate PDGF receptors within processing compartments and to initiate activation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway coupled with the failure of PDGF A to activate its receptor intracellularly and to induce transformation when endogenously expressed at high levels suggests that the internal autoactivation of PDGF receptors may be essential for transformation by v-sis."
https://openalex.org/W1483151675,"In Zajdela hepatoma cells (ZHC) the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump displayed no sensitivity to glucagon (19-29) (mini-glucagon), whereas in hepatocyte this metabolite of glucagon evoked a biphasic regulation of the Ca2+ pump system via a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein. Analysis of G protein subunits in ZHC membranes indicated the presence of cholera toxin-sensitive Gs alpha and G beta gamma proteins, whose functionality was manifested by GTP and NaF stimulation of adenylylcyclase activity, and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha, respectively. However, immunoblotting experiments suggested a lower content in beta gamma subunits in ZHC as compared with hepatocyte plasma membranes. Complementation of ZHC or hepatocyte plasma membranes with purified beta gamma subunits from transducin (T beta gamma) caused inhibition of the basal activity of the Ca2+ pump at 10 and 300 ng/ml, respectively, and revealed (in ZHC) or increased (in hepatocytes) sensitivity of the system to mini-glucagon. After cholera toxin treatment of ZHC, T beta gamma no longer reconstituted the response of the Ca2+ pump to mini-glucagon, suggesting that the mechanism of beta gamma action is dependent on an association with the alpha subunit of a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein. It is concluded that G beta gamma subunits control both the basal activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump and its inhibition by mini-glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1965290256,"Ion channels from bovine neurohypophysial granules were incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers. The larger amplitude channel is permeable to cations and exhibits multiple conductances. The channel opens only in the presence of free Ca2+, but is inhibited by relatively high Ca2+ concentrations. Release of vasopressin from permeabilized neurohypophysial terminals also shows a similar biphasic dependence on Ca2+. Release is selectively inhibited by low concentrations of the long-chain alcohol octanol, but not by high concentrations of ethanol, as is the neurosecretory granule Ca2+-activated cation channel. Furthermore, Ca 2+-evoked release and channel activity are both inhibited by the long-chain tetraethylammonium analogs decamethonium and decyl-triethyl ammonium bromide. The close correlation between channel and release properties lead us to conclude that the Ca2+-activated channel is involved in peptide secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2126481983,"Adenovirus infection of hepatoma cells inhibited transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) gene and virtually eliminated transcription of a chimeric gene which contained the PEPCK promoter linked to the structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This effect is due to the viral protein E1A, since adenovirus containing a deletion in the E1A gene did not repress transcription from the PEPCK promoter. Both the 243R and 283R products of the E1A gene were effective. The conserved region 1 (CR-1) domain of E1A was required for this effect. Treatment of hepatoma cells with 8-bromo-cAMP or transfection with plasmids coding for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP), or Jun, all potent inducers of PEPCK gene transcription, did not relieve the inhibition caused by E1A. This inhibition does not appear to be mediated by major enhancer elements and in the PEPCK gene since transcription from the PEPCK promoter containing block mutations in binding domains for C/EBP and cAMP regulatory element binding protein (CREB) was also inhibited by E1A. Transcription of chimeric genes containing two copies each of the major cAMP response domains (CRE-1 and P-3) linked to a neutral promoter and fused to the CAT structural gene was stimulated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, but this effect was totally inhibited by E1A. The strong repressive effect of E1A on PEPCK gene transcription seems to involve an interruption of an obligatory interaction between factors which bind to the cAMP response element in the PEPCK promoter and the TATA box."
https://openalex.org/W1530373030,"L-Proline's glycogenic action is unlike that of other amino acids in that it produces effects beyond those explainable by a simple increase in osmolarity (Baquet, A., Hue, L., Meijer, A. J., van Woerkom, G. M., and Plomp, P. J. A. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 955-959). We postulate that this effect may relate to inhibition of hepatic glucose-6-P hydrolysis by a proline-derived metabolite. We tested this hypothesis with isolated livers from rats fasted 48 h which were perfused with L-proline or L-glutamine. Net glucose and net glycogen production and levels of glucose-6-P and certain other hepatic metabolites were measured. The data obtained support our hypothesis by demonstrating fundamental differences in the metabolic fates of proline and glutamine in the liver. Both pass through alpha-ketoglutarate in the initial stage of gluconeogenesis, but proline supports hepatic glycogen formation while glutamine does not. The concomitant increase in hepatic glucose-6-P and proline-associated glyconeogenesis suggests that inhibition of glucose-6-P hydrolysis by a proline-derived metabolite may divert glucose-6-P produced from proline from glucose production and to glycogen synthesis. This conclusion is supported by the effects of perfusions with and without proline (3-mercaptopicolinate present) on (a) glyconeogenesis and glucose formation from dihydroxyacetone, (b) net glucose uptake and glycogen formation with 30 mM glucose as substrate, and (c) glucose production from endogenous glycogen in perfused livers from fed rats."
https://openalex.org/W1565645558,"The molecular weight of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor in rat lung and its interaction with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs) were assessed by covalent cross-linking, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunological techniques. Studies with two cross-linking agents indicated that the VIP receptor in this tissue is a single polypeptide of Mr = 54,000. The VIP-occupied receptor could be cross-linked to neighboring proteins after detergent solubilization; higher molecular weight complexes of Mr = 114,000 and 184,000 were formed. Immunoblotting with antisera against G-protein subunits demonstrated that both complexes contained the alpha-subunit of Gs as well as the 125I-VIP cross-linked receptor whereas only the Mr = 184,000 complex contained the beta-subunit. Pretreatment with GTP reduced the prominence of these complexes, verifying the functional nature of this receptor-Gs association. Studies with a third cross-linking agent, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), provided direct evidence of physically associated, ternary VIP-receptor-Gs complexes actually in the membrane milieu. That these complexes were functionally associated with shown by their inhibition by anti-Gs alpha anti-serum. Since treatment of membranes with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) resulted in the separation of the VIP-cross-linked receptor from Gs such that no cross-linking could occur, we conclude that the binding of GTP analogs induces a conformational change in Gs in the membrane milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1605305053,"Euglena cells grown in diurnal light-dark cycles exhibit circadian variations of their cAMP content, which we believe to be under the control of an endogenous timer because they persist in constant darkness in the absence of any environmental time cue. We think that these cAMP oscillations may play a role in the regulation of some of the numerous cellular activities that are known to display circadian rhythmicities in this organism. The role of cAMP in algal cells is still controversial, however, since the nature of the cAMP receptor is unknown. We show that extracts of the achlorophyllous ZC mutant of Euglena gracilis contain two cAMP-binding proteins, which bind cAMP with a high affinity (Kd values of 10 nM and 30 nM) and which can be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Protein kinase activity was assayed using Kemptide as a substrate. Stimulation of kinase activity by cAMP was observed after partial purification by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Two peaks of activity were resolved, corresponding to distinct enzymes with different cAMP-analog specificities. Thus, cAMP signaling in plant cells may proceed by the phosphorylation of target proteins by cAMP-dependent kinases, in a manner similar to that of animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524916031,"32D cells transfected with the human alpha platelet-derived growth factor receptor (alpha PDGFR) bind PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB isoforms with high affinity, and the binding of each can be efficiently competed by all three isoforms. In an effort to develop better understanding of spatial relationships of binding sites for PDGF-AA and -BB, we constructed an alpha PDGFR mutant which deleted amino acids 150-189 within its extracellular domain. This mutant showed a marked decrease in high affinity binding sites for PDGF-AA without comparable alteration in affinity for PDGF-BB. These findings imply that the high affinity binding sites for PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB in the alpha PDGFR extracellular domain are not structurally coincident."
https://openalex.org/W1592387636,"Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in leucine metabolism. Previous studies of fibroblasts from patients with isovaleric acidemia (IVA), an inherited defect in IVD, have revealed that IVD precursor protein produced by type II IVA cells is 3 kDa smaller than normal and is processed inefficiently to a mature form which is also 3 kDa smaller than normal. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we have identified a 90-base pair deletion encompassing bases 145-234 in type II IVD cDNA. This deletion is caused by an error in RNA splicing and predicts the in-frame deletion of 30 amino acids beginning with leucine 20 of the mature IVD. The rate of leader peptide cleavage by purified mitochondrial leader peptidases was similar for the variant and normal precursor IVDs expressed in vitro, and radiosequencing confirmed that both mature proteins contain identical amino termini. In vitro import studies showed that the efficiency of overall mitochondrial import of type II variant IVD precursor was approximately 30% of normal, as was its binding to the mitochondrial surface. Unlike its normal counterpart, the bound variant IVD precursor was readily released. These data suggest that binding of the variant protein to mitochondrial membrane receptors per se is hindered, resulting in the inefficient mitochondrial processing."
https://openalex.org/W1582846107,"To determine the relationship between cellular uptake of cadmium and content of metallothionein, we measured uptake of 109Cd in cells that differed in content of metallothionein (MT). MT cells were derived from NIH/3T3 cells by transfection with a plasmid containing the genome of bovine papilloma virus and the mouse metallothionein-I gene, driven by the promotor for the glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa. Control cells were similarly transfected with bovine papilloma virus-based plasmids with the gene for metallothionein inverted and thus separated from the promoter (TM), or deleted, along with the promoter (BPA). The number of copies of bovine papilloma virus-based plasmids was similar in MT, TM, and BPA cells, approximately 100 per cell. MT cells were more than 10 times more resistant to the lethal effect of cadmium than were the control cells. Synthesis of metallothionein was 15-fold greater in the MT cells than in the TM or BPA cells. The uptake of 109Cd by the cells enriched in metallothionein was 4-fold less than by the control cells. These data suggest that an increased content of metallothionein may protect some cells from the toxic effects of cadmium, in part, by diminishing uptake of the metal."
https://openalex.org/W1555884855,"The glycogen phosphorylase-2 (GP2) activity that appears during the cell differentiation of Dictyostelium was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the nondenatured enzyme was 200,000 as determined by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration and was 107,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the native enzyme consists of two similar subunits. The intact protein was digested with trypsin and protease V8, and the resulting peptides were purified by microbore high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptides were sequenced, and oligonucleotides were constructed for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the GP2 gene from Dictyostelium genomic DNA template. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced directly and were confirmed to encode portions of the GP2 gene. These fragments were used to probe a partial EcoRI genomic library for the remainder of the GP2 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the GP2-selected clones revealed an open reading frame of 2975 base pairs that was interrupted by two introns of 109 and 105 base pairs, respectively. The open reading frame encoded a protein of 992 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 112,500 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.4. An unusual sequence within the second exon of GP2, in which the triplet CAA was repeated 11 times, resulted in 11 in-frame glutamine residues of a possible 15 amino acids coded for by this region. The CAA repeat was transcribed, as shown by the sequence of cDNA. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of Dictyostelium GP2 to the phosphorylases from other organisms revealed that the Dictyostelium protein was 50 and 44% identical to yeast and rabbit muscle phosphorylases, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that GP2 mRNA was absent in amebas and the early stages of development, reached a maximum level of expression at the slug stage, and then decreased in the terminal stages of development. Comparison of the mRNA expression with the appearance of GP2 enzyme protein and enzyme activity revealed that gp2 mRNA and a 113-kDa GP2 enzyme peptide were expressed concurrently at 10 h of development. However, enzyme activity did not appear until 18 h, coincident with a decrease in the level of the 113-kDa peptide and a corresponding increase in the amount of a 106-kDa GP2 peptide. Addition of cAMP to aggregation-competent cells in liquid culture resulted in the induction of GP2 mRNA, GP2 protein, and GP2 enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1495953832,"During its development the eukaryotic microorganisms Dictyostelium discoideum secretes an alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). In cells of the growth phase almost no alpha-L-fucosidase activity is detectable. The activity increases steadily up to the aggregation stage and accumulates also in the extracellular medium. The developmental regulation is mediated by pulsatile cAMP signals. The alpha-L-fucosidase was purified from extracellular medium. The isolation procedure started with concentration of the enzyme by batchwise anion-exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration and further purification by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono Q, phenyl-Superose, and finally Superose 12. The purified preparation was found to be essentially free of activities of six other glycosidases also secreted by D. discoideum. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme showed one major band with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kilodalton. Gel filtration of the enzyme on a Superose 12 column was consistent with an active monomer. A monoclonal antibody was produced, which recognizes a carbohydrate epitope shared by all lysosomal enzymes in D. discoideum. The pH optimum of the alpha-L-fucosidase is at 3.7. The apparent Michaelis constant for p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucoside as substrate is 1.2 mM. The enzyme catalyzes preferentially the hydrolysis of alpha 1----6GlcNAc but also of alpha 1----2Gal and alpha 1----3Glc fucosyl linkages."
