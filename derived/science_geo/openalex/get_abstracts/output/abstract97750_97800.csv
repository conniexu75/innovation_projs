https://openalex.org/W1670928643,"The effects of varying concentrations of L-methionine, L-homocysteine, and adenosine on the tissue levels of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosyl-homocystein (AdoHcy) were investigated in perfused liver. In the normal liver, the intracellular concentration of AdoMet was dependent upon the availability of methionine. In the presence of high concentrations of methionine the maximum level of AdoMet attainable was 300 nmol/g of liver. The exogenous concentration of methionine did not alter the hepatic concentration of AdoHcy (8 to 20 nmol/g) while adenosine or homocysteine blocked hydrolysis of AdoHcy resulting in elevated levels of AdoHcy (400 to 600 nmol/g) and AdoMet (300 to 600 nmol/g). The addition of both adenosine (4mM) and homocysteine (3.4 mM) to the perfusate further increased the levels of AdoHcy (4 mumol/g) and AdoMet (1.2 mumol/g). As the concentration of AdoHcy increased, significant amounts of this compound were released into the perfusate, while AdoMet was not detected. Under all conditions where AdoHcy accumulated in the cell, a concomitant increase in the AdoMet level occurred. Apparently AdoHcy acts as a positive effector of the S-adenosylmethionine synthase. The hepatocytes did not take up significant amounts of [methyl-14C]AdoMet from the perfusate nor were any [14C]methyl groups from this compound incorporated into histones, DNA, or phospholipids. In contrast, [14C]methyl groups were readily incorporated into these macromolecules from exogenous [methyl-14C]methionine. The addition of adenosine (4 mM) and homocystein (3.4 mM) shifted the AdoMet:AdoHcy ratio from 8.2 to 0.3. Under these conditions, transmethylation was inhibited markedly."

We have found that the oligosaccharide units of newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase contain phosphate residues in diester linkage between mannose and alpha-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues (Tabas, I., and Kornfeld, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6633--6639). To obtain larger amounts of these molecules for structural studies, total cellular glycopeptides were isolated from [2-3H]mannose-labeled mouse lymphoma cells, and the phosphorylated oligosaccharides were released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase CII and H and isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The fractions were characterized by alpha-mannosidase digestion before and after removal of the phosphate residues and by acetolysis. We also determined whether the phosphate was present as a phosphomonoester or as a diester. The phosphorylated oligosaccharides consisted of a family or related molecules, all of which contained a high mannose-type oligosaccharide core. The major class consisted of isomers containing a single phosphate in diester linkage to 1 of 3 mannose residues of the underlying oligosaccharide. The second class contained isomers with two phosphodiester groups located at five different positions of the oligosaccharide. In both of these classes, the phosphodiester group could be converted to a phosphomonoester by pig liver alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, indicating that the cover is alpha-linked N-acetylglucosamine. The third class was similar to the second except that the 2 phosphate residues were present as monoester groups. The last class contained molecules with a single phosphomonoester group. These molecules differed from those with single phosphodiester groups in that the core oligosaccharides were smaller. This is consistent with their being more mature species which have undergone partial processing. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation can occur at 5 separate mannose residues on the high mannose-type oligosaccharides. Individual molecules can have 1, 2, and perhaps even 3 phosphate residues. The majority of the newly synthesized phosphorylated oligosaccharides contain phosphate groups in diester linkage."

https://openalex.org/W1492878157,"The differential binding of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol to cytosolic proteins in various types of cells was investigated. 25-Hydroxycholesterol taken up by six different established cell culture lines and by mouse spleen cells in primary culture was bound to cytosolic components which, during velocity gradient centrifugation, displayed sedimentation coefficients of approximately 5 S and 8 S. In contrast, cholesterol taken up by the cells was concentrated near the bottom (approximately 20 S) of the sucrose density gradient but was distributed throughout. Results with primary cultures of mouse fetal liver differed from thos obtained with other cell cultures in that both sterols appeared principally in a 5 S band. Further characterization of the binding components from intact L cells indicated that binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol to the 8 S fraction was saturable and reversible, whereas binding to the 5 S band was not saturable. The 8 S 25-hydroxycholesterol complex involved a protein with a relatively long half-life. The complex was essentially stable at 0 degrees C but dissociated slowly at 25 degrees C. Sulfhydryl functions were not required for sterol binding, and formation of the complex was not dependent upon cAMP. Competition studies with intact cells and with isolated cytosol indicated that a number of other oxygenated sterols bind to 8 S sites occupated by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Those sterols which are potent suppressors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) activity competed for these binding sites, while those which do not suppress the reductase did not compete for them. These studies suggest that the binding of oxygenated sterols to the 8 S cytosolic component may be in some sense specific, while that to the 5 S component is nonspecific. The kinetics of formation and dissociation of the 8 S 25-hydroxy-cholesterol.protein complex and of the suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the presence of the diol was also consistent with a postulated role for the complex in the regulation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1580396495,"A growth factor was isolated from bovine cartilage and purified by a combination of gel filtration chromatography and isoelectric focusing. In the first step of the purification, growth factor activity as measured by stimulation of DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3 cells or chondrocytes, was extracted by incubation of cartilage with 1 M guanidine hydrochloride, pH 6.0. The crude cartilage extract was analyzed by gel filtration on a column equilibrated with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mM dithiothreitol. All of the cartilage-derived growth factor activity migrated in a region corresponding to molecular weights between 12,000 and 20,000. The low molecular weight fraction was analyzed by isoelectric focusing in the presence of 6 M urea. Two major active fractions were found, with isoelectric points of approximately 9 and 10. Purification to homogeneity was accomplished by several cycles of gel filtration of the pI 9 fraction on columns equilibrated with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The purified growth factor migrated as a single polypeptide band in two polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the cartilage-derived growth factor was estimated to be between 16,000 and 18,000 by gel filtration and 16,400 by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration chromatography of the pI 10 fraction also yielded an active purified 16,400 molecular weight growth factor. Approximately 1 to 2.5 micrograms/ml of purified cartilage-derived growth factor was necessary to half-maximally stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells and chondrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2096513982,"Rat hepatocyte plasma membranes were isolated and examined by differential scanning calorimetry and by steady state fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, 12-anthroyl stearate, and 2-anthroyl stearate. Calorimetry of the intact membranes revealed a reversible lipid thermotropic transition with lower and upper critical temperatures of 18 degrees and 31 degrees C, respectively. The transition was also observed in lipid extracts of the membrane, both dried and rehydrated. The transition enthalpies estimated for intact membranes, dried membrane lipids, and rehydrated lipids, respectively, were approximately 0.3, 1.2 to 1.4, and 0.5 to 0.7 cal/g of lipid. The transition observed in the native membranes is broad and of low enthalpy, owing in part to the relatively high cholesterol content and to protein-lipid interactions. Fluorescence polarization studies detect the lower critical temperature of the transition in the membranes and in sonicated dispersions of the membrane lipid. Arrhenius studies of membrane 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase give two-slope plots with breakpoints, respectively, of approximately 17 degrees and 26 degrees C. These break points and others reported for a number of hepatocyte membrane protein activities cluster uniformly at either the lower or the upper critical temperature of the lipid transition observed by differential scanning calorimetry."
https://openalex.org/W1489156615,"The acidic oligosaccharide fraction obtained by paper electrophoresis of the hydrazinolysate of the plasma membrane glycoprotein mixture of calf thymocytes was fractionated by high voltage paper electrophoresis into 15 acidic components. Three of them were mixtures of two acidic oligosaccharides, while the remaining 12 were almost pure acidic oligosaccharides. The 18 oligosaccharides have a common core hexasaccharide, Man alpha 1 yields 6(man beta 1 yields 3)Man beta 1 yields 4GlcNAc beta 1 yields 4(Fuc alpha 1 yields 6)GlcNAc. The number of outer chains ranges from two to four. Three different types of outer chains, Gal beta 1 yields 4 GlcNAc beta 1 yields, Gal beta 1 yields 3 GlcNAc beta 1 yields, and Gal beta 1 yields 4 GlcNAc beta 1 yields 3Gal beta 1 yields 4GlcNAc beta 1 yields, were found to occur in the acidic oligosaccharides in various combination. In the biantennary oligosaccharides, the two outer chains are linked only at the C-2 position of the two alpha-mannosyl residues of the core hexasaccharide. All triantennary oligosaccharides have an additional outer chain at the C-4 position of the alpha-mannosyl residue constructing the Man alpha 1 yields 6Man group of the core. Two outer chains of tetraantennary oligosaccharides are linked at the C-2 and 4 positions of one alpha-mannosyl residue and the remaining two outer chains at the C-2 and 6 positions of the other alpha-mannosyl residue of the core. An interesting observation is that C-2,6 disubstitution always occurs on the alpha-mannosyl residue of the Man alpha 1 yields 6 side in all oligosaccharides with Gal beta 1 yields 4GlcNAc beta 1 yields 3Gal beta 1 yields 4GlcNAc beta 1 yields outer chain, while in other tetraantennary oligosaccharides, C-2,6 disubstitution always occurs on the alpha-mannosyl residue of the Man alpha 1 yields 3 side. No sialylated Gal beta 1 yields 3Gal beta 1 yields 4GlcNAc beta 1 yields outer chain was found in the acidic oligosaccharides studied in this paper."

https://openalex.org/W1604279237,"The site-specific phosphorylation of initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) by three different cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinases from rabbit reticulocytes was examined. The hemin-controlled repressor modified serine in the alpha subunit (Mr = 38,000), while casein kinase II and protease-activated kinase II phosphorylated serine residues of the beta subunit (Mr = 53,000). Under conditions of maximal phosphorylation, 1 mol of phosphate was incorporated into eIF-2 by each of the protein kinases. However, following treatment of eIF-2 with alkaline phosphatase, 2 mol of phosphate were added by casein kinase II, indicating residual phosphate was present on the beta subunit of purified eIF-2. The tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of the phosphorylated subunits were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping involving thin layer electrophoresis followed by ascending chromatography. When eIF-2 was phosphorylated by the hemin-controlled repressor, three major chymotryptic and four tryptic phosphopeptides with molecular weights ranging from approximately 600 to 3000 were identified. When phosphorylation of eIF-2 beta was examined, two tryptic and two chymotryptic phosphopeptides were obtained after phosphorylation with casein kinase II and were different from the phosphopeptides observed following phosphorylation with protease-activated kinase II. This indicates that three distinct sites in the beta subunit were phosphorylated, two by casein kinase II and one by protease-activated kinase II."

https://openalex.org/W1598957172,"Abstract The Gardner strain of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) has previously been shown to encode as its major translational product, a phosphoprotein of molecular weight (Mr) = 115,000 (P115) with an associated protein kinase activity and probable transforming function. In the present study, we demonstrate that this enzyme specifically phosphorylates tyrosine and that Gardner FeSV-transformed mink and rat cells exhibit constitutively higher levels of phosphotyrosine than nontransformed control cells. In addition, we identify a Mr = 150,000 cellular substrate for the FeSV P115-associated protein kinase activity. This latter protein, designated P150, is expressed in cells of a number of mammalian species including cat, mink, dog, rat, mouse and human, possesses broadly reactive interspecies antigenic determinants, and exhibits binding affinity for FeSV P115. Although P150 exhibits an associated protein kinase activity, this activity differs from the FeSV P115-associated enzyme in that it phosphorylates serine and threonine rather than tyrosine. On the basis of immunologic criteria and tryptic peptide analysis, the possibility that P150 is structurally related to Gardner FeSV P115 is excluded. As a consequence of its affinity for FeSV P115, P150 is efficiently incorporated into FeSV pseudotype virions, providing a source for its purification and preparation of antisera for study of its expression in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1578220284,"The synthesis of 2-thioltryptophan-glucagon is described. Oxidation of this compound gives the dimer (Trp-S-glucagon)2. Both monomer and dimer are equi-potent on a molar basis with native glucagon as activators of adenylate cyclase in hepatic plasma membranes. However, from the ability to compete with 125I-glucagon for binding at the glucagon receptor, the dimer has one-fourth the binding affinity for the receptor as does native glucagon, 2-thiol-Trp-glucagon, and Trp-(2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl)-glucagon which have equal affinities for the receptor. Addition of GTP, which converts the receptor from a tight-binding to a lower affinity form and which activates adenylate cyclase in the presence of glucagon, allows (Trp-S-glucagon)2 to bind equally with native glucagon and the other thiol derivatives of the hormone. This effect of GTP on the binding of the glucagon dimer and the uses of 2-thiol-Trp-glucagon in the semisynthesis of new glucagon derivatives are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1494733204,"Abstract Succinyl-CoA synthetase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver. The key step in the purification procedure involved adsorption on a GDP dialdehyde (dial-GDP)-adipic dihydrazide-Sepharose 4B column and elution by GDP-Mg2+. Like the pig heart enzyme (Brownie, E. R., and Bridger, W. A. (1972) Can. J. Biochem. 50, 719--724), the rat liver enzyme was an alpha beta heterodimer and only the alpha subunit was phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]GTP. The A 280(0.1%) of the enzyme was determined to be 0.5. Amino acid analyses revealed significant similarities in 50% of the amino acid residues of rat liver and Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetases. However, immunodiffusion analysis failed to reveal any antigenic identity between the two enzymes. Incubation with the affinity label, dial-GDP, in the presence of Mg2+ resulted in a biphasic inactivation of the enzyme. The extent of the rapid phase of inactivation appeared to be related to the extent of dephosphorylation of the enzyme and was prevented by preincubation of the enzyme with GTP-Mg2+. The presence of GDP-Mg2+ in the incubation medium prevented the slow phase of the inactivation and retarded the rapid phase. Dephosphorylated enzyme was approximately 2 orders of magnitude more susceptible to inactivation by dial-GDP than phosphorylated enzyme. Labeling of succinyl-CoA synthetase with [3H]dial-GDP gave a linear relationship between inactivation and incorporation of radioactivity with an extrapolated value of less than 1.2 mol of analog/mol of enzyme at 100% inactivation. The distribution of the label in enzyme that was inactivated 40% was approximately 60% in the alpha subunit and 40% in the beta subunit. Thus, while phosphorylation of the enzyme occurs exclusively in the alpha subunit, the nucleotide binding site appears to include components from both alpha and beta subunits."
