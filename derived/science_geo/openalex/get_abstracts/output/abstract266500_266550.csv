In the head, the neural crest functions as mesoderm and forms connective, skeletal, and muscular tissue. Both the neural crest and the epidermal placodes form special sense organs and other neural structures. These structures may be homologous to portions of the epidermal nerve plexus of protochordates. The transition to vertebrates apparently was associated with a shift from a passive to an active mode of predation, so that many of the features occurring only in vertebrates became concentrated in the head."

In response, new laws were passed, pollution control funding was increased, and natural resource conservation was heavily stressed. Despite such good intentions, the cumulative effects of new technologies, inadequate budgets and enforcement, the primacy of production goals, and various institutional impediments resulted in an uneven and in some places inadequate level of environmental enhancement."

https://openalex.org/W2012045939,Energy storage has long been a problem in connection with home utilization of solar energy. A solution which utilizes solar semiconductor cells for conversion to d-c power is proposed. The d-c power is used to drive an alternator which is connected directly across the residential power lines. Thus a-c power is delivered to the power lines when a surplus of power is available in the home and is used in other parts of the power distribution system. At latitude 42 degrees N there is 3 times more yearly energy recoverable than is used by an average residence on the basis of a 10-by-10-m collection area. At the present state of technical development the cost of such a large-area semiconductor solar cell would be prohibitive.

https://openalex.org/W2089334140,"In a paper to be communicated to the American Physical Society it is assumed that the ionisation in the upper atmosphere is caused by the ultraviolet light of the Sun and that the ion- and electron-densities at noon at the equator are those required by the theory of wireless wave-propagation. From the laws of recombination of the ions and the diffusion and drift of the ions in the Earth's magnetic and gravitational fields, the distribution of the ions and electrons over the Earth is worked out. The distribution turns out to be that required by the diamagnetic theory of the solar diurnal-variation of the Earth's magnetism (Gunn, Phys. Rev., v. 32, 1928 (133); Terr. Mag., v. 34, 1929 (17)). The gravitational drift-currents are found to flow mainly along the parallels of latitude in the following way: On the daylight hemisphere (1) a current-sheet flowing eastward in the levels above 150 km, which at the sunrise and sunset longitudes divides into two sheets; (2) one of these flows westward on the day side of the Earth underneath (1) in the levels below 150 km, and (3) the other sheet continues eastward in the upper levels around on the night side of the Earth."

Mitchell Waldrop (Research News, 28 Jan., p. 375), it was stated incorrectly that, in the standard model, the expanding universe cooled below 1027 degrees Kelvin about 1035 seconds after the Big Bang. The correct time is 10â€“35 second."
