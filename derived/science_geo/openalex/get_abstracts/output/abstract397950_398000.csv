https://openalex.org/W2153974854,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main site of protein and lipid synthesis, membrane biogenesis, xenobiotic detoxification and cellular calcium storage, and perturbation of ER homeostasis leads to stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response. Chronic activation of ER stress has been shown to have an important role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes in obesity. However, the mechanisms that lead to chronic ER stress in a metabolic context in general, and in obesity in particular, are not understood. Here we comparatively examined the proteomic and lipidomic landscape of hepatic ER purified from lean and obese mice to explore the mechanisms of chronic ER stress in obesity. We found suppression of protein but stimulation of lipid synthesis in the obese ER without significant alterations in chaperone content. Alterations in ER fatty acid and lipid composition result in the inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity and ER stress. Correcting the obesity-induced alteration of ER phospholipid composition or hepatic Serca overexpression in vivo both reduced chronic ER stress and improved glucose homeostasis. Hence, we established that abnormal lipid and calcium metabolism are important contributors to hepatic ER stress in obesity."

Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition in specific brain regions is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism underlying the regional vulnerability to Aβ deposition in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that endogenous neuronal activity regulates the regional concentration of interstitial fluid (ISF) Aβ, which drives local Aβ aggregation. Using in vivo microdialysis, we show that ISF Aβ concentrations in several brain regions of APP transgenic mice before plaque deposition were commensurate with the degree of subsequent plaque deposition and with the concentration of lactate, a marker of neuronal activity. Furthermore, unilateral vibrissal stimulation increased ISF Aβ, and unilateral vibrissal deprivation decreased ISF Aβ and lactate, in contralateral barrel cortex. Long-term unilateral vibrissal deprivation decreased amyloid plaque formation and growth. Our results suggest a mechanism to account for the vulnerability of specific brain regions to Aβ deposition in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983470920,"Although the functional interaction between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin ligases (E3s) is essential in ubiquitin (Ub) signalling, the criteria that define an active E2-E3 pair are not well established. The human E2 UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) shows broad specificity for HECT-type E3s, but often fails to function with RING E3s in vitro despite forming specific complexes. Structural comparisons of inactive UBCH7-RING complexes with active UBCH5-RING complexes reveal no defining differences, highlighting a gap in our understanding of Ub transfer. Here we show that, unlike many E2s that transfer Ub with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic, E3-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits activity with the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes parkin (also known as PARK2) and human homologue of ariadne (HHARI; also known as ARIH1). Found in all eukaryotes, RBRs regulate processes such as translation and immune signalling. RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by two conserved Cys/His-rich Zn(2+)-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family. We show that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s via a RING domain, but transfer Ub through an obligate thioester-linked Ub (denoted ∼Ub), requiring a conserved cysteine residue in RING2. Our results define the functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation and immune function, and indicate a novel mechanism for an entire class of E3s."

We identified associated loci at TMCO1 (rs4656461[G] odds ratio (OR) = 1.68, P = 6.1 × 10(-10)) and CDKN2B-AS1 (rs4977756[A] OR = 1.50, P = 4.7 × 10(-9)). We replicated these associations in an independent cohort of cases with advanced OAG (rs4656461 P = 0.010; rs4977756 P = 0.042) and two additional cohorts of less severe OAG (rs4656461 combined discovery and replication P = 6.00 × 10(-14), OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.35-1.68; rs4977756 combined P = 1.35 × 10(-14), OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.28-1.51). We show retinal expression of genes at both loci in human ocular tissues. We also show that CDKN2A and CDKN2B are upregulated in the retina of a rat model of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2019472515,"Gene activity is described by the time series of discrete, stochastic mRNA production events. This transcriptional time series shows intermittent, bursty behavior. One consequence of this temporal intricacy is that gene expression can be tuned by varying different features of the time series. Here we quantify copy-number statistics of mRNA from 20 Escherichia coli promoters using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization in order to characterize the general properties of these transcriptional time series. We find that the degree of burstiness is correlated with gene expression level but is largely independent of other parameters of gene regulation. The observed behavior can be explained by the underlying variation in the duration of bursting events. Using Shannon's mutual information function, we estimate the mutual information transmitted between an outside stimulus, such as the extracellular concentration of inducer molecules, and intracellular levels of mRNA. This suggests that the outside stimulus transmits information reflected in the properties of transcriptional time series."
https://openalex.org/W2082297209,"Efficient, high-fidelity storage and exchange of quantum information between light and an optical quantum memory is essential for long-distance quantum communication, quantum networking and distributed quantum computing. Stephan Ritter and colleagues demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a quantum memory, mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out of single atoms trapped inside an optical cavity. The high fidelity (93%) and relatively long qubit coherence time of this atomic memory make it a versatile quantum node, with excellent prospects for applications in optical quantum gates and quantum repeaters. The faithful storage of a quantum bit (qubit) of light is essential for long-distance quantum communication, quantum networking and distributed quantum computing1. The required optical quantum memory must be able to receive and recreate the photonic qubit; additionally, it must store an unknown quantum state of light better than any classical device. So far, these two requirements have been met only by ensembles of material particles that store the information in collective excitations2,3,4,5,6,7. Recent developments, however, have paved the way for an approach in which the information exchange occurs between single quanta of light and matter8,9,10,11,12,13. This single-particle approach allows the material qubit to be addressed, which has fundamental advantages for realistic implementations. First, it enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon by means of state detection14,15,16; this can be used to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies. Second, it allows for individual qubit manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum information. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a quantum memory, by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out of a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is tested with weak coherent pulses and analysed using full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is measured to be 93%, and low decoherence rates result in qubit coherence times exceeding 180 microseconds. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent prospects for applications in optical quantum gates17 and quantum repeaters18."
https://openalex.org/W2047573503,"DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is crucial for maintenance of methylation, gene regulation and chromatin stability. DNA mismatch repair, cell cycle regulation in post-mitotic neurons and neurogenesis are influenced by DNA methylation. Here we show that mutations in DNMT1 cause both central and peripheral neurodegeneration in one form of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy with dementia and hearing loss. Exome sequencing led to the identification of DNMT1 mutation c.1484A>G (p.Tyr495Cys) in two American kindreds and one Japanese kindred and a triple nucleotide change, c.1470-1472TCC>ATA (p.Asp490Glu-Pro491Tyr), in one European kindred. All mutations are within the targeting-sequence domain of DNMT1. These mutations cause premature degradation of mutant proteins, reduced methyltransferase activity and impaired heterochromatin binding during the G2 cell cycle phase leading to global hypomethylation and site-specific hypermethylation. Our study shows that DNMT1 mutations cause the aberrant methylation implicated in complex pathogenesis. The discovered DNMT1 mutations provide a new framework for the study of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2067576594,"PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, is one of the most frequently mutated tumour suppressors in human cancer. Several recent studies have highlighted the importance of ubiquitylation in regulating PTEN tumour-suppressor function, but the enzymatic machinery required for PTEN ubiquitylation is not clear. In this study, by using a tandem affinity-purification approach, we have identified WWP2 (also known as atrophin-1-interacting protein 2, AIP-2) as a PTEN-interacting protein. WWP2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that belongs to the NEDD4-like protein family, which is involved in regulating transcription, embryonic stem-cell fate, cellular transport and T-cell activation processes. We show that WWP2 physically interacts with PTEN and mediates its degradation through a ubiquitylation-dependent pathway. Functionally, we show that WWP2 controls cellular apoptosis and is required for tumorigenicity of cells. Collectively, our results reveal a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN that plays a vital role in tumour-cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2167049113,"KCC2 is a neuron-specific K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter that maintains a low intracellular Cl(-) concentration that is essential for hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by GABA(A) receptors. Deficits in KCC2 activity occur in disease states associated with pathophysiological glutamate release. However, the mechanisms by which elevated glutamate alters KCC2 function are unknown. The phosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940 is known to regulate its surface activity. We found that NMDA receptor activity and Ca(2+) influx caused the dephosphorylation of Ser940 in dissociated rat neurons, leading to a loss of KCC2 function that lasted longer than 20 min. Protein phosphatase 1 mediated the dephosphorylation events of Ser940 that coincided with a deficit in hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition resulting from the loss of KCC2 activity. Blocking dephosphorylation of Ser940 reduced the glutamate-induced downregulation of KCC2 and substantially improved the maintenance of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition. Reducing the downregulation of KCC2 therefore has therapeutic potential in the treatment of neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2164351607,"Although previous studies have described CD25 expression and production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by mature dendritic cells (mDCs), it remains unclear how these molecules participate in the activation of T cells. In search of the mechanisms by which daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD25, inhibits brain inflammation in multiple sclerosis, we observed that although the drug has limited effects on polyclonal T cell activation, it potently inhibits activation of antigen-specific T cells by mDCs. We show that mDCs (and antigen-experienced T cells) secrete IL-2 toward the mDC-T cell interface in an antigen-specific manner, and mDCs 'lend' their CD25 to primed T cells in trans to facilitate early high-affinity IL-2 signaling, which is crucial for subsequent T cell expansion and development of antigen-specific effectors. Our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism for the IL-2 receptor system in DC-mediated activation of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976750232,"Learning and memory tasks are associated with the addition of new synapses in the brain, but the function of this structural plasticity is not clear. A study of the rearrangement of circuits within the hippocampus and cerebellum in response to learning reveals a robust, long-lasting and reversible increase in the number of synapses that trigger feedforward inhibition. This synapse growth has a vital role in maintaining the precision of the memory and the learned behaviour. In the adult brain, new synapses are formed and pre-existing ones are lost, but the function of this structural plasticity has remained unclear1,2,3,4,5. Learning of new skills is correlated with formation of new synapses6,7,8. These may directly encode new memories, but they may also have more general roles in memory encoding and retrieval processes2. Here we investigated how mossy fibre terminal complexes at the entry of hippocampal and cerebellar circuits rearrange upon learning in mice, and what is the functional role of the rearrangements. We show that one-trial and incremental learning lead to robust, circuit-specific, long-lasting and reversible increases in the numbers of filopodial synapses onto fast-spiking interneurons that trigger feedforward inhibition. The increase in feedforward inhibition connectivity involved a majority of the presynaptic terminals, restricted the numbers of c-Fos-expressing postsynaptic neurons at memory retrieval, and correlated temporally with the quality of the memory. We then show that for contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze learning, increased feedforward inhibition connectivity by hippocampal mossy fibres has a critical role for the precision of the memory and the learned behaviour. In the absence of mossy fibre long-term potentiation in Rab3a−/− mice9, c-Fos ensemble reorganization and feedforward inhibition growth were both absent in CA3 upon learning, and the memory was imprecise. By contrast, in the absence of adducin 2 (Add2; also known as β-adducin)10 c-Fos reorganization was normal, but feedforward inhibition growth was abolished. In parallel, c-Fos ensembles in CA3 were greatly enlarged, and the memory was imprecise. Feedforward inhibition growth and memory precision were both rescued by re-expression of Add2 specifically in hippocampal mossy fibres. These results establish a causal relationship between learning-related increases in the numbers of defined synapses and the precision of learning and memory in the adult. The results further relate plasticity and feedforward inhibition growth at hippocampal mossy fibres to the precision of hippocampus-dependent memories."
https://openalex.org/W1996900960,"Breast cancer is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that is usually associated with poor outcome and lack of benefit from targeted therapy. We used microarray analysis to perform a pathway analysis of TNBC compared with non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Overexpression of several Wnt pathway genes, such as frizzled homolog 7 (FZD7), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) was observed in TNBC, and we directed our focus to the Wnt pathway receptor, FZD7. To validate the function of FZD7, FZD7shRNA was used to knock down FZD7 expression. Notably, reduced cell proliferation and suppressed invasiveness and colony formation were observed in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Study of the possible mechanism indicated that these effects occurred through silencing of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, as evidenced by loss of nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and decreased transcriptional activity of TCF7. In vivo studies revealed that FZD7shRNA significantly suppressed tumor formation, through reduced cell proliferation, in mice bearing xenografts without FZD7 expression. Our findings suggest that FZD7-involved canonical Wnt signaling pathway is essential for tumorigenesis of TNBC, and thus, FZD7 shows promise as a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2125254321,"Molecular replacement procedures, which search for placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best account for the measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by automatic chain tracing methods, have allowed the rapid solution of large numbers of protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work, molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30% sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3.2 Å resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with >20% sequence identity."

https://openalex.org/W1963966397,"The interaction between cancer cells and microenvironment has a critical role in tumor development and progression. Although microRNAs regulate all the major biological mechanisms, their influence on tumor microenvironment is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the role of microRNAs in the tumor-supportive capacity of stromal cells. We demonstrated that miR-15 and miR-16 are downregulated in fibroblasts surrounding the prostate tumors of the majority of 23 patients analyzed. Such downregulation of miR-15 and miR-16 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoted tumor growth and progression through the reduced post-transcriptional repression of Fgf-2 and its receptor Fgfr1, which act on both stromal and tumor cells to enhance cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration. Moreover, reconstitution of miR-15 and miR-16 impaired considerably the tumor-supportive capability of stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest a molecular circuitry in which miR-15 and miR-16 and their correlated targets cooperate to promote tumor expansion and invasiveness through the concurrent activity on stromal and cancer cells, thus providing further support to the development of therapies aimed at reconstituting miR-15 and miR-16 in advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2166878457,"In adipose tissue, muscle, liver and macrophages, signaling by the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a determinant of insulin sensitivity and this receptor mediates the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs). As PPAR-γ is also expressed in neurons, we generated mice with neuron-specific Pparg knockout (Pparg brain knockout (BKO)) to determine whether neuronal PPAR-γ signaling contributes to either weight gain or insulin sensitivity. During high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, food intake was reduced and energy expenditure increased in Pparg-BKO mice compared to Pparg(f/f) mice, resulting in reduced weight gain. Pparg-BKO mice also responded better to leptin administration than Pparg(f/f) mice. When treated with the TZD rosiglitazone, Pparg-BKO mice were resistant to rosiglitazone-induced hyperphagia and weight gain and, relative to rosiglitazone-treated Pparg(f/f) mice, experienced only a marginal improvement in glucose metabolism. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showed that the increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity induced by rosiglitazone treatment during HFD feeding was completely abolished in Pparg-BKO mice, an effect associated with the failure of rosiglitazone to improve liver insulin receptor signal transduction. We conclude that excess weight gain induced by HFD feeding depends in part on the effect of neuronal PPAR-γ signaling to limit thermogenesis and increase food intake. Neuronal PPAR-γ signaling is also required for the hepatic insulin sensitizing effects of TZDs."
https://openalex.org/W1989360250,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a nuclear receptor that is activated by lipids to induce the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, thereby converting nutritional signals into metabolic consequences. PPAR-γ is the target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, which have been widely prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. A common side effect of treatment with TZDs is weight gain. Here we report a previously unknown role for central nervous system (CNS) PPAR-γ in the regulation of energy balance. We found that both acute and chronic activation of CNS PPAR-γ, by either TZDs or hypothalamic overexpression of a fusion protein consisting of PPAR-γ and the viral transcriptional activator VP16 (VP16-PPAR-γ), led to positive energy balance in rats. Blocking the endogenous activation of CNS PPAR-γ with pharmacological antagonists or reducing its expression with shRNA led to negative energy balance, restored leptin sensitivity in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed rats and blocked the hyperphagic response to oral TZD treatment. These findings have implications for the widespread clinical use of TZD drugs and for understanding the etiology of diet-induced obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1965183541,"How the directionality of vesicle traffic is achieved remains an important unanswered question in cell biology. The Sec23p/Sec24p coat complex sorts the fusion machinery (SNAREs) into vesicles as they bud from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Vesicle tethering to the Golgi begins when the tethering factor TRAPPI binds to Sec23p. Where the coat is released and how this event relates to membrane fusion is unknown. Here we use a yeast transport assay to demonstrate that an ER-derived vesicle retains its coat until it reaches the Golgi. A Golgi-associated kinase, Hrr25p (CK1δ orthologue), then phosphorylates the Sec23p/Sec24p complex. Coat phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are needed for vesicle fusion and budding, respectively. Additionally, we show that Sec23p interacts in a sequential manner with different binding partners, including TRAPPI and Hrr25p, to ensure the directionality of ER-Golgi traffic and prevent the back-fusion of a COPII vesicle with the ER. These events are conserved in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013246050,"Background Development of Type 2 diabetes, like obesity, is promoted by a genetic predisposition. Although several genetic variants have been identified they only account for a small proportion of risk. We have asked if genetic risk is associated with abnormalities in storing excess lipids in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings We recruited 164 lean and 500 overweight/obese individuals with or without a genetic predisposition for Type 2 diabetes or obesity. Adipose cell size was measured in biopsies from the abdominal adipose tissue as well as insulin sensitivity (HOMA index), HDL-cholesterol and Apo AI and Apo B. 166 additional non-obese individuals with a genetic predisposition for Type 2 diabetes underwent a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to measure insulin sensitivity. Genetic predisposition for Type 2 diabetes, but not for overweight/obesity, was associated with inappropriate expansion of the adipose cells, reduced insulin sensitivity and a more proatherogenic lipid profile in non-obese individuals. However, obesity per se induced a similar expansion of adipose cells and dysmetabolic state irrespective of genetic predisposition. Conclusions/Significance Genetic predisposition for Type 2 diabetes, but not obesity, is associated with an impaired ability to recruit new adipose cells to store excess lipids in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, thereby promoting ectopic lipid deposition. This becomes particularly evident in non-obese individuals since obesity per se promotes a dysmetabolic state irrespective of genetic predisposition. These results identify a novel susceptibility factor making individuals with a genetic predisposition for Type 2 diabetes particularly sensitive to the environment and caloric excess."
https://openalex.org/W2020279594,"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity plays a pivotal role in antibody-based tumor therapies and is based on the recruitment of natural killer cells to antibody-bound tumor cells via binding of the Fcγ receptor III (CD16). Here we describe the generation of chimeric DNA aptamers that simultaneously bind to CD16α and c-Met, a receptor that is overexpressed in many tumors. By application of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method, CD16α specific DNA aptamers were isolated that bound with high specificity and affinity (91 pm-195 nm) to their respective recombinant and cellularly expressed target proteins. Two optimized CD16α specific aptamers were coupled to each of two c-Met specific aptamers using different linkers. Bi-specific aptamers retained suitable binding properties and displayed simultaneous binding to both antigens. Moreover, they mediated cellular cytotoxicity dependent on aptamer and effector cell concentration. Displacement of a bi-specific aptamer from CD16α by competing antibody 3G8 reduced cytotoxicity and confirmed the proposed mode of action. These results represent the first gain of a tumor-effective function of two distinct oligonucleotides by linkage into a bi-specific aptamer mediating cellular cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1982245858,"LKB1/STK11 is a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. It is inactivated in 30% of lung cancer cell lines but only 5–15% of primary lung adenocarcinomas. There is evidence that homozygous deletion (HD) of chromosome 19p at the LKB locus contributes to the inactivation of the gene in primary human lung cancers. Here, we used several complementary genetic approaches to assess the LKB1 locus in primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We first analyzed 124 NSCLC cases for allelic imbalance using eight microsatellite markers on chromosome 19p, which revealed an overall rate of 65% (80 of 124) loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We next used chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) to directly examine the chromosomal status of the LKB1 locus. In all, 65 of 124 LOH tested samples were available for CISH and 58 of those (89%) showed either loss of one copy of chromosome 19p (LOH, 40 of 65 cases, 62%) or both copies (HD 18 of 65 cases, 28%). The occurrence of HD was significantly more frequent in Caucasian (35%) than in African-American patients (6%) (P=0.04). A total of 62 of 124 samples with LOH at one or both markers immediately flanking the LKB1 gene were further analyzed by directly sequencing the complete coding region, which identified 7 of 62 (11%) tumors with somatic mutations in the gene. Jointly, our data identified total inactivation of the LKB1 gene by either HD or LOH with somatic mutation in 39% of tested samples, whereas loss of chromosome 19p region by HD or LOH at the LKB1 region occured in 90% of NSCLC."

In rat organotypic hippocampal slices treated to reduce endogenous neuroligin, the authors find that the C-terminal tail of neuroligin is critical for its function. Neuroligins, a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, are important in synaptogenesis through a well-characterized trans-synaptic interaction with neurexin. In addition, neuroligins are thought to drive postsynaptic assembly through binding of their intracellular domain to PSD-95. However, there is little direct evidence to support the functional necessity of the neuroligin intracellular domain in postsynaptic development. We found that presence of endogenous neuroligin obscured the study of exogenous mutated neuroligin. We therefore used chained microRNAs in rat organotypic hippocampal slices to generate a reduced background of endogenous neuroligin. On this reduced background, we found that neuroligin function was critically dependent on the cytoplasmic tail. However, this function required neither the PDZ ligand nor any other previously described cytoplasmic binding domain, but rather required a previously unknown conserved region. Mutation of a single critical residue in this region inhibited neuroligin-mediated excitatory synaptic potentiation. Finally, we found a functional distinction between neuroligins 1 and 3."
https://openalex.org/W2089041551,"Rap1GAP is a critical tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in multiple aggressive cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. However, the mechanistic basis of rap1GAP downregulation in cancers is poorly understood. By employing an integrative approach, we demonstrate polycomb-mediated repression of rap1GAP that involves Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase in head and neck cancers. We further demonstrate that the loss of miR-101 expression correlates with EZH2 upregulation, and the concomitant downregulation of rap1GAP in head and neck cancers. EZH2 represses rap1GAP by facilitating the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27, a mark of gene repression, and also hypermethylation of rap1GAP promoter. These results provide a conceptual framework involving a microRNA–oncogene–tumor suppressor axis to understand head and neck cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2150688588,"Simon John and Mounira Hmani-Aifa and colleagues show that mutation of the serine protease gene Prss56 causes elevated intraocular pressure and angle closure glaucoma in mice. They also identified PRSS56 mutations that cause posterior microphthalmia in humans. Angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) is a subset of glaucoma affecting 16 million people1,2,3. Although 4 million people are bilaterally blind from ACG4,5, the causative molecular mechanisms of ACG remain to be defined. High intraocular pressure induces glaucoma in ACG. High intraocular pressure traditionally was suggested to result from the iris blocking or closing the angle of the eye, thereby limiting aqueous humor drainage. Eyes from individuals with ACG often have a modestly decreased axial length, shallow anterior chamber and relatively large lens, features that predispose to angle closure6. Here we show that genetic alteration of a previously unidentified serine protease (PRSS56) alters axial length and causes a mouse phenotype resembling ACG. Mutations affecting this protease also cause a severe decrease of axial length in individuals with posterior microphthalmia. Together, these data suggest that alterations of this serine protease may contribute to a spectrum of human ocular conditions including reduced ocular size and ACG."
https://openalex.org/W2029810412,"Prostate cancer and breast cancer are the most common malignancies in the western world. Androgen receptor (AR) and PTEN both have been well documented to have important roles in prostate carcinogenesis. In contrast, AR and PTEN in breast carcinogenesis have not been well studied. Furthermore, the crosstalk and connection between those two pathways remain unclear. Increased AR expression in prostate cancers, combined with decreased PTEN expression, portends a poor clinical outcome. Paradoxically, both high AR and high PTEN levels, detected by immunohistochemistry, in primary breast carcinomas have been associated with better disease-free survival. Here, we performed in silico analysis of publicly available microarray data sets from prostate or breast carcinomas. We found an inverse correlation between AR and PTEN transcript expression in prostate cancer tissues in contrast to the positive correlation in breast cancer. These data led us to hypothesize that AR may directly affect PTEN transcriptional regulation in prostate and breast cancer cells. Here, we show for the first time that AR inhibits PTEN transcription in prostate cancer cells, whereas AR upregulates PTEN transcription in breast cancer cells, which mechanistically explains both the immunohistochemical PTEN-AR expressional data noted in clinical trials and in our in silico analysis of the transcriptomes of breast and prostate cancers. In addition, we have fine-mapped the AR-binding motif within the PTEN promoter. Here we show that, in patients with Cowden syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations scattered throughout PTEN, point variants affecting the 3' end of the AR-binding motif result in abrogation of androgen-mediated transcriptional regulation of PTEN expression. We may speculate that the differential AR effect on PTEN may begin to explain organ-specific and perhaps sex-specific neoplasia predisposition in Cowden syndrome, as well as why only a fraction of women with germline PTEN mutations develop breast cancer, depending on the androgen steroid milieu and levels."
https://openalex.org/W2089612851,"Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) is a multifunctional enzyme with an important role in processing antigenic peptides presented to class I major histocompatibility complex in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we found that endoplasmic reticulum-retained ERAP1 was secreted from macrophages in response to activation by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-γ and enhanced their phagocytic activity. Enhancement of the phagocytic activity of murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS/IFN-γ was inhibited by a potent aminopeptidase inhibitor, amastatin. The addition of recombinant wild-type but not inactive mutant ERAP1 to culture medium enhanced phagocytosis. These results suggest that enhancement of phagocytic activity is at least in part mediated by secreted ERAP1 through the generation of active peptides processed by the enzyme. Our data reveal ERAP1-mediated activation of macrophages for the first time and will provide new insights into the role of this enzyme in innate immunity."

The aim of these studies was to identify microRNAs that are aberrantly regulated during inflammation and may participate in transformation of colonic epithelial cells in the inflammatory setting. Methodology/Principal Findings We have use quantitative PCR arrays to compare microRNA (miRNA) expression in tumors and control colonic epithelial cells isolated from distal colons of chronically inflamed mice and APCMin/+ mice. Rank order statistics was utilized to identify differentially regulated miRNAs in tumors that arose due to chronic inflammation and/or to germline APC mutation. Eight high priority miRNAs were identified: miR-215, miR-137, miR-708, miR-31, and miR-135b were differentially expressed in APC tumors and miR-215, miR-133a, miR-467d, miR-218, miR-708, miR-31, and miR-135b in colitis-associated tumors. Four of these (miR-215, miR-708, miR-31, and miR-135b) were common to both tumors types, and dysregulation of these miRNAs was confirmed in an independent sample set. Target prediction and pathway analysis suggests that these microRNAs, in the aggregate, regulate signaling pathways related to MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and TGF-β, all of which are known to be involved in transformation. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that these four miRNAs are dysregulated at some very early stage in transformation of colonic epithelial cells. This response is not dependent on the mechanism of initiation of transformation (inflammation versus germline mutation), suggesting that the miRNAs that we have identified are likely to regulate critical signaling pathways that are central to early events in transformation of colonic epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069902808,"Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, has been recently shown to suppress cell proliferation and to stimulate the expression of cyclin G2 (CCNG2) in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these events are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of CCNG2 by the Nodal signaling pathway. In ovarian cancer cells, overexpression of Nodal or its receptors, activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) or ALK4, resulted in an increase in the CCNG2 promoter activity. Several putative Forkhead box class O (FoxO)3a-binding sites are present in the human CCNG2 promoter and overexpression of FoxO3a enhanced the CCNG2 promoter activity. The functional FoxO3a-binding element (FBE) was mapped to a proximal region located between −398 and −380 bp (FBE1) through deletion and mutation analyses, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Interestingly, mutation of the FBE1 not only abolished the effect of FoxO3a, but also blocked Nodal-induced CCNG2 transcription. Nodal stimulated FoxO3a mRNA and protein expression through the canonical Smad pathway and suppressed FoxO3a inactivation by inhibiting AKT activity. Silencing of FoxO3a using small interfering RNA significantly reduced the effect of Nodal on the CCNG2 promoter activity. On the other hand, overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 enhanced the FoxO3a-induced CCNG2 promoter activity whereas knockdown of Smad4 blocked the activity of FoxO3a. Furthermore, IP assays revealed that FoxO3a formed complexes with Smad proteins and that Nodal enhanced the binding of FoxO3a to the CCNG2 promoter. Finally, silencing of FoxO3a reversed the inhibitory effect of Nodal on cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Nodal signaling promotes CCNG2 transcription by upregulating FoxO3a expression, inhibiting FoxO3a phosphorylation and enhancing its synergistic interaction with Smads. These results also suggest that FoxO3a is an important mediator of Nodal signaling in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967767666,"Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a fatal adult T-cell leukemia. Through deregulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways the viral Tax protein has a pivotal role in T-cell transformation. In response to stressful stimuli, cells mount a cellular stress response to limit the damage that environmental forces inflict on DNA or proteins. During stress response, cells postpone the translation of most cellular mRNAs, which are gathered into cytoplasmic mRNA-silencing foci called stress granules (SGs) and allocate their available resources towards the production of dedicated stress-management proteins. Here we demonstrate that Tax controls the formation of SGs and interferes with the cellular stress response pathway. In agreement with previous reports, we observed that Tax relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress. We found that the presence of Tax in the cytoplasm of stressed cells prevents the formation of SGs and counteracts the shutoff of specific host proteins. Unexpectedly, nuclear localization of Tax promotes spontaneous aggregation of SGs, even in the absence of stress. Mutant analysis revealed that the SG inhibitory capacity of Tax is independent of its transcriptional abilities but relies on its interaction with histone deacetylase 6, a critical component of SGs. Importantly, the stress-protective effect of Tax was also observed in the context of HTLV-1 infected cells, which were shown to be less prone to form SGs and undergo apoptosis under arsenite exposure. These observations identify Tax as the first virally encoded inhibitory component of SGs and unravel a new strategy developed by HTLV-1 to deregulate normal cell processes. We postulate that inhibition of the stress response pathway by Tax would favor cell survival under stressful conditions and may have an important role in HTLV-1-induced cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1970587777,"Progenitor cells are considered an important cell of origin of human malignancies. However, there has not been any single gene that can define mammary bipotential progenitor cells, and as such it has not been possible to use genetic methods to introduce oncogenic alterations into these cells in vivo to study tumorigenesis from them. Keratin 6a is expressed in a subset of mammary luminal epithelial cells and body cells of terminal end buds. By generating transgenic mice using the Keratin 6a (K6a) gene promoter to express tumor virus A (tva), which encodes the receptor for avian leukosis virus subgroup A (ALV/A), we provide direct evidence that K6a(+) cells are bipotential progenitor cells, and the first demonstration of a non-basal location for some biopotential progenitor cells. These K6a(+) cells were readily induced to form mammary tumors by intraductal injection of RCAS (an ALV/A-derived vector) carrying the gene encoding the polyoma middle T antigen. Tumors in this K6a-tva line were papillary and resembled the normal breast-like subtype of human breast cancer. This is the first model of this subtype of human tumors and thus may be useful for preclinical testing of targeted therapy for patients with normal-like breast cancer. These observations also provide direct in vivo evidence for the hypothesis that the cell of origin affects mammary tumor phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2043702598,"We have studied the effects of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) on tumor angiogenesis in murine ductal mammary adenocarcinomas. We crossed transgenic mice with whey acidic protein promoter-driven large T-antigen expression (WAP-T mice) with oncogene-induced mammary carcinogenesis with CEACAM1null mice, and with Tie2-Ceacam1 transgenics, in which the Tie2 promoter drives endothelial overexpression of CEACAM1 (WAP-T × CEACAM1endo+ mice), and analyzed tumor vascularization, angiogenesis and vessel maturation in these mice. Using flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) and histology, we found that WAP-T × CEACAM1endo+ mice exhibited enhanced tumoral vascularization owing to CEACAM1+ vessels in the tumor periphery, and increased intratumoral angiogenesis compared with controls. In contrast, vascularization of CEACAM1null/WAP-T-derived tumors was poor, and tumor vessels were dilated, leaky and showed poor pericyte coverage. Consequently, the tumoral vasculature could not be visualized in CEACAM1null/WAP-T mice by fpVCT, and we observed poor organization of the perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM), accompanied by the accumulation of collagen IV-degrading matrix metalloproteinase 9+ (MMP9+) leukocytes and stromal cells. Vascular instability and alterations in ECM structure were accompanied by a significant increase in pulmonary metastases in CEACAM1null/WAP-T mice, whereas only occasional metastases were observed in CEACAM1+ hosts. In CEACAM1+ hosts, intratumoral vessels did not express CEACAM1, but they were intact, extensively covered with pericytes and framed by a well-organized perivascular ECM. MMP9+ accessory cells were largely absent. Orthotopic transplantation of primary WAP-T- and CEACAM1null/WAP-T tumors into all three mouse lines confirmed that a CEACAM1+ host environment is a prerequisite for productive angiogenic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Hence, CEACAM1 expression in the tumor periphery determines the vascular phenotype in a tumor, whereas systemic absence of CEACAM1 interferes with the formation of an organized tumor matrix and intratumoral vessel maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2004315299,"Although they contain NMDA receptors, hippocampal mossy fiber synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cells have been reported to lack conventional NMDA receptor–dependent LTP of AMPA EPSCs. Here, the authors find that LTP of NMDA receptors serves as a metaplastic switch, making mossy fiber synapses competent to express NMDA receptor–dependent LTP of AMPA EPSCs. Hippocampal mossy fiber synapses have been reported to lack NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), unlike conventional glutamatergic synapses. An explanation for this difference may reside in the relatively low number of NMDARs at these synapses. Because mossy fiber synapses display LTP selective for NMDARs, we examined whether this would affect the plasticity rules at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses in mouse hippocampal slices. We found that LTP of NMDARs serves as a metaplastic switch making mossy fiber synapses competent for generating NMDAR-dependent LTP of AMPA EPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1986867661,"Akt activation is common in progressive thyroid cancer. In breast cancer, Akt1 induces primary cancer growth, but is reported to inhibit metastasis in vivo in several model systems. In contrast, clinical and in vitro studies suggest a metastasis-promoting role for Akt1 in thyroid cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the functional role of Akt1 in thyroid cancer growth and metastatic progression in vivo using thyroid hormone receptor (TR) βPV/PV knock-in (PV) mice, which develop metastatic thyroid cancer. We crossed Akt1−/− and PV mice and compared tumor development, local progression, metastasis and histology in TRβPV/PV/Akt1+/+ (PVPV-Akt1WT) and TRβPV/PV/Akt1−/− (PVPV-Akt1KO) mice. Mice were killed at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months; necropsy was performed and serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured. Thyroid hyperplasia occurred in both groups beginning at 3 months; the thyroid size was greater in the PVPV-Akt1WT mice (P<0.001). In comparison with PVPV-Akt1WT mice, thyroid cancer development was delayed in the PVPV-Akt1KO mice (P=0.003) and the degree of tumor invasiveness was reduced. The PVPV-Akt1WT mice displayed pulmonary metastases at 12 and 15 months of age, by contrast PVPV-Akt1KO mice did not develop distant metastases at 15 months of age. Despite continued expression of Akt2 or Akt3, pAkt levels were decreased and there was evidence of reduced Akt effect on p27 in the PVPV-Akt1KO thyroids. TSH levels were similarly elevated in PV mice regardless of Akt1 expression. In conclusion, thyroid cancer development and progression in TR βPV/PV mice are Akt1-dependent, consistent with a tumor progression-promoting role in this murine thyroid cancer model."
https://openalex.org/W2061177157,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by abnormal and dysplastic maturation of all blood lineages. Even though epigenetic alterations have been seen in MDS marrow progenitors, very little is known about the molecular alterations in dysplastic peripheral blood cells. We analyzed the methylome of MDS leukocytes by the HELP assay and determined that it was globally distinct from age-matched controls and was characterized by numerous novel, aberrant hypermethylated marks that were located mainly outside of CpG islands and preferentially affected GTPase regulators and other cancer-related pathways. Additionally, array comparative genomic hybridization revealed that novel as well as previously characterized deletions and amplifications could also be visualized in peripheral blood leukocytes, thus potentially reducing the need for bone marrow samples for future studies. Using integrative analysis, potentially pathogenic genes silenced by genetic deletions and aberrant hypermethylation in different patients were identified. DOCK4, a GTPase regulator located in the commonly deleted 7q31 region, was identified by this unbiased approach. Significant hypermethylation and reduced expression of DOCK4 in MDS bone marrow stem cells was observed in two large independent datasets, providing further validation of our findings. Finally, DOCK4 knockdown in primary marrow CD34(+) stem cells led to decreased erythroid colony formation and increased apoptosis, thus recapitulating the bone marrow failure seen in MDS. These findings reveal widespread novel epigenetic alterations in myelodysplastic leukocytes and implicate DOCK4 as a pathogenic gene located on the 7q chromosomal region."

Although the oncogenic roles of pRb/E2F1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways have been well studied, the functional interaction between the two pathways has only recently been characterized. In particular, E2F1 has been recently reported to negatively regulate Wnt/β-catenin activity in human colorectal cancers, though the mechanism underlying this regulation is not fully understood. Here we provide evidence that β-catenin interacting protein 1 (CTNNBIP1), also known as ICAT (inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF4), functions as a crucial node to mediate the cross talk between E2F1 and β-catenin signaling. We show that ICAT is a direct transcriptional target of E2F1, and that activation of ICAT by E2F1 is required for E2F1 to inhibit β-catenin activity. This study provides a mechanistic insight into the antagonistic interaction between E2F1 and β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1998976837,"Mitosis is the most conspicuous cell cycle phase, because it is the phase in which the dynamic physical distributions of cellular components into the two daughter cells occur. The separation of sister chromatids is especially important during mitosis, because of the extreme accuracy required for distribution to the next generation of cells. Shugoshin-like 1 (SGOL1) is a key protein in protecting sister chromatids from precocious separation. We have reported finding that chromosome instability is more likely in SGOL1-downregulated colorectal cancers, but it is still unknown whether there is an association between cancer and SGOL1 transcript variation. Here, we identified a novel SGOL1 variant, SGOL1-P1, in human colon cancer. The SGOL1-P1 transcript contains an exon-skip of exon 3 that results in a stop codon occurring within exon 4. Overexpression of SGOL1-P1 in HCT116 cells resulted in an increased number of cells with aberrant chromosome alignment, precociously separated chromatids and delayed mitotic progression, occasionally followed by inaccurate distribution of the chromosomes. These phenotypes, observed when SGOL1-P1 was present, were also observed very frequently in SGOL1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of SGOL1-P1 inhibited the localization of endogenous SGOL1 and cohesin subunit RAD21/SCC1 to the centromere. These results suggest that SGOL1-P1 may function as a negative factor to native SGOL1, and that abundant expression of SGOL1-P1 may be responsible for chromosomal instability."

The C-terminal domain 20 of HufH contains the binding site for sialylated gonococci. We exploited differences in amino acid sequences between human and non-binding chimpanzee fH domain 20 to create cross-species mutations to define amino acids important for binding to sialylated gonococci. We used fH/Fc fusion constructs that contained contiguous fH domains 18-20 fused to Fc fragments of murine IgG2a. The Fc region was used both as a tag for detection of each fusion molecule on the bacterial surface and as an indicator for complement-dependent killing. Arg-1203 was critical for binding to both porin (Por) B.1A and PorB.1B strains. Modeling of the R1203N human-to-chimpanzee mutation using the crystal structure of HufH19-20 as a template showed a loss of positive charge that protrudes at the C terminus of domain 20. We tested the functional importance of Arg-1203 by incubating sialylated gonococci with normal human serum, in the presence of wild-type HufH18-20/Fc or its R1203A mutant. Gonococci bound and were killed by wild-type HufH18-20/Fc but not by the R1203A mutant. A recombinant fH/Fc molecule that contained chimpanzee domain 20, humanized only at amino acid 1203 (N1203R) also bound to sialylated gonococci and restored killing.

The underlying mechanism of osajin-induced cancer cell death is not clearly understood. In the present study, the mechanisms of osajin-induced cell death of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells were explored. Osajin was found to significantly induce apoptosis of NPC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Multiple molecular effects were observed during osajin treatment including a significant loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, enhanced expression of Fas ligand (FasL), suppression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), and activation of caspases-9, -8, -4 and -3. In addition, up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax protein and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein were also observed. Taken together, osajin induces apoptosis in human NPC cells through multiple apoptotic pathways, including the extrinsic death receptor pathway, and intrinsic pathways relying on mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, osajin could be developed as a new effective and chemopreventive compound for human NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2017495040,"In bacteria, RuvABC is required for the resolution of Holliday junctions (HJ) made during homologous recombination. The RuvAB complex catalyzes HJ branch migration and replication fork reversal (RFR). During RFR, a stalled fork is reversed to form a HJ adjacent to a DNA double strand end, a reaction that requires RuvAB in certain Escherichia coli replication mutants. The exact structure of active RuvAB complexes remains elusive as it is still unknown whether one or two tetramers of RuvA support RuvB during branch migration and during RFR. We designed an E. coli RuvA mutant, RuvA2(KaP), specifically impaired for RuvA tetramer-tetramer interactions. As expected, the mutant protein is impaired for complex II (two tetramers) formation on HJs, although the binding efficiency of complex I (a single tetramer) is as wild type. We show that although RuvA complex II formation is required for efficient HJ branch migration in vitro, RuvA2(KaP) is fully active for homologous recombination in vivo. RuvA2(KaP) is also deficient at forming complex II on synthetic replication forks, and the binding affinity of RuvA2(KaP) for forks is decreased compared with wild type. Accordingly, RuvA2(KaP) is inefficient at processing forks in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that RuvA2(KaP) is a separation-of-function mutant, capable of homologous recombination but impaired for RFR. RuvA2(KaP) is defective for stimulation of RuvB activity and stability of HJ·RuvA·RuvB tripartite complexes. This work demonstrates that the need for RuvA tetramer-tetramer interactions for full RuvAB activity in vitro causes specifically an RFR defect in vivo."

It was shown previously that individual water molecules can stabilize between Asp(15) and the buried [3Fe-4S](0) cluster and thus can potentially act as a proton relay in transferring H(+) from the protein to the μ(2) sulfur atom. Here, we generalize molecular mechanics with proton transfer to studying proton transfer reactions in the condensed phase. Both umbrella sampling simulations and electronic structure calculations suggest that the PT Asp(15)-COOH + H(2)O + [3Fe-4S](0) → Asp(15)-COO(-) + H(2)O + [3Fe-4S](0) H(+) is concerted, and no stable intermediate hydronium ion (H(3)O(+)) is expected. The free energy difference of 11.7 kcal/mol for the forward reaction is in good agreement with the experimental value (13.3 kcal/mol). For the reverse reaction (Asp(15)-COO(-) + H(2)O + [3Fe-4S](0)H(+) → Asp(15)-COOH + H(2)O + [3Fe-4S](0)), a larger barrier than for the forward reaction is correctly predicted, but it is quantitatively overestimated (23.1 kcal/mol from simulations versus 14.1 from experiment). Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Compared with the water-assisted process (ΔE ≈ 10 kcal/mol), water-unassisted proton transfer yields a considerably higher barrier of ΔE ≈ 35 kcal/mol."

Consistent with the above role, A20-deficient cells demonstrate prolonged NF-κB activation in response to TNFα, and mice deficient in A20 develop severe inflammation, show hypersensitivity to LPS and TNFα, and die early (8Lee E.G.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8, is an oncogenic γ2 herpesvirus that is the etiological agent of Kaposi sarcoma (9Dourmishev L.A. Dourmishev A.L.

One of the KSHV proteins that is expressed in all cells latently infected with KSHV is K13 (11Stürzl M. Hohenadl C. Zietz C. Castanos-Velez E. Wunderlich A. Ascherl G. Biberfeld P. Monini P.

However, subsequent work showed that K13 is not an inhibitor of caspase 8/FLICE but is a potent activator of the NF-κB pathway and uses this pathway to promote cellular proliferation, survival, transformation, cytokine secretion, and KSHV latency (13Sun Q.

Because A20 is a key regulator of inflammatory response, in this study, we have examined the effect of K13 on A20 expression. Our results demonstrate that A20 expression is up-regulated by K13, and in turn A20 blocks K13-induced NF-κB activity. 293T, BC1, BC3, BCBL1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and APK1 cells were obtained from Dr. Jae Jung (University of Southern California). 293T and BCBL1 cells expressing an empty vector and K13 have been described previously (21Zhao J.

Recombinant retroviruses were generated and used to infect 293T, BCBL1, and MEF cells essentially as described previously (27Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The 293T cells were transfected in a 24-well plate with various test plasmids (250 ng/well) along with the WT or mutant A20 luciferase reporter constructs (75 ng/well) and a pRSV/LacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter construct (75 ng/well) using calcium phosphate as described previously (24Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 24–36 h later, and extracts were used for the measurement of firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to the β-galactosidase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (28Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies used in these experiments were: p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NEMO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKKα/β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), A20 (Cell Signaling), p-IκBα (Cell Signaling), total IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tubulin (mouse monoclonal; Sigma), and mouse monoclonal M2 FLAG (Sigma). A mouse monoclonal antibody against K13 (8F6) was raised in our laboratory. FLAG, control mouse IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG beads were obtained from Sigma and used in co-immunoprecipitation studies as described previously (28Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of the p65 subunit was measured in triplicate in the nuclear extracts using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based NF-κB DNA binding assay, as described previously (21Zhao J. Punj V. Matta H. Mazzacurati L. Schamus S. Yang Y. Yang T. Hong Y. Chaudhary P.M. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Human CCL20 and IL-8 were measured in the cell culture supernatant using ELISA kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and BD Pharmingen, respectively. The ELISA was performed following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Soft agar assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Sun Q. Zachariah S. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52437-52445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat1 K13 cells expressing an empty vector or A20 were overlaid as a single cell suspension of 1000 cells in 1.0 ml of 0.4% Bacto-agar onto a 3.5-cm tissue culture dish containing a 0.6% agar base. All agar media were made with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum, penicillin/streptomycin. Triplicate plates were prepared for each tested cell line and inspected for colony formation after incubation at 37 °C for 14 days. siRNA oligonucleotides against A20 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p65 siRNA has been described previously (18Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected using Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) and following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Following transfection, cells were immediately transferred to a 24-well plate containing prewarmed antibiotic-free medium and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were first examined for knock-down of A20 expression by Western blotting, and then the lysates were assayed for NF-κB luciferase reporter activity. A two-tailed paired Student's t test was used to test for differences between two groups. Differences with a p ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times with triplicate samples. A20 is a tumor suppressor, and recent studies have demonstrated a loss of its expression in several subtypes of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3Hymowitz S.G. Wertz I.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine whether A20 expression is also lost in PEL, we used Western blotting to examine its expression in four PEL cell lines, BC1, BC3, BCBL1, and APK1. The BC1 cells are dually infected with KSHV and EBV, whereas the BC3, BCBL1 and APK1 cells are infected with KSHV only. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed robust expression of A20 in BC1 and BC3 and low level expression in BCBL1 and APK1 cell lines. Immunoblotting using a K13 monoclonal antibody revealed that expression of A20 in the four PEL cell lines correlated closely with their level of endogenous K13 expression, implying a causal association (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis further, we took advantage of BCBL1 cells that had been engineered to express FLAG-tagged K13 ectopically by retroviral-mediated gene transfer (21Zhao J. Punj V. Matta H. Mazzacurati L. Schamus S. Yang Y. Yang T. Hong Y. Chaudhary P.M. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that K13 up-regulates A20 expression, the BCBL1-K13 cells demonstrated a marked increase in A20 expression compared with the BCBL1-vector cells (Fig. 1B). Induction of A20 expression by ectopic K13 expression, however, was not limited to BCBL1 cells but was also observed in the 293T cell line (Fig. 1B). Taken collectively, the above results demonstrate that K13 is a key determinant of A20 expression in PEL. To determine the mechanism of A20 up-regulation by K13, we examined the effect of ectopic K13 expression on the transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter construct (A20-Luc) driven by the A20 promoter region (25Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We transfected the A20-Luc reporter plasmid into 293T cells along with an empty vector or an expression plasmid encoding K13 and measured the luciferase activity in the cell lysates 28–30 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2A, transient expression of K13 resulted in a >8-fold increase in A20 luciferase reporter activity compared with transfection with an empty vector, suggesting that K13 up-regulates A20 expression at the transcriptional level. The A20 promoter region contains two NF-κB sites residing at −54 and −66 nucleotides from the putative transcription start site which have been shown to play a key role in response to TNFα stimulation (25Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the A20 promoter has a negative upstream promoter element called ELIE (Elongation Inhibitory Element) (30Amir-Zilberstein L. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1317-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of these NF-κB and ELIE sites in K13-induced A20 promoter activation, we transfected 293T cells with either a luciferase reporter construct containing the wild-type A20 promoter (A20-WT-Luc) or reporter constructs bearing mutations in the NF-κB (A20-mNF-κB-Luc) and ELIE sites (A20-m1-Luc), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, K13-induced A20 promoter activity was markedly attenuated in the A20-mNF-κB-Luc construct. On the other hand, mutation of the ELIE site had no effect on K13-induced A20 promoter activation. The role of the NF-κB sites in K13-induced A20 promoter activation was confirmed by an independent experiment involving expression of a K13-ERTAM fusion protein in which K13 activity is controlled at the post-translational level by fusion with a mutated estrogen receptor (18Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mutated estrogen receptor (ERTAM) in this construct does not bind to the physiological ligand estrogen but binds with very high affinity to the synthetic ligand 4OHT and regulates the activity of K13 in a 4OHT-dependent fashion (18Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous results, 4OHT treatment strongly activated the luciferase activity in cells transfected with K13-ERTAM and A20-WT-Luc construct but not in those transfected with K13-ERTAM and A20-mNF-κB-Luc (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of the NF-κB sites in K13-mediated A20 gene expression. To confirm the role of the NF-κB pathway in K13-induced A20 promoter activation, we used three previously described point mutants of K13, K13-58AAA (E58A/C59A/L60A), K13-65AAA (R65A/R66A/D67A), and K13-67AAA (D67A/L68A/L69A), which are defective in NF-κB activation (14Sun Q. Zachariah S. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52437-52445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) Consistent with their loss of NF-κB activating ability, these mutants failed to activate the A20-Luc construct (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, no A20 promoter activation was observed upon co-expression of the vFLIP E8 from the equine herpesvirus 2, which resembles K13 in structure but lacks the ability to activate the NF-κB pathway (24Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 31Matta H. Punj V. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chen A.M. Song R. Yang T. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5243-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, co-expression of human T cell leukemia-encoded Tax protein, which resembles K13 in activating the NF-κB pathway, led to A20 promoter activation (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results indicate that K13-induced NF-κB activity is likely involved in A20 promoter activation. K13 activates the NF-κB pathway by activating a ∼700-kDa IKK complex consisting of IKK1/IKKα, IKK2/IKKβ, and NEMO/IKKγ which phosphorylates IκBα, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the proteasome (28Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of dominant negative mutants of IκBα, IKK1/IKKα, and IKK2/IKKβ on K13-induced A20 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2E, K13-induced A20 promoter activity was completely blocked by a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of IκBα in which the two critical serine residues have been mutated to alanine (IκBα S32A/S36A), and a deletion mutant of IκBα lacking the N-terminal 36 amino acids (IκBαΔN). Similarly, kinase-dead mutants of IKK1 and IKK2 effectively blocked K13-induced A20 promoter activity (Fig. 2E). We next examined whether K13-induced A20 promoter activity could be antagonized by pharmacologic inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway. We have previously reported that Bay-11-7082, a specific inhibitor of the NF-κB, can block K13-induced NF-κB activity and spindle cell transformation of human vascular endothelial cells (18Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, treatment with Bay-11-7082 also blocked K13-induced A20 promoter activity in 293T cells (Fig. 2F). Because K13 activates the NF-κB pathway by activating the IKK complex (24Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Liu L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of a specific inhibitor of this complex, PS1145 (32Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Mitsiades C. Mitsiades N. Hayashi T. Munshi N. Dang L. Castro A. Palombella V. Adams J. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16639-16647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), to block K13-induced A20 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2F, this inhibitor effectively blocked K13-transactivated A20 promoter activity. Arsenic trioxide, another known inhibitor of K13-induced NF-κB activation (33Matta H. Sun Q. Moses G. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), also blocked K13-induced A20 promoter activity (Fig. 2F). Taken collectively, these results confirm the importance of the IKK complex and the NF-κB pathway in K13-induced A20 promoter activation. A20 is a key player in the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB signaling in response to multiple stimuli, including TNFα and IL-1β (34Vereecke L. Beyaert R. van Loo G. Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 383-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB activation by human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 Tax protein, which resembles K13 in activating NF-κB by directly binding to NEMO, has been reported to be resistant to A20 (7Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effect of A20 on K13- and Tax-induced NF-κB activity. For this purpose, we transfected 293T cells with an NF-κB driven luciferase-based reporter construct along with K13 and Tax in the presence or absence of A20 and ∼24 h after transfection examined the induction NF-κB promoter activity by a luciferase assay. A20 effectively blocked K13-induced NF-κB activity but had only a minor effect of Tax induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, A20 co-expression led to near complete inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity in 293T cells that had been transfected with the K13-ERTAM construct and treated with 4OHT (Fig. 3C). A20 contains two ubiquitin-editing domains, an N-terminal deubiquitinating domain of the OTU family, and a C-terminal ubiquitin ligase domain that contains seven zinc fingers (3Hymowitz S.G. Wertz I.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Both these domains have been shown to play a role in inhibiting NF-κB activity. To determine the role of these domains in K13-induced NF-κB activity, we tested the ability of A20 deletion mutants containing its N-terminal (1–380) and C-terminal (373–790) domains to block K13-induced NF-κB activity. We observed that both domains of A20 contributed to inhibition of K13-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 3D). Essentially similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated using the K13-ERTAM construct (Fig. 3E). We and others have shown that K13 induces the expression of a large number of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma (15Sun Q. Matta H. Lu G. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M.

Blood. 2009; 113: 5660-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because A20 is known to block the inflammatory response, we examined the effect of A20 on K13-induced promoter activation of two inflammatory chemokines, CCL20 and IL-8. As shown in Fig. 4, A–D, luciferase-based reporter assays showed that A20 blocks the induction of CCL20 and IL-8 by K13 by blocking the transcriptional activation of their promoters. Furthermore, co-expression of A20 blocked the induction of both these chemokines by K13 as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4, E and F). Anchorage-independent growth is a characteristic feature of transformed cells. We have demonstrated previously that ectopic expression of K13 in Rat1 fibroblast cells confers on them the ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner and form colonies in soft agar. To examine the effect of A20 on K13-induced cellular transformation, we generated stable populations of Rat1-K13 cells expressing an empty vector and A20 (Fig. 4G). We next used a soft agar colony formation assay to test the effect of A20 on K13-induced cellular transformation. As shown in Fig. 4H, we observed greater than 4-fold reduction in soft agar colony formation in the Rat1-K13 cells transfected with the A20 expression vector compared with those transfected with the control vector. The mechanism by which A20 blocks NF-κB is not entirely clear, and contradictory results have been reported on the effects of A20 on NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding.

Although RGS13 expression is induced by immune receptor and chemokine receptor stimulation, the molecular regulation of RGS13 transcription is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of two p53 response elements (REs) in the regulation of RGS13 promoter activity and expression. We found that a 1000-bp DNA fragment upstream of the ATG translation start site (TSS) had promoter activity in reporter gene assays, and deletion or mutation of a p53-binding motif nearest the TSS abolished promoter activity. Notably, p53 bound to both REs in the RGS13 promoter in vivo as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the p53 RE most distal to the TSS is physiologically inactive. We detected reduced RGS13 expression in MCs exogenously expressing p53 or treated with doxorubicin, which induces genotoxic stress and leads to p53 accumulation. RNA silencing of p53 up-regulated RGS13 expression in B lymphocytes, and bone marrow-derived MCs from p53−/− mice had increased RGS13 expression. Finally, p53-depleted B cells with increased RGS13 expression had reduced Ca2+ mobilization in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate. These studies indicate that p53 may modulate immune responses through suppression of RGS13 transcription in MCs and B cells.

RGS13 reduces IgE-antigen-dependent PI3K activation, a critical downstream event in the degranulation pathway, by binding the PI3K p85α regulatory subunit and blocking its interaction with an Fc∈ receptor I-associated signaling complex.Within the hematopoietic compartment, RGS13 expression is highly restricted and subject to transcriptional regulation. RGS13 is specifically expressed in germinal center (GC) B lymphocytes and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (which resemble GC B cells) (4Shi G.X. Harrison K. Wilson G.L. Moratz C. Kehrl J.H. J.

GPCR activation of the human MC line HMC1 by either C5a or CXCL12, but not adenosine, also increases RGS13 protein levels (6Bansal G. DiVietro J.A. Kuehn H.S. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Gilfillan A.M.

In contrast, treatment of the human MC line LAD2 with a permeable cAMP analog, which activates the cAMP response element-binding protein pathway, reduces RGS13 mRNA expression (9Xie Z. Yang Z. Druey K.M. J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 2: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest involvement of various transcription factors activated by these stimuli (e.g. and NFκB) in the regulation of RGS13 transcription, the molecular determinants of RGS13 expression under homeostatic conditions or in activated MCs or B cells have not been characterized.Analysis of the RGS13 locus upstream of the published mRNA sequence revealed potential binding sites for several transcription factors, including two motifs with considerable homology to a consensus p53-binding site. p53 is a master regulator of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, which together actively suppress oncogenesis in response to stress signals (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 11Kruse J.P. Gu W. Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterize the RGS13 promoter and demonstrate the presence of an active p53-binding site, which suppresses RGS13 transcription in MCs and B lymphocytes.DISCUSSIONThis study is the first to identify and characterize molecular determinants of RGS13 expression. RGS13 meets the definition of a p53 response gene according to published criteria (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar): 1) it contains putative p53 REs in its upstream promoter region; 2) manipulation of p53 expression or elimination of the p53-binding motif modifies RGS13 promoter activity; 3) p53 binds to the identified RE in vivo as assessed by ChIP; and 4) manipulation of p53 levels leads to changes in the expression of both RGS13 mRNA and protein.Prior work demonstrated that another member of the RGS family (RGS16) is a p53 response gene. Treatment with doxorubicin or exogenous p53 expression induces rapid and robust up-regulation of RGS16 mRNA expression in colon or breast cancer cell lines (17Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J. Seizinger B.R. Gutkind J.S. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7868-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although purified p53 was reported to bind elements resembling p53-binding motifs located in intronic/3′-UTR regions of RGS16, it was unclear whether p53 regulated RGS16 transcription directly. In contrast to these studies, we showed that p53 quantities correlated inversely with RGS13 expression in MCs. Cells with increased p53 levels as a result of cell stress (doxorubicin treatment) or plasmid-based p53 transfection had reduced RGS13 expression due to direct inhibition of the RGS13 promoter by p53.We characterized the RGS13 promoter in total and found that its regulation is likely to be complex. We characterized an ∼1000-bp DNA fragment flanking the experimentally determined TSS (RGS13 1000) that had promoter activity in MCs. A reporter containing the RGS13 promoter had minimal activity in cells that do not express RGS13 (supplemental Fig. S2), which is consistent with the limited expression of RGS13 in a limited number of cell types. Although we did not find putative binding motifs for transcription factors unique to MCs and/or B lymphocytes in the RGS13 promoter region by bioinformatic analysis, we did identify elements resembling binding sites for PU.1 (−1263), GATA1 (−487), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (−273). These transcription factors, which are expressed highly in MC progenitors, are all required to some extent for MC differentiation and could thus contribute to the high expression of RGS13 in MCs (16Takemoto C.M. Brandal S. Jegga A.G. Lee Y.N. Shahlaee A. Ying Y. Dekoter R. McDevitt M.A. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 4349-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In contrast to the promoter activity of RGS13 1000, a fragment containing this sequence plus an additional ∼900-bp upstream flanking sequence (RGS13 2000) had no promoter activity in reporter assays. This result suggests that elements in the sequence between −691 and −1564 inhibit responsiveness of RGS13 1000. However, the distal p53 RE located in this region is not likely to be involved in the negative regulation of the RGS13 promoter, as mutation of its p53-binding motif did not affect promoter activity. The RGS13 gene locus may also have as yet uncharacterized enhancers and/or repressors in its first three introns or exons because the coding sequence is contained entirely in exons 4–6. We included exon 1 and a portion of intron 1 in our reporter constructs, and these sequences could impose negative or positive modulation of the upstream regulatory regions studied here. Further work will be needed to determine whether selective use of such elements could also contribute to the highly cell type-specific expression of RGS13 in MCs and GC B cells. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated for a conserved 3′-noncoding region of Il4, which acts as an essential enhancer for Il4 gene transcription in MCs but not in basophils (21Yagi R. Tanaka S. Motomura Y. Kubo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8087-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The detailed mechanism(s) whereby p53 suppresses RGS13 transcription will also require further study. Repression of gene transcription by p53 may be either direct or indirect. p53 has the capacity to “squelch” the activity of nearby activating transcription factors, primarily of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, by steric hindrance (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). We identified several potential C/EBPβ-binding sites in the RGS13 promoter, the closest located 321 bp from the active p53-binding site. Alternatively, p53 may inactivate certain transcription factors by direct binding, namely Sp1, C/EBPβ, and AP1. In addition to the aforementioned C/EBP motif, we identified a putative Sp1-binding site located 95 bp from the proximal p53 RE. Finally, p53 may also repress gene transcription indirectly through activation of histone deacetylases (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar).The expression of RGS proteins is often low in unstimulated cells (22Bansal G. Druey K.M. Xie Z. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 116: 473-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because of their strong catalytic activity, which promotes termination of GPCR pathways, such tight control of the basal transcription of RGS genes may permit a certain level of homeostatic GPCR signaling. Abnormal expression of RGS genes may occur in neoplastic or inflammatory conditions. RGS13 is difficult to detect in normal T cells but is overexpressed in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells (3Johnson E.N. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16768-16774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Dohoney K. Morris J.C. O'Mahony D. Lee M.J. Trepel J. Waldmann T.A. Janik J.E. Brady J.N. Blood. 2009; 113: 4016-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, RGS13 is strongly expressed in GC B cells and Burkitt lymphomas (which resemble GC B cells) (4Shi G.X. Harrison K. Wilson G.L. Moratz C. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2507-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but is absent in B cell lymphomas with a mantle cell phenotype (24Islam T.C. Asplund A.C. Lindvall J.M. Nygren L. Liden J. Kimby E. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Sander B. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The relationship of these variations in RGS13 expression to p53, if any, is unknown. Although several SNPs in RGS13 were identified in mantle cell phenotype lymph nodes, which were located in noncoding regions downstream of the TSS, the functional significance of these SNPs was not explored. Recently, another SNP was identified in the 5′-region of the RGS13 gene locus in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (rs3795617), which correlated significantly with clinical risk of recurrence or the development of a second primary tumor (25Wang J. Lippman S.M. Lee J.J. Yang H. Khuri F.R. Kim E. Lin J. Chang D.W. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Wu X. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given the ability of RGS proteins to regulate cell growth (26Liang G. Bansal G. Xie Z. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21719-21727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), these or other genetic variations could predispose to neoplasia by modulating RGS13 promoter activity.IL-17-induced up-regulation of RGS13 in lymph node B cells has also been implicated in spontaneous GC formation and autoimmunity in BXD2 mice (8Hsu H.C. Yang P. Wang J. Wu Q. Myers R. Chen J. Yi J. Guentert T. Tousson A. Stanus A.L. Le T.V. Lorenz R.G. Xu H. Kolls J.K. Carter R.H. Chaplin D.D. Williams R.W. Mountz J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We showed here that increased RGS13 expression induced by p53 depletion blunts responses to a GPCR ligand (sphingosine 1-phosphate). Recent studies have shown the importance of sphingosine 1-phosphate in lymphocyte migration and GC formation and maintenance in secondary lymphoid organs (27Cyster J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 127-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 28Wang J.H. Li J. Wu Q. Yang P. Pawar R.D. Xie S. Timares L. Raman C. Chaplin D.D. Lu L. Mountz J.D. Hsu H.C. J.

It will be of considerable interest to fully characterize RGS13 sequence and expression and their relationship to p53 in immune diseases associated with dysregulated MC and/or B lymphocyte migration or other functions.

Cross-linking of CD40 on tonsillar human B lymphocytes or IL-17 stimulation of mouse GC B cells up-regulates RGS13 expression (4Shi G.X. Harrison K. Wilson G.L. Moratz C. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2507-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Hsu H.C. Yang P. Wang J. Wu Q. Myers R. Chen J. Yi J. Guentert T. Tousson A. Stanus A.L. Le T.V. Lorenz R.G. Xu H. Kolls J.K. Carter R.H. Chaplin D.D. Williams R.W. Mountz J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We found previously that IgE-antigen stimulation induces RGS13 expression in bone marrow-derived MCs (5Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GPCR activation of the human MC line HMC1 by either C5a or CXCL12, but not adenosine, also increases RGS13 protein levels (6Bansal G. DiVietro J.A. Kuehn H.S. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Gilfillan A.M. Druey K.M. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7882-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of the human MC line LAD2 with a permeable cAMP analog, which activates the cAMP response element-binding protein pathway, reduces RGS13 mRNA expression (9Xie Z. Yang Z. Druey K.M. J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 2: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest involvement of various transcription factors activated by these stimuli (e.g. and NFκB) in the regulation of RGS13 transcription, the molecular determinants of RGS13 expression under homeostatic conditions or in activated MCs or B cells have not been characterized. Analysis of the RGS13 locus upstream of the published mRNA sequence revealed potential binding sites for several transcription factors, including two motifs with considerable homology to a consensus p53-binding site. p53 is a master regulator of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, which together actively suppress oncogenesis in response to stress signals (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 11Kruse J.P. Gu W. Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterize the RGS13 promoter and demonstrate the presence of an active p53-binding site, which suppresses RGS13 transcription in MCs and B lymphocytes. DISCUSSIONThis study is the first to identify and characterize molecular determinants of RGS13 expression. RGS13 meets the definition of a p53 response gene according to published criteria (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar): 1) it contains putative p53 REs in its upstream promoter region; 2) manipulation of p53 expression or elimination of the p53-binding motif modifies RGS13 promoter activity; 3) p53 binds to the identified RE in vivo as assessed by ChIP; and 4) manipulation of p53 levels leads to changes in the expression of both RGS13 mRNA and protein.Prior work demonstrated that another member of the RGS family (RGS16) is a p53 response gene. Treatment with doxorubicin or exogenous p53 expression induces rapid and robust up-regulation of RGS16 mRNA expression in colon or breast cancer cell lines (17Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J. Seizinger B.R. Gutkind J.S. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7868-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although purified p53 was reported to bind elements resembling p53-binding motifs located in intronic/3′-UTR regions of RGS16, it was unclear whether p53 regulated RGS16 transcription directly. In contrast to these studies, we showed that p53 quantities correlated inversely with RGS13 expression in MCs. Cells with increased p53 levels as a result of cell stress (doxorubicin treatment) or plasmid-based p53 transfection had reduced RGS13 expression due to direct inhibition of the RGS13 promoter by p53.We characterized the RGS13 promoter in total and found that its regulation is likely to be complex. We characterized an ∼1000-bp DNA fragment flanking the experimentally determined TSS (RGS13 1000) that had promoter activity in MCs. A reporter containing the RGS13 promoter had minimal activity in cells that do not express RGS13 (supplemental Fig. S2), which is consistent with the limited expression of RGS13 in a limited number of cell types. Although we did not find putative binding motifs for transcription factors unique to MCs and/or B lymphocytes in the RGS13 promoter region by bioinformatic analysis, we did identify elements resembling binding sites for PU.1 (−1263), GATA1 (−487), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (−273). These transcription factors, which are expressed highly in MC progenitors, are all required to some extent for MC differentiation and could thus contribute to the high expression of RGS13 in MCs (16Takemoto C.M. Brandal S. Jegga A.G. Lee Y.N. Shahlaee A. Ying Y. Dekoter R. McDevitt M.A. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 4349-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In contrast to the promoter activity of RGS13 1000, a fragment containing this sequence plus an additional ∼900-bp upstream flanking sequence (RGS13 2000) had no promoter activity in reporter assays. This result suggests that elements in the sequence between −691 and −1564 inhibit responsiveness of RGS13 1000. However, the distal p53 RE located in this region is not likely to be involved in the negative regulation of the RGS13 promoter, as mutation of its p53-binding motif did not affect promoter activity. The RGS13 gene locus may also have as yet uncharacterized enhancers and/or repressors in its first three introns or exons because the coding sequence is contained entirely in exons 4–6. We included exon 1 and a portion of intron 1 in our reporter constructs, and these sequences could impose negative or positive modulation of the upstream regulatory regions studied here. Further work will be needed to determine whether selective use of such elements could also contribute to the highly cell type-specific expression of RGS13 in MCs and GC B cells. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated for a conserved 3′-noncoding region of Il4, which acts as an essential enhancer for Il4 gene transcription in MCs but not in basophils (21Yagi R. Tanaka S. Motomura Y. Kubo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8087-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The detailed mechanism(s) whereby p53 suppresses RGS13 transcription will also require further study. Repression of gene transcription by p53 may be either direct or indirect. p53 has the capacity to “squelch” the activity of nearby activating transcription factors, primarily of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, by steric hindrance (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). We identified several potential C/EBPβ-binding sites in the RGS13 promoter, the closest located 321 bp from the active p53-binding site. Alternatively, p53 may inactivate certain transcription factors by direct binding, namely Sp1, C/EBPβ, and AP1. In addition to the aforementioned C/EBP motif, we identified a putative Sp1-binding site located 95 bp from the proximal p53 RE. Finally, p53 may also repress gene transcription indirectly through activation of histone deacetylases (10Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar).The expression of RGS proteins is often low in unstimulated cells (22Bansal G. Druey K.M. Xie Z. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 116: 473-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because of their strong catalytic activity, which promotes termination of GPCR pathways, such tight control of the basal transcription of RGS genes may permit a certain level of homeostatic GPCR signaling. Abnormal expression of RGS genes may occur in neoplastic or inflammatory conditions. RGS13 is difficult to detect in normal T cells but is overexpressed in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells (3Johnson E.N. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16768-16774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Dohoney K. Morris J.C. O'Mahony D. Lee M.J. Trepel J. Waldmann T.A. Janik J.E. Brady J.N. Blood. 2009; 113: 4016-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, RGS13 is strongly expressed in GC B cells and Burkitt lymphomas (which resemble GC B cells) (4Shi G.X. Harrison K. Wilson G.L. Moratz C. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2507-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but is absent in B cell lymphomas with a mantle cell phenotype (24Islam T.C. Asplund A.C. Lindvall J.M. Nygren L. Liden J. Kimby E. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Sander B. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The relationship of these variations in RGS13 expression to p53, if any, is unknown. Although several SNPs in RGS13 were identified in mantle cell phenotype lymph nodes, which were located in noncoding regions downstream of the TSS, the functional significance of these SNPs was not explored. Recently, another SNP was identified in the 5′-region of the RGS13 gene locus in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (rs3795617), which correlated significantly with clinical risk of recurrence or the development of a second primary tumor (25Wang J. Lippman S.M. Lee J.J. Yang H. Khuri F.R. Kim E. Lin J. Chang D.W. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Wu X. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given the ability of RGS proteins to regulate cell growth (26Liang G. Bansal G. Xie Z. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21719-21727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), these or other genetic variations could predispose to neoplasia by modulating RGS13 promoter activity.IL-17-induced up-regulation of RGS13 in lymph node B cells has also been implicated in spontaneous GC formation and autoimmunity in BXD2 mice (8Hsu H.C. Yang P. Wang J. Wu Q. Myers R. Chen J. Yi J. Guentert T. Tousson A. Stanus A.L. Le T.V. Lorenz R.G. Xu H. Kolls J.K. Carter R.H. Chaplin D.D. Williams R.W. Mountz J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We showed here that increased RGS13 expression induced by p53 depletion blunts responses to a GPCR ligand (sphingosine 1-phosphate). Recent studies have shown the importance of sphingosine 1-phosphate in lymphocyte migration and GC formation and maintenance in secondary lymphoid organs (27Cyster J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 127-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 28Wang J.H. Li J. Wu Q. Yang P. Pawar R.D. Xie S. Timares L. Raman C. Chaplin D.D. Lu L. Mountz J.D. Hsu H.C. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It will be of considerable interest to fully characterize RGS13 sequence and expression and their relationship to p53 in immune diseases associated with dysregulated MC and/or B lymphocyte migration or other functions. This study is the first to identify and characterize molecular determinants of RGS13 expression. RGS13 meets the definition of a p53 response gene according to published criteria (10Riley T.
