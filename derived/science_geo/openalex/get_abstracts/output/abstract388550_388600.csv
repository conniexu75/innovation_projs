https://openalex.org/W2036123793,"IN 1944 we obtained a culture of a Metarrhizium sp. from the United States Department of Agriculture, which had been described by Great-house, Klemme and Barker1 as an active decomposer of cellulose, particularly suitable for in vitro assessment of textile preservative treatments. This fungus was afterwards described by Pope2 as a new species, M. glutinosum. Our organism agrees with Pope's description. We have found that this mould, when grown on a variety of synthetic media, produces fungistatic culture filtrates. From cultures of this mould on Raulin Thorn medium, supplemented by 0.01 percent 'Difco' yeast extract, we have isolated a substance for which we propose the name 'glutinosin' in yields of the order of 15 mgm. per litre of culture filtrate."
https://openalex.org/W2083573876,"DURING investigations of the heat resistance of the spores of several Australian strains of Clostridium botulinum, it was found that various agar media gave divergent estimates of spores surviving heat treatment, even though each medium indicated similar numbers of viable spores in the unheated suspension. An attempt was made, therefore, to prepare a medium which would be reliable for the detection or spores surviving heat treatment. It has now been shown that the addition of small amounts of starch to media increases the number of colonies which develop from an inoculum of heated spores. Several types of natural starches produce similar effects in different infusion media suitable for the growth of Cl. botulinum. The influence of different concentrations of soluble starch added to pork infusion thioglycollate agar1 is shown in the accompanying graph."

https://openalex.org/W2027561801,"Subtilin, a new antibiotic obtained from B. subtilis, proved active in vitro against L. plantarum, E. histolytica and its associated bacterium ;t', and T. equiperdum without causing immediate hemolysis of erythrocytes. Subtilin is tensioactive, and amounts required for antibiotic effect are within the range of surface tension activity. It was relatively nontoxic for four species of mammals, especially after intragastric administration. Gramicidin is more hemolytic and more toxic than subtilin."

Dougherty and White1 described a direct depressant effect of the hormone on lymphoid tissue, while Reinhardt and Li1 associated this with an observed diminution in the thoracic duct lymphocytes entering the blood."
https://openalex.org/W1974099087,"THE isolation and purification by Bailey and Webb1 of a phosphatase, which acts specifically on inorganic pyrophosphate, makes probable the occurrence in baker's yeast of this compound as a natural meta-bolite. That inorganic pyrophosphate may be accumulated under certain conditions in baker's yeast is revealed by the experiments described below. Studying the mechanism of the inhibition of the respiration caused by the lithium ion in baker's yeast, we had observed the accumulation of an easily hydrolysable phosphate compound. This was prepared in the following way. In 5 l of 0.080 M sodium potassium succinate buffer of pH 5.0, the [K] of which was 1/10 of its total alkaline ion concentration, sufficient lithium chloride was dissolved as to make the solution 0.40 M with respect to lithium. Tn this solution 170 gm. fresh yeast was suspended and a powerful stream of oxygen was bubbled through the mixture (temperature, 20° C.). After one hour, the lithium now being in equilibrium with the interior of the cells, 5.4 gm. of glucose was stirred into the mixture and the aeration continued for another thirty minutes. At the end of this time the sample was fixed by addition of perchloric acid. The yeast cells were extracted at 0° C, the pH of the liquid raised to 8 and the cells centrifuged off. The clear extract was treated with excess barium chloride. The precipitate was centrifuged down, dissolved in normal hydrochloric acid and the clear solution again precipitated with barium chloride at pH 4.5. The barium salt thus obtained was purified by repeated precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W1972705802,"DIFFERENCE of opinion exists as to the incidence of defective colour vision among the male members of the population. Wright1 has given a figure of 8 per cent, and the value of 7.95 per cent of v. Planta2 and 8.01 per cent of Waaler3 agree very closely. Vernon and Straker4 gave a lower figure of 7.49 per cent for examinations carried out for entrance to the Navy ; the testing in the Navy was done by 'Wrens' working in different centres. In Germany, Schmidt5 gives 7 per cent for males and 4 per cent for females from the examination of 20,000 persons."

https://openalex.org/W2087540768,"In a previous paper1 it was mentioned that the non-specific or pseudo-cholinesterase is absent from the blood and tissues of ox and sheep. Although the experiments with blood were conclusive2, an observation, difficult to interpret at that time, was made with one of the tissues examined, namely, beef kidney. This tissue was found to be capable of hydrolysing benzoylcholine, a compound suggested by Mendel, Mundell and Rudney2 as a substrate suitable for measuring the activity of pseudo-cholinesterase. The activity towards this substrate, however, proved to be resistant to a concentration of eserine which inhibits the pseudo-cholinesterase in other mammalian tissues—a fact which made it appear unlikely that the enzyme in beef kidney was a pseudo-cholinesterase."

https://openalex.org/W2066053024,"IT has been recorded by several workers that insulin, though effective in most diabetics in lowering the blood-sugar level to normal, in a small fraction of cases either does not react at all or very high doses are required for beneficial results. Rosenthal1 observed that one of his patients showed no relief in hyperglycæmia even by daily injections of 100–120 units of insulin. Isolation of inactive insulin has been reported by Bhima Rao et al.2, and Himsworth3 reports on diabetics insensible to insulin. Joslin4 regards adiposity as a precursor of diabetes and this idea has recently been supported by our evidence5 that disturbance in the intermediary metabolism of fat is one of the factors responsible for the onset of hyperglycæmia. It has also been observed that hyperglycæmia caused by repeated injections of pyruvic acid, aceto-acetic ester, and -hydroxy butyric acid, etc., is followed by a rapid fall in blood-sugar level, thus suggesting the possibility of extra stimulation of islet cells. This is to be expected when there is a chance that the internal insulin may be destroyed or inactivated by such substances when administered to the system."

https://openalex.org/W2066185401,"DATA obtained elsewhere1 appeared to show evidence of competitive interaction between a pair of regenerating Crustacean limbs: the effect was not statistically significant, however. Specific experiments to test this have also failed to yield a significant result. In forty individuals of Asellus aquaticus (L.) both limbs of the seventh and one of the eighth thoracic pair (right and left in equal numbers) were amputated at the autotomy plane. The regenerating seventh pair were measured when first visible externally, that is, after regeneration for one instar. The limb on the same side as the regenerating limb of the eighth pair showed a mean excess of 2.6 per cent in length over its partner, but with a probable error of ± 1.2 per cent. The effect is little greater than might be obtained by chance: in a random sample of forty individuals, with only the two limbs of the seventh pair regenerating, the left limb showed a mean excess of 1.7 ± 1.1 per cent over the right (while in a previous sample2 an excess of the right over the left had seemed probable)."

https://openalex.org/W2004156758,"MAY I, in regard to my scheme for the mechanism of aromatic nitration1, explain that I do not conceive the components within the bracketed complex as bound merely by van der Waals' forces, but in an intimacy which is dependent both on their nature and on the conditions to which they are exposed. Just as Hughes and Ingold have postulated a state ""intermediate between the ionic and co-valent extremes""2, so I postulate one intermediate between radical and covalent extremes. While, therefore, I do not consider the criticisms of Ingold and his collaborators3 applicable to my scheme, nevertheless in formulating it I had in mind the fact that instances are available in the literature indicative of radical formation as an accompaniment of the nitration process. Thus Auwers and Marko-wits showed that 2: 6-dialkyl and dialoxyphenols are largely converted into the corresponding diphenoquinones4, and the preponderating formation of resinous products in the nitration of symmetrical xylenol is also on record5. The formation of tetramethylbenzidine by heating dimethylaniline with sulphuric acid6 may similarly be cited in regard to the sulphonation process."
https://openalex.org/W2012223933,"THE hexahydric alcohols mannitol, sorbitol and iditol all form dianhydro compounds on being heated with acid reagents. These compounds and the problem of their constitution have interested us for some time, and the structure of dianhydro mannitol (known as isomannide in the older literature) has already been proved to be that of 1: 4-3: 6-dianhydro mannitol2 (I)."
https://openalex.org/W2051573702,"IN the course of an investigation of the nutritional requirements of insects in mineral elements, we were confronted with a peculiar instance of an effect exerted by salt ions upon the production of one of the vitamins. The wax moth Galleria melonella can be reared on a medium composed of one part of yeast and two parts of wax. However, if in place of commercial bakers' yeast, yeast grown in the laboratory be used, the result will depend upon the composition of the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2070667185,"Chanos chanos (Forskal) is a marine fish which can be easily acclimatized to fresh water and hence it is recommended for culture in both brackish water and fresh water. (The technique of acclimatizing and conditioning milk-fish fingerlings for transporting and stocking in fresh waters has been perfected at Krusadai.) The fish, with mullet, are reared at the Krusadai marine fish farm."

https://openalex.org/W4229828577,"AT the meeting of the Society for General Microbiology held at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine during December 19-20, an afternoon session was devoted to a symposium on the “Role, Organisation and Maintenance of Collections of Living Micro-organisms”. The Committee of the Society was fortunate in being able to arrange, through the good offices of the British Council, for Prof. Johanna Westerdijk, director of the Centraal bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, Holland, and Prof. A. J. Kluyver, director of the Laboratorium voor Microbiologie at the Technische Hoogeschool, Delft, Holland, to take part in the meeting and in this way renew with British men of science contacts that had been broken by war. From an analysis of the papers submitted and of the subsequent discussion it appeared that the sense of the meeting was in accord with a principle implicit in the constitution of the Society, namely, to promote the co-ordination of microbiology in its various disciplines and at its different levels ; the development and maintenance of generalized collections of micro-organisms being ancillary to this purpose."

It receives little attention in the systematic teaching of medicine, and is considered with diffidence by the general practitioner because of its medico-legal implications. Its proper study is confined largely to the dermatologists and to those physicians employed in industrial medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2009946589,"THE great diversity of form shown by the gametes of the Protozoa is well known. Even among the Foraminifera they may be amœboid, for example, Patellina1, Spirillina2; or flagellate, at least at one stage. Of the latter, to mention only one feature, some may have but one flagellum as in Gromia3,4, but in the more typical Foraminifera they are usually represented as having two ; for example, Trichosphœrium5, Iridia, Planorbulina and others6, Polystomella (Elphidium)7,8, Tretomphalus9 (perhaps, as Myers suggests, a pelagic phase of a species of Discorbis). In the case of Discorbis (Discorbina), we have the very convincing account by Foyn10 of a life-cycle for D. vilardeboana which includes biflagellate gametes of a similar kind ; but Myers11 has also described and figured triflagellate gametes in D. patelliformis in California. As he himself remarks, “three is a most unusual number” for the flagella of gametes of either plant or animal organisms ; indeed it is unique."

https://openalex.org/W2066984542,"THE report of the meeting of the Advisory Committee of the Ross Institute held in July last contains a valuable review by Dr. G. Macdonald of some of the diseases which interfere most severely with tropical industry. During the War, states Dr. Macdonald, the Army has learnt that, in the tropics, malaria is the most important cause both of incapacity and of the failure of whole projects. This is a lesson which tropical industry learnt years ago. New methods of tackling malaria have, however, been developed. The two main developments originated in pre-war civilian practice. These are the eradication of anopheline vectors rather than the attack upon malaria itself ; and the proof that the control of the-adult mosquito is an economical as well as an effective method, which can be applied to rural communities at a cost which even the most primitive communities can bear."

https://openalex.org/W4242310855,"A NUMBER of papers contributed to symposia on “Science and the Modern Crisis” and “The Unity of Knowledge”, arranged by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, have since been reprinted under the title “Science, the Universities and the Modern Crisis” ; and through these papers runs a line of thought which is related to the topic of the presidential address delivered by Dr. Harlow Shapley in 1944 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts and Sci., 75, No. 6, 131-139 ; 1944). Dr. Shapley was discussing the future of the Academy, and said that the problems of such a learned society are in large measure the result of history. One of the principal issues leading to the creation of scientific societies was the necessity of finding or creating a language common to the new dispensation, more accurate than literary language, and better shaped for the purpose than the technical vocabulary of scholasticism. Assuming that all parts of knowledge were equally accessible to any educated person and that the reporting of experiment and discovery in simple, rational and perspicuous words would render the results intelligible to all who participated in the style, the founders of the academies sought an instrument of language at once definite and clear in meaning, uncoloured by personal emotion, and unperplexed by rhetorical adornment. To this was added in the eighteenth century, when the American Philosophical Society was founded, the ideal of research for social ends, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences was created in accordance with the view that public diffusion of knowledge was a virtue."
