https://openalex.org/W3042183476,"Memory T cells induced by previous pathogens can shape susceptibility to, and the clinical severity of, subsequent infections1. Little is known about the presence in humans of pre-existing memory T cells that have the potential to recognize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we studied T cell responses against the structural (nucleocapsid (N) protein) and non-structural (NSP7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals convalescing from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (n = 36). In all of these individuals, we found CD4 and CD8 T cells that recognized multiple regions of the N protein. Next, we showed that patients (n = 23) who recovered from SARS (the disease associated with SARS-CoV infection) possess long-lasting memory T cells that are reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV 17 years after the outbreak of SARS in 2003; these T cells displayed robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also detected SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with individuals who had SARS and/or COVID-19 (n = 37). SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of immunodominance, and frequently targeted NSP7 and NSP13 as well as the N protein. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed the recognition of protein fragments that are conserved among animal betacoronaviruses but have low homology to ‘common cold’ human-associated coronaviruses. Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces multi-specific and long-lasting T cell immunity against the structural N protein. Understanding how pre-existing N- and ORF1-specific T cells that are present in the general population affect the susceptibility to and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were found in individuals who had recovered from SARS or COVID-19 and in unexposed donors, although with different patterns of immunoreactivity."
https://openalex.org/W3042323010,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major threat to global health1 and the medical countermeasures available so far are limited2,3. Moreover, we currently lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-24. Here we analyse a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies that target the spike (S) glycoprotein5, and identify several that exhibit potent neutralizing activity and fully block the receptor-binding domain of the S protein (SRBD) from interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using competition-binding, structural and functional studies, we show that the monoclonal antibodies can be clustered into classes that recognize distinct epitopes on the SRBD, as well as distinct conformational states of the S trimer. Two potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, which recognize non-overlapping sites, bound simultaneously to the S protein and neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus in a synergistic manner. In two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of COV2-2196, COV2-2130 or a combination of both of these antibodies protected mice from weight loss and reduced the viral burden and levels of inflammation in the lungs. In addition, passive transfer of either of two of the most potent ACE2-blocking monoclonal antibodies (COV2-2196 or COV2-2381) as monotherapy protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results identify protective epitopes on the SRBD and provide a structure-based framework for rational vaccine design and the selection of robust immunotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3043699273,"Many European countries have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing nationwide protection measures and lockdowns1. However, the epidemic could rebound when such measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a requirement for a second or more, repeated lockdowns2. Here, we present results of a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of post-lockdown measures, including physical distancing, mask-wearing and shielding individuals who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on cumulative disease incidence and mortality, and on intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy. While lockdown is effective in containing the viral spread, once lifted, regardless of duration, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound. Both physical distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICUs from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with the shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower mortality and maintaining an adequate ICU capacity to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if most people do not adhere to these measures, or if they are not maintained for a sufficiently long period. A new study that models the COVID-19 epidemic in France suggests that although a second peak is likely unavoidable, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks when lockdown restrictions are lifted, as well as continuing to shelter vulnerable individuals, will reduce mortality and avoid overwhelming ICU facilities."

https://openalex.org/W3043244612,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an emerging alphavirus, has infected millions of people. However, the factors modulating disease outcome remain poorly understood. Here, we show in germ-free mice or in oral antibiotic-treated conventionally housed mice with depleted intestinal microbiomes that greater CHIKV infection and spread occurs within 1 day of virus inoculation. Alteration of the microbiome alters TLR7-MyD88 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and blunts systemic production of type I interferon (IFN). Consequently, circulating monocytes express fewer IFN-stimulated genes and become permissive for CHIKV infection. Reconstitution with a single bacterial species, Clostridium scindens, or its derived metabolite, the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid, can restore pDC- and MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses to restrict systemic CHIKV infection and transmission back to vector mosquitoes. Thus, symbiotic intestinal bacteria modulate antiviral immunity and levels of circulating alphaviruses within hours of infection through a bile acid-pDC-IFN signaling axis, which affects viremia, dissemination, and potentially transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3042260949,"Green infrastructure in cities is considered to serve as a refuge for insect pollinators, especially in the light of an ongoing global decline of insects in agricultural landscapes. The design and maintenance of urban green spaces as key components of green infrastructure play a crucial role in case of nesting opportunities and for foraging insects. However, only few research has explored the impact of urban green space design on flower visitor communities, plant-pollinator interaction and the provision of the ecosystem service of pollination in cities. We investigated the abundance and diversity of pollinator communities in different urban park types in designed, standardized vegetation units, linked the visitation rates to the structural composition of the park types and derived indices for implemented pollination performances. The study was performed in two different structural park elements, flower beds and insect-pollinating trees. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between plants and pollinators, we calculated a plant-pollinator network of the recorded community in the investigation area. Visitation rates at different park types clearly showed, that the urban community gardens in comparison to other urban park types had a significantly higher abundance of pollinator groups, comparable to results found on a rural reference site. Tilia trees contributed significantly to the ecosystem service of pollination in investigated green spaces with a high supply of nectar and pollen during their flowering period. Calculations of pollination performances showed that recreational parks had comparably low visitation rates of pollinators and a high potential to improve conditions for the ecosystem service of pollination. The results indicated the strong potential of cities to provide a habitat for different groups of pollinators. In order to access this refuge, it is necessary to rely on near-natural concepts in design and maintenance, to create a wide range of flower diversity and to use even small green patches. Based on the findings, we encourage an integrated management of urban free spaces to consider parks as key habitats for pollinators in anthropogenic dominated, urban environments."

https://openalex.org/W3042405460,"The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased drastically due to the global obesity pandemic but at present there are no approved therapies. Here, we aimed to revert high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and NAFLD in mice by enhancing liver fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Moreover, we searched for potential new lipid biomarkers for monitoring liver steatosis in humans. We used adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a permanently active mutant form of human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (hCPT1AM), the key enzyme in FAO, in the liver of a mouse model of HFD-induced obesity and NAFLD. Expression of hCPT1AM enhanced hepatic FAO and autophagy, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose homeostasis. Lipidomic analysis in mice and humans before and after therapeutic interventions, such as hepatic AAV9-hCPT1AM administration and RYGB surgery, respectively, led to the identification of specific triacylglyceride (TAG) specie (C50:1) as a potential biomarker to monitor NAFFLD disease. To sum up, here we show for the first time that liver hCPT1AM gene therapy in a mouse model of established obesity, diabetes, and NAFLD can reduce HFD-induced derangements. Moreover, our study highlights TAG (C50:1) as a potential noninvasive biomarker that might be useful to monitor NAFLD in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W3042763024,"Pasteurization of donated human milk preserves it for storage and makes it safe for feeding, but at the expense of its composition, nutritional values and functions. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of Holder Pasteurization (HoP) and High Pressure Processing (HPP) methods on miRNA in human milk and to evaluate impact of these changes on miRNA functions. Milk samples obtained from women in 50th day of lactation (n = 3) were subjected either to HoP, HPP or remained unpasteurized as a control. Subsequently, miRNA was isolated from whole material and exosomal fraction and sequenced with Illumina NextSeq 500. Sequencing data were processed, read counts were mapped to miRNA and analyzed both quantitatively with DESeq2 and functionally with DIANA mirPath v.3. While HPP caused statistically insignificant decrease in number of miRNA reads compared to unprocessed material, HoP led to 82-fold decrease in whole material (p = 0.0288) and 302-fold decrease in exosomes (p = 0.0021) not leaving enough reads for further analysis. Changes in composition of miRNA fraction before and after HPP indicated uneven stability of individual miRNAs under high pressure conditions, with miR-30d-5p identified as relatively stable and miR-29 family as sensitive to HPP. Interestingly, about 2/3 of unprocessed milk miRNA content consists of only 10 distinct miRNAs with miR-148a-3p at the top. Functional analysis of most abundant human milk miRNAs showed their involvement in signaling pathways, cell communication, proliferation and metabolism that are obviously important in rapidly growing infants. Functions of miRNAs which suffered the greatest depletion during HPP were similar to roles of the majority of unprocessed human milk's miRNA, which indicates that those functions may be weakened although not completely lost. Our findings indicate that HPP is less detrimental to human milk miRNAs than HoP and should be considered in further research on recommended processing procedures for human milk banks."

We previously showed that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac is transported into R. gnavus ATCC 29149 before being converted back to Neu5Ac for further metabolic processing. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the conversion of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac remained elusive. Using 1D and 2D NMR, we elucidated the multistep enzymatic mechanism of the oxidoreductase (RgNanOx) that leads to the reversible conversion of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac through formation of a 4-keto-2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid intermediate and NAD+ regeneration. The crystal structure of RgNanOx in complex with the NAD+ cofactor showed a protein dimer with a Rossman fold. Guided by the RgNanOx structure, we identified catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of RgNanOx homologues across Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species and co-occurrence with sialic acid transporters. We showed by electrospray ionization spray MS that the Escherichia coli homologue YjhC displayed activity against 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and that E. coli could catabolize 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac. Differential scanning fluorimetry analyses confirmed the binding of YjhC to the substrates 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac, as well as to co-factors NAD and NADH. Finally, using E. coli mutants and complementation growth assays, we demonstrated that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism in E. coli depended on YjhC and on the predicted sialic acid transporter YjhB. These results revealed the molecular mechanisms of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism across bacterial species and a novel sialic acid transport and catabolism pathway in E. coli.

These results revealed the molecular mechanisms of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism across bacterial species and a novel sialic acid transport and catabolism pathway in E. coli. The sialic acids comprise a family of 9-carbon sugar acids found predominantly on cell-surface glycans of humans and other animals (1Varki A. Schnaar R.L. Schauer R.

Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2017Google Scholar). Sialic acids are subject to a remarkable number of modifications, generating more than 50 structurally distinct molecules. Their terminal location makes them a preferential target for interaction with viruses and microorganisms at mucosa surfaces across the body (1Varki A. Schnaar R.L. Schauer R. Sialic acids and other nonulosonic acids.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G. Kinoshita T. Packer N.H. Prestegard J.H. Schnaar R.L. Seeberger P.H.

N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the most common form of sialic acid in humans, is a major epitope of mucin glycans that can serve as a metabolic substrate to the gut bacteria that have adapted to the mucosal environment (2Juge N.

R. gnavus is a human gut symbiont that plays a major role in human health and disease. R. gnavus is widely distributed among individuals being represented in the most common 57 species present in ≥90% of individuals (6Qin J. Li R. Raes J. Arumugam M. Burgdorf K.S. Manichanh C.

The 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac compound binds specifically to the substrate-binding protein (RgSBP), which forms part of an ABC sialic acid transporter in R. gnavus. Once inside the cell, 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac is converted into Neu5Ac via a novel enzymatic reaction catalyzed by an oxidoreductase, RgNanOx. Following this conversion, Neu5Ac is then catabolized into N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate via the action of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase (19Bell A. Brunt J. Crost E. Vaux L. Nepravishta R.

Recently, the crystal structure of the RgNanOx homologue in E. coli, YjhC, was solved in complex with NAD+ (20Horne C.R. Kind L. Davies J.S. Dobson R.C.J. On the structure and function of Escherichia coli Yjhc: an oxidoreductase involved in bacterial sialic acid metabolism.Proteins. 2020; 88 (31697432): 654-66810.1002/prot.25846Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of these newly identified enzymatic activities remained undefined. Here, using a combination of in silico, molecular, biochemical, and structural approaches, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of RgNanOx and showed that homologous enzymes are present across both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and are associated with different classes of predicted transporters. We validated these data in vitro and further unraveled the 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism in E. coli. RgNanOx (RUMGNA_02695) from R. gnavus ATCC 29149 catalyzes the equilibration of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac (19Bell A. Brunt J. Crost E. Vaux L. Nepravishta R. Owen C.D. Latousakis D. Xiao A. Li W. Chen X. Walsh M.A. Claesen J. Angulo J. Thomas G.H. Juge N. Elucidation of a sialic acid metabolism pathway in mucus-foraging Ruminococcus gnavus unravels mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the gut.Nat.

To gain insights into the mechanism of action of the enzyme, the conversion of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac was monitored by 1H NMR for 24 h. Comparison of samples differing only in the solvent (light water (H2O) versus deuterated water (D2O) at the same reaction time points showed the loss of specific 1H signals from protons attached at C3 and C5 in D2O, indicating solvent exchange. The loss of these signals led to simplification in the splitting of the neighboring proton signals (Fig. S1). Analysis of the reaction curve, obtained by monitoring the signals from the methyl protons of the acetamide group at C5, revealed the presence of a new (third) molecule (XY). This molecule is formed with a very fast kinetics, reaching its highest concentration at very early time (Fig. 1A). The reaction mixture was analyzed by 2D NMR during the interval at which the intermediate was at its highest concentration, using a 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. The comparison of the 2D 1H,13C HSQC spectra of the substrate (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), the product (Neu5Ac), and the reaction mixture at 30 min allowed the identification of an additional set of cross-peaks that did not belong to the substrate or to the product and were therefore assigned to the intermediate (Fig. 1, B and C). Specifically, the presence of a heteronuclear cross-peak at 2.73 ppm/43.1 ppm (1H/13C) (signal 2 in Fig. 1B), characteristic of a proton in α to a keto group, strongly suggested the intermediate to be a keto-sugar. Homonuclear 2D 1H,1H COSY and 1H,1H TOCSY experiments showed connectivity of this proton to one and two other protons, respectively (Fig. S2). Signal 2, at 2.73 ppm, corresponds then to a proton neighboring a carbonyl on one side and at least two other protons on the other side with chemical shifts in the 3–4 ppm region. Analysis of the 3–4 ppm spectral region, where standard sugar-ring C-H signals typically show, suggests that the intermediate chemical shifts are closer to Neu5Ac than to 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac (Fig. S3). Based on this information, we proposed that in this species, the glycerol moiety is in the open form, indicating that the 2,7-anhydro bond is broken in the intermediate. The formation of such an oxidized intermediate (i.e. the keto-sugar), as detected by NMR, is compatible with the regeneration of NAD+ observed previously (19Bell A. Brunt J. Crost E. Vaux L. Nepravishta R. Owen C.D. Latousakis D. Xiao A. Li W. Chen X. Walsh M.A. Claesen J. Angulo J. Thomas G.H. Juge N. Elucidation of a sialic acid metabolism pathway in mucus-foraging Ruminococcus gnavus unravels mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the gut.Nat.

As the final result of the reaction is a reductive opening of the ring through the O7–C2 bond, a preliminary oxidation must occur earlier in the mechanism. Based on this analysis, we propose a multistep mechanism for the reversible conversion of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac by RgNanOx (Fig. 2). In the first step, 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac is oxidized at the C4 keto by NAD+ cofactor. The proton at C3 is now α to the keto group and thus more acidic and can be abstracted in an anti-periplanar elimination reaction in which the 2,7-anhydro bond is also broken. The resulting compound, 4-keto-DANA, is consistent with 2D NMR, and the conjugation would be expected to stabilize the intermediate (full NMR assignment of 4-keto-DANA is given in Table S1). 4-Keto-DANA exists as an equilibrium between two ring-flipped forms; however, the form with the equatorial glycerol and N-acetyl substituents would be expected to predominate. In this ring-flipped form, a Michael addition of water to C2 hydrates the C2=C3 double bond with a proton from the solvent added to C3. The addition reaction would be expected to follow the expected anti-periplanar geometry. This is consistent with the NMR observation that the axial, not equatorial proton, undergoes exchange (Fig. S1). The product of the addition (2Juge N. Tailford L. Owen C.D. Sialidases from gut bacteria: a mini-review.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2016; 44 (26862202): 166-17510.1042/BST20150226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is a 4-keto-Neu5Ac, in which the proton at C5 is now α to the keto and acidic. This acidic proton will exchange with solvent by the well-known keto enol tautomerization reaction, consistent with the NMR data (Fig. S1). The 4-keto-Neu5Ac (2Juge N. Tailford L. Owen C.D. Sialidases from gut bacteria: a mini-review.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2016; 44 (26862202): 166-17510.1042/BST20150226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is finally reduced by NADH to yield the final Neu5Ac product and NAD+. The regeneration of NAD+ also explains why no net change in the ratio of NAD+ and NADH was observed in the enzymatic reaction (19Bell A. Brunt J. Crost E. Vaux L. Nepravishta R. Owen C.D. Latousakis D. Xiao A. Li W. Chen X. Walsh M.A. Claesen J. Angulo J. Thomas G.H. Juge N.

The crystal structure of the recombinant RgNanOx in complex with the NAD+ cofactor was solved at 2.58 Å and subsequently at 1.74 Å using molecular replacement with an oxidoreductase from Agrobacterium radiobacter as a model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5UI9). The protein shows a Rossman fold typical of NAD-binding protein of the Gfo/Idh/MocA class (21Taberman H. Parkkinen T. Rouvinen J. Structural and functional features of the NAD(P) dependent Gfo/Idh/Moca protein family oxidoreductases.Protein Sci. 2016; 25 (26749496): 778-78610.1002/pro.2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) characterized by a central β-sheet with helices on either side. RgNanOx forms a dimer in the asymmetric unit, and the NAD+ cofactor can be seen bound to the protein (Fig. 3A). A structural similarity search (22Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (Ssm), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (15572779): 2256-226810.1107/S0907444904026460Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar) identifies multiple oxidoreductase enzymes, all of which share the same Rossman fold and location of the nucleotide-binding site. Oxidoreductase proteins typically have a catalytic triad of K (found in the EKP motif), D, and H (often found as a DXXXH motif; in some enzymes Y replaces the H) and a fourth residue, which is positively charged (21Taberman H. Parkkinen T. Rouvinen J. Structural and functional features of the NAD(P) dependent Gfo/Idh/Moca protein family oxidoreductases.Protein Sci. 2016; 25 (26749496): 778-78610.1002/pro.2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RgNanOx has Lys-93 and His-178 which correspond to the Lys and His of the catalytic triad, and Lys-163 occupies the “fourth” position (23Persson B. Kallberg Y. Bray J.E. Bruford E. Dellaporta S.L.

Interact. 2009; 178 (19027726): 94-9810.1016/j.cbi.2008.10.040Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, RgNanOx has His-175, which occupies the position typical for the Asp in the catalytic triad (23Persson B. Kallberg Y. Bray J.E. Bruford E. Dellaporta S.L. Favia A.D. Duarte R.G. Jörnvall H.

The closest structural match (0.8 Å over 341 residues) is the recently solved crystal structure of YjhC oxidoreductase from E. coli (Fig. 3B) (20Horne C.R. Kind L. Davies J.S. Dobson R.C.J. On the structure and function of Escherichia coli Yjhc: an oxidoreductase involved in bacterial sialic acid metabolism.Proteins. 2020; 88 (31697432): 654-66810.1002/prot.25846Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which also has a HXXH motif. In the RgNanOx structure, there is additional density adjacent to the nicotinamide ring that, given the high resolution of the second structure, we were able to unambiguously identify as citric acid from the crystallization buffer. Using the high-resolution structure, we used a simple modeling approach to place a molecule of DANA a transition state analog inhibitor of sialidases, in RgNanOx active site by overlapping the carboxylate acid of the DANA with each of the three carboxylate groups of citric acid. Next we manually positioned the sugar such that the H3 of the atom ring pointed toward the C4′ of the nicotinamide, as would be required for hydride transfer. These models were then minimized, and we investigated whether the H4 atom of DANA was still able to transfer to nicotinamide. Only one position (Fig. 3C) where the DANA carboxylate was placed on the 2-carboxylic acid of citric remained positioned for hydride transfer. The goal of modeling was not to generate a precise model of the substrate protein interactions but rather, along with sequence comparisons, generate hypotheses for site-directed active-site mutagenesis. The model indicated that His-178, predicted to be a catalytic residue, is positioned to remove the proton from O4 during the oxidation step. His-176 is plausibly positioned to undertake proton transfer with the O7 of the substrate glycerol that the mechanism requires. His-175 interacts with the negatively charged carboxylic acid in the model but could play a role in proton transfer at the substrate C3 atom. Lys-93 binds to NAD+, is part of the catalytic constellation, and is also within a plausible distance for proton transfer to C3. Lys-163 binds to the NAD+ co-factor and interacts with the substrate carboxylate. The following mutants of RgNanOx were constructed: K93A, K163A, H175A, H176A, and H178A. The purified mutants lost enzymatic activity, as demonstrated by electrospray ionization spray MS (ESI-MS) (Fig. 4A), supporting the hypothesis that they are catalytically important. K93A lost the ability to bind NAD+; as did H176A, to some extent. The other mutants appeared able to retain substrate binding (Fig. 4B). Sequence similarity network analysis of the R. gnavus Nan cluster (responsible for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism) identified the presence of RgNanOx homologues in a number of organisms (19Bell A.

One such example was the model Gram-negative human commensal E. coli K-12, the organism in which the genes for Neu5Ac catabolism were first discovered (24Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. Regulation of sialic acid metabolism in Escherichia coli: role of N-acylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase.J.

In E. coli, the homologue of RgNanOx is part of a two-gene operon, yjhBC, which is one of only three operons in E. coli regulated by the transcription factor NanR as reported previously (25Kalivoda K.A. Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Control of the Escherichia coli sialoregulon by transcriptional repressor NanR.J.

Here, we demonstrated that E. coli could grow on 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source (Fig. 5B), reaching growth yields similar to that obtained when E. coli was grown on Neu5Ac. Deletion of yjhC resulted in loss of growth on 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac but not on Neu5Ac (Fig. 5C), which could be complemented in trans with yjhC (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the gene encodes an equivalent protein to RgNanOx. To test this hypothesis, the YjhC protein was recombinantly expressed and purified, and its activity against 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac was analyzed by ESI-MS. The purified enzyme was shown to be active against both substrates, reaching an equilibrium of 2:1 Neu5Ac/2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, in line with that of RgNanOx (19Bell A. Brunt J. Crost E. Vaux L.

https://openalex.org/W3042561658,"The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is globally distributed with established coastal and open-ocean movement patterns in many portions of its range. While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here."
https://openalex.org/W3042235917,"Background Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) means that an infant should be breastfed only for the first six months of life to achieve optimal child development and to prevent infant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this analysis was to determine the individual-, household-, and community-level factors associated with EBF practice in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 1,440 women-child pairs data were analysed extracted from 2011 and 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Multilevel logistic regression models were used separately for individual-, household-, and community level factors to identify the different level of factors associated with EBF practice. Results Around 61% women in Bangladesh practiced EBF with significant variation across several individual-, household-, and community-level factors. At the individual level, higher odds of EBF practice was found among mothers' received higher number of antenatal care and lower age of child. Mothers' higher education and engagement in formal jobs were found negatively associated with EBF practice. At the community level, higher odds of EBF was found among women live in Barishal, Dhaka, and Rajshahi divisions, and resided in the community with moderate level of female education, higher level of fertility, and higher use of antenatal and delivery care. Conclusions One in every three children in Bangladesh do not breastfeed exclusively which needs special attention for the policymakers. In this case, educated women engaged in income generating activities and women did not use antenatal care should be given priority. At the community level, priority should be given for the women's resides in the community with lower level of antenatal and delivery healthcare services use."

A total of 613 samples were analyzed for pesticide residues, out of which 250 were also analyzed for bacterial contamination. Overall, 47.5% had pesticide residues, 74.2% exceeded Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs). Organophosphorus (95.2%), organochlorines (24.0%), pyrethroids (17.3%), and carbamates (9.2%) residues dominated. MRL values were mostly exceeded in tomatoes, onions, watermelons, cucumbers, Chinese cabbage, and sweet paper. Tetramethrin (0.0329–1.3733 mg/kg), pirimiphos-methyl (0.0003–1.4093 mg/kg), permethrin (0.0009–2.4537 mg/kg), endosulfan (beta) (0.0008–2.3416 mg/kg), carbaryl (0.0215–1.5068 mg/kg), profenofos (0.0176–2.1377 mg/kg), chlorpyrifos (0.0004–1.2549 mg/kg) and dieldrin (0.0011–0.5271 mg/kg) exceeded MRLs. The prevalence of bacteria contamination was high (63.2%). Enterobacter (55.6%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.4%), E. coli (28.2%), Citrobacter (26.8%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.8%), and Salmonella (7.7%) were isolated. Furthermore, 46.4% tested positive for both pesticide residues and bacterial contaminants. Vegetables from farms (60.7%) contained more dual contaminants than market-based vegetables (41.8%). This may have resulted from excessive pesticide use and unhygienic handling of fresh fruits and vegetables at production level. Binary logistic regression showed that fresh fruits and vegetables with pesticide residues were 2.231 times more likely to have bacteria contaminants (OR: 2.231; 95% CI: 0.501, 8.802). The contamination levels of pesticide residues and bacterial contaminants could be perceived as a serious problem as most fresh fruits and vegetables recorded values of pesticide residues far above the MRLs with pathogenic bacteria isolated in higher proportions. MRLs was higher in most vegetables consumed raw or semi-cooked such as watermelons, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, onion and sweet paper. There is an urgent need to develop pesticide monitoring and surveillance systems at farmer level, educating farmers and promoting the use of greener pesticides to mitigate the health effects of pesticides and bacterial contaminants."

Rabs function as switch proteins that cycle between an active state and an inactive state. In their active state, Rabs localize to specific vesicles or organelles and recruit a specific binding partner (called a Rab effector), via which they regulate a specific membrane trafficking pathway. Recent studies have reported that several Rabs, including Rab8, Rab10, Rab11, Rab23, Rab29, and Rab34, participate in ciliogenesis (8Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W.

However, not all of the membrane trafficking mechanisms in ciliogenesis are fully understood, and knockout mice in which each of several cilia-regulating Rabs had been knocked out did not exhibit any ciliopathy phenotypes (15Sato T.

Moreover, no attempts have been made to perform a comprehensive analysis of all mammalian Rabs (Rab1A–43) during ciliogenesis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive knockdown screening for Rabs that regulate serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in hTERT-RPE1 (human telomerase reverse transcriptase retinal pigment epithelium 1) cells and succeeded in identifying Rab34 as an essential Rab in serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis. Intriguingly, however, the known cilia-regulating Rabs, including Rab8, Rab10, Rab11B, and Rab12, were found to be dispensable for ciliogenesis, because their knockout (KO) cells formed primary cilia. Moreover, the requirement of Rab34 for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis was confirmed in NIH/3T3 cells and MCF10A cells. On the other hand, Rab34 was not essential for ciliogenesis in cysts of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II cells. We then performed KO-rescue experiments on several Rab34 mutants, including a switch II swapping mutant (S1A) and an N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN), to identify the region of Rab34 that is responsible for ciliogenesis. The results showed that Rab34(S1A) rescued the Rab34-KO phenotype but that Rab34(ΔN) did not. These findings indicate that the unique long N-terminal region of Rab34, and not a specific sequence in the switch II region, is necessary for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis. To identify novel Rabs that participate in serum starvation-induced primary ciliogenesis, by using effective and specific siRNAs against 62 human Rabs that we have developed previously (20Aizawa M. Fukuda M. Small GTPase Rab2B and its specific binding protein Golgi-associated Rab2B interactor-like 4 (GARI-L4) regulate Golgi morphology.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (26209634): 22250-2226110.1074/jbc.M115.669242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we performed a comprehensive knockdown screening in hTERT-RPE1 cells. We used acetylated tubulin as a cilium marker and then counted the number of nonciliated cells. When we knocked down CEP164 protein that is essential for ciliogenesis (21Graser S. Stierhof Y.D. Lavoie S.B. Gassner O.S. Lamla S. Le Clech M. Nigg E.A. Cep164, a novel centriole appendage protein required for primary cilium formation.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 (17954613): 321-33010.1083/jcb.200707181Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the number of nonciliated cells increased to more than 80% (Fig. 1A, black bar), whereas control siRNA had almost no effect (∼10% of the cells were nonciliated), thereby validating our experimental setup. The results of the screening showed that knockdown of ten Rabs, i.e. Rab6C, Rab9A, Rab10, Rab11B, Rab12, Rab34, Rab40A, Rab40B, Rab42(43), and Rab43(41), increased the number of nonciliated cells to more than 50% (Fig. 1A, blue bars, and B), and we considered these Rabs to be primary candidates. To confirm the knockdown effects on ciliogenesis that had been observed in the first screening and to avoid possible off-target effects by single siRNAs, we proceeded to perform knockdown experiments by using other independent siRNAs against the primary Rab candidates. The results showed that knockdown of only four Rabs, i.e. Rab6C, Rab11B, Rab12, and Rab34, by each of two independent siRNAs increased the number of nonciliated cells to more than 50% (Fig. 2A). We also checked the protein expression levels of several candidate Rabs by immunoblotting, and the results confirmed that the Rab11B, Rab12, and Rab34 bands almost completely disappeared when the two independent siRNAs were used (Fig. 2B). siRab9A#2 and siRab10#2 seemed to decrease the protein expression level more efficiently than siRab9A#1 and siRab10#1, respectively (Fig. 2B and data not shown), but they had a lesser effect on ciliogenesis, suggesting that siRab9A#1 and siRab10#1 have certain off-target effects on ciliogenesis. On the other hand, no protein expression of other candidate Rabs, including Rab6C, was detected by immunoblotting (data not shown), and we did not pursue Rab6C in the subsequent analysis. Based on the results of the two-step screenings, we selected Rab11B, Rab12, and Rab34 as secondary candidate Rabs. A possible function of Rab11 in ciliogenesis had already been reported (8Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

During investigating Rab12 and Rab34 in the subsequent analysis, their possible involvement in ciliogenesis was reported by other groups (17Pusapati G.V. Kong J.H. Patel B.B. Krishnan A. Sagner A.

To determine whether the secondary candidates identified above, i.e. Rab11B, Rab12, and Rab34, are indeed essential for ciliogenesis in hTERT-RPE1 cells, we generated their respective KO cells by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We also established Rab8A/B-double KO (Rab8A/B-KO) cells and Rab8A/B/10-triple KO (Rab8A/B/10-KO) cells as controls, because Rab8 and Rab10 are widely thought to be involved in cilium formation in mammalian cultured cells (15Sato T. Iwano T. Kunii M. Matsuda S. Mizuguchi R. Jung Y. Hagiwara H. Yoshihara Y. Yuzaki M. Harada R. Harada A. Rab8a and Rab8b are essential for several apical transport pathways but insufficient for ciliogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (24213529): 422-43110.1242/jcs.136903Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Loss of the target Rabs in each KO cell was verified by both immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) and sequencing of genomic PCR products (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 3A, only Rab34-KO greatly increased the number of nonciliated cells. In contrast, Rab8A/B-KO, Rab10-KO, Rab8A/B/10-KO, Rab11B-KO, and Rab12-KO cells did not show any defects in ciliogenesis under our experimental conditions. The KO phenotypes observed in this study are unlikely to be caused by clonal variations, because essentially the same results were obtained in other independent Rab-KO clones (i.e. impaired ciliogenesis in Rab34-KO cells versus normal ciliogenesis in other Rab-KO cells) (data not shown). To further confirm that the impaired ciliogenesis was directly related to Rab34-KO, we performed rescue experiments by stably expressing EGFP (enhanced GFP)-P2A-Rab34, which contains a P2A self-cleavage site (25Kim J.H. Lee S.R. Li L.H. Park H.J. Park J.H. Lee K.Y. Kim M.K. Shin B.A. Choi S.Y. High cleavage efficiency of a 2A peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 in human cell lines, zebrafish and mice.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 (21602908): e1855610.1371/journal.pone.0018556Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) between EGFP and Rab34, in Rab34-KO cells (Fig. S2A). The results showed that expression of EGFP-P2A-Rab34 completely rescued the impaired ciliogenesis phenotype of Rab34-KO cells (Fig. 3, C and D). We used EGFP-P2A-Rab34 instead of EGFP-Rab34 for the KO-rescue experiment, because EGFP-P2A-Rab34 was able to rescue the phenotype of Rab34-knockdown (KD) cells more efficiently than EGFP-Rab34 was (Fig. S2B), suggesting that N-terminal EGFP tagging partly distorts the function of Rab34. A similar observation was previously reported with respect to Rab10: untagged Rab10, but not EGFP-Rab10, was found to promote neurite outgrowth of Rab10-depleted cells (26Homma Y. Fukuda M. Rabin8 regulates neurite outgrowth in both GEF-activity-dependent and -independent manners.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27 (27170183): 2107-211810.1091/mbc.E16-02-0091Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Rab34 is the most crucial Rab for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in hTERT-RPE1 cells. To determine whether Rab34 is a general positive regulator of ciliogenesis, we investigated the effect of Rab34-KO or -KD on ciliogenesis in other cell types. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, Rab34 depletion in NIH/3T3 cells and MCF10A cells resulted in an increase in the number of nonciliated cells under serum-starved conditions, the same as that in hTERT-RPE1 cells, and the impaired ciliogenesis of Rab34-KO NIH/3T3 cells and Rab34-KD MCF10A cells was clearly rescued by expression of EGFP-P2A-Rab34. On the other hand, checking the primary cilia in the cysts of Rab-KO MDCK-II cells that we recently established (27Homma Y. Kinoshita R. Kuchitsu Y. Wawro P.S. Marubashi S. Oguchi M.E. Ishida M. Fujita N. Fukuda M. Comprehensive knockout analysis of the Rab family GTPases in epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 (31072826): 2035-205010.1083/jcb.201810134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that all of the Rab-KO cysts, including the Rab34-KO cysts, had formed primary cilia in their luminal domain (Fig. 4C and Fig. S3). Although Rab6 and Rab11 have been shown to be required for normal epithelial morphogenesis (27Homma Y. Kinoshita R. Kuchitsu Y. Wawro P.S. Marubashi S. Oguchi M.E. Ishida M. Fujita N. Fukuda M. Comprehensive knockout analysis of the Rab family GTPases in epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 (31072826): 2035-205010.1083/jcb.201810134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their KO cysts still had primary cilia in their luminal domain (Fig. 4D). Thus, Rab34 is unlikely to be a general regulator of ciliogenesis, and it is dispensable for ciliogenesis at least in MDCK-II cysts. To investigate the defective ciliogenesis in the absence of Rab34 in greater detail, we then investigated the subcellular localization of ciliary membrane proteins and proteins that are required for ciliogenesis, i.e. Rabin8, CP110, IFT20, and Arl13B (7Follit J.A.

As shown in Fig. 5A, Rab34-KO had no effect on the localization of Rabin8 (3 h after serum starvation) or of CP110, IFT20, and Arl13B (24 h after serum starvation) in hTERT-RPE1 cells compared with that of the control parental cells for removal of CP110 from mother centrioles (Fig. 5A, arrows in the second row) (28Spektor A. Tsang W.Y. Khoo D. Dynlacht B.D. Cep97 and CP110 suppress a cilia assembly program.Cell. 2007; 130 (17719545): 678-69010.1016/j.cell.2007.06.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and the centriole localization of Rabin8, IFT20, and Arl13B (Fig. 5A, arrowheads in the top, third, and bottom rows, respectively). Essentially the same results were reported for CP110, Rabin8, and IFT20 in Rab34-KO NIH/3T3 cells (23Xu S. Liu Y. Meng Q. Wang B. Rab34 small GTPase is required for Hedgehog signaling and an early step of ciliary vesicle formation in mouse.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131: jcs21371010.1242/jcs.213710Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicating that Rab34 is not involved in the recruitment of Rabin8 and IFT20 to centrioles or CP110 removal. Because depletion of Rab34 inhibited the axoneme elongation and extension of ciliary vesicles, Rab34 is likely to be required for early steps in serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Because our anti-Rab34 antibody was unable to detect the subcellular localization of endogenous Rab34 in hTERT-RPE1 cells by immunofluorescence analysis, we tried overexpressing FLAG-tagged Rab34, which can restore the Rab34-KO phenotype in Rab34-KO cells (Fig. 6E), and visualized it by using an anti-FLAG tag antibody. The results showed that FLAG-Rab34 was mainly localized at the Golgi apparatus, consistent with the findings in a previous report (30Wang T. Hong W. Interorganellar regulation of lysosome positioning by the Golgi apparatus through Rab34 interaction with Rab-interacting lysosomal protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (12475955): 4317-433210.1091/mbc.e02-05-0280Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and that it rarely localized at primary cilia (∼20%) (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results imply that Rab34, an early-step regulator of ciliogenesis, is released from ciliary membranes before the maturation of primary cilia. Next, we attempted to identify a specific region(s) of Rab34 that is essential for ciliogenesis by performing mutation and deletion analyses of Rab34-KO cells. In general, Rabs are thought to recognize specific effectors through their switch II region, because mutations of specific amino acids in this region of some Rabs have been shown to abrogate their effector-binding ability (31Kloer D.P.

Sequence comparisons of the switch II region of mammalian Rabs have revealed that Lys-115 and Cys-116 are specific to Rab34 (and its closest paralog, Rab36) (Fig. 6A, asterisks) (34Matsui T.

Actually, we had previously shown that K120A/C121A mutations of Rab36 impaired RILP (Rab interacting lysosomal protein)-binding activity, and that the Rab36(K120A/C121A) mutant did not support retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes (34Matsui T.

Therefore, we generated a Rab34(K115A/C116A) [here referred to as Rab34(KC/AA)] mutant and evaluated its effect on ciliogenesis in Rab34-KD hTERT-RPE1 cells. Consistent with the previous finding regarding Rab36 (34Matsui T. Ohbayashi N. Fukuda M.

Unexpectedly, however, Rab34(KC/AA) completely rescued the Rab34-KD phenotype (Fig. S4C). Because a weak interaction between Rab34(KC/AA) and RILP was still observed in the coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. S4B), it was possible that such a weak interaction could rescue the KD phenotype. To rule out this possibility, we generated an additional Rab34 mutant that completely lacks RILP-binding ability by swapping the switch II region of Rab34 for that of Rab1A, a Rab isoform distantly related to Rab34 [named Rab34(S1A)] (Fig. 6A), and complete loss of RILP-binding activity by Rab34(S1A) was confirmed by both yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 6, B and C). Nevertheless, Rab34(S1A) did rescue the Rab34-KO phenotype, the same as Rab34(WT) did (Fig. 6D). Although no specific sequence in the switch II region of Rab34 was essential for ciliogenesis, GTP-binding activity of Rab34 itself was necessary, because a constitutively active Rab34 mutant, Rab34(Q111L), but not its constitutively inactive mutant, Rab34(T66N), rescued the Rab34-KD effect on ciliogenesis, as did Rab34(WT) (Fig. S5). To further identify the crucial region of Rab34 for ciliogenesis, we compared the entire sequences of mammalian Rab family members in greater detail and discovered that Rab34 contains a long N-terminal region (gray box in Fig. 6A) that was not found in other Rab isoforms except Rab36. Rab36, the closest paralog of Rab34, also contains a"

The validated study instruments used consisted of questions on socio-demography, KAP on UI, and also the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form to determine UI among the respondents.The response rate for this study was 72.1%, where 440 pregnant women consented to take part in the study. The median age of study respondents was 30 years old and majority of the study respondents was from the Malay ethnicity (80.9%). The prevalence of UI was 40.9%. The proportion of pregnant women with good knowledge, attitude and practice scores were 58.0%, 46.6% and 45.2% respectively. There was a significant association between UI and age (p = .03), body mass index (p = .03), ethnicity (p = .04), gravida. (p = .001), knowledge on PFME (p = .007) and attitude towards PFME (p = .006).Findings from this study fill a gap in the prevalence and KAP concerning PFME at the primary care level. The foundation areas for future education and health promotion on UI should address the importance of correct PFME. This education can be delivered through a pragmatic way to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability of the health promotion program."
https://openalex.org/W3043179788,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) denoising is a biomedical research area of great importance. In this paper, an integrated empirical mode decomposition adaptive threshold denoising method (IEMD-ATD) is proposed for processing ECGs. Three methods are included in the IEMD-ATD. First, an integrated EMD method based on a framework of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is proposed to improve the decomposition quality and stability of raw ECGs. Second, a new grouping method for intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is developed based on the energy and eigenperiod of IMFs. The grouping method is able to determine the boundaries among high-frequency noise predominant IMFs, useful information predominant IMFs and IMFs with low-frequency noises. Finally, an adaptive threshold denoising method is derived and used for denoising high-frequency noise predominant IMFs. There are two main contributions: 1) an adaptive threshold determination method based on the 3σ criterion and 2) a peak filtering denoising method for retaining useful information contained in the values smaller than the threshold. Synthetic and real ECG data in the MIT-BIH database are utilised in experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of IEMD-ATD for ECG denoising. The results indicate that IEMD-ATD offers better performance in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient compared with the existing EMD denoising methods. Our method offers obvious advantages, especially in retaining detailed information on the QRS complex of the ECG, which is significant for the feature extraction of ECG signals and for pathological diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3042553943,"Planktic foraminiferal biostratigraphic zonation schemes are critical for providing first-order relative age control in deep-sea sediments and provide the basis on which to interpret evolutionary dynamics through time. Over the previous decades, the majority of published biostratigraphic zonation schemes focused on the tropical regions of the world. The mid-latitude or temperate regions, especially of the northwest Pacific, have been understudied in terms of recording plankton occurrences. Lack of detailed biostratigraphic studies have largely left out this region from plankton evolutionary analyses, thus how this part of the world ocean, which is characterized by the Kuroshio Current Extension (KCE), may contribute to global plankton biodiversity is unknown. In this study, we present the first magnetostratigraphically-calibrated late Neogene to Quaternary (15.12–0 Ma) planktic foraminiferal zonation schemes from the northwest Pacific for three Ocean Drilling Program Leg 198 holes (1207A, 1208A, and 1209A) that span the KCE. We utilize previously published warm subtropical, cool subtropical, and temperate zonation schemes from the southwest Pacific, with modifications. We find examples of significant diachroneity among primary marker taxa used to construct biozones at the three northwest Pacific sites, which ranges from 0.075 to 2.29 million years. Comparison of our primary datum markers with those of the tropical planktic foraminiferal zonation scheme also reveal diachroneity on the scale of 0.022 to 4.8 million years. We have identified times of intense dissolution in the northwest Pacific, namely in the middle to late Miocene that likely contribute to the observed diachroneity of datums. This study highlights the need for regionally specific mid-latitude biostratigraphic zonation schemes, as diachronous datums and differing assemblages may be hallmarks of oceanic ecotones created by major boundary current systems. These data also provide a framework to characterize local plankton evolutionary dynamics and paleobiogeographic patterns in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3042596034,"Several studies have recently suggested that an abnormal processing of respiratory interoceptive and nociceptive (painful) stimuli may contribute to eating disorder (ED) pathophysiology. Mood and anxiety disorders (MA) are also characterized by abnormal respiratory symptoms, and show substantial comorbidity with ED. However, no studies have examined both respiratory and pain processing simultaneously within ED and MA. The present study systematically evaluated responses to perturbations of respiratory and nociceptive signals across the levels of physiology, behavior, and symptom report in a transdiagnostic ED sample (n = 51) that was individually matched to MA individuals (n = 51) and healthy comparisons (HC; n = 51). Participants underwent an inspiratory breath-holding challenge as a probe of respiratory interoception and a cold pressor challenge as a probe of pain processing. We expected both clinical groups to report greater stress and fear in response to respiratory and nociceptive perturbation than HCs, in the absence of differential physiological and behavioral responses. During breath-holding, both the ED and MA groups reported significantly more stress, feelings of suffocation, and suffocation fear than HC, with the ED group reporting the most severe symptoms. Moreover, anxiety sensitivity was related to suffocation fear only in the ED group. The heightened affective responses in the current study occurred in the absence of group differences in behavioral (breath hold duration, cold pressor duration) and physiological (end-tidal carbon dioxide, end-tidal oxygen, heart rate, skin conductance) responses. Against our expectations, there were no group differences in the response to cold pain stimulation. A matched-subgroup analysis focusing on individuals with anorexia nervosa (n = 30) produced similar results. These findings underscore the presence of abnormal respiratory interoception in MA and suggest that hyperreactivity to respiratory signals may be a potentially overlooked clinical feature of ED."
https://openalex.org/W3043428374,"The alcohol-abuse drug disulfiram has antitumor effects against diverse cancer types via inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein nuclear protein localization protein 4 (NPL4). However, the antitumor effects of NPL4 and disulfiram in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway using disulfiram and RNA interference and investigated the mechanisms underlying disulfiram in ccRCC. According to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, NPL4 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in clinical ccRCC samples compared with that in normal kidney samples, and patients with high NPL4 expression had poor overall survival compared with patients with low NPL4 expression. Disulfiram and NPL4 siRNA inhibited ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro, and disulfiram inhibited ccRCC tumor growth in a xenograft model. Synergistic antiproliferative effects were observed for combination treatment with disulfiram and sunitinib in vitro and in vivo. In RCC cells from mice treated with disulfiram and/or sunitinib, several genes associated with serine biosynthesis and aldose reductase were downregulated in cells treated with disulfiram or sunitinib alone and further downregulated in cells treated with both disulfiram and sunitinib. These findings provided insights into the mechanisms of disulfiram and suggested novel therapeutic strategies for RCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3042551958,"Maresin1 is a potent lipid mediator exhibiting potential anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of inflammatory diseases, however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Excessive activation of NLRP3 inflammasome has been established in multiple inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that Maresin1 dose-dependently inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This inhibitory effect could be reversed by KH7 and H89, the inhibitors of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Activation of PKA kinase induced by Maresin1 led to the K63-linked ubiquitination of NLRP3 in macrophages. Maresin1 attenuated serum IL-1β secretion through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo using Nlrp3-deficient mouse models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Maresin1 also repressed MSU-induced peritonitis. This study suggests that Maresin1 is an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and can be used clinically in the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-driven inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3042334854,"Transmission network modelling to infer 'who infected whom' in infectious disease outbreaks is a highly active area of research. Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have been a key focus of transmission network models that integrate genomic and epidemiological data. The aim of this study was to extend Lau's systematic Bayesian inference framework to incorporate additional parameters representing predominant species and numbers of animals held on a farm. Lau's Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was reformulated, verified and pseudo-validated on 100 simulated outbreaks populated with demographic data Japan and Australia. The modified model was then implemented on genomic and epidemiological data from the 2010 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Japan, and outputs compared to those from the SCOTTI model implemented in BEAST2. The modified model achieved improvements in overall accuracy when tested on the simulated outbreaks. When implemented on the actual outbreak data from Japan, infected farms that held predominantly pigs were estimated to have five times the transmissibility of infected cattle farms and be 49% less susceptible. The farm-level incubation period was 1 day shorter than the latent period, the timing of the seeding of the outbreak in Japan was inferred, as were key linkages between clusters and features of farms involved in widespread dissemination of this outbreak. To improve accessibility the modified model has been implemented as the R package 'BORIS' for use in future outbreaks."

The comparative study shows that the map cryptographic characteristics are better than the Logistic map, and the map is used as the controller of Fisher-Yates scrambling. Secondly, with the higher complexity of the fractional-order five-dimensional cellular neural network system, it is used as a diffusion controller in the encryption process. And mix the secret key, mapping and plaintext, we can obtain the final ciphertext. Finally, the comparative experiments prove that the proposed algorithm improves the encryption efficiency, has good security performance, and can resist common attack methods."
https://openalex.org/W3042368665,"Homogenization of the initial cell distribution is essential for effective cell development. However, there are few previous reports on efficient cell seeding methods, even though the initial cell distribution has a large effect on cell proliferation. Dense cell regions have an inverse impact on cell development, known as contact inhibition. In this study, we developed a method to homogenize the cell seeding density using secondary flow, or Ekman transportation, induced by orbital movement of the culture dish. We developed an orbital shaker device that can stir the medium in a 35-mm culture dish by shaking the dish along a circular orbit with 2 mm of eccentricity. The distribution of cells in the culture dish can be controlled by the rotational speed of the orbital shaker, enabling dispersion of the initial cell distribution. The experimental results indicated that the cell density became most homogeneous at 61 rpm. We further evaluated the cell proliferation after homogenization of the initial cell density at 61 rpm. The results revealed 36% higher proliferation for the stirred samples compared with the non-stirred control samples. The present findings indicate that homogenization of the initial cell density by Ekman transportation contributes to the achievement of higher cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3042805122,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection stimulates the release of cytokines, including interferons (IFNs). IFNs are initiators, regulators, and effectors of innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, the expression levels of Type I (α, β) and II (γ) IFNs, among untreated tuberculosis (TB) patients and household contacts (HHC) clinically free of TB was assessed. A total of 264 individuals (TB patients-123; HHC-86; laboratory volunteers-55; Treated TB patients-36) were enrolled for this study. IFN-α mRNA expression levels predominated compared to IFN-γ and IFN-β among untreated TB patients. IFN-α transcripts were ~3.5 folds higher in TB patients compared to HHC, (p<0.0001). High expression of IFN-α was seen among 46% (56/ 123) of the TB patients and 26%, (22/86) of HHCs. The expression levels of IFN-α correlated with that of IFN transcriptional release factor 7 (IRF) (p<0.0001). In contrast, an inverse relationship exists between PGE2 and IFN-α expression levels; high IFN-α expressers were associated with low levels of PGE2 and vice-versa (Spearman’s rho = -0.563; p<0.0001). In-vitro, IFN-α failed to restrict the replication of intracellular M.tb. The anti-mycobacterial activity of IFN-γ was compromised in the presence of IFN-α, but not by IFN-β. The expression of IFN-α and β diminished or is absent, among successfully treated TB patients. These observations suggest the utility of assessment of Type I IFNs expression levels as a prognostic marker to monitor tuberculosis patient response to chemotherapy because changes in Type I IFNs expression are expected to precede the clearance and /reduction in bacterial load."
https://openalex.org/W3043276499,"Delivery of preventive care and chronic disease management are key components of a high functioning primary care practice. Health Centers (HCs) funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) have been delivering affordable and accessible primary health care to patients in underserved communities for over fifty years. This study examines the association between health center organization's health information technology (IT) optimization and clinical quality performance.Using 2016 Uniform Data System (UDS) data, we performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to study the association of Meaningful Use (MU) attestation as a proxy for health IT optimization, patient centered medical home (PCMH) recognition status, and practice size on performance of twelve electronically specified clinical quality measures (eCQMs). Bivariate analysis demonstrated performance of eleven out of the twelve preventive and chronic care eCQMs was higher among HCs attesting to MU Stage 2 or above. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Stage 2 MU or above, PCMH status, and larger practice size were positively associated with performance on cancer screening, smoking cessation counseling and pediatric weight assessment and counseling eCQMs.Organizational advancement in MU stages has led to improved quality of care that augments HCs patient care capacity for disease prevention, health promotion, and chronic care management. However, rapid technological advancement in health care acts as a potential source of disparity, as considerable resources needed to optimize the electronic health record (EHR) and to undertake PCMH transformation are found more commonly among larger HCs practices. Smaller practices may lack the financial, human and educational assets to implement and to maintain EHR technology. Accordingly, targeted approaches to support small HCs practices in leveraging economies of scale for health IT optimization, clinical decision support, and clinical workflow enhancements are critical for practices to thrive in the dynamic value-based payment environment."
https://openalex.org/W3043349651,"The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is a destructive polyphagous pest that causes damage to various fruit crops, and their distribution is currently expanding worldwide. Temperature is an important abiotic factor that influences insect population dynamics and distribution by affecting their survival, development, and reproduction. We examined the fecundity, pre-oviposition and oviposition periods, and longevity of adult B. dorsalis at various constant temperatures ranging from13°C to 35°C. The longevity of female B. dorsalis ranged from 116.8 days (18.8°C) to 22.4 days (34.9°C), and the maximum fecundity per female was 1,684 eggs at 28.1°C. Females were only able to lay eggs at 16.7°C to 34.9°C, and both the pre-oviposition and oviposition periods were different depending on the temperature. We modeled female reproduction in two oviposition models (OMs): 1) the current model developed by Kim and Lee, an OM composed of a fecundity model, age-specific survival model, and age-specific cumulative oviposition rate model, and 2) a two-phase OM modified the logic structure of the current model by separating pre-oviposition, so that oviposition was estimated with the female in oviposition phase who had complete pre-oviposition phase. The results of the two-phase OM provided more realistic outputs at lower and higher temperatures than those of the current model. We discussed the usefulness of the two-phase OM for the reproduction of insects with long pre-oviposition periods."
https://openalex.org/W3043379810,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in the pathophysiology of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The mechanisms underlying DCs phenotypic modulation and their function are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of miR-21 on the phenotypic modulation of DCs in vitro and in vivo, and further investigated the impact of miR-21-overexpression DC or miR-21-deficient DC on renal IRI. We found that treatment with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) suppressed miR-21 expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and significantly increased the percentage of mature DCs (CD11c+/MHC-II+/CD80+). Using a selection of microRNA mimics, we successfully induced the upregulation of miR-21 in BMDCs, which induced immature DC phenotype and an anti-inflammatory DC response. However, deletion of miR-21 in BMDCs promoted maturation of DCs under H/R. Adoptive transfer of miR-21-overexpression BMDCs could alleviate renal IR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and acute kidney injury (AKI). Mice with miR-21 deficiency in DCs subjected to renal IR showed more severe renal dysfunction and inflammatory response compared with wild-type mice. In addition, chemokine C receptor 7 (CCR7), a surface marker of mature DC, was a target gene of miR-21, and silencing of CCR7 in BMDCs led to reduced mature DCs under H/R. In conclusion, our findings highlight miR-21 as a key regulator of DCs subset phenotype and a potential therapeutic target in renal IRI."
https://openalex.org/W3043764652,"The discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations spurred the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, as the first-line treatment of lung cancers. We previously reported that differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (e.g. L858R) and resistant (T790M) EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2–EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas SMURF2 knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas SMURF2 knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance.

There are two “classical” activating mutations, in-frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R) in EGFR, which drive adenocarcinoma of the lung in the majority of never smokers (1Sharma S.V. Bell D.W. Settleman J. Haber D.A. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in lung cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7 (17318210): 169-18110.1038/nrc2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). The presence of these receptor mutations is a marker for sensitivity to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). First-generation TKIs, such as erlotinib and gefitinib, produce responses; however, within a year, tumors develop TKI resistance. In about 50% of these cases, resistance is because of the enrichment of a second point mutation at exon 20, where threonine at the 790 position is mutated to methionine (T790M) (2Costa D.B. Schumer S.T. Tenen D.G. Kobayashi S.

To circumvent resistance, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor (AZD9291, osimertinib) has been generated, which is effective for patients carrying the T790M mutation (3Ramalingam S.S. Vansteenkiste J.

Despite significant efforts, the molecular mechanisms causing acquired TKI resistance are still poorly understood. In initial studies, differential drug-binding abilities and altered ATP-binding affinities of various EGFR mutants have been proposed to be responsible for differential TKI response (5Yun C.H.

We further elucidated the importance of EGFR degradation in head and neck cancer patients treated with erlotinib (19Tsien C.I. Nyati M.K. Ahsan A. Ramanand S.G. Chepeha D.B. Worden F.P. Helman J.I.

Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that EGFR degradation is a key phenomenon in determining cytotoxicity to various chemotherapies, radiation, or TKI targeting EGFR. Differential EGFR degradation may contribute to the dramatic difference in sensitivity to TKIs of patients harboring L858R compared with T790M. Our data demonstrated that TKI-sensitive EGFR delE746-A759 or L858R mutant proteins undergo rapid degradation upon erlotinib treatment, whereas TKI-resistant L858R/T790M protein is highly stable (20Ray P.

Ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes, which play an important role in EGFR endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation, regulate EGFR stability (21Tomas A. Futter C.E. Eden E.R.

The most extensively studied E3 ligase responsible for EGF-mediated EGFR polyubiquitination is c-CBL (22Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K.

Additionally, AIP4/ITCH, pVHL, and UBE4B play roles in the polyubiquitination and degradation of EGFR (23Zhou L. Yang H.

We have reported that the HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2), directly interacts with EGFR, but, unlike several others, SMURF2's ubiquitin ligase activity is critical for stabilizing EGFR (25Ray D. Ahsan A. Helman A. Chen G. Hegde A. Gurjar S.R. Zhao L. Kiyokawa H. Beer D.G. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Regulation of EGFR protein stability by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase SMURF2.Neoplasia. 2011; 13 (21750651): 570-57810.1593/neo.11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we study the mechanistic and functional importance of SMURF2-mediated ubiquitination on different EGFR mutants, identify residues undergoing posttranslational modifications, and determine the relevance of mutant receptor membrane retention and protein stability, which together can predict TKI response. Additionally, we explore the impact of disruption of SMURF2 interaction with its cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), UBCH5, on EGFR protein stability to overcome TKI resistance. We previously reported that SMURF2 ubiquitin ligase activity is critical in maintaining EGFR protein stability (25Ray D. Ahsan A. Helman A. Chen G. Hegde A. Gurjar S.R. Zhao L. Kiyokawa H. Beer D.G. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Regulation of EGFR protein stability by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase SMURF2.Neoplasia. 2011; 13 (21750651): 570-57810.1593/neo.11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SMURF2 can directly ubiquitinate EGFR and whether such modification can vary depending on the type of EGFR mutations, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays by incubating either WT or different EGFR (either L858R [L] or L858R/T790M [L+T]) mutants with SMURF2. As SMURF2 partners with either UBCH7 or UBCH5 as the E2, we tested SMURF2 catalytic activity on EGFR in the presence or absence of either one of the E2s. As shown in Fig. 1A, we noted substantial polyubiquitination of L+T mutant EGFR compared with WT and L mutant. Additionally, the polyubiquitinated species formed in the presence of UBCH5 was of higher molecular weight than those formed in the presence of UBCH7; the latter we speculate to be autoubiquitinated SMURF2, as reported earlier (26Ogunjimi A.A. Briant D.J. Pece-Barbara N. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Seet B.T. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Regulation of Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase activity by anchoring the E2 to the HECT domain.Mol.

Chen G. Hegde A. Gurjar S.R. Zhao L. Kiyokawa H. Beer D.G. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Regulation of EGFR protein stability by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase SMURF2.Neoplasia. 2011; 13 (21750651): 570-57810.1593/neo.11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a catalytic-dead (C716A) mutant SMURF2 also failed to polyubiquitinate L+T mutant EGFR, supporting the hypothesis that EGFR is a SMURF2 substrate (Fig. 1B). To decipher whether preferential binding is responsible for SMURF2-mediated mutant EGFR ubiquitination, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. As shown in Fig. 1C, we noted comparable binding of SMURF2 with WT and L and L+T mutant EGFR. To understand the kind of ubiquitin linkage formed on L+T mutant EGFR, we utilized different ubiquitin mutants (K11R, K48R, and K63R) deficient in forming specific linkages. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was a significant reduction of mutant EGFR polyubiquitination only in the presence of K63R recombinant ubiquitin, suggesting SMURF2-mediated EGFR ubiquitination is predominantly K63 linked. To determine the site(s) ubiquitinated in EGFR by SMURF2, we performed MS analysis of immunoprecipitated receptor and identified four lysine residues, K721, K846, K1037, and K1164 (Fig. S1, A–D, and Table S1). Interestingly, K721 and K846 are known to be important for EGFR kinase activity (27Russo M.W. Lukas T.J. Cohen S. Staros J.V.

Huang F. Kim W. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Multiple mechanisms collectively regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J.

Acetylation and ubiquitination counteract each other (31Caron C. Boyault C. Khochbin S. Regulatory cross-talk between lysine acetylation and ubiquitination: role in the control of protein stability.Bioessays. 2005; 27 (15770681): 408-41510.1002/bies.20210Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of the two posttranslational processes in determining EGFR protein stability, we generated site-specific EGFR mutants of K1037, mutated either to arginine (R, can be neither ubiquitinated nor acetylated) or glutamine (Q, mimics acetylated lysine) (32Wang X. Hayes J.J. Acetylation mimics within individual core histone tail domains indicate distinct roles in regulating the stability of higher-order chromatin structure.Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 2A, the incorporation of the K-to-Q mutation in an L+T background converted a stable double mutant to unstable following erlotinib treatment with consequent accumulation of polyubiquitinated species (Fig. 2B). In contrast, conversion of K1037 to R affected the triple mutant EGFR steady-state levels to a lesser extent following erlotinib treatment (Fig. 2A). Ubiquitination and acetylation counteract each other, and acetylation of EGFR has been associated with receptor internalization (30Goh L.K. Huang F. Kim W. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Multiple mechanisms collectively regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SMURF2-mediated ubiquitination is important to maintain the surface density of EGFR by enhancing protein stability and thereby reducing internalization. We addressed this question by directly measuring the protein density in the membrane using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) (34Rust M.J. Bates M. Zhuang X. Sub-diffraction-limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 (16896339): 793-79510.1038/nmeth929Crossref PubMed Scopus (5637) Google Scholar, 35Heilemann M. van de Linde S. Schuttpelz M. Kasper R. Seefeldt B. Mukherjee A. Tinnefeld P. Sauer M.

Engl. 2008; 47 (18646237): 6172-617610.1002/anie.200802376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). STORM images were quantified using a pair correlation-based analytical method that can correct quantitative artifacts arising from overcounting. This method takes advantage of the observation that the magnitude of self-clustering that arises from overcounting is inversely proportional to the density of the labeled protein, as long as the labeled protein is sampled randomly. We calculated the autocorrelation function for reconstructed images and used the value of the autocorrelation function at different radii to determine the density of protein in the reconstructed image using Equation 1 described in Materials and methods. We first tested the validity of our approach by quantifying EGFR levels in the membranes of multiple cell lines (CHO with no detectable EGFR and head and neck cancer cell lines UMSCC-11b, UMSCC-1, and UMSCC-29b), which express various amounts of receptor as assessed by conventional immunoblotting (Fig. S2A). As shown in Fig. S2, B and C, there was a high correlation (R2 = 0.9854) observed between the conventional immunoblotting and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, demonstrating applicability. To validate the methodology further, we measured the receptor population in a human breast cancer MCF7 cell line with known (1000–5000 per cell) numbers of EGFR (36Song L. Falzone N. Vallis K.A. EGF-coated gold nanoparticles provide an efficient nano-scale delivery system for the molecular radiotherapy of EGFR-positive cancer.Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2016; 92: 716-72310.3109/09553002.2016.1145360Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S2, D and E, we counted n = 900–1771 receptor molecules per cell (assuming a radius of 20–25 μm), consistent with the literature. The mean and standard deviation of cell-to-cell variation of EGFR density in MCF-7 was 0.86 ± 0.40 receptors/µm2. Having established the reliability of the methodology, we next quantified EGFR surface density in the presence and absence of SMURF2. We conducted this experiment in both the presence and absence of EGF. EGF treatment caused a decrease in surface EGFR population arising from internalization of EGFR (Fig. S2F). The decrease in EGFR surface expression was greater following EGF treatment in SMURF2 siRNA treated cells (∼60% versus ∼40% loss) compared with control siRNA treatment, which was further demonstrated using immunoblotting of the same samples (Fig. S2F, lower). These findings show that there is a role for SMURF2 in maintaining EGFR membrane levels. We previously reported a dynamic interaction between EGFR and SMURF2 (25Ray D. Ahsan A. Helman A. Chen G. Hegde A. Gurjar S.R. Zhao L. Kiyokawa H. Beer D.G. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Regulation of EGFR protein stability by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase SMURF2.Neoplasia. 2011; 13 (21750651): 570-57810.1593/neo.11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and here we found that knockdown of SMURF2 alters EGFR density, especially following EGF stimulation. This led us to hypothesize that EGFR-SMURF2 interaction occurs proximal to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis in cell-fractionated isolates from UMSCC-1 cells, using siRNA to alter SMURF2 levels. As expected, we observed EGFR was predominantly present in the plasma membrane, but SMURF2 was primarily cytosolic (Fig. 3A, right) with a small fraction present in the membrane. Interestingly, we found an increased EGFR-SMURF2 interaction in the membrane fraction following EGF treatment (Fig. 3A, left). Next, we conducted two-color STORM experiments to quantify interaction between EGFR and SMURF2 localized proximal to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). UMSCC-1 cells were grown normally in serum-containing media, and SMURF2 and EGFR levels were determined in the presence and absence of EGF (10 ng/ml, 30 min). Interestingly, upon stimulation with EGF, we observed an increase (2.9 ± 0.3-fold) in SMURF2 coclustering with EGFR to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). SMURF2 density in the membrane went up almost 4-fold in the membrane, in line with the cell fractionation studies. To better understand the protective role of SMURF2 in the retention of activated receptor in the cell membrane, we determined changes in EGFR density in the plasma membrane following SMURF2 knockdown both in the presence and absence of EGF. Surface EGFR molecules of UMSCC-1 cells grown in serum-containing medium were 5.3 ± 0.6-fold higher than those of cells grown under serum-free conditions (Fig. 3D). As previously noted, EGF (10 ng/ml for 30 min) treatment caused a decrease of 44.5% ± 3.3% and 37.2% ± 1.2%, respectively, for cells grown in serum-starved and serum-containing media, suggesting that EGF-induced EGFR internalization is independent of the growth conditions. However, the impact of SMURF2 loss was predominant in EGF-treated cells grown in serum-containing media; in the absence of EGF, SMURF2 knockdown caused a decrease of 21.1% ± 2.3% and 29.3% ± 3.4% in serum-starved and serum-containing conditions, respectively. However, upon EGF treatment, we noted 46% ± 3.3% and 53% ± 4.3% decreases in EGFR surface expression depending on serum absence or presence. As shown in Fig. 3E, loss of SMURF2 resulted in significant loss of surface EGFR. In contrast, there was an increase in the cytosolic EGFR levels when the same cell was imaged using superresolution imaging on a cross-sectional area of the cytosol using a greater penetration depth in the TIRF setup. However, because of clustering of EGFR, we were unable to use STORM microscopy to quantify receptor density in the cytosol. We circumvented this by investigating the relationship between fluorescence intensity of EGFR in the membrane and cytosol to that of SMURF2 in individual cells in nonreconstructed images. Two-color epifluorescence imaging was used to determine the fluorescence intensity of SMURF2 and EGFR in the cytosol, and TIRF imaging was used to measure the membrane fluorescence intensity of EGFR in individual cells. The intensities were then normalized and binned. As shown in Fig. 3F, membrane levels of EGFR are positively correlated with SMURF2 expression, whereas cytosolic EGFR levels are inversely correlated. Together, as the loss of surface EGFR was more prevalent upon SMURF2 knockdown upon EGF treatment, our data indicate that SMURF2 better protects ligand-activated EGFR, which otherwise undergoes receptor internalization. As EGF treatment promotes endosome-mediated receptor internalization followed by lysosome-mediated degradation, we tested the effects of SMURF2 loss on EGFR cytosolic trafficking. Although TIRF imaging can be used to quantify EGFR membrane expression, clustering of receptors in cytosolic organelles is less reliable. Therefore, we relied on conventional two-color colocalization studies of EGFR with EEA1 (as an endosomal marker) and LAMP1 (as a lysosomal marker). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated by drawing a mask of the cell, and the two (control versus SMURF2 siRNA) conditions were compared for at least 10 cells. Upon SMURF2 knockdown, we found an increase in cytosolic EGFR colocalization both with EEA1 (p = 0.03) and LAM"

Pinpointing the precise function of these structural motifs in determining ligand binding affinity and specificity, however, not only contributes to a better understanding of the molecular evolution of large protein families in general but also provides the structural basis for engineering synthetic adhesins with novel ligand binding patterns. The opportunistic human fungal pathogen C. glabrata is a commensal of the human microbiome that accounts for up to 29% of total life-threatening Candida bloodstream infections (16Pfaller M.A. Messer S.A. Moet G.J. Jones R.N. Castanheira M.

Because of its resistance to several antimicrobial agents and in combination with the more virulent C. albicans, it poses an increasing threat to human health, especially to patients with a compromised immune system (17Miceli M.H.

For adherence to human epithelial cells, C. glabrata carries more than 80 proteins with architectures of typical GPI-CWP adhesins (19Timmermans B. De Las Penas A. Castano I. Van Dijck P.

Among these, the Epa (epithelial adhesin) proteins form the largest family, with more than 20 members, depending on the strain background. Moreover, comparative genomic studies have shown that Epa-like adhesins can be found in diverse species of the Nakaseomyces genus, albeit with variable numbers often correlating with known pathogenicity (21Gabaldon T.

These functional studies have employed either purified EpaA domains or EpaA-presenting surface display systems like the nonpathogenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These binding studies show that roughly 70% of Epa family members recognize a wide variety of α- and β-linked galactosides and that the rest binds to several nongalactosidic terminal glycans. Moreover, host cell binding studies have revealed that about 20% of Epa adhesins confer very efficient human epithelial cell adhesion and 35% mediate moderate binding, whereas the rest adhere only weakly to epithelial cells. Whether Epa family members are competent to bind to further glycans or host cells is currently not known. A number of high-resolution crystal structures of the adhesion domains of Epa1 and Epa6 in complex with cognate glycan ligands have provided several structural features of Epa family members (12Maestre-Reyna M.

These studies revealed that Epa proteins generally possess a highly conserved PA14/Flo5-like core domain as initially found in the structures of the anthrax-protective antigen and the adhesion domains of the S. cerevisiae flocculin Flo5 (24Petosa C.

In addition, further peripheral structural elements have been identified that appear to contribute to ligand binding affinity and specificity (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). These structural features include two calcium binding loops, CBL1 and CBL2, which form the inner binding pocket of Epa proteins, and three further loops, L1–L3, that form the outer pocket. Moreover, these structural studies show that the surface composition of EpaA domains is variable but that certain residues of the ligand binding pockets are highly conserved. These include a DcisD motif (25Veelders M. Brückner S. Ott D. Unverzagt C. Mösch H.U. Essen L.O. Structural basis of flocculin-mediated social behavior in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2010; 107 (21149680): 22511-2251610.1073/pnas.1013210108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in the inner pocket and a tryptophan residue in loop L3, as well as a disulfide bond linking loop L1 and L2 in the outer pocket (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that these conserved surface elements are required for high-affinity ligand binding (12Maestre-Reyna M. Diderrich R. Veelders M.S. Eulenburg G. Kalugin V. Brückner S. Keller P. Rupp S. Mösch H.U. Essen L.O. Structural basis for promiscuity and specificity during Candida glabrata invasion of host epithelia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, the binding pockets of EpaA domains contain highly variable residues that are located within CBL2 and the loops L1 and L2. Specifically, three of the residues of CBL2, positions II–IV, are highly variable. Interestingly, the sequence of these positions often correlates with the binding of certain galactosides, indicating that they are involved in conferring ligand binding specificity. In certain cases, CBL2 composition and ligand binding patterns do not correlate, suggesting that other variable elements, e.g. loops L1 and L2, contribute to ligand recognition (15Diderrich R. Kock M. Maestre-Reyna M. Keller P. Steuber H. Rupp S. Essen L.O. Mösch H.U. Structural hot spots determine functional diversity of the Candida glabrata epithelial adhesin family.J. Biol.

However, the involvement of these variable structural elements in determining ligand binding affinity and specificity has not been comprehensively addressed by structure-based mutational analysis to obtain a more general picture of programming ligand binding properties within the Epa family. In this study, we have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of diverse EpaA domains to determine the precise function of both conserved and variable structural motifs. Specifically, we created EpaA variants with mutations in the highly conserved DcisD motif, the tryptophan residue in loop L3, the disulfide bond linking loops L1 and L2, exchanges in the highly variable CBL2 positions II–IV, and the variable loop L1. Mutated EpaA variants were then functionally characterized by in vivo studies using an S. cerevisiae expression system and human epithelial cells and complementary in vitro analyses employing glycan array assays and crystal structure analysis. Our data indicate that (i) the conserved structural motifs are crucial for efficient host cell binding, (ii) the variable loop CBL2 plays a central role in programming ligand binding specificity, and (iii) the variable loop L1 appears to affect host cell binding by influencing the affinity rather than the specificity of ligand binding. In summary, our study suggests that core functionality and diversity of the Epa family has been achieved by coevolution of crucial conserved and variable structural hot spots. We first assessed the role of three structural elements that are conserved in all known EpaA variants, specifically the DcisD motif, the tryptophan residue in loop L3, and the disulfide bond linking loops L1 and L2 (Fig. 1). For this purpose, we tested functionality of these elements at the example of Epa1A by construction of respective mutants. These included Epa1AD165A carrying an AcisD motif, Epa1AW198A carrying an alanine instead of a tryptophan residue in the L3 loop, and Epa1AC78S breaking the disulfide bond between loops L1 an L2. These variants were tested for their in vivo adhesion activity to epithelial cells by using an S. cerevisiae expression system and human colorectal Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2, Fig. S2, Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2, all three mutations significantly suppress adhesion activity in vivo (Table S1), indicating that the respective conserved structural elements are indeed crucial for functionality.Table 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidEpaA variantRelevant genotypeSource or referencepET-28(a)+PT7 6×His lacI KanRMerck, GermanyBHUM1829Epa1AEPA1(31-271) in pET-28(a)+15Diderrich R.

Therefore, we tested whether, apart from indole, other aromatic side chains fulfill this function. For this purpose, Epa1AW198Y and Epa1AW198H mutants were constructed and tested for epithelial cell binding, revealing that both variants confer efficient adhesion. Thus, functionality of the residue at position 198 is not restricted to indole and can be fulfilled by other aromatic side chains. Previous studies with Epa1A have shown that either exchange of its CBL2 motif to corresponding regions of other EpaA variants or random mutagenesis of positions II or III in CBL2 is sufficient to alter ligand binding specificity (12Maestre-Reyna M.

https://openalex.org/W3043395715,"The objective is to study the design method of roadway support and provide technical support for coal mining and other mining methods that need deep roadway excavation. Through literature review, the occurrence, development mechanism and influencing factors of surrounding loose rock zones of roadways are analyzed. A method of detecting is selected according to the characteristics of surrounding rock loosening. Knowledge of elastoplastic mechanics is used to theoretically study the failure mechanism of surrounding rock in deep re-mining roadways. Based on the artificial neural network prediction model (ANN), the surrounding rock is classified and a support network model of the decision system is constructed. After the design of roadway support, a sharp change of vault subsidence normally occurs within about 7 days after excavation, and the total subsidence is 14 mm. In the following month, deformation is slow, subsidence is small, and it is basically stable after one month. The curve of the vault subsidence rate shows that the vault subsidence rate is less than or equal to 1mm/d after 7 days. The convergence rate is also less than 1 mm/d after 7 days. There are two cave mouths AB and CD, and the convergence value of AB is 6.47mm, CD is 10.26mm: CD is slightly larger than AB, and it is close to stable one month later. It is essentially consistent with the time of vault settlement and stability, and the amount of deformation is approximately the same. This shows that, with the advance of the working face, the displacement of the surrounding rock in the section away from the working face will gradually decrease and the surrounding rock will be stable. The stability time of surrounding rock displacement of the portal section is the same as that of vault subsidence under the initial support, and the amount of deformation is approximately the same, indicating that the support parameters and construction methods are reasonable."
https://openalex.org/W3043209234,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease of high medical importance that affects humans worldwide. Humans or animals acquire an infection with pathogenic leptospires either by direct contact with infected animals or by indirect contact to contaminated environment. Survival of Leptospira spp. in the environment after having been shed via animal urine is thus a key factor to estimate the risk of infection, but not much is known about the tenacity of pathogenic leptospires. Here, the survival time of both a laboratory strain and a field strain of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa in animal urine and their tenacity while drying was investigated and compared at different temperatures (15°C-37°C). Leptospira spp. are also often found in rivers and ponds. As the infection risk for humans and animals also depends on the spreading and survival of Leptospira spp. in these environments, the survival of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa was investigated using a 50-meter-long hose system simulating a water stream. Both strains did not survive in undiluted cattle or dog urine. Comparing different temperatures and dilution media, the laboratory strain survived the longest in diluted cattle urine with a slightly alkaline pH value (3 days), whilst the field strain survived in diluted dog urine with a slightly acid pH value up to a maximum of 24 h. Both strains did not survive drying on a solid surface. In a water stream, leptospires were able to move faster or slower than the average velocity of the water due to their intrinsic mobility but were not able to survive the mechanical damage caused by running water in the hose system. From our results we conclude, that once excreted via animal urine, the leptospires immediately need moisture or a water body to survive and stay infectious."

The key pathways regulating substance and energy metabolism were screened, encompassing tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis pathways, biosynthesis of amino acid pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors pathway, etc Poria and its split components showed promoting effects on substance and energy metabolism in normal model, while showed amelioration effects on hypothyroidism model at different degrees, and had no significant improvement effects on hyperthyroidism in rats. Volatile oil, triterpenoid, and crude polysaccharide from Poria were regarded as substance basis of Poria ameliorating hypothyroidism other than hyperthyroidism.

https://openalex.org/W3043781527,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether pre-weaning heifer calves divergent for residual feed intake (RFI) or residual feed intake and body weight gain (RIG) exhibit differences in thermography, blood, and ruminal parameters. Thirty-two Gyr heifer calves were enrolled in a 63-d trial and classified into 2 feed efficiency (FE) groups based on RFI and RIG (mean ± 0.5 SD). The groups were classified as high efficiency (HE) RFI (HE RFI, n = 9), HE RIG (HE RIG, n = 10), low efficiency (LE) RFI (LE RFI, n = 10), and LE RIG (LE RIG, n = 11). The amount of whole milk provided for each calf was calculated based on their metabolic weight at birth (42% x BW0.75). The liquid diet was divided into two meals at 0700 and 1400 h. The total solid diet (TSD) was composed of 92% concentrate and 8% of Tifton 85 hay chopped in 5-cm lengths, as fed. Intake was measured daily. Blood concentrations of insulin, beta hydroxybutyrate, urea, and glucose, and ruminal pH, N-NH3, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were evaluated at 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days of age. Thermal images of the calves were taken with an infrared camera (FLIR T420, FLIR Systems Inc., Wilsonville, OR) on d 56 (±3) at 0600 h, before the morning feeding. Total VFA concentration and propionate as % of total VFA were 24.2% and 22.2% lower in HE RFI compared to LE RFI calves, respectively. On the other hand, acetate as % of total VFA was 10.6% greater in HE RFI than LE RFI calves. Blood urea concentration tended to be greater in LE RFI than HE RFI calves. High efficiency HE RIG tended to have 6.8% greater acetate and 15.4% lower propionate as % of total VFA than LE RIG. Blood insulin concentration was greater and blood glucose tended to be greater for LE RIG than HE RIG group. Low efficiency RIG group had greater left rib, left flank, and anus surface temperature measured by infrared thermography than the HE RIG group. Differences in ruminal fermentation do not seem to be associated with pre-weaning calves efficiency, while differences in protein metabolism seem to affect RFI during this phase. Infrared thermography appears to be correlated to RIG in pre-weaning heifer calves."
https://openalex.org/W3042300008,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification required for protein secretion, extracellular matrix formation, and organ growth. O-Glycosylation is initiated by a large family of enzymes (GALNTs in mammals and PGANTs in Drosophila) that catalyze the addition of GalNAc onto the hydroxyl groups of serines or threonines in protein substrates. These enzymes contain two functional domains: a catalytic domain and a C-terminal ricin-like lectin domain comprised of three potential GalNAc recognition repeats termed α, β, and γ. The catalytic domain is responsible for binding donor and acceptor substrates and catalyzing transfer of GalNAc, whereas the lectin domain recognizes more distant extant GalNAc on previously glycosylated substrates. We previously demonstrated a novel role for the α repeat of lectin domain in influencing charged peptide preferences. Here, we further interrogate how the differentially spliced α repeat of the PGANT9A and PGANT9B O-glycosyltransferases confers distinct preferences for a variety of endogenous substrates. Through biochemical analyses and in silico modeling using preferred substrates, we find that a combination of charged residues within the α repeat and charged residues in the flexible gating loop of the catalytic domain distinctively influence the peptide substrate preferences of each splice variant. Moreover, PGANT9A and PGANT9B also display unique glycopeptide preferences. These data illustrate how changes within the noncatalytic lectin domain can alter the recognition of both peptide and glycopeptide substrates.

https://openalex.org/W3042836795,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in mammal physiology and in the etiology and progression of inflammatory and oxidative stress-based diseases. In adults, RAGE expression is normally high only in the lung where the protein concentrates in the basal membrane of alveolar Type I epithelial cells. In diseases, RAGE levels increase in the affected tissues and sustain chronic inflammation. RAGE exists as a membrane glycoprotein with an ectodomain, a transmembrane helix, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail, or as a soluble ectodomain that acts as a decoy receptor (sRAGE). VC1 domain is responsible for binding to the majority of RAGE ligands including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and HMGB1. To ascertain whether other ligands exist, we analyzed by MS the material pulled down by VC1 from human plasma. Twenty of 295 identified proteins were selected and associated to coagulation and complement processes and to extracellular matrix. Four of them contained a γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla) domain, a calcium-binding module, and prothrombin (PT) was the most abundant. Using MicroScale thermophoresis, we quantified the interaction of PT with VC1 and sRAGE in the absence or presence of calcium that acted as a competitor. PT devoid of the Gla domain (PT des-Gla) did not bind to sRAGE, providing further evidence that the Gla domain is critical for the interaction. Finally, the presence of VC1 delayed plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that RAGE is involved in modulating blood coagulation presumably in conditions of lung injury."

The YBT was used to measure participants' dynamic balance in the right and left anterior (RA, LA), posteromedial (RPM, LPM), and posterolateral (RPL, LPL) directions.The outcome in this trial was reach distance (cm). There was a significant group by time interaction in terms of reach distance for all directions (p<0.05, η2 ranged from 0.06 to 0.20). In the exercise group, results of the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant improvements in the reach distance in all the directions (p<0.001). In contrast, the non-exercise group had significant difference only in the left posterolateral direction (p = 0.009). Participants in the exercise group achieved significantly greater reach distance (cm) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for RA[(2.8, 0.4 to 5.2), p = 0.023]; LA[(3.2, 0.9 to 5.6), p = 0.008]; RPM[(4.0, 1.0 to 7.9), p = 0.046]; LPM[(5.8,1.3 to 10.3), p = 0.013]; RPL[(7.6, 2.6 to 12.6), p = 0.003]; and LPL[(4.2, 0.3 to 8.2), p = 0.035].The modified version of OEP appears to be effective in improving parameters of dynamic balance in the middle-aged adult population. The improvements in YBT reach distance in the exercise group are indicative of the significance of performing balance and strength exercises regularly for this population."
https://openalex.org/W3042289630,"Testosterone stimulates iron-dependent erythropoiesis and suppresses hepcidin. To clarify the role of iron in mediating testosterone's effects on erythropoiesis, we induced iron deficiency in mice by feeding low iron diet. Iron-replete and iron-deficient mice were treated weekly with testosterone propionate or vehicle for 3 weeks. Testosterone treatment increased red cell count in iron-replete mice, but, surprisingly, testosterone reduced red cell count in iron-deficient mice. Splenic stress erythropoiesis was stimulated in iron-deficient mice relative to iron-replete mice, and further increased by testosterone treatment, as indicated by the increase in red pulp area, the number of nucleated erythroblasts, and expression levels of TfR1, GATA1, and other erythroid genes. Testosterone treatment of iron-deficient mice increased the ratio of early-to-late erythroblasts in the spleen and bone marrow, and serum LDH level, consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis. In iron-deficient mice, erythropoietin levels were higher but erythropoietin-regulated genes were generally downregulated relative to iron-replete mice, suggesting erythropoietin resistance. Conclusion: Testosterone treatment stimulates splenic stress erythropoiesis in iron-replete as well as iron-deficient mice. However, testosterone worsens anemia in iron-deficient mice because of ineffective erythropoiesis possibly due to erythropoietin resistance associated with iron deficiency. Iron plays an important role in mediating testosterone's effects on erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W3042811906,"This study aimed to clarify the cause of rugby head and spinal cord injuries through a network centrality analysis of 14-year (2004-2018) longitudinal data in Japan. The study hypothesis is that understanding the causal relationship among the occurrence of serious injuries, the quality of player experience and play situation as a network structure could be possible to obtain practical knowledge on injury prevention. In this study, bipartite graphs are used to make it easier to understand the situation of players and injuries. This would also help to elucidate more characteristic subgroup. A network bipartite graph and subgroup (cluster) analyses were performed to clarify the injured players' experience and the cause of injury. We used the algorithm of R program, IGRAPH, clustering edge betweenness. For subgroup extraction, the modularity Q value was used to determine which step to cut. The Japanese rugby population was 93,873 (2014-2018 average), and 27% were high school students. The data showed that careful attention would be particularly needed for groups of inexperienced Japanese high school players. Our study suggests that we should consider introducing rules that prohibit ""head-on collisions"" in youth rugby."
https://openalex.org/W3043660832,"Chinese information extraction is traditionally performed in the process of word segmentation, entity recognition, relation extraction and event detection. This pipelined approach suffers from two limitations: 1) It is prone to introduce propagated errors from upstream tasks to subsequent applications; 2) Mutual benefits of cross-task dependencies are hard to be introduced in non-overlapping models. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel transition-based model that jointly performs entity recognition, relation extraction and event detection as a single task. In addition, we incorporate subword-level information into character sequence with the use of a hybrid lattice structure, removing the reliance of external word tokenizers. Results on standard ACE benchmarks show the benefits of the proposed joint model and lattice network, which gives the best result in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3043710493,"We present a multi-agent computational approach to partitioning semantic spaces using reinforcement-learning (RL). Two agents communicate using a finite linguistic vocabulary in order to convey a concept. This is tested in the color domain, and a natural reinforcement learning mechanism is shown to converge to a scheme that achieves a near-optimal trade-off of simplicity versus communication efficiency. Results are presented both on the communication efficiency as well as on analyses of the resulting partitions of the color space. The effect of varying environmental factors such as noise is also studied. These results suggest that RL offers a powerful and flexible computational framework that can contribute to the development of communication schemes for color names that are near-optimal in an information-theoretic sense and may shape color-naming systems across languages. Our approach is not specific to color and can be used to explore cross-language variation in other semantic domains."

While a third of extant Hawaiian landbird species are estimated to be elevational migrants this assumption is based primarily on early naturalist's observations with limited empirical evidence. In this study, we compared stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2H) of metabolically inert (feathers) and active (blood plasma, red blood cells) tissues collected from the same individual to determine if present day populations of Hawaiian honeycreepers undergo elevational movements to track areas of seasonally high flower bloom that constitute significant food resources. We also measured stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) and stable nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) to examine potential changes in diet between time periods. We found that the majority of 'apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Hawai'i 'amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) captured at high elevation, high bloom flowering sites in the fall were not year-round residents at the capture locations, but had molted their feathers at lower elevations presumably in the summer after breeding. δ2H values of feathers for all individuals sampled were higher than blood plasma isotope values after accounting for differences in tissue-specific discrimination. We did not find a difference in the propensity of elevational movement between 'apapane and Hawai'i 'amakihi, even though the 'amakihi is considered more sedentary. However, consistent with a more generalist diet, δ15N values indicated that Hawai'i 'amakihi had a more diverse diet across trophic levels than 'apapane, and a greater reliance on nectar in the fall. We demonstrate that collecting multiple tissue samples, which grow at different rates or time periods, from a single individual can provide insights into elevational movements of Hawaiian honeycreepers over an extended time period."
https://openalex.org/W3043113451,"Continuous, safely managed water is critical to health and development, but rural service delivery faces complex challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report the first application of continuous quality improvement (CQI) methods to improve the microbial quality of household water for consumption (HWC) and the functionality of water sources in four rural districts of northern Ghana. We further report on the impacts of interventions developed through these methods. A local CQI team was formed and trained in CQI methods. Baseline data were collected and analyzed to identify determinants of service delivery problems and microbial safety. The CQI team randomized communities, developed an improvement package, iteratively piloted it in intervention communities, and used uptake survey data to refine the package. The final improvement package comprised safe water storage containers, refresher training for community WaSH committees and replacement of missing maintenance tools. This package significantly reduced contamination of HWC (p<0.01), and significant reduction in contamination persisted two years after implementation. Repair times in both intervention and control arms decreased relative to baseline (p<0.05), but differences between intervention and control arms were not significant at endline. Further work is needed to build on the gains in household water quality observed in this work, sustain and scale these improvements, and explore applications of CQI to other aspects of water supply and sanitation."
https://openalex.org/W3043180592,"Cross-country skiers use different sub-techniques like 'gears' (diagonals stride, double poling with kick, and double poling) depending on terrain (incline) and demand (speed and external work rate). Previous studies have identified the major effect of speed and incline, but not any potential interaction between these parameters: the incline-speed combination determines the work rate, which in itself may be a controlling factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these task conditions (external work rate, speed, incline) and their interactions on the choice of sub-technique in classical roller skiing. Twelve male and nine female cross-country skiers executed three subsets of protocols in which two of three condition parameters were altered every 15 seconds while roller skiing on a treadmill. This design created a quasi-random set of combinations of speed, incline and work rate that were analysed on sub-technique choice. A repeated measures model with sex as between subject factor was conducted for each subset of protocols. The incline appeared to be the factor affecting sub-technique choice most, but not exclusively; at constant incline, athletes applied different sub-techniques, depending mostly on speed rather than work rate. Most athletes did not use one particular sub-technique for a given speed-incline-work rate combination, but it depended on the protocol and direction of condition change in the constant speed protocol (hysteresis). Only minor differences between men and women existed regarding the impact of condition factor on sub-technique choice. The findings disagree with the notion of a simple mechanism that explains the choice of sub-technique, but rather opt for a complex structure that entangles various mechanisms which play a role in the choice of sub-technique under moderate effort conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3043382057,"The epidemic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is in its second decade, but the routes of transmission remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that by pairing single genome sequencing (SGS), to enumerate infecting HCV genomes (viruses), with detailed sexual and drug histories, we could gain insight into the routes of transmission among MSM. We used SGS to analyze blood specimens from eight HIV-infected MSM who had 10 episodes of acute (seronegative) or early HCV infections. Seven of eight men reported condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI), six with rectal exposure to semen, and all eight denied rectal trauma or bleeding. Of the 10 HCV infections, eight resulted from transmission of a single virus; one infection resulted from transmission of either one or a few (three or four) closely-related viruses; and one infection resulted from transmission of >10 distinct viruses. The participant infected by >10 viruses reported sharing injection equipment for methamphetamine during sex. Two other participants also injected methamphetamine during sex but they did not share injection equipment and were infected by a single virus. Conclusions: Most HCV infections of HIV-infected MSM without a history of either rectal trauma or bleeding or shared injection equipment were caused by a single virus. Intra-rectal exposure to semen during CRAI is therefore likely sufficient for HCV transmission among MSM. Conversely, rectal trauma or bleeding or shared injection equipment are not necessary for HCV transmission among MSM. These results help clarify routes of HCV transmission among MSM and can therefore help guide the design of much-needed behavioral and other interventions to prevent HCV transmission among MSM."
https://openalex.org/W3042832692,"Automatic evaluation of 3D volumes is a topic of importance in order to speed up clinical decision making. We describe a method to classify computed tomography scans on volume level for the presence of non-acute cerebral infarction. This is not a trivial task, as the lesions are often similar to other areas in the brain regarding shape and intensity. A three stage architecture is used for classification: 1) A cranial cavity segmentation network is developed, trained and applied. 2) Region proposals are generated 3) Connected regions are classified using a multi-resolution, densely connected 3D convolutional network. Mean area under curve values for subject level classification are 0.95 for the unstratified test set, 0.88 for stratification by patient age and 0.93 for stratification by CT scanner model. We use a partly segmented dataset of 555 scans of which 186 scans are used in the unstratified test set. Furthermore we examine possible dataset bias for scanner model and patient age parameters. We show a successful application of the proposed three-stage model for full volume classification. In contrast to black-box approaches, the convolutional network's decision can be further assessed by examination of intermediate segmentation results."
https://openalex.org/W3042942812,"In the mammalian gut CD103+ve myeloid DCs are known to suppress inflammation threatened by luminal bacteria, but stimuli driving DC precursor maturation towards this beneficial phenotype are incompletely understood. We isolated CD11+ve DCs from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of healthy mice; CD103+ve DCs were 8–24 fold more likely than CD103-ve DCs to exhibit extensive of prior phagocytosis of apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells. However, CD103+ve and CD103-ve MLN DCs exhibited similar ex vivo capacity to ingest apoptotic cells, indicating that apoptotic cells might drive immature DC maturation towards the CD103+ve phenotype. When cultured with apoptotic cells, myeloid DC precursors isolated from murine bone marrow and characterised as lineage-ve CD103-ve, displayed enhanced expression of CD103 and β8 integrin and acquired increased capacity to induce T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs) after 7d in vitro. However, DC precursors isolated from αv-tie2 mice lacking αv integrins in the myeloid line exhibited reduced binding of apoptotic cells and complete deficiency in the capacity of apoptotic cells and/or latent TGF-β1 to enhance CD103 expression in culture, whereas active TGF-β1 increased DC precursor CD103 expression irrespective of αv expression. Fluorescence microscopy revealed clustering of αv integrin chains and latent TGF-β1 at points of contact between DC precursors and apoptotic cells. We conclude that myeloid DC precursors can deploy αv integrin to orchestrate binding of apoptotic cells, activation of latent TGF-β1 and acquisition of the immunoregulatory CD103+ve β8+ve DC phenotype. This implies that a hitherto unrecognised consequence of apoptotic cell interaction with myeloid phagocytes is programming that prevents inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3042349051,"In this study, we suggested a hypothesis test method that was robust to different genotype encodings in a genome-wide association analysis of continuous traits. When the population stratification is corrected for using a method based on principal component analysis, ordinally (or categorically) encoded genotypes are adjusted and turn into continuous values. Due to the adjustment of the encoded genotype, the association test result using conventional methods, such as the test of Pearson's correlation coefficient, was shown to be dependent on how genotypes were encoded. To overcome this shortcoming, we proposed a non-parametric test based on Kendall's tau. Because Kendall's tau deals with rank, rather than value, associations between adjusted genotype and phenotype values, Kendall's test can be more robust than Pearson's test under different genotype encodings. We assessed the robustness of Kendall's test and compared with that of Pearson's test in terms of the difference in p-values obtained by using different genotype encodings. With simulated as well as real data set, we demonstrated that Kendall's test was more robust than Pearson's test under different genotype encodings. The proposed method can be applicable to the broad topics of interest in population genetics and comparative genomics, in which novel genetic variants are associated with traits. This study may also bring about a cautious approach to the genotype encoding in the numerical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3042658486,"The firm size distribution is highly skewed to the right and often follows a power law. In practice, it is common that firm size and firm age data are aggregated and released as grouped data to avoid disclosure of confidential information. We investigate multiple parametric methods for firm size and firm age modeling based on grouped data, and propose to estimate the joint distribution of firm size and firm age using the Plackett copula. The goodness-of-fit of the estimated marginal distributions are benchmarked with respect to the fit to the whole data and to the upper tails, respectively. The utilization of the proposed methods are demonstrated via an application to the 1977-2014 US firm data. Results show that the generalized lambda distribution has overall better performance in modeling both firm size and firm age data. The exponentiated Weibull distribution also works well in modeling the firm size data. As a by-product, the estimated parameter of the Plackett copula provides a measure of the association between firm size and firm age."
