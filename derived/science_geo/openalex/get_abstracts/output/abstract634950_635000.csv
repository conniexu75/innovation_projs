https://openalex.org/W2952013316,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development and clinical guidelines. However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1-3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4-10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839 non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States-where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13-the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities."

https://openalex.org/W2952738056,"Homeostasis is a recurring theme in biology that ensures that regulated variables robustly—and in some systems, completely—adapt to environmental perturbations. This robust perfect adaptation feature is achieved in natural circuits by using integral control, a negative feedback strategy that performs mathematical integration to achieve structurally robust regulation1,2. Despite its benefits, the synthetic realization of integral feedback in living cells has remained elusive owing to the complexity of the required biological computations. Here we prove mathematically that there is a single fundamental biomolecular controller topology3 that realizes integral feedback and achieves robust perfect adaptation in arbitrary intracellular networks with noisy dynamics. This adaptation property is guaranteed both for the population-average and for the time-average of single cells. On the basis of this concept, we genetically engineer a synthetic integral feedback controller in living cells4 and demonstrate its tunability and adaptation properties. A growth-rate control application in Escherichia coli shows the intrinsic capacity of our integral controller to deliver robustness and highlights its potential use as a versatile controller for regulation of biological variables in uncertain networks. Our results provide conceptual and practical tools in the area of cybergenetics3,5, for engineering synthetic controllers that steer the dynamics of living systems3–9. A synthetic gene circuit implementing an integral feedback topology is shown to achieve robust perfect adaptation in living cells--mathematical analysis proves this topology is necessary for adaptation in networks with noisy dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2951924500,"Activated CD4 T cells proliferate rapidly and remodel epigenetically before exiting the cell cycle and engaging acquired effector functions. Metabolic reprogramming from the naive state is required throughout these phases of activation1. In CD4 T cells, T-cell-receptor ligation—along with co-stimulatory and cytokine signals—induces a glycolytic anabolic program that is required for biomass generation, rapid proliferation and effector function2. CD4 T cell differentiation (proliferation and epigenetic remodelling) and function are orchestrated coordinately by signal transduction and transcriptional remodelling. However, it remains unclear whether these processes are regulated independently of one another by cellular biochemical composition. Here we demonstrate that distinct modes of mitochondrial metabolism support differentiation and effector functions of mouse T helper 1 (TH1) cells by biochemically uncoupling these two processes. We find that the tricarboxylic acid cycle is required for the terminal effector function of TH1 cells through succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), but that the activity of succinate dehydrogenase suppresses TH1 cell proliferation and histone acetylation. By contrast, we show that complex I of the electron transport chain, the malate–aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial citrate export are required to maintain synthesis of aspartate, which is necessary for the proliferation of T helper cells. Furthermore, we find that mitochondrial citrate export and the malate–aspartate shuttle promote histone acetylation, and specifically regulate the expression of genes involved in T cell activation. Combining genetic, pharmacological and metabolomics approaches, we demonstrate that the differentiation and terminal effector functions of T helper cells are biochemically uncoupled. These findings support a model in which the malate–aspartate shuttle, mitochondrial citrate export and complex I supply the substrates needed for proliferation and epigenetic remodelling early during T cell activation, whereas complex II consumes the substrates of these pathways, which antagonizes differentiation and enforces terminal effector function. Our data suggest that transcriptional programming acts together with a parallel biochemical network to enforce cell state. Genetic, pharmacological and metabolomics experiments reveal that the malate–aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial citrate export support the differentiation of mouse T helper 1 cells, whereas succinate dehydrogenase enforces their terminal effector function."
https://openalex.org/W3098847359,"For centuries, the scientific discovery process has been based on systematic human observation and analysis of natural phenomena1. Today, however, automated instrumentation and large-scale data acquisition are generating datasets of such large volume and complexity as to defy conventional scientific methodology. Radically different scientific approaches are needed, and machine learning (ML) shows great promise for research fields such as materials science2–5. Given the success of ML in the analysis of synthetic data representing electronic quantum matter (EQM)6–16, the next challenge is to apply this approach to experimental data—for example, to the arrays of complex electronic-structure images17 obtained from atomic-scale visualization of EQM. Here we report the development and training of a suite of artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to recognize different types of order hidden in such EQM image arrays. These ANNs are used to analyse an archive of experimentally derived EQM image arrays from carrier-doped copper oxide Mott insulators. In these noisy and complex data, the ANNs discover the existence of a lattice-commensurate, four-unit-cell periodic, translational-symmetry-breaking EQM state. Further, the ANNs determine that this state is unidirectional, revealing a coincident nematic EQM state. Strong-coupling theories of electronic liquid crystals18,19 are consistent with these observations. A machine-learning approach is used to train artificial neural networks to analyse experimental scanning tunnelling microscopy image arrays of quantum materials."

https://openalex.org/W2949218973,"New antibiotics are needed to combat rising levels of resistance, with new Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) drugs having the highest priority. However, conventional whole-cell and biochemical antibiotic screens have failed. Here we develop a strategy termed PROSPECT (primary screening of strains to prioritize expanded chemistry and targets), in which we screen compounds against pools of strains depleted of essential bacterial targets. We engineered strains that target 474 essential Mtb genes and screened pools of 100-150 strains against activity-enriched and unbiased compound libraries, probing more than 8.5 million chemical-genetic interactions. Primary screens identified over tenfold more hits than screening wild-type Mtb alone, with chemical-genetic interactions providing immediate, direct target insights. We identified over 40 compounds that target DNA gyrase, the cell wall, tryptophan, folate biosynthesis and RNA polymerase, as well as inhibitors that target EfpA. Chemical optimization yielded EfpA inhibitors with potent wild-type activity, thus demonstrating the ability of PROSPECT to yield inhibitors against targets that would have eluded conventional drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2952464912,"The ability to manipulate the twisting topology of van der Waals structures offers a new degree of freedom through which to tailor their electrical and optical properties. The twist angle strongly affects the electronic states, excitons and phonons of the twisted structures through interlayer coupling, giving rise to exotic optical, electric and spintronic behaviours1–5. In twisted bilayer graphene, at certain twist angles, long-range periodicity associated with moiré patterns introduces flat electronic bands and highly localized electronic states, resulting in Mott insulating behaviour and superconductivity3,4. Theoretical studies suggest that these twist-induced phenomena are common to layered materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus6,7. Twisted van der Waals structures are usually created using a transfer-stacking method, but this method cannot be used for materials with relatively strong interlayer binding. Facile bottom-up growth methods could provide an alternative means to create twisted van der Waals structures. Here we demonstrate that the Eshelby twist, which is associated with a screw dislocation (a chiral topological defect), can drive the formation of such structures on scales ranging from the nanoscale to the mesoscale. In the synthesis, axial screw dislocations are first introduced into nanowires growing along the stacking direction, yielding van der Waals nanostructures with continuous twisting in which the total twist rates are defined by the radii of the nanowires. Further radial growth of those twisted nanowires that are attached to the substrate leads to an increase in elastic energy, as the total twist rate is fixed by the substrate. The stored elastic energy can be reduced by accommodating the fixed twist rate in a series of discrete jumps. This yields mesoscale twisting structures consisting of a helical assembly of nanoplates demarcated by atomically sharp interfaces with a range of twist angles. We further show that the twisting topology can be tailored by controlling the radial size of the structure. Experiments demonstrate a class of van der Waals nanowires, made from layered crystals of the semiconductor germanium sulfide, in which a tunable interlayer twist evolves naturally during synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2950486036,"Soil pH is a key factor that controls soil nutrient availability, soil microbial activities, and crop growth and development. However, studies on the soil pH variations of cultivated lands in different horizons at the regional scale remain limited. In this work, 348 soil samples were collected from three soil horizons (A, B, and C) at 120 sites over the hilly region of Chongqing, southwestern China. Six topographic indicators, four climate parameters, and parent material were considered. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) were applied to investigate the relationships between soil pH and the variables in the A, B, and C horizons. Model performances were evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Results showed that soil pH increased obviously from the A to C horizons. Soil pH was predicted well by the forcing factors with the CART models in all horizons. RMSE, RRMSE, and R2 varied between 0.37 and 0.435, between 5.93 and 7.23%, and between 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. The relative importance of the studied variables to soil pH differed with the horizons. Annual temperature range (ATR), terrain wetness index (TWI), and Melton ruggedness number were critical factors that controlled soil pH variability in the A horizon. Parent material, precipitation of warmest quarter (PWQ), ATR, and TWI were important variables in the B horizon. Parent material, PWQ, ATR, and precipitation were key factors in the C horizon. The results are expected to provide valuable information for designing appropriate measurements for agricultural practices and preventing soil acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2949965776,"Background The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is widely used to assess child and adolescent mental health problems. However, the factor structure of the SDQ is subject to debate and there is limited evidence investigating measurement equivalence invariance (ME/I) between treatment groups, informants, and across time. Method A randomised controlled trial (RCT) recruited 250 participants (6–17 years) who had been referred for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessment. Participants and their clinician either received or did not receive a QbTest report (computer task measuring attention, impulsivity and activity). Parents and teachers completed the SDQ at baseline and 6-months later. This study aimed to understand the factor structure of the SDQ in a clinic referred ADHD sample, and validate the scale as a screening/diagnostic aide and as a measure of treatment outcome both in clinical and research settings. Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (ESEM) was performed to examine the factor structure, and ME/I was assessed between treatment groups, informants, and time points. The criterion validity of the SDQ predictive algorithm for ADHD was compared with clinician and research diagnoses using logistic regression and tests of diagnostic accuracy. Results A 5-factor structure provided the best fit with strong factorial invariance between treatment groups and across time points, but not across informants (parent and teacher ratings). SDQ ratings of ‘probable’ hyperactivity disorder were good predictors of clinical (OR = 10.20, 95%CI 2.18–48.71,p = 0.003) and research diagnoses of ADHD (OR = 6.82, 95%CI 1.95–23.84,p = 0.003), and research diagnoses of Hyperkinetic disorder (OR = 4.02, 95%CI 1.13–14.25,p = 0.031). Further examination of the SDQ hyperactivity ‘probable’ rating showed good specificity (84.5%-74.5%) but poor sensitivity (45.0–42.5%) for ADHD. Conclusion The findings indicate the SDQ is a valid outcome measure for use in RCTs and clinical settings. However, care should be taken when using the SDQ predictive algorithm to screen for ADHD in clinically referred samples."
https://openalex.org/W2950095629,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication that have the potential to improve cardiac function when used in cell-based therapy. However, the means by which cardiomyocytes respond to EVs remains unclear. Here, we sought to clarify the role of exosomes in improving cardiac function by investigating the effect of cardiomyocyte endocytosis of exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells on acute myocardial infarction (MI). Exposing cardiomyocytes to the culture supernatant of adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) prevented cardiomyocyte cell damage under hypoxia in vitro. In vivo, the injection of ADRCs into the heart simultaneous with coronary artery ligation decreased overall cardiac infarct area and prevented cardiac rupture after acute MI. Quantitative RT-PCR–based analysis of the expression of 35 known anti-apoptotic and secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) in ADRCs revealed that ADRCs express several of these miRNAs, among which miR-214 was the most abundant. Of note, miR-214 silencing in ADRCs significantly impaired the anti-apoptotic effects of the ADRC treatment on cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. To examine cardiomyocyte endocytosis of exosomes, we cultured the cardiomyocytes with ADRC-derived exosomes labeled with the fluorescent dye PKH67 and found that hypoxic culture conditions increased the levels of the labeled exosomes in cardiomyocytes. Chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, significantly suppressed the ADRC-induced decrease of hypoxia-damaged cardiomyocytes and also decreased hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte capture of both labeled EVs and extracellular miR-214 secreted from ADRCs. Our results indicate that clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cardiomyocytes plays a critical role in their uptake of circulating, exosome-associated miRNAs that inhibit apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2950233280,"Human-mediated translocation of species to areas beyond their natural distribution (which results in 'alien' populations1) is a key signature of the Anthropocene2, and is a primary global driver of biodiversity loss and environmental change3. Stemming the tide of invasions requires understanding why some species fail to establish alien populations, and others succeed. To achieve this, we need to integrate the effects of features of the introduction site, the species introduced and the specific introduction event. Determining which, if any, location-level factors affect the success of establishment has proven difficult, owing to the multiple spatial, temporal and phylogenetic axes along which environmental variation may influence population survival. Here we apply Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis to a global spatially and temporally explicit database of introduction events of alien birds4 to show that environmental conditions at the introduction location, notably climatic suitability and the presence of other groups of alien species, are the primary determinants of successful establishment. Species-level traits and the size of the founding population (propagule pressure) exert secondary, but important, effects on success. Thus, current trajectories of anthropogenic environmental change will most probably facilitate future incursions by alien species, but predicting future invasions will require the integration of multiple location-, species- and event-level characteristics."

Hyperthermia as a chemo- and radiosensitiser has shown to improve treatment outcomes. This is an analysis of the local control results at six months post-treatment of patients enrolled in an ongoing study investigating the effects of the addition of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) to chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of HIV-positive and -negative cervical cancer patients in a low-resource setting.This ongoing Phase III randomised controlled trial, conducted at a state hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, was registered with the appropriate ethics committee. After signing an informed consent, participants with FIGO stages IIB to IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were randomised to receive chemoradiotherapy with/without mEHT using a secure online random-sampling tool (stratum: HIV status) accounting for age and stage. Reporting physicians were blind to treatment allocation. HIV-positive participants on antiretroviral treatment, or with a CD4 count >200cell/μL were included. mEHT was administered 2/weekly immediately before external beam radiation. The primary end point is local disease control (LDC) and secondary endpoints are toxicity; quality of life analysis; and two year survival. We report on six month LDC, including nodes visualised in the radiation field on 18F-FDG PET/CT (censored for six month survival), and six month local disease free survival (LDFS) (based on intention to treat). Trial status: Recruitment closed (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03332069).271 participants were recruited between January 2014 and November 2017, of which 210 were randomised for trial and 202 were available for analysis at six months post-treatment (mEHT: n = 101; Control: n = 101). Six month LDFS was higher in the mEHT Group (n = 39[38.6%]), than in the Control Group (n = 20[19.8%]); p = 0.003). LDC was also higher in the mEHT Group (n = 40[45.5%]) than the Control Group (n = 20[24.1%]); (p = 0.003).Our results show that mEHT is effective as a chemo-radiosensitiser for cervical cancer, even in high risk a patients and resource-constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W2950252187,"Representation of women in science drops substantially at each career stage, from early student to senior investigator. Disparities in opportunities for women to contribute to research metrics, such as distinguished speaker events and authorship, have been reported in many fields in the U.S.A. and Europe. However, whether female representation in scientific contributions differs in other regions, such as Latin America, is not well understood. In this study, in order to determine whether female authorship is influenced by gender or institutional location of the last (senior) author or by subfield within ecology, we gathered author information from 6849 articles in ten ecological and zoological journals that publish research articles either in or out of Latin America. We found that female authorship has risen marginally since 2002 (27 to 31%), and varies among Latin American countries, but not between Latin America and other regions. Last author gender predicted female co-authorship across all journals and regions, as research groups led by women published with over 60% female co-authors whereas those led by men published with less than 20% female co-authors. Our findings suggest that implicit biases and stereotype threats that women face in male-led laboratories could be sources of female withdrawal and leaky pipelines in ecology and zoology. Accordingly, we encourage every PI to self-evaluate their lifetime percentage of female co-authors. Female role models and cultural shifts-especially by male senior authors-are crucial for female retention and unbiased participation in science."
https://openalex.org/W2949875809,"Human populations in Western Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum were geographically constrained to glacial refugia by the severity of the climate and ecological risk factors. In this research we use an agent-based model of human mobility and interaction, based on ethnographic and archaeological data, to explore the impact of ecological risk on human population structure via a reconstructed landscape of habitat suitability. The agent-based model allows us to evaluate the size and location of glacial refugia, the size of the populations occupying them and the degree of genetic relatedness between people occupying these areas. To do this, we model the probability of an agent foraging groups’ survival as a function of habitat suitability. The model’s simulated “genomes” (composed of regionally specific genetic markers) allow us to track long-term trends of inter-regional interaction and mobility. The results agree with previous archaeological studies situating a large glacial refugium spanning southern France and northeastern Spain, but we expand on those studies by demonstrating that higher rates of population growth in this central refugium led to continuous out-migration and therefore genetic homogeneity across Western Europe, with the possible exception of the Italian peninsula. These results concur with material culture data from known archaeological sites dating to the Last Glacial Maximum and make predictions for future ancient DNA studies."
https://openalex.org/W2949389678,"Risk assessment regarding the distribution of malaria vectors and environmental variables underpinning their distribution under changing climates is crucial towards malaria control and eradication. On this basis, we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) Model to estimate the potential future distribution of major transmitters of malaria in Nigeria—Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and its siblings: Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and Anopheles arabiensis under low and high emissions scenarios. In the model, we used mosquito occurrence data sampled from 1900 to 2010 alongside land use and terrain variables, and bioclimatic variables for baseline climate 1960–1990 and future climates of 2050s (2041–2060) and 2070s (2061–2080) that follow RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The Anopheles gambiae species are projected to experience large shift in potential range and population with increased distribution density, higher under high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and 2070s than low emission scenario (RCP2.6) and 2050s. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles arabiensis are projected to have highest invasion with 47–70% and 10–14% percentage increase, respectively in Sahel and Sudan savannas within northern states in 2041–2080 under RCP8.5. Highest prevalence is predicted for Humid forest and Derived savanna in southern and North Central states in 2041–2080; 91–96% and 97–99% for Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and 67–71% and 72–75% for Anopheles arabiensis under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The higher magnitude of change in species prevalence predicted for the later part of the 21st century under high emission scenario, driven mainly by increasing and fluctuating temperature, alongside longer seasonal tropical rainfall accompanied by drier phases and inherent influence of rapid land use change, may lead to more significant increase in malaria burden when compared with other periods and scenarios during the century; especially in Humid forest, Derived savanna, Sahel and Sudan savannas."
https://openalex.org/W2950354742,"Large-scale genome sequencing is poised to provide a substantial increase in the rate of discovery of disease-associated mutations, but the functional interpretation of such mutations remains challenging. Here we show that deletions of a sequence on human chromosome 16 that we term the intestine-critical region (ICR) cause intractable congenital diarrhoea in infants1,2. Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2953173775,"Purpose Vitreous vitamin C, as an anti-oxidant, is responsible for regulating oxygen tension and oxidative stress in the eye. Oxidative stress and retinal ischemia are implicated in the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In this study, we aimed to determine whether vitreous level of vitamin C is compromised in patients with PDR and to investigate the association of diabetic macular ischemia and vitamin C. Methods This prospective study enrolled forty patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of PDR (PDR group, n = 20) and idiopathic epiretinal membrane (control group, n = 20). Serum, aqueous humor, and the vitreous were collected for the analysis of vitamin C level by HPLC. Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) in PDR group was evaluated with fluorescein angiography (FA). Results PDR patients (60.4 ± 2.1 y) were younger than non-diabetic control patients (67.4 ± 1.2 y). Serum, aqueous, and vitreous levels of vitamin C in PDR were 38.7%, 22.5%, and 11.1% of non-diabetic control group, respectively. All PDR patients had DMI (grade 1: 25%, grade 2: 30%, grade 3: 30%, grade 4: 15%). DMI grade was inversely correlated with the level of vitreous vitamin C (r = -0.546, P = 0.019), not with HbA1C, serum, or aqueous vitamin C level. In addition, the level of vitreous vitamin C (4.5 ± 2.6 μg/ml) in high DMI group (Gr 3 &4) was lower than that (31.0 ± 9.1 μg/ml) in low DMI group (Gr 1&2) (P = 0.015). Conclusions Vitreous level of vitamin C in PDR patients showed a tenfold decrease, which was associated with the degree of macular ischemia. This suggests that vitreous vitamin C depletion may cause macula ischemia in PDR patients."

The rationale is that by lowering barriers to entry more manufacturers will be enticed to enter the market, while the capacity at the national medicines regulatory authorities is strengthened. The African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization Initiative, agreed in 2009, is developing regional platforms with harmonized regulatory procedures for the registration of medicines. The first region to implement medicines regulatory harmonization was the East African Community (EAC). The harmonization was based on the existing EAC Free Trade Agreement, which officially launched the free movement of goods and services in 2010.In this study we conducted semi-structured interviews and performed document reviews. The main target group for our interviews was pharmaceutical companies. We interviewed 18 companies, including 64% of the total companies who had experienced the EAC joint product assessment procedure, and two EAC-based national medicines regulatory authorities. We found that generally pharmaceutical companies are supportive of the African-based MRH efforts and appreciative of the progress being achieved. However, many companies are now hesitant to use the joint product assessment procedure until efficiency improvements are made. Common frustrations were the length of time to receive the actual marketing authorization; unexpectedly higher quality standards than national procedures; and challenges in getting all EAC countries to recognize EAC approvals. Smaller, less attractive markets have not yet become more attractive from a corporate perspective, and there is no free trade of pharmaceuticals in the EAC region.Pharmaceutical companies agree that medicines regulatory harmonization is the way forward. However, regulatory medicines harmonization must actually result in quicker access to the harmonized markets for quality-assured medicines. At this time, improvements are required to the current EAC processes to meet the vision of harmonization."

This sensor protein enabled us to monitor the redox change of chloroplast thioredoxin in vivo, and we therefore designated this protein “change in redox state of Trx” (CROST). Using CP12 isoforms, we successfully prepared two types of CROST sensors that displayed different affinities for two major chloroplast Trx isoforms (f-type and m-type).

Therefore, detection of Trx activity in vivo is important for understanding the states of the redox regulation system and various Trx-regulated enzymes in chloroplasts such as ATP synthase (2Mills J.D.

Genome sequencing of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that 10 Trx isoforms, classified into five subtypes (f, m, x, y, and z), are localized in chloroplasts. These five subtypes of Trx exhibit different target selectivities and form a complicate redox network, although these Trx isoforms maintain a common structural motif named Trx-fold (7Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. Crystal structure of thioredoxin from Escherichia coli at 1.68 A resolution.J. Mol.

The target selectivity of Trx isoforms might be determined by their different molecular characteristics, such as the surface charges of the protein molecule (8Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C.

Thioredoxin selectivity for thiol-based redox regulation of target proteins in chloroplasts.J. Biol.

However, the details of the target discrimination mechanism of Trx are unclear (10Yoshida K. Hisabori T. Determining the rate-limiting step for light-responsive redox regulation in chloroplasts.Antioxidants. 2018; 7 (30384474): E153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that some proteins possessing Trx-like motifs also function in the redox network in chloroplasts. For example, NADPH-Trx reductase C (NTRC), which has both NTR and Trx domains in one molecule, can reduce several Trx target proteins, such as 2-Cys proxiredoxin (2-CysPrx), peroxiredoxin Q, and the Mg-chelatase I subunit, using reducing power provided by NADPH (11Yoshida K. Hisabori T. Two distinct redox cascades cooperatively regulate chloroplast functions and sustain plant viability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, we recently reported the physiological significance of TrxL2, which has a WCRKC sequence in its active center motif, in the chloroplast redox network. TrxL2 has a higher midpoint redox potential than Trx, and it can oxidize Trx target proteins using oxidation power derived from 2-CysPrx and reactive oxygen species (12Yoshida K. Hara A. Sugiura K. Fukaya Y. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin-like2/2-Cys peroxiredoxin redox cascade supports oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We then clarified that the TrxL2–2-CysPrx pathway is the oxidation pathway for redox-regulated enzymes in chloroplasts in the dark. This important finding reminded us of the significance of the reduction/oxidation balance of the whole redox network in chloroplasts as a metabolism-regulatory system for adapting to fluctuating environmental conditions. To date, Trx activities in vivo have been assessed by visualizing the redox states of target proteins using SDS-PAGE mobility shift analysis following chemical modification of free thiol groups (13Kobayashi T.

However, this method requires disruption of the desired cells or organelles. To monitor the in vivo redox state, roGFP, the most well-known redox sensor protein, was developed by introducing two cysteine residues at positions Ser147 and Gln204 in the WT GFP or the GFP S65T mutant, and these Cys residues act as switches to detect the redox state as a redox-dependent change in fluorescence (16Hanson G.T. Aggeler R. Oglesbee D. Cannon M. Capaldi R.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Investigating mitochondrial redox potential with redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein indicators.J. Biol.

However, roGFP cannot react directly with Trx or small redox molecules such as GSH and hydrogen peroxide. Instead, roGFP was reduced and oxidized by glutaredoxin (Grx), a Trx superfamily protein containing the CPYC motif in its active center (17Meyer A.J. Brach T. Marty L. Kreye S. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. Hell R. Redox-sensitive GFP in Arabidopsis thaliana is a quantitative biosensor for the redox potential of the cellular glutathione redox buffer.Plant J. 2007; 52 (17892447): 973-98610.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03280.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although several redox sensor proteins, such as Oba-Q (18Sugiura K. Nagai T. Nakano M. Ichinose H. Nakabayashi T. Ohta N. Hisabori T.

For this purpose, TrxRFP was recently developed as a genetically encoded sensor by fusing rxRFP and human Trx1 (22Fan Y. Makar M. Wang M.X. Ai H.W. Monitoring thioredoxin redox with a genetically encoded red fluorescent biosensor.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28671680): 1045-105210.1038/nchembio.2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This Trx1 was reduced by human Trx reductase and oxidized by human Trx peroxidases in a similar manner as native Trx1. In this system, the redox states of rxRFP and Trx1 in the fused TrxRFP molecule are in equilibrium, and the redox state of Trx1 can be observed by measuring the change in the fluorescence intensity of rxRFP. However, TrxRFP overexpression in cells might affect the intracellular redox states because TrxRFP functions similarly as Trx in vivo. In addition, the signal obtained from TrxRFP illustrates the redox status of Trx1 in the fused molecule but not that of other endogenous Trx molecules. Therefore, it is difficult to directly apply TrxRFP to the observation of Trx molecules in photosynthetic organisms. In this study, we report newly designed sensor probes to detect the redox changes of Trx by combining CFP, YFP, and a partial sequence of CP12 (Fig. 1A). CP12 is a Trx target protein conserved among photosynthetic organisms that forms a supercomplex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoribulokinase and suppresses their activities in the dark or under limited light or stress conditions (23Wedel N. Soll J. Paap B.K. CP12 provides a new mode of light regulation of Calvin cycle activity in higher plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94 (9294236): 10479-1048410.1073/pnas.94.19.10479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CP12 in chloroplasts has two cysteine pairs that can form disulfide bonds at the N- and C-terminal sides. Trx-f can reduce these disulfide bonds and induce a conformational change of CP12 (24Marri L. Zaffagnini M. Collin V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Lemaire S.D. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Trost P. Prompt and easy activation by specific thioredoxins of Calvin cycle enzymes of Arabidopsis thaliana associated in the GAPDH/CP12/PRK supramolecular complex.Mol. Plant. 2009; 2 (19825612): 259-26910.1093/mp/ssn061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We therefore applied the partial sequence of CP12 to our Trx sensor. We then fused the N-terminal domain of CP12 with mTurquoise (CFP) and cp173-mVenus (YFP). When the fused protein interacted with the reduced form of Trx, the protein exhibited a remarkable change in fluorescence based on FRET. In addition, we succeeded in conferring Trx specificity to the sensor protein using CP12 from a different origin. CP12 of A. thaliana (CP12-2) has two pairs of cysteines (Cys75-Cys84 and Cys117-Cys126) that form disulfide bonds under oxidizing conditions, and this protein is considered the target of Trx-f in vivo (24Marri L. Zaffagnini M. Collin V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Lemaire S.D. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Trost P. Prompt and easy activation by specific thioredoxins of Calvin cycle enzymes of Arabidopsis thaliana associated in the GAPDH/CP12/PRK supramolecular complex.Mol. Plant. 2009; 2 (19825612): 259-26910.1093/mp/ssn061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the molecular structure of CP12 was unsolved, a large conformational change of the molecule caused by changes of the redox status of these cysteine pairs was expected. We therefore applied the partial sequence of the N-terminal domain of CP12-2 from Gly58 to Ala101, including the Cys75-Cys84 pair, which was designated as AtCP12_Nd, to prepare the sensor protein (Fig. 1B, red). As a donor protein for FRET, mTurquoiseΔ11, a variant of CFP lacking the C-terminal 11 amino acids, was adopted, and cp173-mVenus, a circular permutation mutant of YFP having the amino acid at number 173 as its N terminus, was used as the acceptor protein (Fig. 1A). These two GFP derivatives were connected by AtCP12_Nd, and the redox changes of cysteines in the CP12 region were then confirmed using the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE following the labeling of free thiols on the proteins with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (13Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Respiratory chain is required to maintain oxidized states of the DsbA-DsbB disulfide bond formation system in aerobically growing Escherichia coli cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This new probe nicely displayed high FRET efficiency in the oxidized form, and a remarkable decrease of the signal was noted for the reduced form (Fig. 1D). We then designated this sensor protein change in redox state of thioredoxin 1 (CROST1). Next we prepared another sensor protein using CP12 from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120, as the major Trx in cyanobacteria is Trx-m, and they do not possess Trx-f. A part of CP12 from Anabaena, Lys7-Gln51 (Fig. 1B, red), was fused to mTurquoiseΔ11 at the N terminus and cp173-mVenus at the C terminus. This protein also exhibited a change in fluorescence caused by the redox change of the CP12 molecule (Fig. 1D), and it was designated CROST2. We digitalized the FRET signal changes of the sensor proteins by calculating the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 530 and 480 nm (Fig. 2). Initially, reduction of the oxidized form of CROST1 was examined in the presence of various reductants. When Trx-f1 from A. thaliana was applied together with 100 μm of the reduced form of DTT (DTTred) at time 0, the signal rapidly decreased from 4.1 to 1.5 (Fig. 2A, left panel, closed circles), indicating that the full reduction of CROST1 occurs within 20 s. By contrast, CROST1 was not reduced when the reduced form Trx-m2 from A. thaliana was applied (Fig. 2A, left panel, open circles). In addition, CROST1 was hardly reduced by 100 μm DTTred (Fig. 2A, closed squares), glutaredoxin C5 (GrxC5) from A. thaliana and 2 mm GSH (Fig. 2A, open squares) or by NTRC and 100 μm NADPH (Fig. 2A, closed reverse triangles). These results clearly indicate that CROST1 is a specific sensor for efficiently detecting the redox status of Trx-f. Similarly, reduction of CROST2 was not observed when DTTred, GrxC5 or NTRC was used as a reductant (Fig. 2A, right panel). However, CROST2 was reduced by Trx-m2 in addition to Trx-f1. This result suggests that CROST2 is a redox sensor that has a lower specificity to Trx isoforms. (Fig. 2A, right panel). Because we recently revealed a new protein functioning in the chloroplast redox network that inactivates thiol-regulated enzymes in the dark via oxidation (12Yoshida K. Hara A. Sugiura K. Fukaya Y. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin-like2/2-Cys peroxiredoxin redox cascade supports oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oxidation of the reduced form CROST1 was observed when the protein was incubated with Trx-f1 and the oxidized form of DTT (DTTox), whereas the newly assigned chloroplast oxidation factors (TrxL2 proteins) oxidized CROST1 much slower than Trx-f1 (Fig. 2B, left panel). DTTox, GrxC5 plus GSSG, or 2-CysPrx together with H2O2 did not oxidize CROST1. In contrast, CROST2 was efficiently oxidized by TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 (12Yoshida K. Hara A. Sugiura K. Fukaya Y. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin-like2/2-Cys peroxiredoxin redox cascade supports oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These results indicate that CROST proteins can reflect changes in the redox states of Trx-f or Trx-m in the solution to their FRET signals, whereas the chemical redox molecules do not affect the redox status of CROST proteins. The Trx isoform specificities of CROST sensors were then examined using nine Trx isoforms derived from A. thaliana, Physcomitrella patens, and Anabaena sp. PCC7120 (A. 7120). Because the reaction rate of CROST1 with AtTrx-f1 was sufficiently fast, as shown in Fig. 2A, a Trx isoform concentration of 30 nm was used together with 100 μm DTTred in this study. Among the Trx isoforms examined, AtTrx-f1 and PpTrx-f could efficiently reduce CROST1 (Fig. 3A, left), and the rate constants were obtained (Fig. 4A). We then examined the Trx isoform specificity of CROST1 in the oxidation process. When 0.1 μm CROST1 was incubated with 1 μm Trx isoforms together with 50 mm DTTox, slow oxidation was observed. Again, AtTrx-f1 and PpTrx-f could oxidize CROST1 under these conditions (Figs. 3B, left panel, and 4B). Although slow reduction and oxidation of CROST1 were observed when AnTrx-m1 was used (Fig. 3, A and B, left), the rate constants were much smaller than those of f-type isoforms (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that CROST1 is an f-type Trx-specific sensor that is reduced or oxidized via the redox equilibrium with f-type Trx.Figure 4Rate constants of CROST reduction and oxidation. A and B, reaction rate constants for CROST1 were determined via fitting with the first-order equation (see “Experimental procedures”) of the reduction process data shown in Fig. 3A, left (A), and the oxidation process data shown in Fig. 3B, left (B). C and D, reaction rate constants for CROST2 were determined via fitting with the first-order equation (see “Experimental procedures”) of the reduction process data shown in Fig. 3A, right (C), and the oxidation process data shown in Fig. 3B, right (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the specificity of CROST2, 500 nm Trx isoforms were used because the apparent reduction rates of CROST2 were much slower than those of CROST1 (Fig. 2). Based on the rate constants calculated from the reduction time course data (Fig. 3A, right), CROST2 could detect changes in the redox states of AtTrx-f, PpTrx-f, AtTrx-m2, PpTrx-m, and AnTrx-m1 (Fig. 4C). When the oxidation process was examined, AnTrx-m1 was more effective than AtTrx-f1 (Figs. 3B, right, and 4D), and this must be attributable to the use of A. 7120–origin CP12 to prepare CROST2. Hence, CROST2 must be applicable to indicate the redox states of m-type Trx in cells lacking f-type Trx, such as cyanobacteria. Although there was a large difference in the reduction rate constants of CROST1 (0.40 s−1 μm−1) and CROST2 (0.068 s−1 μm−1) using AtTrx-f1, the reduction rate constant of CROST2 for AtTrx-f1 was equivalent to that of chloroplast F1-ATPase for spinach-derived Trx-f (0.057 s−1 μm−1) (25Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. Kinetics and thioredoxin specificity of thiol modulation of the chloroplast H+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (9202002): 16924-1692710.1074/jbc.272.27.16924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, CROST2 must have a certain reactivity with Trx even under physiological conditions. The rate constant of the reduction process of CROST1 for AtTrx-f1 was 21-fold larger than that for the oxidized process (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the oxidation of AtCP12-2 used by Trx-f1 to reduce CROST1 does not occur efficiently in vivo. Conversely, the rate constant of the reduction process of CROST2 for AnTrx-m1 was only 4.2-fold larger than that for the oxidation process (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that the N-terminal domain of AnCP12 used for CROST2 must be easily oxidized by AnTrx-m1 in A. 7120 cells. We then measured the midpoint redox potentials of CROST1 and CROST2 to reveal the cause of the difference of reduction rate constants of AtTrx-f1. Consequently, a midpoint redox potential of −266 mV was obtained for CROST1 at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5A, left). This value was considerably larger than that of AtTrx-f1 (−321 mV) (9Yoshida K. Hara S. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin selectivity for thiol-based redox regulation of target proteins in chloroplasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (26254269): 1954010.1074/jbc.A115.647545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and similar to that of TrxL2.1 (−258 mV) (12Yoshida K. Hara A. Sugiura K. Fukaya Y. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin-like2/2-Cys peroxiredoxin redox cascade supports oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (30104347): E8296-E830410.1073/pnas.1808284115Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, CROST2 displayed a more negative midpoint redox potential of −296 mV (Fig. 5A). Because the rate of electron transfer between two redox proteins is influenced by the difference of their midpoint redox potentials, the observed difference at ∼30 mV between CROST1 and CROST2 must be sufficient to explain the difference of the reduction rate constants observed in Fig. 4. The lower midpoint redox potential of CROST2 may explain the difficulty of various Trx isoforms in reducing this protein. The disadvantages of CROST sensor proteins are their remarkable pH dependences and small fluorescent signal changes under low pH conditions (Fig. 5B). The observed pH dependencies may be attributable to the pH dependence of the YFP chromophore. Under low-pH conditions, the YFP chromophore of cp173-mVenus is not ionized, and, therefore, it cannot function as a FRET acceptor. However, CROST sensors fortunately had large dynamic ranges at a pH of ∼7–8 (Fig. 5B), which is equivalent to the pH in various organelles, and the F530/F480 values under the oxidized conditions were more than double compared with those under the reduced condition. These sensors should therefore be useful for monitoring the intracellular redox states of Trx molecules. To observe the redox status of Trx in living cells, we expressed CROST1 and CROST2 in A. thaliana chloroplasts and observed the fluorescence of the sensor proteins using an LSM780 confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) (Fig. 6A). Because of the unexpected appearance of bright spots, which were obviously differentiated from the fluorescence signals from the cytosol or chloroplasts and might be ascribed to the aggregation of sensor proteins (Fig. 6A, arrowheads), we calculated the fluorescence intensities in the image by removing these bright spots. In addition, we confirmed the expression of CROST proteins in leaves by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6B). Degradation of a small part of CROST sensors was observed. The emerged degraded fluorescent proteins may affect the fluorescence intensity ratios of YFP (518–544 nm) and CFP (465–491 nm) channels (FYFP/FCFP) in measurements, especially when free CFP appeared in cells. The autofluorescence of chlorophyll is also a possible disturbance factor for the in situ measurement. Fluorescence spectra from A. thaliana cells expressing CROST sensors were acquired using the λ mode, and we confirmed that the effects of degradation of the sensors and the autofluorescence of chlorophyll in chloroplasts was weak enough and did not influence the fluorescence signals of CROST sensors (Fig. 6C). Leaves of WT plants were used as a control. By changing the light intensity, we could observe a slight decrease in signal intensity at 530 nm and an increase in the second peak at 480 nm (Fig. 6C). FYFP/FCFP ratios were then calculated from these spectra (Fig. 6D). As controls, FYFP/FCFP ratios were determined in the presence of 20 mm DTTred or 20 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). Finally, we observed the change in FYFP/FCFP during the mutual light/dark changes using CROST1 (Fig. 6E, top, closed circles) and CROST2 (Fig. 6E, bottom, closed circles) introduced into the chloroplasts of A. thaliana. When the plant leaves were illuminated, both CROST sensors immediately shifted to the reduced state, implying that Trx proteins in chloroplasts, mainly Trx-f, were reduced. When the light source was removed, FYFP/FCFP gradually increased, indicating that Trx-f was slowly oxidized in chloroplasts. The signal decay of CROST1 was obviously slower than that of CROST2. This difference might be ascribed to the difference of the midpoint redox potentials of these two sensors. CROST1 had a higher redox potential than CROST2 (Fig. 5A). In addition, the reactivity of CROST2 was not restricted to f-type Trx, but it was sufficient against Trx proteins and TrxL2. This property might explain the rapid oxidation of CROST2 even under the light/dark transition (Figure 2, Figure 3). In contrast, we could not detect any changes in FYFP/FCFP when 20 μm DCMU was applied (Fig. 6E, open circles). Thus, we succeeded in observing the real-time redox dynamics of Trx molecules in chloroplasts caused by photosynthetic electron transport according to the light/dark transition. The complementary DNAs of mTurquoiseΔ11, cp173m-Venus, the N-terminal domains of AtCP12-2 (At3g56690) and AnCP12 (pfam02672) were amplified by PCR and fused using hot fusion methods (26Fu C.

BL21(DE3) pLysS was used to express A. thaliana-derived Trx, and BL21(DE3) was used for P. patens-derived Trx and CROST sensors. Transformed E. coli was then cultured at 37 °C. Expression of the desired protein was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by further cultivation for 16 h at 21 °C. Collected cells were disrupted and ultracentrifuged (125,000 × g for 40 min) to obtain supernatant containing the desired protein for subsequent purification. His-tagged A. thaliana–derived Trxs and P. patens–derived Trx and CROST sensors were purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA–agarose (Qiagen) resin. Ni-NTA–agarose resin was washed in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted using the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Elusions including A. thaliana–derived Trxs were applied to Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) columns and purified. Eluates including P. patens–derived Trx were dialyzed and concentrated. Eluates containing CROST sensors were applied to a Toyopearl Butyl-650 (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) column and eluted using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with an ammonium sulfate reverse gradient from 30% to 0%. Peak fractions eluted from the column were collected. Eluates containing CROST sensors were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm diamide for 10 min at 25 °C, dialyzed, and concentrated.

Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using an FP-8500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). An excitation wavelength of 430 nm was used to excite CROST sensors. Emission fluorescence intensities from CROST sensors at 480 (F480) and 530 nm (F530) were measured, and the fluorescence ratio (Fr) was calculated using Equation 1: Fr=F530/F480(Eq. 1) To establish fully reduced or oxidized conditions, CROST sensors were incubated with 100 μm DTTred or 50 mm DTTox in the presence of 1 μm AtTrx-f1 for 10 min at 25 °C, and Fr values were obtained as Fred and Fox. The oxidation ratio, Ox/total, was then calculated using Equation 2: Ox/total=(Fr−Fred)/(Fox−Fred)(Eq. 2) To eliminate the influence of direct reduction by DTT, we calculated the rate constant from Ox/total data in the presence of Trx isoforms after subtracting Ox/total data in the presence of only DTT at each time. Then the resulting Ox/total value at the indicated time was plotted and fitted using Equation 3 to determine the rate constant kred and Equation 4 to determine kox: Ox/total=exp−(−kred[Trx]t)(Eq. 3) Ox/total=1−exp−(−kox[Trx]t)(Eq. 4) [Trx] is the concentration of Trx. CROST sensor proteins (0.1 μm) were incubated in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm DTTox, various concentrations of DTTred (1 μm to 50 mm), and 1 μm AtTrx-f1 for 3 h at 25 °C. The midpoint redox potential values of CROST sensors were calculated by fitting the titration data of the reduction level of proteins to the Nernst equation. A value of −357 mV was used as a midpoint redox potential of DTT at pH 7.5 (9Yoshida K. Hara S. Hisabori T.

The expression plasmids pRI201/PtCROST1 and pRI201/PtCROST2 were prepared by appending the recA DNA recombination family protein leader sequence to the 5′ end of the CROST1 and CROST2 coding genes cloned in the expression vector pRI201-AN (Takara). The A. thaliana plants were transformed with the expression plasmids using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and then grown at 22 °C under 16 h light/8 h dark conditions. For the observation, AxioObserverZ1 with LSM780 (Carl Zeiss) was used with an Ar 458-nm laser (25 milliwatt). The laser power was held at less than 0.1% to avoid activating the photosystem. A multi-channel GaAsP detector was used in the photon-counting and λ modes. The intensity of the fluorescence image was then digitalized using ImageJ image analysis software. K. S. and T.

https://openalex.org/W2949655962,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit-like protein 3B (APOBEC3B or A3B), as other APOBEC3 members, is a single-stranded (ss)DNA cytosine deaminase with antiviral activity. A3B is also overexpressed in multiple tumor types, such as carcinomas of the bladder, cervix, lung, head/neck, and breast. A3B generates both dispersed and clustered C-to-T and C-to-G mutations in intrinsically preferred trinucleotide motifs (TCA/TCG/TCT). A3B-catalyzed mutations are likely to promote tumor evolution and cancer progression and, as such, are associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, little is known about cellular processes that regulate A3B. Here, we used a proteomics approach involving affinity purification coupled to MS with human 293T cells to identify cellular proteins that interact with A3B. This approach revealed a specific interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). We validated and mapped this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Functional studies and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments in multiple cell lines revealed that A3B is not a substrate for CDK4–Cyclin D1 phosphorylation nor is its deaminase activity modulated. Instead, we found that A3B is capable of disrupting the CDK4-dependent nuclear import of Cyclin D1. We propose that this interaction may favor a more potent antiviral response and simultaneously facilitate cancer mutagenesis.

Although the mechanism of nuclear import has yet to be fully elucidated, the identification of A3B-interacting factors may shed light in this process. The cell cycle is comprised of a complex set of interacting proteins that tightly regulate progression through each phase.

Cells must progress through four phases of the cell cycle to divide and replicate: G1, S phase (DNA synthesis), G2, and M phase (mitosis).

Our studies here began with the goal of identifying direct protein–protein interactors that post-translationally regulate A3B. We used affinity purification coupled to MS (AP-MS) to identify CDK4 as a high-confidence A3B interactor. AP-MS results were validated by showing that A3B interacts directly with CDK4 but not with the closely related family members CDK2 or CDK6. Additionally, we use structure-guided mutagenesis to define the regions of both A3B and CDK4 required for interaction. We could also engraft key residues from CDK4 into CDK2 and endow it with the ability to interact with A3B. Finally, we demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous expression of A3B could disrupt CDK4-dependent import of Cyclin D1, thereby providing a novel post-translational function for A3B. To identify direct cellular regulators of A3B, we utilized AP-MS to identify A3B-interacting proteins. We expressed an A3B-2×Strep-3×Flag-tagged (hereafter referred to as A3B-SF) construct in 293T cells followed by affinity purification via anti-Strep resin and stringent high salt washes to enrich for tightly bound proteins. Immunoblot analysis, Coomassie gels, and activity assays using ssDNA oligonucleotide substrates were used to validate the presence, enrichment, and activity of affinity-purified A3B (schematic in Fig. 1A and data not shown). As controls, eGFP-SF, A3A-SF, and A3G-SF constructs were expressed in 293T cells and affinity purified in parallel. Co-immunoprecipitated samples were digested with trypsin and subjected to analysis by MS (Fig. 1A). To our surprise, we identified CDK4 as a putative A3B-interacting protein based on the recovery of multiple unique peptides across six independent AP-MS experiments (cumulatively spanning 24.7% of CDK4 amino acid sequence; Fig. 1, B and C). Additionally, CDK4 was not identified in the eGFP-SF, A3A-SF, or A3G-SF control experiments. Interestingly, even though CDK4 shares high homology with closely related family members (70% identity with CDK6 and 42% with CDK2), it was the only CDK and the only cell-cycle protein identified in our AP-MS datasets. Furthermore, Cyclin D1, the canonical binding partner of CDK4, was not present in any of the A3B-SF AP-MS datasets. To validate our AP-MS results implicating an A3B–CDK4 interaction, we performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) of eGFP-SF and A3B-SF in 293T cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that endogenous CDK4 could IP with A3B-SF but not with eGFP-SF (Fig. 2A). A similar approach was taken to IP endogenous A3B; however, despite multiple attempts in various cell lines using several commercial and custom in-house antibodies, immunoprecipitation of endogenous A3B was unsuccessful due to an overt failure to bind A3B, cross-reactivity to related APOBEC3s, and/or inferred low affinity (i.e. all were non-IP grade reagents; data not shown). To overcome these technical limitations, we further verified the interaction in co-IP experiments using two different sets of epitope-tagged A3B and CDK4 constructs. We expressed either Strep- or Flag-tagged A3B and CDK4 constructs in 293T cells and performed co-IPs probing for A3B first, CDK4s, and vice versa. Immunoblot analysis of both Strep and Flag co-IPs revealed that, regardless of resin or epitope tag, these two proteins reproducibly immunoprecipitated CDK4 (Fig. 2B). Although our AP-MS approach was performed in the presence of both DNA and RNA nucleases, we sought to determine whether the A3B–CDK4 interaction could occur in a heterologous system, which would indicate a direct protein–protein interaction. Utilizing a His-tagged full-length A3B catalytically dead construct (A3BE255A) expressed in Escherichia coli, we were able to successfully purify co-expressed CDK4 (Fig. 2C). These results showed that no other human protein or specific RNA/DNA intermediate is required for the A3B–CDK4 interaction, such as the canonical CDK4 binding partner Cyclin D1. Although CDK4 was not identified in our A3A or A3G AP-MS data sets, sequence homology between A3B and these APOBEC3 family members is high (89% homology between A3A and A3B C-terminal domain and 57% homology between A3G and A3B). Therefore, we sought to reconfirm our AP-MS results by directly examining the ability of A3A and A3G to interact with CDK4. As shown in Fig. 2D, A3B is the only deaminase able to co-IP CDK4. A3B is comprised of two deaminase domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD is catalytically active and responsible for deaminating cytosines in ssDNA. The NTD is catalytically inactive and implicated in protein oligomerization and mediating interactions with nucleic acids (53Feng Y.Q. Baig T.T. Love R.P. Chelico L.

To begin to determine the binding interface for CDK4, we performed comparative co-IPs with full-length Strep-tagged A3B (A3BFL), A3BNTD, and A3BCTD constructs. These experiments revealed that CDK4 could IP with A3BFL and A3BNTD, but not with A3BCTD (Fig. 2D). To address whether this interaction was occurring endogenously within a cell, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed using A3B, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 antibodies to visualize these interactions in MCF10A cells treated with 25 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce A3B expression. Notably, A3B and CDK4 showed PLA foci in the nuclear compartment, whereas CDK4 and Cyclin D1 PLA foci were cell-wide (Fig. 2E). In further support of our proteomics results, A3B and Cyclin D1 did not form PLA foci. Interestingly, we noticed that A3BFL and A3BNTD displayed altered mobilities in co-IP experiments with overexpressed CDK4 (seen throughout Fig. 2, A–D). It is well-known that altered mobility of protein species in SDS-PAGE can be attributed to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (55Lee C.R. Park Y.H. Min H. Kim Y.R. Seok Y.J.

Furthermore, using human neutrophils and endothelial cell monolayers, we demonstrate that sevuparin inhibits hkGAS-induced endothelial barrier disruption by neutralizing the activity of neutrophil-derived proteins. By mass spectrometry of neutrophil secretion, we identify proteins, including serprocidins, S100 proteins, and histone H4, that interact with sevuparin and that are responsible for the disruptive effect on endothelial integrity.

Yet, research that investigates the causal role of the left versus right DLPFC during the processes of emotion appraisal is lacking. In the current study, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used to disentangle the functional lateralization of the DLPFC on emotional processing in response to the anticipation of, and subsequent confrontation with emotional stimuli in healthy volunteers. Methods Forty-eight subjects received both active and sham (on separate days) anodal tDCS over either the left (N = 24) or right (N = 24) DLPFC. Subjects’ pupil dilation (PD, a physiological marker of cognitive resource allocation) was recorded while performing an appraisal task in which negative and positive emotion eliciting images were presented, each preceded by an informative cue indicating the valence of the upcoming stimulus. Results As compared to sham stimulation, left DLPFC anodal tDCS resulted in increased PD when confronted with negative emotional images, whereas right DLPFC anodal tDCS resulted in decreased PD when confronted with emotional images, irrespective of valence. Limitations The interpretation of pupil dilation in response to emotional stimuli is limited. Conclusion These findings suggest inverse lateralized DLPFC effects on cognitive resource allocation (as measured by pupillary responses) when confronted with emotional stimuli. The current findings may shed some light on mechanisms that explain the antidepressant effects of non-invasive brain stimulation of the left DLPFC."

Herein, we show that p73-deficient mice exhibit delayed wound healing despite morphologically normal-appearing skin. The delay in wound healing is accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased levels of biomarkers of the DNA damage response in basal keratinocytes at the epidermal wound edge. In wild-type mice, this same cell population exhibited increased p73 expression after wounding. Analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data, we found that p73 was expressed by epidermal and hair follicle stem cells, cell types required for wound healing. Moreover, we discovered that p73 isoforms expressed in the skin (ΔNp73) enhance p63-mediated expression of keratinocyte genes during cellular reprogramming from a mesenchymal to basal keratinocyte-like cell. We identified a set of 44 genes directly or indirectly regulated by ΔNp73 that are involved in skin development, cell junctions, cornification, proliferation, and wound healing. Our results establish a role for p73 in cutaneous wound healing through regulation of basal keratinocyte function."

We recently showed that, in mice, repair of this adduct 2 h following injection is controlled by two circadian programs. 1) The circadian clock controls transcription of 2000 genes in liver and, via transcription-directed repair, controls repair of the transcribed strand (TS) of these genes in a rhythmic fashion unique to each gene’s phase of transcription. 2) The excision repair activity itself is controlled by the circadian clock with a single phase at which the repair of the nontranscribed strand (NTS) and the rest of the genome takes place.

https://openalex.org/W2905071552,"Self-management is a concept which is now firmly established in Western healthcare policy and practice. However, the term remains somewhat ambiguous, multi-faceted and contentious. This is evident in stroke care and rehabilitation, in which a self-management approach is increasingly adopted and advocated, yet interpreted in different ways, resulting in contradictions and tensions around control, responsibility, power and discipline. This paper aims to further our understanding of tensions and contradictions in stroke self-management, by critically examining contemporary self-management practices. We use a Foucauldian theoretical lens to explore the various power dynamics in the operationalisation of self-management, in addition to the complexity of the term self-management itself. Conducting a secondary analysis of interview and focus group data from the Self-Management VOICED study, supplemented with analysis of relevant documentary evidence from policy and practice, we describe the multiple aspects of power in operation. These include rhetorical, hierarchical, personal and mutual forms of power, representing interweaving dynamics evident in the data. These aspects of power demonstrate underlying agendas and tacit and explicit understandings of self-management which exist in clinical practice. These aspects of power also give insight into the multiple identities of ‘self-management’, acting as a simultaneous repressor and liberator, directly in keeping with Foucauldian thinking. The findings are also consistent with Foucault’s notions of bodily docility, discussions around governance and biopower, and contemporary discipline. Our analysis positions self-management as a highly nuanced and complex concept, which can fluctuate in its conceptualisation depending on the structures, routines, and the individual. We encourage healthcare professionals, policymakers and commissioners in the field of self-management to reflect on these complexities, to make transparent their assumptions and to explicitly position their own practice accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2949398458,"Activation of macrophages and overexpression of TNFα is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms leading to TNFα overexpression are still unknown. 5-methylocytosine (5-mC) is an epigenetic modification that is associated with silenced genes. Recent studies showed that it is converted to 5-hydroxylmethylocytosine (5-hmC) and reactivates gene expression through the action of the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET1-3) enzymes. In this study, we show that 5-hmC levels are increased globally and specifically in the TNFα promoter during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. In addition, the levels of 5-hmC are increased upon LPS stimulation of macrophages. Furthermore, CRIPSR stable knockout of TET1 decreases the expression of TNFα and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, we showed that TET1 contributes to the activation of macrophages possibly through regulation of 5-hydroxymethylation in the promoter of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. The TET1 enzyme could be a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the persistent inflammation caused by macrophages in chronic inflammatory diseases."

This species has high resistance to many diseases and insects, and it plays key roles in shelterbelts and urban afforestation in northern China. It has long been suspected to be a hybrid, but its parents remain unknown. In the present study, we report four newly sequenced complete cp genomes from section Populus and comparative genomic analyses of these new sequences and three published cp genome sequences. The seven cp genomes ranged from 155,853 bp (P. tremula var. davidiana) to 156,746 bp (P. adenopoda) in length, and their gene orders, gene numbers and GC contents were similar. We analyzed SNPs, indels, SSRs and repeats among the seven cp genomes, and eight small inversions were detected in the ndhC-trnV, rbcL-accD, petA-psbJ, trnW-trnP, rpl16-rps3, trnL-ycf15, ycf15-trnL, and ndhF-trnL intergenic regions. Furthermore, seven divergent regions (trnH-psbA, matK, psbM-psbD, ndhC-trnV, ycf1, ndhF-ccsA and ccsA-ndhD) were found in more highly variable regions. The phylogenetic tree reveals that P. tomentosa is closely related to P. alba and P. alba var. pyramidalis. Hence, P. alba was involved in the formation of P. tomentosa."
https://openalex.org/W2951748504,"Introduction Research has demonstrated benefits of social capital on depression, but variations in this relationship by geographic characteristics such as urbanicity have rarely been investigated. Methods Using survey data on 4,209 Ghanaian and 3,148 South African adults aged 50 and above from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to extract dimensions of social capital from survey items. Structural equation models with the extracted factors were then used to estimate the associations between social capital and depression in each sample and assess differences between urban and rural settings with measurement and structural invariance tests. Results Factor analyses suggested three dimensions of social capital representing community engagement, sociability, and trust. Urbanicity did not substantially modify the effects of social capital on depression in either setting, but urban-rural differences in the measurement and level of social capital were observed. Urban Ghanaian older adults were less socially integrated and trusting than older rural residents (standardized mean difference: -0.28, -0.24, and -0.38 for community engagement, sociability, and trust, respectively) while urban South African older adults appeared less engaged in community activities but significantly more trusting and socially active informally than older rural residents (standardized mean difference: -0.33, 0.30, and 0.17 for community engagement, sociability, and trust, respectively). Moreover, while trust was associated with a lower risk of depression in South Africa overall, sociability and trust were associated with an increased risk of depression in Ghana. Conclusions Results indicate that the composition and average levels of social capital differ between urban and rural older adult residents in Ghana and South Africa although urban-rural differences in the strength of the association between social capital and depression were not substantial. Furthermore, the associations between social capital and depression are context-specific and are not uniformly beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2949808096,"Introduction Child health remains an important public health concern at the global level, with preventable diseases such as diarrheal disease, acute respiratory infection (ARI) and fever posing a large public health burden in low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. Improvements in socio-economic conditions have tended to benefit advantaged groups in societies, which has resulted in widespread inequalities in health outcomes. This study examined how socioeconomic inequality is associated with childhood morbidity in Bangladesh, and identified the factors affecting three illnesses: diarrhea, ARI and fever. Materials and methods A total of 43,860 sample observations from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, spanning a 22-year period (1993–2014), were analysed. Concentration curve and concentration index methods were used to evaluate changes in the degree of household wealth-related inequalities and related trends in childhood morbidity. Regression-based decomposition analyses were used to attribute the inequality disparities to individual determinants for the three selected causes of childhood morbidity. Results The overall magnitude of inequality in relation to childhood morbidity has been declining slowly over the 22-year period. The magnitude of socio-economic inequality as a cause of childhood morbidity varied during the period. Decomposition analyses attributed the inequalities to poor maternal education attainment, inadequate pre-delivery care, adverse chronic undernutrition status and low immunisation coverage. Conclusions High rates of childhood morbidity were observed, although these have declined over time. Socio-economic inequality is strongly associated with childhood morbidity. Socio-economically disadvantaged communities need to be assisted and interventions should emphasise improvements of, and easier access to, health care services. These will be key to improving the health status of children in Bangladesh and should reduce economic inequality through improved health over time."
https://openalex.org/W2950223975,"Oxylipins are metabolites with a variety of biological functions. However, the biosynthetic pathway is widely unknown. It is considered that the first step is the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid. Therefore, a lipoxygenase (LOX) from the edible basidiomycete Agrocybe aegerita was investigated. The AaeLOX4 was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified via affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Biochemical properties and kinetic parameters of the purified AaeLOX4 were determined with linoleic acid and linolenic acid as substrates. The obtained Km, vmax and kcat values for linoleic acid were 295.5 μM, 16.5 μM · min-1 · mg-1 and 103.9 s-1, respectively. For linolenic acid Km, vmax and kcat values of 634.2 μM, 19.5 μM · min-1 · mg-1 and 18.3 s-1 were calculated. Maximum activities were observed at pH 7.5 and 25 °C. The main product of linoleic acid conversion was identified with normal-phase HPLC. This analysis revealed an explicit production of 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD). The experimental regio specificity is underpinned by the amino acid residues W384, F450, R594 and V635 considered relevant for regio specificity in LOX. In conclusion, HPLC-analysis and alignments revealed that AaeLOX4 is a 13-LOX."
https://openalex.org/W2953338935,"Sequencing data have been instrumental in identifying oncogenic drivers in prostatic carcinoma and highlighting biomarkers that define aggressive disease. A review of a series of 30 primary and metastatic prostatic carcinomas clinically sequenced at our cancer genomics laboratory utilizing a targeted gene panel identified recurrent structural variants in the TP53 gene. These structural variants were found in 27% of all sequenced cases and represented 36% of the cases with metastatic disease. TP53 structural rearrangements have been previously reported in a significant subset of osteosarcomas, where they result in loss of p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Similarly, in our prostate cases with TP53 structural rearrangements for which tissue was available for testing, we find loss of p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. In the eight TP53-rearranged cases, concurrent PTEN loss was identified in 4 cases, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in 5 cases, and AR and FOXA1 amplification in 1 case each. Our results from this small case series suggest that TP53 rearrangements with loss of expression represent a frequent alternative mechanism of inactivation of this key tumor suppressor gene with potential utility as a marker of aggressive disease. Recognition of this TP53 rearrangement pathway is essential to accurately identify prostatic carcinomas with loss of TP53 function."
https://openalex.org/W2952995156,"The advent of smartphones has advanced the use of embedded sensors to acquire various physiological information. For example, smartphone camera sensors and accelerometers can provide heart rhythm signals to the subjects, while microphones can give respiratory signals. However, the acquired smartphone-based physiological signals are more vulnerable to motion and noise artifacts (MNAs) compared to using medical devices, since subjects need to hold the smartphone with proper contact to the smartphone camera and lens stably and tightly for a duration of time without any movement in the hand or finger. This results in more MNA than traditional methods, such as placing a finger inside a tightly enclosed pulse oximeter to get PPG signals, which provides stable contact between the sensor and the subject’s finger. Moreover, a smartphone lens does not block ambient light in an effective way, while pulse oximeters are designed to block the ambient light effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel diversity method for smartphone signals that reduces the effect of MNAs during heart rhythm signal detection by 1) acquiring two heterogeneous signals from a color intensity signal and a fingertip movement signal, and 2) selecting the less MNA-corrupted signal of the two signals. The proposed method has advantages in that 1) diversity gain can be obtained from the two heterogeneous signals when one signal is clean while the other signal is corrupted, and 2) acquisition of the two heterogeneous signals does not double the acquisition procedure but maintains a single acquisition procedure, since two heterogeneous signals can be obtained from a single smartphone camera recording. In our diversity method, we propose to choose the better signal based on the signal quality indices (SQIs), i.e., standard deviation of instantaneous heart rate (STD–HR), root mean square of the successive differences of peak-to-peak time intervals (RMSSD–T), and standard deviation of peak values (STD–PV). As a performance metric evaluating the proposed diversity method, the ratio of usable period is considered. Experimental results show that our diversity method increases the usable period 19.53% and 6.25% compared to the color intensity or the fingertip movement signals only, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2952947260,"Background Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been emerged as one of the causes of acute recurrent or chronic hypertensive anterior uveitis in immunocompetent. In hypertensive anterior uveitis, human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells are considered a focus of inflammation. We investigated the effects of losartan, a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on CMV infection in human TM cells. Methods Human TM cells were infected with CMV AD169. Virus infected and mock-infected cells were treated with losartan or dexamethasone or ganciclovir with or without transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Viral DNA accumulation and host cell response were analyzed using real-time PCR. Levels of secreted TGF-β1 were measured by determining its concentration in conditioned medium using a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results CMV infection significantly increased the concentrations of the secreted TGF-β1 at 3, 5, and 7 day post infection in TM cells. Treatment with dexamethasone or losartan significantly decreased the levels of TGF-β1, whereas treatment with ganciclovir did not affect TGF-β1 levels. TM cells treated with TGF-β1 along with the presence of losartan for 48 hours showed marked decrease in the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), lysyl oxidase (LOX), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and collagen-1A, compared with cells treated with TGF-β1 alone. CMV-infected TM cells stimulated by TGF-β1 significantly increased the expression of α-SMA and CTGF, which were attenuated by additional treatment with losartan. Conclusion Losartan inhibited the expression of TGF-β1 and fibrogenic molecules in human TM cells. Thus, losartan has the potential to decrease TM fibrosis in patients with CMV-induced hypertensive anterior uveitis."
https://openalex.org/W2951461550,"Autophagy, a highly regulated degradative process that promotes cellular homeostasis, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental component of the cellular response against viral infection. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy during Junín virus (JUNV) multiplication using human A549 cells. We found that JUNV infection induces an increment of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, an accumulation of punctate pattern in RFP-LC3-transfected cells and the colocalisation of viral nucleoprotein and LC3 protein, suggesting autophagosome formation. JUNV infection also induced the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62, suggesting that complete autophagic flux was triggered. In addition, we showed that inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine significantly reduces viral multiplication. Moreover, viral yield was increased when autophagy was induced using rapamycin. Furthermore, JUNV infection induced the colocalisation of p62, ATG16, RAB5, RAB7A and LAMP1 with the autophagosomal LC3 protein. That suggests that phagosomes undergo the maturation process during viral infection. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA experiments targeting essential autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin 1) reduce viral protein synthesis and viral yield. Overall, our results indicate that JUNV activates host autophagy machinery enhancing its multiplication."
https://openalex.org/W2951043858,"Objective Although there is evidence that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms are positively related to alcohol use and related problems among young adults, little research has examined the mechanisms that might explain this association. In response, this study examined the mediating effects of coping and enhancement drinking motives on the prospective associations between ADHD symptoms and alcohol outcomes. Method Participants (N = 4,536) were young men from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors. Measures of ADHD symptoms and those of drinking motives, heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol use disorder symptoms were used from the baseline and 15-month follow-up assessments. Results Findings indicated that the associations of ADHD-inattention symptoms with alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms and with HED were partially and completely mediated through drinking motives, respectively, whereas drinking motives did not mediate the ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity-symptoms-alcohol outcomes associations. Conclusion Results indicated that coping and enhancement motives partially explained the ADHD-inattention symptoms—subsequent alcohol outcomes association. These findings suggest that interventions targeting enhancement and coping motives may help prevent problematic drinking among young men with elevated ADHD-inattention symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2950149697,"Objectives The Code of Ethics of pharmacy practitioners in Australia recognises the obligation to provide care to patients in a culturally safe and responsive manner. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine how Australian community pharmacists understand and experience the concept of ‘culture’ in their everyday practice environment. Methods Voluntary, semi-structured interviews were conducted at community pharmacy placement sites in South-East Queensland, Australia. Pharmacists were asked to recall an incident that evoked their cultural awareness during the course of their practice. The question stated, verbatim: “We are preparing our students to be pharmacists in a highly multicultural community. Can you think of an incident where you learnt something about another person’s culture or it made you more aware of your own culture? Please briefly describe the incident.” Reportable responses were collected from 59 of the 92 visited pharmacists. These responses were audio-recorded and transcribed. The data were collated and analysed through iterative, reflexive, thematic analysis using constant comparison. Results and significance The responses provided a rich selection of lived experiences within Australian multicultural pharmacy practice, describing professional dilemmas, fears and the strategies employed to overcome practice challenges. Six main response categories were identified: (i) Language/communication challenges, (ii) Cultural attitudes and behaviours, (iii) Exposure to culture due to pharmacy location, (iv) Religion, gender, and age, (v) Prejudiced/perceived racist attitudes and discrimination towards ‘other’ cultures, (vi) Perceived ‘sameness’ of different cultures. The study has provided valuable insights into community pharmacists’ experiences of culture in their day-to-day professional practice, also highlighting the associated strategies used to maintain a high standard of practice. There is merit in ensuring that the pharmacy curriculum and professional development programs are designed to respond to the ethical obligation of pharmacists to practise in a culturally safe, responsive manner that acknowledges and incorporates the importance of culture, cultural differences and intercultural relations, while addressing culturally unique needs in a skilled and professional manner."
https://openalex.org/W2950470569,"We studied the effect of derrone (DR), one of the major compounds of unripe fruits of Cudrania tricuspidata, on cancer cell death. DR inhibited cell growth of various cancer cells, and that was partially associated with apoptosis in A549 cells. DR showed the autophagic features, such as the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, the formation of autophagosome and the downregulation of SQSTM1/p62 (p62). The treatment of autophagy inhibitor reversed DR-mediated cell death, suggesting that DR induces autophagic cell death. The increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and ROS by DR treatment significantly influences the formation of autophagosomes; however, only ROS scavengers significantly rescued the reduced cell viability. Additional results revealed that treatment of DR induces sustained phosphorylation of ERK and the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation using U0126 (ERK inhibitor) markedly attenuated DR-induced cell death. Overall, these results suggest that DR induces autophagic cell death through intracellular ROS and sustained ERK phosphorylation in A549 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2952731019,"Introduction Response rates in health research are declining, and low response rates could result in biased outcomes when population characteristics of participants systematically differ from the non-respondents. Few studies have examined key factors of non-response beyond demographic characteristics, such as behavioral and psychological factors. The aim of the current study was to identify predictors of non-response and loss to follow-up in a longitudinal sexual health study. Materials and methods A longitudinal cohort study (iMPaCT) was conducted from November 2016 to July 2018 among heterosexual STI clinic visitors aged 18–24 years. At four different time points in one year, data was collected on sexual behavior, psychological determinants and chlamydia infections. The national STI surveillance database provided data on demographic, behavioral and sexual health-related characteristics for non-respondents. Predictors of non-response at baseline and of loss to follow-up were identified using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results In total, 13,658 STI clinic visitors were eligible to participate, of which 1,063 (8%) participated. Male gender, low/medium education level, young age (≤ 20 years) and having a non-Dutch migration background were significant predictors of non-response at baseline. Furthermore, non-respondents at baseline were more likely to report STI-related symptoms, to have been notified by a partner, to have had condomless sex, and to have had ≤ 2 partners in the past six months, compared to participants. Psychological predictors of loss to follow-up differed between STI clinic regions, but low perceived importance of health at baseline was associated with loss to follow-up in all regions. The baseline chlamydia positivity rate was significantly higher in the non-respondents (17%) compared to the participants (14%), but was not a predictor of loss to follow-up. Discussion Targeted recruitment aimed at underrepresented groups in the population based on demographic, behavioral and psychological characteristics, might be necessary to decrease loss to follow-up, and to prevent non-response bias in health research."
https://openalex.org/W2949378762,"Protein kinase B (AKT) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an important downstream effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. We have recently shown that MK-2206 and triciribine, two highly selective AKT inhibitors increase the level of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNA which leads to increased amount of cell-surface LDLRs. However, whereas MK-2206 induces transcription of the LDLR gene, triciribine stabilizes LDLR mRNA, raising the possibility that the two inhibitors may actually affect other kinases than AKT. In this study, we aimed to ascertain the role of AKT in regulation of LDLR mRNA expression by examining the effect of five additional AKT inhibitors on LDLR mRNA levels. Here we show that in cultured HepG2 cells, AKT inhibitors ARQ-092, AKT inhibitor VIII, perifosine, AT7867 and CCT128930 increase LDLR mRNA levels by inducing the activity of LDLR promoter. CCT128930 also increased the stability of LDLR mRNA. To study the role of AKT isoforms on LDLR mRNA levels, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of AKT1 or AKT2 on LDLR promoter activity and LDLR mRNA stability. Whereas knockdown of either AKT1 or AKT2 led to upregulation of LDLR promoter activity, only knockdown of AKT2 had a stabilizing effect on LDLR mRNA. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for involvement of AKT in regulation of LDLR mRNA expression, and point towards the AKT isoform specificity for upregulation of LDLR mRNA expression."

Extracted from pregnant mare urine, CEEs are composed of nearly a dozen estrogens existing in an inactive sulfated form. To determine whether the hepatic steroid sulfatase (STS) is a key contributor to the efficacy of CEEs in HRT, we performed estrogen-responsive element (ERE) reporter gene assay, real-time PCR, and UPLC-MS/MS to assess the STS-dependent and inflammation-responsive estrogenic activity of CEEs in HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes. Using liver-specific STS-expressing transgenic mice, we also evaluated the effect of STS on the estrogenic activity of CEEs in vivo. We observed that CEEs induce activity of the ERE reporter gene in an STS-dependent manner and that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STS attenuates CEE estrogenic activity. In hepatocytes, inflammation enhanced CEE estrogenic activity by inducing STS gene expression. The inflammation-responsive estrogenic activity of CEEs, in turn, attenuated inflammation through the anti-inflammatory activity of the active estrogens. In vivo, transgenic mice with liver-specific STS expression exhibited markedly increased sensitivity to CEE-induced estrogenic activity in the uterus resulting from increased levels of liver-derived and circulating estrogens. Our results reveal a critical role of hepatic STS in mediating the hormone-replacing activity of CEEs. We propose that caution needs to be applied when Premarin is used in patients with chronic inflammatory liver diseases because such patients may have heightened sensitivity to CEEs due to the inflammatory induction of STS activity.

As the average age of menopause is ∼50, and the average life expectancy of women is over 85, women may live more than one-third of their life in the postmenopausal state with dramatic sex hormone deficiencies.

Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), whose brand name is Premarin, are one of the most prescribed HRT drugs. CEEs are a complex natural extract from pregnant mare urine, containing nearly a dozen different estrogens with equilin and estrone as the main components (4Bhavnani B.R. Stanczyk F.Z. Pharmacology of conjugated equine estrogens: efficacy, safety and mechanism of action.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 142 (24176763): 16-2910.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.10.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The estrogens present in CEEs are the sulfate esters. Unlike estrogens, sulfonated estrogens cannot bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and thus they are hormonally inactive (5Pan C.C. Woolever C.A. Bhavnani B.R. Transport of equine estrogens: binding of conjugated and unconjugated equine estrogens with human serum proteins.J. Clin. Endocrinol.

To the best of our knowledge, how the estrogen sulfates in CEEs exert their pharmacological activity of hormone replacement remains to be defined. Steroid sulfatase (STS) is the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of steroid sulfates to their unconjugated forms (7Ferrante P. Messali S. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Molecular and biochemical characterisation of a novel sulphatase gene: Arylsulfatase G (ARSG).Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 10 (12461688): 813-81810.1038/sj.ejhg.5200887Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the tissue distribution of STS varies considerably among mammalian species, the liver is one of the organs rich in this enzyme. STS mediated desulfation and sulfotransferase (SULT) mediated sulfation are critical metabolic mechanisms to regulate the chemical and functional homeostasis of endogenous chemicals, including the estrogens. Estrogen sulfotransferase (EST; or SULT1E1) is the primary SULT that sulfonates and deactivates estrogens at their physiological concentrations (8Falany C.N. Enzymology of human cytosolic sulfotransferases.FASEB J. 1997; 11 (9068609): 206-21610.1096/fasebj.11.4.9068609Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Compared with the parent estrogens, estrogen sulfates have higher concentrations and prolonged half-life in the circulation. The desulfation of steroid sulfate is catalyzed by STS, which is believed to be the only enzyme responsible for the activation of conjugated estrogens. Although it is known that CEEs are a natural mixture of sulfated estrogens, the specific role of STS in the hormone-replacement effect of CEEs has yet to be established. Here, we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that hepatic STS and its inflammatory regulation in hepatocytes are essential for the hormone-replacement therapy efficacy of CEEs. To evaluate the estrogenic activity of CEEs and its dependence on STS in vitro, 293T cells were transfected with ERα expression vector and the estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene ERE-Luc in the absence or presence of the cotransfection of STS expression vector. The transfected cells were then treated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of CEEs. Without the STS cotransfection, treatment with the positive control, estradiol (E2), efficiently induced the reporter activity as expected, whereas CEEs elicited little reporter activity (Fig. 1A), consistent with the notion that conjugated estrogens are hormonally inactive. In contrast, cotransfection of STS markedly elevated CEE-induced reporter activity at all of the tested concentrations, and CEEs induced the reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Cotransfection of STS had little effect on the activity of E2 (Fig. 1A). In STS-cotransfected cells, treatment with STX64, a pharmacological inhibitor of STS (9Stanway S.J. Purohit A. Woo L.W.

The CEE-elicited reporter activity in STS-transfected cells was estrogen-dependent because the stimulated reporter activity was abolished in cells cotreated with the ERα antagonist fulvestrant (also called ICI 182,780 (ICI)) (Fig. 1C). We have previously reported that inflammation can induce the expression of STS in human liver cells, and the human STS gene was established as an NF-κB target gene (10Jiang M. Klein M. Zanger U.M.

Indeed, treatment of human hepatoma HepG2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or LPS, induced mRNA expression of STS (Fig. 2A), and the induction of STS protein in PMA-treated HepG2 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A, inset) and enzymatic activity assay (Fig. 2B). In HepG2 cells, CEEs had little effect on the basal or PMA-inducible expression of STS (Fig. 2C). The effect of PMA was enzyme-specific because PMA had little effect on the expression of the estrogen-deactivating enzyme EST (Fig. 2C). Having shown that STS can promote the estrogenic activity of CEEs, we hypothesized that inflammation may enhance the estrogenic activity of CEEs by inducing STS. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were treated with CEEs for 24 h, in the absence or presence of PMA and/or STX, before being measured for the intracellular or medium concentrations of estrone and estradiol by ultraperformance LC-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). As shown in Fig. 2D, the intracellular (left panel) and medium (right panel) concentrations of estrone and estradiol were increased in CEE-treated cells even in the absence of PMA, likely due to basal endogenous expression of STS in these cells. Cotreatment with PMA elevated the CEE-responsive estrogen levels, but the PMA effect was completely abolished by cotreatment with STX. At the functional level, treatment with CEEs alone had little effect on the expression of the estrogen-responsive gene trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) (11Barkhem T. Haldosén L.A. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. pS2 gene expression in HepG2 cells: complex regulation through crosstalk between the estrogen receptor α, an estrogen-responsive element, and the activator protein 1 response element.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61 (12021387): 1273-128310.1124/mol.61.6.1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but cotreatment with PMA resulted in a marked activation of TFF1 (Fig. 2E). The PMA effect on CEE-responsive induction of TFF1 was abolished when STS was knocked down by siRNA (Fig. 2F). The efficiency of STS knockdown was verified by real-time PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 2G). The effect of PMA on CEE-elicited estrogenic activity in HepG2 cells was also confirmed by a reporter gene assay. The ERE reporter activity induced by cotreatment with CEEs and PMA was abolished by treatment with STX (Fig. 2H), ICI (Fig. 2I) or the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) (12Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. Dithiocarbamates as potent inhibitors of nuclear factor κB activation in intact cells.J. Exp.

The effect of PDTC was consistent with the notion that NF-κB mediates the inflammatory induction of STS (10Jiang M. Klein M. Zanger U.M. Mohammad M.K. Cave M.C. Gaikwad N.W. Dias N.J. Selcer K.W.

We then determined whether the inflammation-responsive enhancement of CEE estrogenic activity can be verified in HPHs. Interestingly, the induction of STS in HPHs was more responsive to LPS than to PMA as confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 3A) and Western blotting (Fig. 3B). It is unclear why PMA and LPS showed different effects on STS expression in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes, but a similar pattern of difference was observed when we compared Huh7 cells and primary human hepatocytes in their inflammatory induction of STS (10Jiang M. Klein M. Zanger U.M. Mohammad M.K. Cave M.C. Gaikwad N.W. Dias N.J. Selcer K.W. Guo Y. He J. Zhang X. Shen Q. Qin W. Li J. Li S. Xie W.

CEEs had little effect on the basal or LPS-inducible expression of STS (Fig. 3C). The expression of EST was suppressed by LPS but restored by the cotreatment with CEEs (Fig. 3C). At the biochemical level, treatment of HPHs with CEEs alone led to detectable intracellular (Fig. 3D, left panel) and medium (Fig. 3D, right panel) levels of estrone and estradiol because of the basal expression of STS. At the same dose of CEEs, cotreatment with LPS substantially increased the intracellular and medium concentrations of estrogens, and the sensitizing effect of LPS was abolished by STX (Fig. 3D). At the functional level, CEEs were effective to induce the expression of estrogen-responsive genes TFF1, X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), and growth-regulating estrogen receptor–binding 1 (GREB1) (13Lee Y.J. Jin Y.R. Lim W.C. Park W.K. Cho J.Y. Jang S. Lee S.K. Ginsenoside-Rb1 acts as a weak phytoestrogen in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.Arch. Pharm.

Estrogen regulation of X-box binding protein-1 and its role in estrogen induced growth of breast and endometrial cancer cells.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin. Investig. 2010; 2 (21297881): 235-24310.1515/HMBCI.2010.025PubMed Google Scholar) only when HPHs were cotreated with LPS (Fig. 3E). Given the known anti-inflammatory effect of estrogens (15Straub R.H. The complex role of estrogens in inflammation.Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28 (17640948): 521-57410.1210/er.2007-0001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the inflammation-responsive and STS-mediated estrogenic activity of CEEs may in return attenuate inflammation. Indeed, the PMA-responsive induction of inflammatory marker genes, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), TNFα, and interleukin-8 (IL-8), was attenuated in cells cotreated with CEEs (Fig. 4A). The inflammation-attenuating effect of CEEs was abolished by treatment with STX or ICI (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the effect of CEE and PMA cotreatment was mediated by STS and ER, respectively. In an independent assay using an NF-κB–responsive luciferase reporter gene, the PMA-induced activation of the NF-κB reporter was attenuated by CEEs with an inhibitory effect similar to that of estradiol (Fig. 4B). Again, the attenuating effect of CEEs on the NF-κB reporter activity was abolished by STX or ICI (Fig. 4C). To understand the function of STS in CEE activation in vivo, we used the FABP-STS transgenic (TG) mice generated by crossing the FABP-tTA mice that express the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) in liver under the fatty acid–binding protein (FABP) gene promoter, and the TRE-STS mice expressing STS under the control of the tetracycline-response element (TRE) as outlined in Fig. 5A (16Zhou J. Zhai Y. Mu Y. Gong H. Uppal H. Toma D. Ren S. Evans R.M. Xie W. A novel pregnane X receptor-mediated and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-independent lipogenic pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (16556603): 15013-1502010.1074/jbc.M511116200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The protein expression of the transgene in the liver was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B) and enzymatic assay (Fig. 5C). We found that the intracellular (Fig. 5D, left) and medium (Fig. 5D, right) concentrations of estrone and estradiol were substantially higher in CEE-treated primary hepatocytes isolated from the TG mice compared with their wildtype (WT) counterparts. The basal and CEE-responsive expression of Hsp, a hepatic estrogen-responsive gene, was increased in hepatocytes isolated from the TG mice (Fig. 5E). The uterus is one of the organs most sensitive to estrogen stimulation. Therefore, we used the uterus to determine the estrogenic activity of CEEs in vivo. As outlined in Fig. 6A, ovariectomized virgin female WT mice or TG mice were treated with a single gavage of vehicle or CEEs (20 or 50 μg/kg of body weight) and sacrificed 20 h later. The treatment with CEEs, especially at the dose of 50 μg/kg, which was the boundary and most sensitive dose of CEEs showing the estrogenic difference between WT and TG mice, caused obvious uterine enlargement with hyperemia in the TG mice (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the gross appearance, CEE-treated TG mice showed a dramatically increased ratio of uterus to body weight, whereas only a mild increase of the ratio was observed in WT mice (Fig. 6C). The estrogen-responsive uterine epithelial proliferation was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunostaining. A single dose of CEEs (50 μg/kg) results in a BrdU labeling index of ∼15% in TG mice compared with 5% in the WT mice (Fig. 6D). The transgenic effect on the uterine response to CEEs was abolished when the TG mice were treated with doxycycline (DOX) to silence the transgene expression (Fig. 6, B–D). The uterotropic effect of CEEs was also confirmed by estrogen-responsive gene expression in that CEEs had little effect on the expression of uterine estrogen-responsive genes, including progesterone receptor (Pgr), lactoferrin (Ltf), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1), in the WT mice, likely because the boundary dose of CEEs (50 μg/kg) was used, but it caused a marked induction of these genes in the TG mice (Fig. 6E). The uteri of the TG mice did not express the STS transgene, and the expression of endogenous STS in the uteri of the TG mice was not affected either (data not shown), suggesting that the increased CEE-elicited estrogenic activity in the uterus was derived from the liver and through the circulation. Indeed, the liver concentrations of estrone and estradiol in CEE-treated TG mice were significantly higher than those in their WT counterparts (Fig. 6F). CEEs induced the expression of hepatic estrogen-responsive genes insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 4 (Igfbp4), sulfatase 2 (Sulf2), and Hsp in TG mice but not in WT mice (Fig. 6G). The circulating concentration of estrone was elevated in CEE-treated TG mice but not in WT mice (Fig. 6H). HRT is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but the safety profile of these hormone products, especially the risk of breast cancer, has been a concern (17Miller V.M. Harman S.M. An update on hormone therapy in postmenopausal women: mini-review for the basic scientist.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2017; 313 (28801526): H1013-H102110.1152/ajpheart.00383.2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the window of opportunity is crucial for balancing the benefit and risk of HRT, meaning the women's age and the time to initiate HRT relative to menopause onset are crucial (2Lobo R.A. Pickar J.H. Stevenson J.C. Mack W.J. Hodis H.N. Back to the future: hormone replacement therapy as part of a prevention strategy for women at the onset of menopause.Atherosclerosis. 2016; 254 (27745704): 282-29010.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.10.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been reported that benefits exceed risk for women starting HRT before 60 years of age or during 10 years since the onset of menopause (18Stuenkel C.A. Gass M.L. Manson J.E. Lobo R.A. Pal L. Rebar R.W. Hall J.E. A decade after the Women’s Health Initiative—the experts do agree.Menopause. 2012; 19 (22776849): 846-84710.1097/gme.0b013e31826226f2Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CEEs are one of the most prescribed HRT agents. Indeed, CEEs were used in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), the largest clinical trial to date, that was initiated in 1991. Based on the results from the WHI, women aged 50–59 years with CEE-alone treatment had a lower incidence of the combined end points of coronary heart disease and coronary revascularization compared with women older than 60 years (19Hsia J. Langer R.D. Manson J.E. Kuller L. Johnson K.C. Hendrix S.L. Pettinger M. Heckbert S.R. Greep N. Crawford S. Eaton C.B. Kostis J.B. Caralis P. Prentice R. Women's Health Initiative Investigators Conjugated equine estrogens and coronary heart disease: the Women's Health Initiative.Arch. Int. Med. 2006; 166 (16476878): 357-36510.1001/archinte.166.3.357Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Additionally, the WHI study showed that unlike CEEs plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, the regimen of CEEs alone did not increase the risk of breast cancer (20Anderson G.L. Limacher M. Assaf A.R. Bassford T. Beresford S.A. Black H. Bonds D. Brunner R. Brzyski R. Caan B. Chlebowski R. Curb D. Gass M. Hays J. Heiss G. et al.Effects of conjugated equine estrogen in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial.JAMA. 2004; 291 (15082697): 1701-171210.1001/jama.291.14.1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). It was probably due to a decreased level of total insulin-like growth factor-1 in the CEE-alone subjects (21Cardim H.J. Lopes C.M. Giannella-Neto D. da Fonseca A.M. Pinotti J.A. The insulin-like growth factor-I system and hormone replacement therapy.Fertil. Steril. 2001; 75 (11172828): 282-28710.1016/S0015-0282(00)01691-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is a risk factor for breast cancer (22Christopoulos P.F. Msaouel P. Koutsilieris M. The role of the insulin-like growth factor-1 system in breast cancer.Mol. Cancer. 2015; 14 (25743390): 4310.1186/s12943-015-0291-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These clinical observations verify that CEEs are a safe estrogen product for women in the early phase of postmenopause. As a natural hormone product extracted from pregnant mare urine, containing unique ring B unsaturated estrogens such as equilin and equilenin (4Bhavnani B.R. Stanczyk F.Z. Pharmacology of conjugated equine estrogens: efficacy, safety and mechanism of action.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 142 (24176763): 16-2910.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.10.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the metabolism and therapeutic effect of CEEs are more complex than single-component natural or synthetic estrogen. STS is believed to be the only enzyme responsible for the deconjugation and activation of conjugated estrogens. In the current study, we have provided compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence that the expression and activity of STS are sufficient and necessary for the effective hormonal activity of CEEs. The induction of STS in hepatocytes had little effect on the expression of the estrogen-deactivating enzyme EST, suggesting that STS is the only enzyme responsible for the estrogenic activity of CEEs. Our transgenic studies showed that the effect of the hepatic expression of STS on the estrogenic activity of CEEs can be systemic because transgenic expression of STS in the liver can distally enhance CEE-induced estrogenic activity in the uterus. The effect of inflammation on estrogenic activity of CEEs is interesting and could have a major clinical significance. Estrogen is an anti-inflammatory hormone. As summarized in Fig. 7, inflammation can enhance the estrogenic activity of CEEs through the induction of STS in an NF-κB–dependent manner, and the inflammation-responsive estrogenic activity of CEEs in return can inhibit inflammation, completing a negative feedback loop to attenuate inflammation. It will be interesting to determine whether chronic inflammation, including that of the liver, such as viral and nonviral hepatitis, steatosis, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis, can sensitize postmenopausal women to the HRT effect of CEEs. In addition, a systemic, low-grade, and subacute inflammatory state is commonly and closely associated with metabolic dysfunctions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcohol fatty liver disease (23Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation and metabolic disorders.Nature. 2006; 444 (17167474): 860-86710.1038/nature05485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6241) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether metabolic syndrome should be a factor considered for the precise use of CEEs. Besides the oral tablets, Premarin is also used in the form of vaginal cream to treat the vaginal symptoms of menopause such as dryness, burning, irritation, and painful sexual intercourse (24Suwanvesh N. Manonai J. Sophonsritsuk A. Cherdshewasart W. Comparison of Pueraria mirifica gel and conjugated equine estrogen cream effects on vaginal health in postmenopausal women.Menopause. 2017; 24 (27749740): 210-21510.1097/GME.0000000000000742Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Future studies are necessary to examine the expression and regulation of STS in the vaginal wall and whether vaginal inflammation can sensitize patients to Premarin vaginal cream. In summary, the current study has uncovered an essential function of hepatic STS in activating CEEs. Caution needs to be applied in the clinical use of CEEs/Premarin in patients with chronic inflammation in the liver because these patients may be more sensitive to CEE therapy due to STS induction. CEEs from Pfizer was dissolved in DMSO. The recombinant human TNFα was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The HepG2 and HEK293T cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HepG2 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In experiments in which exogenous estrogen or anti-estrogen were added, the cells were maintained in phenol red–free and serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose (4.5 mg/liter) before the drug treatment. The TATA-ERE-Luc or TATA-NF-κB-Luc reporter genes were described previously (10Jiang M. Klein M. Zanger U.M. Mohammad M.K. Cave M.C. Gaikwad N.W. Dias N.J. Selcer K.W. Guo Y. He J. Zhang X. Shen Q.

Cells were transiently transfected with the reporter constructs followed by specific chemical treatment for 24 h and then measured for luciferase and β-gal activities. Transfection efficiency was normalized against β-gal activity from the cotransfected pCMX-β-gal plasmid. For knockdown experiments, the human STS siRNA and control scrambled siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). After siRNA transfection, the cells were collected at 24 h for mRNA expression analysis or at 48 h for protein expression analysis. The FABP-STS transgenic mice in C57BL/6J background were generated by cross-breeding the TRE-STS mice with the FABP-tTA mice as described before (10Jiang M. Klein M. Zanger U.M. Mohammad M.K.

Five-week-old virgin females C57BL/6J mice (WT) or TG mice were subjected to ovariectomy. The ovariectomized mice were rested for 7 days before being given a single dose of vehicle or CEEs (20 or 50 μg/kg of body weight) by gavage (25Della Torre S. Biserni A. Rando G. Monteleone G.

When necessary, DOX (2 mg/ml) was given in drinking water 1 day before surgery and until the completion of the experiment. The use of mice in this study complied with all relevant federal guidelines and institutional policies and was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. One uterine horn was harvested for paraffin section and BrdU immunostaining using an anti-BrdU antibody (1:200; ab6326, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) as described before (26Gong H. Guo P. Zhai Y. Zhou J.

Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent. For Western blotting, the anti-STS antibody (1:200; ab34781) was purchased from Abcam. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion from age- and body weight–matched female WT or TG mice as reported previously (27Mu Y. Zhang J. Zhang S. Zhou H.H. Toma D. Ren S.

https://openalex.org/W2952562635,"Hyponatremia is a well-established poor prognostic marker in patients with heart failure. Whether the mortality risk is comparable among different races of patients with heart failure and hyponatremia is unknown.Consecutive patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure and an admission sodium level<135 mEq/L from 1/1/2001 through 12/31/10 were identified. Patients were divided into four groups based on self-reported race: white, African American, Hispanic and other. African Americans were used as the reference group for statistical analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.We included 4,343 patients, from which 1,356 (31%) identified as white, 1,248 (29%) as African American, 780 (18%) as Hispanic and 959 (22%) as other. During a median follow-up of 23 months, a total of 2,384 patients died: 678 were African American, 820 were white, 298 were Hispanic and 588 were other. After adjusting for baseline demographics, comorbidities and medication use, Hispanic patients had a 45% less risk of death as compared to African Americans (HR .55, CI .48-.64, p<0.05). There was no difference in mortality between white and African American patients (HR 1.04, CI .92-1.2, p = 0.79).Hispanic patients admitted for heart failure and who were hyponatremic on admission had an independent lower risk of mortality compared to other groups. These findings may be due to the disparate activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system among various racial groups. This observational study is hypothesis generating and suggests that treatment of patients with heart failure and hyponatremia should perhaps be focused more on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduction in certain racial groups, yet less in others."
https://openalex.org/W2953285910,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an environmental pollutant that causes cardiovascular toxicity. The phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype is a hallmark of vascular response to injury. However, the precise role and molecular mechanism of TCDD in vascular remodeling remains unknown. In the present study, we found that TCDD treatment promoted VSMC phenotypic transition from contractile to synthetic phenotype and exaggerated vascular neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in mice. TCDD treatment enhanced VSMC entry into cell cycle from G0/G1 phase to S and G2/M phase. The expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and its phosphorylation were coordinately increased in response to TCDD treatment. Knocking down of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) inhibited VSMC phenotypic transition induced by TCDD and promoted S/G2 phase cell cycle arrest. TCDD treatment markedly increased oncogenic c-Jun gene expression in VSMCs. ChIP assay revealed the direct binding of AHR on the promoter of c-Jun to up-regulate the mRNA expression of c-Jun. Silencing of c-Jun gene enhanced the expression of p53 and p21, whereas attenuated the expression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 leading to the decrease in the TCDD-stimulated VSMC proliferation and synthetic phenotype transition in vitro. In vivo study showed that genetic ablation of c-Jun in VSMCs restricted injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia in TCDD-treated mice. Thus, TCDD exposure exaggerated injury-induced vascular remodeling by the activation of AHR and up-regulation of the expression of its target gene c-Jun, indicating that inhibition of AHR may be a promising prevention strategy for TCDD-associated cardiovascular diseases.—Guo, S., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Wan, Q., Wang, Y., Yu, Y., Liu, G., Shen, Y., Yu, Y., Zhang, J. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin promotes injury-induced vascular neointima formation in mice.

We investigate whether married couples utilize their spouses as a savings commitment device to alleviate the present bias problem using experimental and survey data in Vietnam. We find that individuals are less present biased when making joint decisions with their spouses than they are when making decisions alone. However, present-biased individuals turn over a smaller ratio of their earnings to their spouses and are more likely to manage household resources than time-consistent individuals are. Present-biased individuals also receive larger amounts of money from their spouses’ incomes, indicating that marriage not only fails to function as a savings commitment device but also exacerbates the problem. Married couples whose joint decisions are not present biased try to alleviate this problem by allocating smaller allowances to present-biased spouses, but the present-biased spouses conceal money to counteract this strategy. Our study indicates the importance of external savings commitment devices in helping people protect money from their present-biased spouses."
https://openalex.org/W2949848598,"The northern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) is a critical pathogen with a wide host range. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has been used to elucidate gene expression and function of M. hapla. Suitable reference genes are required to ensure accurate results of qRT-PCR for normalising gene expression. Eleven candidate reference genes of M. hapla were selected to evaluate gene expression stability under different conditions. The stability of candidate reference genes was ranked using RefFinder analysis, and the optimal number of reference genes was recommended with geNorm. Notably, the most stable reference genes were SDHA, Mdh, and RpS6 for all samples; SDHA and RpS6 were particularly stable during development stage treatments, whereas Mdh and RpS6 were appropriate for temperature and inorganic compound treatments. In contrast, the least stable reference genes were Actin1 during development stages and all other treatments, GAPDH for temperature treatments, and α-Tub for inorganic compound treatments. One target gene, Mh-Hsp90, was used to verify the selection of reference genes, results showed Mdh and RpS6 could be used as suitable reference genes for M. hapla, and Mdh plus RpS6 were better. Our finding contributes to further work on gene transcription analysis in M. hapla."
https://openalex.org/W2950638850,"Bovine NK-lysins are cationic antimicrobial proteins found predominantly in the cytosolic granules of T lymphocytes and NK-cells. NK-lysin-derived peptides show antimicrobial activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Mature NK-lysin protein has six well-conserved cysteine residues. This study was performed to assess whether synthetic bovine NK-lysin-derived peptide (bNK2A) forms disulfide bonds and whether disulfide bonds were essential for bNK2A antimicrobial activity. Two 30-mer bNK2A peptides were synthesized: one with two original cysteines and an analog with cysteines substituted with two serines. Mass spectrometry revealed lack of disulfide bonds in original peptide while CD spectrophotometry showed both peptides have similar α-helical structures. Since both peptides were equally inhibitory to Histophilus somni, disulfide bonds appeared dispensable for synthetic bNK2A peptide antibacterial activity."
https://openalex.org/W2952261250,"Pigmented bacteria cells, including aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, contribute significantly to secondary production and aquatic carbon cycling but their distribution in the deep sea is still not well understood, especially in the South China Sea. In this study, microscopic, flow cytometric, and molecular analyses were carried out to investigate the abundance and diversity of AAP bacteria at seven stations in the South China Sea. The results revealed the existence of bacteriochlorophyll-containing bacteria below 500 m from two of seven stations. Flow cytometric analysis detected red and infra-red fluorescence under blue (488 nm) light excitation from fluorescent cells. Blue light-excited red fluorescence of these cells from the 1000 m depth at station E403 were verified using epifluorescence microscopy. Based on fluorescence and side scatter features, fluorescent cells were sorted and subjected to molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from these sorted cells from both stations for PCR amplification using 16S rDNA primers. Sequencing of the PCR products showed that the sorted cells from the 1000 m depth at station E403 belonged to the genus Porphyrobacter. The cell population sorted from 500 m at station E703 contained Sphingomonas and a Methylobacterium-like taxon. All these three taxa belong to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic alpha-proteobacteria. Using flow cytometric analysis, we found that the abundance of Porphyrobacter sp. at 1000 m was 2.71–2.95×104 cells mL-1 whereas cell counts of Sphingomonas sp. and Methylobacterium at 500 m were about 3.75–4.12×105 cells mL-1. These results indicate that albeit not ubiquitous in deep water, bacteriochlorophyll-containing bacteria can be abundant in the deep-sea aphotic zone."
