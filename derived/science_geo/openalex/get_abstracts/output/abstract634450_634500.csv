https://openalex.org/W2948490412,"Failed regeneration of CNS myelin contributes to clinical decline in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, for which there is an unmet therapeutic need. Here we reveal that efficient remyelination requires death of proinflammatory microglia followed by repopulation to a pro-regenerative state. We propose that impaired microglia death and/or repopulation may underpin dysregulated microglia activation in neurological diseases, and we reveal therapeutic targets to promote white matter regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2950800702,"Recently it has been proposed that information in working memory (WM) may not always be stored in persistent neuronal activity but can be maintained in 'activity-silent' hidden states, such as synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term synaptic plasticity. To test this idea computationally, we investigated recurrent neural network models trained to perform several WM-dependent tasks, in which WM representation emerges from learning and is not a priori assumed to depend on self-sustained persistent activity. We found that short-term synaptic plasticity can support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks that require actively manipulating information, persistent activity naturally emerges from learning, and the amount of persistent activity scales with the degree of manipulation required. These results shed insight into the current debate on WM encoding and suggest that persistent activity can vary markedly between short-term memory tasks with different cognitive demands."
https://openalex.org/W2948952612,"An approaching predator and self-motion toward an object can generate similar looming patterns on the retina, but these situations demand different rapid responses. How central circuits flexibly process visual cues to activate appropriate, fast motor pathways remains unclear. Here we identify two descending neuron (DN) types that control landing and contribute to visuomotor flexibility in Drosophila. For each, silencing impairs visually evoked landing, activation drives landing, and spike rate determines leg extension amplitude. Critically, visual responses of both DNs are severely attenuated during non-flight periods, effectively decoupling visual stimuli from the landing motor pathway when landing is inappropriate. The flight-dependence mechanism differs between DN types. Octopamine exposure mimics flight effects in one, whereas the other probably receives neuronal feedback from flight motor circuits. Thus, this sensorimotor flexibility arises from distinct mechanisms for gating action-specific descending pathways, such that sensory and motor networks are coupled or decoupled according to the behavioral state."
https://openalex.org/W2952952865,"Objective To assess the impact of resilience, the ability to withstand and bounce back from adversity, on measures of well-being, self-reported stress, and mental health diagnoses. Methods This study was a cross-sectional survey of participants seen at an executive health practice at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 2012 through September 2016. Participants completed an anonymous survey that included demographic information and 3 validated survey instruments—the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the 12-item Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale (LASA), and the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Self-reported history of mental health diagnoses was also collected. CD-RISC scores were used to stratify participants into lower (<30), medium (30–34), or higher (≥35) resilience categories. Participants’ LASA scores, PSS scores, and self-reported mental health diagnoses were compared among resilience categories. Results Of the 2,027 eligible participants, 1,954 met the study inclusion criteria as currently employed corporate-sponsored executive or business professionals (self-designated) who completed the CD-RISC survey. Most participants (62.5%) were aged 40 to 59 years. The majority were male (78.3%), white (95.3%), educated (86.2%), and in a committed relationship (89.7%). Among participants, 41.7% reported higher resilience, 34.3% had medium resilience, and 24.0% had lower resilience. The quality of life and overall LASA scores were positively associated with higher resilience (P < .001). PSS scores and self-reported mental health diagnoses were negatively associated with higher resilience (P < .001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for patient characteristics. Conclusions In this cross-sectional survey of a large cohort of corporative executives, the lower-resilience cohort had a 4-fold higher prevalence of depression and an almost 3-fold higher prevalence of anxiety compared with the higher-resilience cohort. High resilience was positively associated with well-being and negatively associated with perceived stress. Our findings suggest that higher resilience in the executive workplace environment is associated with better mental health, reduced stress, and greater well-being."

Here, four commercially available (in Europe) HA ""volumetric"" fillers, among the most used in the clinical practice, have been characterized in vitro. Analyses revealed the highest amounts of water-soluble HA reported so far and provided hydrodynamic data for these soluble polymeric fractions. Volumetric gels exhibit a wide range of rigidity with most of them showing G' values around 200-300Pa. They greatly differ in cohesivity. 1mL of gel hydrates up to 2.4-3.2mL. The products completely solubilize due to Bovine Testicular Hyaluronidase (BTH)'s action, thus predicting in vivo complete resorption. For the first time, filler degradation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied by rheological measurements and a rank in stability was established. Studies using Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) indicated a positive biological response to the HA networks. Further, gel capacity to prompt collagen I, elastin and aquaporin3 synthesis was demonstrated, thus suggesting a positive effect on skin elasticity and hydration, besides the physical volumetric action. The findings are the first wide assessment of features for the volumetric class of HA-fillers and include first data on their resistance to degradation by ROS and biological effects on HDF. The study represents a valuable contribution to the understanding of HA-fillers, useful to optimize their use and manufacture."
https://openalex.org/W2951361015,"Advancing maternal health is central to global health policy-making; therefore, considerable efforts have been made to improve maternal health. Still, in many developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, including Afghanistan, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remains high. The objective of this study was to examine the determinants and current status of the utilization of maternal healthcare in Afghanistan.This study used the most recent data from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The unit of analysis for this study was women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey. The outcome variables were four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits, delivery assistance by a skilled birth attendant (SBA), and delivery by cesarean section (CS). The explanatory variables were basic sociodemographic characteristics of the mothers. We examined the sociodemographic characteristics of women utilizing ANC, SBA, and CS using descriptive statistics and estimated usage of ANC, SBA and CS after adjusting for maternal age and parity groups via direct standardization. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to investigate the determinants of maternal healthcare variables.Overall, 17.8% of women attended four or more ANC visits, 53.6% utilized an SBA, and 3.4% of women gave birth through CS. Women's education, wealth status, urbanity, autonomy, and availability of their own transport were found to be the major determinants of service utilization.This study underscores low utilization of maternal healthcare services with wide disparities in Afghanistan and highlighted the need for an adequate health strategy and policy implementation to improve maternal healthcare uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2885338966,"Background The persistence of preventable maternal and newborn deaths highlights the importance of quality of care as an essential element in coverage interventions. Moving beyond the conventional measurement of crude coverage, we estimated effective coverage of facility delivery by adjusting for facility preparedness to provide delivery services in Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, and Tanzania. Methods The study uses data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Service Provision Assessments (SPA) in Bangladesh (2014 DHS and 2014 SPA), Haiti (2012 DHS and 2013 SPA), Malawi (2015–16 DHS and 2013–14 SPA), Nepal (2016 DHS and 2015 SPA), Senegal (2016 DHS and 2015 SPA), and Tanzania (2015–16 DHS and 2014–15 SPA). We defined effective coverage as the mathematical product of crude coverage and quality of care. The coverage of facility delivery was measured with DHS data and quality of care was measured with facility data from SPA. We estimated effective coverage at both the regional and the national level and accounted for type of facility where delivery care was sought. Findings The findings from the six countries indicate the effective coverage ranges from 24% in Haiti to 66% in Malawi, representing substantial reductions (20% to 39%) from crude coverage rates. Although Malawi has achieved almost universal coverage of facility delivery (93%), effective coverage was only 66%.vSuch gaps between the crude coverage and the effective coverage suggest that women delivered in health facility but did not necessarily receive an adequate quality of care. In all countries except Malawi, effective coverage differed substantially among the country’s regions of the country, primarily due to regional variability in coverage. Interpretation Our findings reinforce the importance of quality of obstetric and newborn care to achieve further reduction of maternal and newborn mortality. Continued efforts are needed to increase the use of facility delivery service in countries or regions where coverage remains low."

To better understand CHIKV dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, we generated 11 near-complete genomes by means of real-time portable nanopore sequencing of virus isolates obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions indicated the circulation of the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) lineage in Rio de Janeiro. Time-measured phylogenetic analysis combined with CHIKV notified case numbers revealed the ECSA lineage was introduced in Rio de Janeiro around June 2015 (95% Bayesian credible interval: May to July 2015) indicating the virus was circulating unnoticed for 5 months before the first reports of CHIKV autochthonous transmissions in Rio de Janeiro, in November 2015. These findings reinforce that continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to assist in the monitoring and understanding of arbovirus epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases."

However, whether it contributes to I/R-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury remains unclear, cilostazol exerts protective effects toward I/R-induced BBB injury, with unclear mechanisms. This study explored the potential role of ER stress in I/R-induced endothelial cell damage and determined whether the therapeutic potential of cilostazol, with respect to I/R-induced endothelial cell damage, is related to inhibition of ER stress. We found that exposing brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly activated ER stress and diminished the barrier function of cell monolayers; treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) or cilostazol prevented OGD/R-induced ER stress and preserved barrier function. Furthermore, OGD/R induced the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB. These changes were partially reversed by 4-PBA or cilostazol treatment. In vivo, 4-PBA or cilostazol significantly attenuated I/R-induced ER stress and ameliorated Evans blue leakage and tight junction loss. These results demonstrate that I/R-induced ER stress participates in BBB disruption. Targeting ER stress could be a useful strategy to protect the BBB from ischemic stroke, and cilostazol is a promising therapeutic agent for this process.—Nan, D., Jin, H., Deng, J., Yu, W., Liu, R., Sun, W., Huang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2952504735,"Multiple microsecond-length molecular dynamics simulations of complexes of Al(III) with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides of varying length are reported, employing a non-bonded model of Al-coordination to the peptide, which is modelled using the AMBER ff14SB forcefield. Individual simulations reach equilibrium within 100 to 400 ns, as determined by root mean square deviations, leading to between 2.1 and 2.7 μs of equilibrated data. These reveal a compact set of configurations, with radius of gyration similar to that of the metal free peptide but larger than complexes with Cu, Fe and Zn. Strong coordination through acidic residues Glu3, Asp7 and Glu11 is maintained throughout all trajectories, leading to average coordination numbers of approximately 4 to 5. Helical conformations predominate, particularly in the longer Al-Aβ40 and Al-Aβ42 peptides, while β-strand forms are rare. Binding of the small, highly charged Al(III) ion to acidic residues in the N-terminus strongly disrupts their ability to engage in salt bridges, whereas residues outside the metal binding region engage in salt bridges to similar extent to the metal-free peptide, including the Asp23-Lys28 bridge known to be important for formation of fibrils. High helical content and disruption of salt bridges leads to characteristic tertiary structure, as shown by heat maps of contact between residues as well as representative clusters of trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2949624174,"Although drusen have long been acknowledged as a primary hallmark of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) their role in the disease remains unclear. We hypothesize that drusen accumulation increases the barrier to metabolite transport ultimately resulting in photoreceptor cell death. To investigate this hypothesis, a computational model was developed to evaluate steady-state oxygen distribution in the retina. Optical coherence tomography images from fifteen AMD patients and six control subjects were segmented and translated into 3D in silico representations of retinal morphology. A finite element model was then used to determine the steady-state oxygen distribution throughout the retina for both generic and patient-specific retinal morphology. Oxygen levels were compared to the change in retinal thickness at a later time point to observe possible correlations. The generic finite element model of oxygen concentration in the retina agreed closely with both experimental measurements from literature and clinical observations, including the minimal pathological drusen size identified by AREDS (64 μm). Modeling oxygen distribution in the outer retina of AMD patients showed a substantially stronger correlation between hypoxia and future retinal thinning (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.2162) than between drusen height and retinal thinning (r = 0.0303) indicating the potential value of this physiology-based approach. This study presents proof-of-concept for the potential utility of finite element modeling in evaluating retinal health and also suggests a potential link between transport and AMD pathogenesis. This strategy may prove useful as a prognostic tool for predicting the clinical risk of AMD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2951735783,"Cytochrome bc1 complexes (cyt bc1), also known as complex III in mitochondria, are components of the cellular respiratory chain and of the photosynthetic apparatus of non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. They catalyze electron transfer (ET) from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and concomitantly translocate protons across the membrane, contributing to the cross-membrane potential essential for a myriad of cellular activities. This ET-coupled proton translocation reaction requires a gating mechanism that ensures bifurcated electron flow. Here, we report the observation of the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (ISP) in a mobile state, as revealed by the crystal structure of cyt bc1 from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides in complex with the fungicide azoxystrobin. Unlike cyt bc1 inhibitors stigmatellin and famoxadone that immobilize the ISP, azoxystrobin causes the ISP-ED to separate from the cyt b subunit and to remain in a mobile state. Analysis of anomalous scattering signals from the iron–sulfur cluster of the ISP suggests the existence of a trajectory for electron delivery. This work supports and solidifies the hypothesis that the bimodal conformation switch of the ISP provides a gating mechanism for bifurcated ET, which is essential to the Q-cycle mechanism of cyt bc1 function."

Methods Case-control study of adolescents with CP (10 to ≤18-years) and age and sex matched controls without disability. Primary caregivers were included for proxy report. HRQoL was measured with Bengali versions CP Quality of Life-Teens (CPQoL-Teens) and KIDSCREEN-27. Mental health was measured with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results 154 cases and 173 controls matched on age and sex participated (mean age 15.1 (1.6) and 14.9 (1.6) respectively; female n = 48, n = 55 respectively, p>0.05). CPQoL-Teens was administered to adolescents with CP only; mean outcomes ranged from 38.5 (27.4) to 71.5 (16.1) and ‘feelings about functioning’ was poorest domain for both self- and proxy-report groups. KIDSCREEN-27 was administered to adolescents with CP and controls; adolescents with CP mean outcomes ranged from 25.9 (12.2) to 48.7 (10.56) and were significantly poorer than controls, mean difference 4.3 (95% CI 0.7 to 7.8) to 16.7 (95% CI 14.5 to 18.5), p<0.05. ‘Peers and social support’ was poorest domain for all groups. In regards to mental health, adolescents with CP reported significantly poorer mean SDQ than peers without disability, mean difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1) to 7.8 (95% CI 6.7 to 8.9), p<0.05; and were for self-report 7.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 23.0) and proxy-report 12.0 (95% CI 6.9 to 20.9) times more likely to report ‘probable’ range ‘total difficulties’ score. Individual item analysis of CPQoL-Teens and KIDSCREEN-27 identified unique areas of concern for adolescents with CP related to pain, friendships, physical activity and energy, what may happen later in life, and feelings about having CP. Financial resources were of concern for both cases and controls. Interpretation Adolescents with CP in rural Bangladesh are at high risk of poor HRQoL and mental health problems. Effort to reduce the disparity between adolescents with CP and those without disability should consider wellbeing holistically and target dimensions including physical, psychological and social wellbeing. Specific interventions to alleviate modifiable aspects of HRQoL including pain, social isolation, and physical in-activity are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2952884046,"This study investigated the effectiveness of new hemostatic adhesive powder (UI-EWD) in a swine mode of acute gastric bleeding. Gastric ulcer bleeding was induced endoscopically at two locations in each of eight heparinized mini-pigs. UI-EWD and saline were sprayed endoscopically in the experimental (n = 5) and control groups (n = 3), respectively. The hemostatic effect and hydrogel persistence on ulcers were periodically evaluated endoscopically. Initial hemostasis was achieved successfully in all lesions in the experimental group. Follow-up endoscopy showed minor delayed bleeding in 10% at 6 hours in the experimental group, whereas re-bleeding was observed in 50% at 6 hours in the control group. UI-EWD gel persisted at 90%, 80%, and 50% of ulcer bases at 6, 18, and 42 hours post-application, respectively. This study suggests that muco-adhesive UI-EWD may be effective in the endoscopic treatment of active ulcer bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2949085117,"Proteins from their native conformation convert into highly ordered fibrillar aggregation under particular conditions; that are described as amyloid fibrils. α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a small natively unfolded protein that its fibrillation is the causative factor of Parkinson’s disease. One important approach in the development of therapeutic agents is the use of small molecules (such as flavonoids) that could specifically and efficiently inhibit the aggregation process. In this study the effect of few herbal extract (Berberis, Quercus robur, Zizyphus vulgaris, Salix aegyptica) containing flavonoids were investigated on fibril formation of α-syn by using conventional methods such as ThT fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The interaction of extracts were also analysed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Among extracts, Salix aegyptica revealed the highest inhibitory effect on fibril formation. As expected, Salix aegyptica extract also exhibited the highest affinity toward α-syn. Cell viability using MTT assay revealed that fibrils alone were more toxic than those containing the extract. Overall, we demonstrated that the affinity of compounds used in this study corresponds to their ability to arrest fibrillation and reduce cellular toxicity of α-syn fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2949595334,"Purpose Retinal detachment (RD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed ophthalmologic conditions requiring prompt surgical intervention. Combination of proper surgical technique and new diagnostic markers, both clinical and molecular, can help improve the diagnosis and prognosis of RD treatment. Methods 12 patients with rhegmatogenous RD (rRD) were included into the study after obtaining patient consent and Regional Ethical Approval (average age: 58.1 ± 17.4 years). OCT was performed before and after 23G vitrectomy for RD. Pure subretinal fluid (SRF) was collected during surgery and analyzed by protein array profiling on a panel of 105 inflammatory cytokines (Human XL Cytokine Array), while the effect of SRF upon human macrophages-driven phagocytosis of apoptotic retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells ex vivo was quantified by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of retinectomized tissue due to PVR caused by RD was performed to determine presence of markers for microglial cells (CD34), macrophages and activated microglia (CD68), regulator of the immune response to infection (NFkB), progenitor and stem cell marker (Sox2), pluripotency marker (Oct4) and intermediate filament markers (GFAP and Nestin). Results OCT of fresh RD patients contained pre-operatively hyper reflective points (HRPs) at the detached neuroretina border and proximal to the RPE layer—their size and number decreased following successful reattachment surgery. IHC of the retinectomized tissue from detached retina due to severe PVR showed presence of cell conglomerates at the detached neuroretina border which were positive for CD68, NFkB, Sox2 and GFAP, less positive for CD47 and Nestin and negative for Oct4 and CD34. The SRF contained at least 37 cytokines with higher, and 4 cytokine with lower concentration compared to that in vitreous from non-RD pathology; when used as conditional medium to human macrophages ex vivo, the SRF doubled their capacity for engulfing dying RPEs. Conclusions Fresh RD can be hallmarked by presence of HRPs at the detached neuroretina border on OCT; the HRPs decrease in size and number after successful reattachment surgery, and likely resemble the macrophage conglomerates seen by IHC. The neuroretina in RD contains progenitor/stem-like cells and signs of inflammatory reaction, while the SRF contains inflammatory cytokines and other factors which increase the ability of professional phagocytes to engulf dying RPE, or for that matter, other dying cells in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2949940780,"This mixed-methods study aims to inform the development of a 'Park Prescription' intervention, including face-to-face counseling on physical activity and park use and providing weekly structured exercise sessions in the park to promote physical activity. Participants aged 40-65 years were recruited from regional health screening events in Singapore where they completed a questionnaire (N = 97) and consented to focus group (FG) participation (N = 16). The questionnaire assessed current park use, and the type, duration, and intensity of park-based activities that would be of interest. FGs explored the barriers and facilitators of physical activity (in parks). Short interviews (N = 16) with 'doers', i.e., people already engaging in park-based physical activity, identified motivational factors and ways to overcome common barriers. Participants acknowledged the health benefits of parks and valued them because of their pleasant landscapes, greenery and facilities. However, few participants engaged in physical activity at the parks, because they were too busy or too tired. Participants mostly indicated doing informal activities, such as walking, cycling or playing traditional Asian games when using the parks for exercise. A variety of low-to-moderate intensity park-based activities such as walking, cycling or aerobics were of interest to participants who expressed the willingness to engage in structured exercise sessions on weekday evenings or weekend mornings. Strategies to increase physical activity in parks included: encourage planning, create social support, identify alternatives for bad weather, improve proximity/accessibility to parks and park safety. The effectiveness of the Park Prescription intervention in promoting physical activity, park use, as well as physical and mental well-being will be tested in a one-year Randomized Controlled Trial."
https://openalex.org/W2950770161,"Medical leadership is an increasingly important aspect of hospital management. By engaging physicians in leadership roles, hospitals aim to improve their clinical and financial performances. Research has revealed numerous factors that are regarded as necessary for ‘medical leaders’ to master, however we lack insights into their relative importance. This study investigates the views of healthcare professionals and managers on what they consider the most important factors for medical leadership. Physicians (n = 11), nurses (n = 10), laboratory technicians (n = 4) and managers (n = 14) were interviewed using Q methodology. Participants ranked 34 statements on factors elicited from the scientific literature, including personal features, context-specific features, activities and roles. By-person factor analysis revealed three distinct views of medical leadership. The first view represents a strategic leader who prioritizes the interests of the hospital by participating in hospital strategy and decision making. The second view describes a social leader with strong collaboration and communication skills. The third view reflects an accepted leader among peers that is guided by a clear job description. Despite these differences, all respondents agreed upon the importance of personal skills in collaboration and communication, and having integrity and a clear vision. We find no differences in views related to particular healthcare professionals, managers, or departments as all views were defined by a mixture of departments and participants. The findings contribute to increased calls from both practice and literature to increase conceptual clarity by eliciting the relative importance of medical leadership-related factors. Hospitals that wish to increase the engagement of physicians in improving clinical and financial performances through medical leadership should focus on selecting and developing leaders who are strong strategists, socially skilled and accepted by clinical peers."
https://openalex.org/W2951433765,"The increasing burden of chronic diseases associated with the ageing of the European population constitutes one of the main challenges for the welfare systems in developed western countries, especially through its impact on the use of hospital services and the cost of care. This study aims at evaluating the cost of hospital care for older adults living in the Lazio Region, Italy, according to their level of frailty.Since 2014 a longitudinal randomized cohort study has been carried out on a sample consisting of 1280 older adults aged over 64 years resident in the Lazio region (Italy), with their being evaluated for multidimensional frailty. Accesses to Hospital Services (acute care and Day Hospital care admissions and Emergency Room accesses) during the first year after enrolment, as well as the related costs have been recorded through a regional database. Costs have been stratified on the basis of the state of frailty.The analysis of hospital services and costs highlights the role played by pre-frail individuals who generated 49.3% of the hospital care cumulative costs. Hospital Admission (HA) costs arising from robust and pre-frail subjects are 70% of the total HA costs. Pre-frail individuals also showed the highest average HA cost per person/year (7062.89 Euros). The main determinant of the highest HA costs was given by the number of HAs during the follow-up (multivariate linear regression, ß coefficient = 0.319; p<0.001), which was higher among pre-frail individuals than in any other group of patients.Pre-frail individuals generated the highest cost for hospital care in a sample of representative subjects living in an Italian Region with a low rate of community care services, as is the case in the Lazio region. Assessment of the multidimensional frailty of older adults permits a better definition of the important target of the pre-frail population as the main category within which interventions to prevent or mitigate frailty should be carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2953012800,"An engineered metabolic pathway consisting of reactions that convert fatty acids to aldehydes and eventually alkanes would provide a means to produce biofuels from renewable energy sources. The enzyme aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) catalyzes the conversion of aldehydes and oxygen to alkanes and formic acid and uses oxygen and a cellular reductant such as ferredoxin (Fd) as co-substrates. In this report, we aimed to increase ADO-mediated alkane production by converting an unused by-product, formate, to a reductant that can be used by ADO. We achieved this by including the gene (fdh), encoding formate dehydrogenase from Xanthobacter sp. 91 (XaFDH), into a metabolic pathway expressed in Escherichia coli. Using this approach, we could increase bacterial alkane production, resulting in a conversion yield of ∼50%, the highest yield reported to date. Measuring intracellular nicotinamide concentrations, we found that E. coli cells harboring XaFDH have a significantly higher concentration of NADH and a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio than E. coli cells lacking XaFDH. In vitro analysis disclosed that ferredoxin (flavodoxin):NADP+ oxidoreductase could use NADH to reduce Fd and thus facilitate ADO-mediated alkane production. As formic acid can decrease the cellular pH, the addition of formate dehydrogenase could also maintain the cellular pH in the neutral range, which is more suitable for alkane production. We conclude that this simple, dual-pronged approach of increasing NAD(P)H and removing extra formic acid is efficient for increasing the production of renewable alkanes via synthetic biology-based approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2952495205,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, chronic disorder of unclear etiology with an underlying genetic predisposition. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified more than 200 IBD susceptibility loci, but the causes of IBD remain poorly defined. We hypothesized that rare (<0.1% population frequency) gene copy number variations (CNVs) could play an important mechanism for risk of IBD. We aimed to examine changes in DNA copy number in a population-based cohort of patients with IBD and search for novel genetic risk factors for IBD.DNA samples from 243 individuals with IBD from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and 2988 healthy controls were analyzed using genome-wide SNP microarray technology. Three CNV calling algorithms were applied to maximize sensitivity and specificity of CNV detection. We identified IBD-associated genes affected by rare CNV from comparing the number of overlapping CNVs in IBD samples with the number of overlapping CNVs in controls for each gene.4,402 CNVs detected by two or three algorithms intersected 7,061 genes, in at least one analyzed sample. Four genes (e.g. DUSP22 and IP6K3) intersected by rare deletions and fourteen genes (e.g. SLC25A10, PSPN, GTF2F1) intersected by rare duplications demonstrated significant association with IBD (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.01). Of these, ten genes were functionally related to immune response and intracellular signalling pathways. Some of these genes were also identified in other IBD related genome-wide association studies.

Using population-based administrative data from Ontario, Canada for the period 2003–2014, we applied a validated case definition to identify persons aged ≤18 years with multiple sclerosis. We identified up to 5 children without multiple sclerosis matched on sex, age, and region of residence. In each cohort, we determined annual rates of any hospitalization and physician services use. Using general linear models we compared utilization rates adjusting for age, sex, region, socioeconomic status and year. Subsequently, we limited the analysis to incident cases of multiple sclerosis and their matches, and compared rates of utilization in the year of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and the three years thereafter. We identified 659 youth with multiple sclerosis (428 incident cases), and 3,294 matched controls. Two-thirds of both cohorts were female. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and year, the multiple sclerosis cohort was more likely to be hospitalized than the matched cohort (odds ratio 15.2; 95%CI: 12.0, 19.1), and had higher rates of ambulatory physician visits (rate ratio 4.58; 95%CI: 4.26, 4.92). The odds of hospitalization (odds ratio 40.1; 95%CI: 27.1, 59.5) and physician visits (rate ratio 5.14; 95%CI: 4.63, 5.71) were markedly elevated in the year of MS diagnosis, declining thereafter but remaining elevated versus the matched cohort. Children with multiple sclerosis have substantially elevated rates of health care utilization as compared to matched children without multiple sclerosis, over calendar time and throughout the early disease course."
https://openalex.org/W2951999264,"Targeted therapies have become the focus of much of the cancer therapy research conducted in the United States. While these therapies have made vast improvements in the treatment of cancer, their results have been somewhat disappointing due to acquired resistances, high cost, and limited populations of susceptible patients. As a result, targeted therapeutics are often combined with other targeted therapeutics or chemotherapies. Compounds which target more than one cancer related pathway are rare, but have the potential to synergize multiple components of therapeutic cocktails. Natural products, as opposed to targeted therapies, typically interact with multiple cellular targets simultaneously, making them a potential source of synergistic cancer treatments. In this study, a rare natural product, deacetylnemorone, was shown to inhibit cell growth in a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines, selectively induce cell death in melanoma cells, and inhibit angiogenesis and invasion. Combined, these results demonstrate that deacetylnemorone affects multiple cancer-related targets associated with tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis. Thus, the multi-targeting natural product, deacetylnemorone, has the potential to enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments as well as reduce commonly acquired treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2950790440,"Schizophrenia has been consistently characterized by abnormal patterns of gene down-regulation, increased restrictive chromatin assemblies, and reduced transcriptional activity. Histone methyltransferase (HMT) mRNA and H3K9me2 levels are elevated in postmortem brain and peripheral blood cells of persons with schizophrenia. Moreover, this epigenomic state likely contributes to the disease, as HMT levels correlate with clinical symptomatology. This manuscript sought to establish the potential therapeutic value of the HMT inhibitor BIX-01294 (BIX). Human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 24 individuals with schizophrenia and 24 healthy individuals were cultured in the presence of BIX (5uM or 10uM). Mice were given once daily intraperitoneal injections of BIX (0.5 or 1mg/kg) for one week. Cultured cells, mouse cortex, or striatum was harvested, RNA extracted and RT-PCR conducted for several schizophrenia candidate genes: IL-6, Gad1, Nanog, KLF4, Reln, and Bdnf9a. Total H3K9me2 levels were measured using western blot while H3K9me2 binding to selected genes of interest was conducted using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Neuronal subtype-specific BDNF conditional knockdown was conducted using the cre/lox system of mutant animals. Treatment with BIX decreased H3K9me2 and increased selected mRNA levels in cultured PBMCs from both normal controls and participants with schizophrenia. In mice, peripheral administration of BIX decreased cortical H3K9me2 levels and increased schizophrenia candidate gene expression. In BDNF conditional knockdown animals, BIX administration was able to significantly rescue Bdnf9a mRNA levels in ChAT and D1 Bdnf conditional knockdown mice. The results presented in this manuscript demonstrate a potential for further research into the clinical effectiveness of histone modifying pharmacology in the treatment of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2953029112,"There is growing interest to restore oyster populations and develop oyster reefs for their role in ecosystem health and delivery of ecosystem services. Successful and sustainable oyster restoration efforts largely depend on the availability and selection of suitable sites that can support long-term growth and survival of oysters. Hence, in the present study a habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed for the intertidal rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata), with special attention: (1) to the role of the monsoon in the suitability of oyster habitats, and (2) to identify potential suitable sites along the south-eastern Bangladesh coast. Seven habitat factors were used as input variables for the HSI model: (1) water temperature; (2) salinity; (3) dissolved oxygen; (4) particulate inorganic matter (PIM); (5) pH; (6) Chlorophyll-a; and (7) water flow velocity. Seven field surveys were conducted at 80 locations to collect geo-spatial environmental data, which were then used to determine HSI scores using habitat suitability functions. The model results showed that the areas suitable (HSI >0.50) for oyster settlement and growth were characterized by relatively high salinities, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and pH values. In contrast, freshwater dominated estuaries and nearby coastal areas with high suspended sediment were found less suitable (HSI <0.50) for oysters. HSI model results were validated with observed oyster distribution data. There was strong correlation between the HSI calculated by the model and observed oyster densities (r = 0.87; n = 53), shell height (r = 0.95; n = 53) and their condition index (r = 0.98; n = 53). The good correspondence with field data enhances the applicability of the HSI model as a quantitative tool for evaluating the quality of a site for oyster restoration and culture."

Method Cross-cultural adaptation followed a combination of guidelines and for psychometric evaluation a sample of 107 athletes as recruited. All recommended measurement properties by the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments were evaluated, including face, structural, convergent, and discriminant validity; reproducibility; distribution-based responsiveness, and interpretability. We also used a structured content analytic method to evaluate content validity. Results The tool presented excellent internal consistency (α = 0.92) and reliability (ICC 0.75–0.98), and good convergent validity compared with Lower Extremity Functional Scale (ρ = 0.67). For reproducibility testing: Minimal detectable change ranged from 0.41 to 6.0 points; for responsiveness assessment: the effect sizes were large (Glass’Δ range 2.03–2.08, Cohen’s d range 2.22 to 2.53) and the Area under the Curve was 0.869. Its unidimensionality was proved by a 1-factor solution explaining 63.8% of the variance. Conclusion The Arabic version of Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool presented acceptable psychometric properties comparable to the original version. The questionnaire is understood across most of the Arabic speaking world and can be used in research and clinical practice to assess patients suffering from chronic ankle instability."
https://openalex.org/W2952854189,"Introduction Primary HIV infection (PHI) is the initial phase after HIV acquisition characterized by high viral replication, massive inflammatory response and irreversible immune-damage, particularly at the gastrointestinal level. In this study we aimed to characterize the dynamics of gastrointestinal damage biomarkers during the different phases of HIV infection and assess their association with HIV-disease markers and their accuracy to differentiate PHI from chronic HIV infection (CHI). Methods PHI-individuals (n = 57) were identified as HIV-seronegative/HIV-RNA positive and were followed up for one year at the Manhiça District Hospital in Mozambique. Ten plasma and 12 stool biomarkers were quantified by Luminex or ELISA and levels were compared to CHI-naive (n = 26), CHI on antiretroviral-treatment (ART; n = 30) and HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 58). Regression models adjusted by time point were used to estimate the association of the biomarkers with HIV-disease markers. Receiver operating curves were compared for the best accuracy to distinguish PHI from CHI. Results Soluble (s)CD14 was significantly associated with the CD4/CD8 ratio (P < 0.05) and viremia levels (P < 0.0001) during PHI. Plasma zonulin and stool lactoferrin were significantly higher in PHI as compared to CHI-individuals (P < 0.05). Plasma zonulin demonstrated the best accuracy to identify PHI among HIV-infected individuals (AUC = 0.85 [95% CI 0.75–0.94]). Using a cutoff value of plasma zonulin ≥ 8.75 ng/mL the model identified PHI with 87.7% sensitivity (95% CI 76.3–94.9) and 69.2% specificity (95% CI 48.2–85.7). An adjusted multivariate model including age, plasma zonulin and sCD14 further increased the classification performance (AUC = 0.92 [95% CI 0.86–0.99]). Conclusions While the stool biomarkers did not provide any predictive ability to distinguish PHI from CHI-individuals, plasma sCD14 and zonulin were significantly associated with HIV-disease markers and PHI identification, respectively. These inflammatory biomarkers may be useful to monitor changes in gastrointestinal integrity during HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2949373914,"Nigerians depend on fish for maintaining diverse and healthy diets. Fish are a key source of protein and micronutrients, both of which are important for healthy diets. Some research has shown that forests provide important ecosystem functions that support the productive capacity and sustainability of inland fisheries. Our study aims to empirically assess the relationship between forest cover around rivers and fish consumption. We use data from the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and spatially merge household and village data with forest cover and river maps. We estimate the relationship between forest cover around rivers and average village fresh fish consumption, while also accounting for other socio-economic and geographical determinants. We find that that the density of forest cover around rivers is positively and significantly correlated with village consumption of fresh fish. Our results suggest that forests influence the consumption of fresh fish by improving the productivity of inland fisheries and increasing the availability of fish. Aquatic habitats tend to be overlooked in debates on land use and food production, and yet can be critically important sources of nutrient-rich foods that are limited in rural diets in developing countries, particularly for the poor. Clearing forests for agriculture in order to produce more agricultural crops might have the unintended consequence of reducing another important food source."

The findings of the research show that self-congruity influences the perceived social value; the perceived social value leads to satisfaction and the creation of interpersonal connections in virtual social networks; and the interpersonal connections in virtual social networks influence the use of these tools by Generation Y travelers.
https://openalex.org/W2949429540,"Resilience theory aims to understand and predict ecosystem state changes resulting from disturbances. Non-native species are ubiquitous in ecological communities and integrated into many described ecological interaction networks, including mutualisms. By altering the fitness landscape and rewiring species interactions, such network invasion may carry important implications for ecosystem resistance and resilience under continued environmental change. Here, I hypothesize that the tendency of established non-native species to be generalists may make them more likely than natives to occupy central network roles and may link them to the resistance and resilience of the overall network. I use a quantitative research synthesis of 58 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks, along with extinction simulations, to examine the roles of known non-natives in networks. I show that non-native species in networks enhance network redundancy and may thereby bolster the ecological resistance or functional persistence of ecosystems in the face of disturbance. At the same time, non-natives are unlikely to partner with specialist natives, thus failing to support the resilience of native species assemblages. Non-natives significantly exceed natives in network centrality, normalized degree, and Pollination Service Index. Networks containing non-natives exhibit lower connectance, more links on average, and higher generality and vulnerability than networks lacking non-natives. As environmental change progresses, specialists are particularly likely to be impacted, reducing species diversity in many communities and network types. This work implies that functional diversity may be retained but taxonomic diversity decline as non-native species become established in networks worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2950227120,"Two-hybrid systems can be used for investigating protein-protein interactions and may provide important information about gene products with unknown function. Despite their success in mapping protein interactions, two-hybrid systems have remained mostly untouched by improvements in next-generation DNA sequencing. The two-hybrid systems rely on one-versus-all methods in which each bait is sequentially screened against an entire library. Here, we developed a screening method that joins both bait and prey as a convergent fusion into one bacterial plasmid vector that can then be amplified and paired-end sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our method enables all-versus-all sequencing (AVA-Seq) and utilizes NGS to remove multiple bottlenecks of the two-hybrid system. AVA-Seq allows for high-resolution protein-protein interaction mapping of a small set of proteins and has the potential for lower-resolution mapping of entire proteomes. Features of the system include ORF selection to improve efficiency, high bacterial transformation efficiency, a convergent fusion vector to allow paired-end sequencing of interactors, and the use of protein fragments rather than full-length proteins to better resolve specific protein contact points. We demonstrate the system's strengths and limitations on a set of proteins known to interact in humans and provide a framework for future large-scale projects."

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods."

Our objectives were to examine how fish culture in TWW affected fish growth and fitness, as well as compliance with the international standards for safe consumption. Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) fingerlings were reared in 0%, 50% and 100% tertiary TWW (TTWW), from the age of five days, for a period of four months. In water analyses, 33 out of 67 tested organic micropollutants (OMPs) were detected in the TTWW samples at least once, at concentrations that are typically reported in domestic TTWW. Fish survival ranged between 77–80% and did not differ between treatment groups. Fish growth and mortality following challenge infection with Tetrahymena sp. (which ranged between 64–68%), were similar among treatment groups. Of tested immunological parameters, lysozyme and anti-protease was similar among treatments while complement activity was highest in the 50% TTWW-reared fish. No abnormalities were observed in the histopathological analysis. Levels of heavy metals, polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorines (OCs) in fish were below the detection limit and below the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Union EU maximal permitted levels in food fish. Results suggest that the yield of fish grown in TTWW is potentially similar to that in freshwater, and the produced fish comply with the standards of consumer safety. The results are in line with previous studies that examined the feasibility of TWW-fed aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2950207878,"The study shows the feasibility of predicting firms' expenditures in innovation, as reported in the Community Innovation Survey, applying a supervised machine-learning approach on a sample of Italian firms. Using an integrated dataset of administrative records and balance sheet data, designed to include all informative variables related to innovation but also easily accessible for most of the cohort, random forest algorithm is implemented to obtain a classification model aimed to identify firms that are potential innovation performers. The performance of the classifier, estimated in terms of AUC, is 0.794. Although innovation investments do not always result in patenting, the model is able to identify 71.92% of firms with patents. More encouraging results emerge from the analysis of the inner working of the model: predictors identified as most important-such as firm size, sector belonging and investment in intangible assets-confirm previous findings of literature, but in a completely different framework. The outcomes of this study are considered relevant for both economic analysts, because it demonstrates the potential of data-driven models for understanding the nature of innovation behaviour, and practitioners, such as policymakers or venture capitalists, who can benefit by evidence-based tools in the decision-making process."
https://openalex.org/W2951146986,"Bodily states are fundamental to emotions’ emergence and are believed to constitute the first step in the chain of events that culminate in emotional awareness. Recent works have shown that distinct topographical maps can be derived to describe how basic and more complex emotions are represented in the body. However, it is still unclear whether these bodily maps can also extend to emotions experienced specifically within social interactions and how these representations relate to basic emotions. To address this issue, we used the emBODY tool to obtain high-resolution bodily maps that describe the body activation and deactivation experienced by healthy participants when presented with social scenarios depicting establishment or loss of social bonds. We observed patterns of activation/deactivation for each single social scenario depending on the valence, but also a common activation of head, chest and deactivation of limbs for positive and negative social scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we show that these maps are comparable to those obtained when taking the perspective of a third person, suggesting the existence of common body representation of social emotions for the self and other person evaluation. Finally, we showed that maps related to complex social scenarios are strongly correlated with bodily states experienced in basic emotions, suggesting that the patterns of body activation/deactivation observed for social scenarios might arise from a complex interaction of the basic emotions that these experiences elicit."
https://openalex.org/W2953310775,"Early life adversity (ELA) negatively affects health behaviors in adulthood, but pathways from ELA exposure to behavioral outcomes are poorly understood. ELA in childhood and adolescence may translate into adult outcomes by way of modified glucocorticoid signaling. The cortisol cotransporter, FKBP5 has a G-to-A substitution (rs9296158) that hinders cortisol trafficking within target cells, and this impaired glucocorticoid signaling may shape the long-term response to ELA. We used performance on the Stroop test to assess working memory in 546 healthy young adults who had experienced 0, 1, or > 1 forms of ELA in childhood and adolescence and were genotyped for the FKBP5 rs9296158 G-to-A polymorphism. We observed a robust Gene x Environment interaction (F = 9.49, p < .0001) in which increased ELA exposure led to progressively greater Stroop interference in persons carrying AG and AA genotypes of FKBP5 with no such effect in GG carriers. Further work is needed to explore the modification of cognitive function resulting from ELA. Impairments in working memory illustrate how ELA may use glucocorticoid pathways to influence working memory with potential implications for decision-making and risky behavior including substance use disorders."

The crystal structure of PPEP-1 revealed a gluzincin metallopeptidase that showed a high degree of similarity to the peptidase domain of the anthrax lethal factor (LF) endopeptidase even though the sequence identity between both proteins was found to be low (21%) (Fig. 1) (10Schacherl M.

A crystal structure of the inactive double mutant PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F) bound to a substrate peptide showed that PPEP-1 binds its substrate in a unique double-kinked manner. The first kink is at position P1′, whereas the second kink occurs at P2′. This unusual double-kinked conformation is dictated by a unique loop of PPEP-1, called the diverting loop. Another unusual structural feature of PPEP-1 is the so-called S-loop, which is located above the substrate-binding groove (Fig. 1). An NMR structure (11Rubino J.T. Martinelli M. Cantini F.

It was shown that it is a critical structural element required for proteolytic activity (11Rubino J.T. Martinelli M. Cantini F. Castagnetti A. Leuzzi R. Banci L. Scarselli M. Structural characterization of zinc-bound Zmp1, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease secreted by Clostridium difficile.J. Biol. Inorg.

Together with other structural features such as the edge strand, the active-site helix, the diverting loop, and the gluzincin-specific helix carrying the third zinc ligand Glu-185, the S-loop forms a narrow hydrophobic tunnel around the substrate peptide at positions P1–P1′ (Fig. 1). This architecture explains why PPEP-1 accepts only small aliphatic amino acids there. To uncover the exact underlying molecular reasons for the unique specificity of PPEP-1 and its catalytic determinants, we investigated its substrate-binding and hydrolysis mechanism in more detail using structural information and enzyme kinetics. We describe the importance of the S-loop for proteolytic activity, providing evidence for its dual role in substrate binding and catalysis. We also investigated the preference of PPEP-1 for prolines at positions P1 and P1′ and explained the specificity of PPEP-1 at position P1′. For the determination of kinetic parameters, we established a steady-state kinetic assay using a set of internally quenched fluorogenic peptides (Table 1) containing the natural consensus recognition sequence of PPEP-1 derived from the cleavage sites in CD2831/CD3246 (VVNX↓X′VPPS). Depending on the peptide, positions P1 (X) and P1′ (X′) were filled with an alanine or proline residue. These peptides will be denoted from hereafter by their P1 and P1′ residues, e.g. Abz-AP-Dnp for the internally quenched fluorogenic peptide Abz-DVVNAPVPPSK(Dnp)DD peptide (Table 1). Shorter and nonfluorescently labeled peptides used for crystallization are denoted in the same way, e.g. AP-pep for Ac-VVNAPVPP-CONH2 (Table 2).Table 1Sequences of Abz/Dnp internally quenched fluorogenic peptidesNamePositionN543211′2′3′4′5′6′7′8′CAbz-PP-DnpAbzAspValValAsnProProValProProSerLys*AspAspCONH2Abz-PA-DnpAbzAspValValAsnProAlaValProProSerLys*AspAspCONH2Abz-AP-DnpAbzAspValValAsnAlaProValProProSerLys*AspAspCONH2AA position12345678910111213 Open table in a new tab Table 2Sequences of peptides used for cocrystallizationNamePositionNP4P3P2P1P1′P2′P3′CPP-pepAcGluValAsnProProValProCONH2PA-pepAcGluValAsnProAlaValProCONH2AP-pepAcGluValAsnAlaProValProCONH2APP-pepAcGluValAlaProProValProCONH2AA position1234567 Open table in a new tab Correction of the raw data for inner-filter effects (12Gauthier T.D.

Because the “trans” conformation of the proline residues is required for cleavage by PPEP-1, conformational homogeneity of the different substrate peptides is crucial. To ensure no significant differences in the substrates because of variations in the cis/trans isomer of proline residues, we analyzed the substrate peptides via NMR. We observed different conformers for all peptides. In the case of the peptide Abz-AP-Dnp, the major conformer with all X-Pro peptide bonds in the trans conformation accounted for 92% of all species. For peptides Abz-PP-Dnp and Abz-AP-Dnp, we could not reliably quantify the ratio between the different conformers because of overlapping signals (Figs. S2–S4). Therefore, we analyzed the shorter peptides PP-pep, AP-pep, and PA-pep (Table 2). Approximately 85% of each peptide occurred in the “all-trans” conformation (Table S1–S3), confirming that Ala/Pro substitutions have no significant impact on the ratio of cis/trans conformations. PPEP-1 had a Km value of 137 μm and a kcat value of 4.3 s−1 for the substrate Abz-PP-Dnp (Fig. 2A). In comparison, the Km value for Abz-AP-Dnp was 43.6 μm, and the kcat was 1.26 s−1. As a result, the catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, toward Abz-PP-Dnp and Abz-AP-Dnp was almost identical, 30,000 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, for Abz-PA-Dnp the Km of PPEP-1 was 82.5 μm with a kcat value of 0.87 s−1. Thus, the resulting catalytic efficiency of about 10,000 m−1 s−1 was 3-fold lower compared with Abz-PP-Dnp, showing that PPEP-1 was more selective for a proline residue at position P1′. Interestingly, although the Km value was only slightly reduced compared with the parent Abz-PP-Dnp, the turnover number, kcat, was severely diminished. To identify the structural basis of the observed kinetic differences, the structures of the inactive double mutant PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F) cocrystallized with peptides PA-pep and AP-pep (Table 2) were determined at 1.90 and 1.39 Å resolution, respectively (Table S4). The peptides PA-pep and AP-pep were well-defined in the electron density maps. However, no electron density was found at the expected position of the Zn2+ ion, revealing that the protein was unintentionally cocrystallized in its apo form (i.e. without Zn2+). The conformations of AP-pep and PA-pep were found to be very similar to that of PP-pep (Fig. 2B). The two kinks described earlier for PP-pep were also observed for PA-pep. However, at the scissile bond and at the primed sites the positioning of the substrate peptide was different. Although the backbone torsion angles Φ (−63°) und Ψ (+160°) of the P1′ alanine residue in PA-pep could also be adopted by a proline (13Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Structure validation by Cα geometry: φ,ψ and Cβ deviation.Proteins. 2003; 50 (12557186): 437-45010.1002/prot.10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar), the newly introduced NH amide proton of the alanine at the P1′ position in PA-pep formed an additional hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-115 located in the edge strand (Fig. 2C). As a consequence, the backbone of residues P1′ and P2′ was shifted by 1 Å (5 times the r.m.s.d. of the global backbone alignment) toward the N-terminal part of the edge strand in the PA-pep structure. This resulted in a sharper kink at the P1′ residue (Fig. 2D). The angle of the second kink of the PA-pep was very similar to those of AP-pep and PP-pep. This shift of the scissile peptide bond away from the metal ion–binding site in the PA-pep complex could explain the reduced kcat of PPEP-1(WT) in the case of the substrate Abz-PA-Dnp. To confirm that the substrate binding was not significantly influenced by the absence of the Zn2+ ion, cocrystallization experiments were repeated in the presence of 0.1 mm ZnCl2. With PP-pep and PA-pep, only crystals of zinc-bound PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F) in complex with the unprimed fragment Ac-EVNP, i.e. the N-terminal cleavage product of the substrate peptides, were obtained (Tables S4 and S5). The reason for this was probably the remaining very low residual proteolytic activity of this PPEP-1 variant. However, a crystal structure of zinc-bound PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F) with uncleaved AP-pep was obtained (Table S5). The substrate peptide as well as the Zn2+ ion was well-resolved (Fig. 2E), and the binding mode was exactly the same as without the Zn2+ ion. A comparison of the situation found in PPEP-1 with the related proteases thermolysin and anthrax LF, of which both do not prefer proline residues at the P1′ position, reveals some interesting aspects (Fig. 3). Notably, the hydrogen bond of the main-chain amide of the P1′ residue to the edge strand was also present in the structure of thermolysin in complexes with a substrate-mimicking inhibitor (PDB code 4N4E (14Krimmer S.G. Betz M. Heine A. Klebe G.

Biol. 2004; 11 (14718924): 60-6610.1038/nsmb708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). In thermolysin and LF, there is also an interaction of the scissile-bond NH group with Asn-112 and Ser-655, respectively. The corresponding residue in PPEP-1 is Val-113, which is, as the following edge strand, shifted away by about 1 Å from the catalytic zinc ion compared with the equivalent residues in thermolysin and LF. This shift of the edge strand and the displacement of the valine residue in PPEP-1 were required to fit a proline residue at position P1′. Thermolysin and LF barely accepted substrates with a P1′ proline (15Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Jarrell E.T. Leppla S.H. Collier R.J. Liddington R.C. Cantley L.C.

In contrast, substrates with residues other than proline at the P1′ position are, upon binding to PPEP-1, translated by about 1 Å away from the catalytic zinc ion, leading to less efficient hydrolysis. In cocrystal structures of PPEP-1(E143/Y178F) with PP-pep, PA-pep, and AP-pep, the ε-amino group of Lys-101 in the S-loop was found to interact with the γ-carboxyl groups of Glu-184 and Glu-185 as well as with the oxygen atom of the asparagine β-amide group at position P2 (Asn-3*). Hereafter, we refer to this interface as the KEEN interface. The KEEN interface explains the strong preference of PPEP-1 for asparagine residues at substrate position P2 and was the only notable interaction of the S-loop with the lower rim of the substrate-binding cleft in the closed conformation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, with the participation of Glu-185, this interface was directly linked to the coordination chemistry of the catalytic Zn2+ ion. To clarify these interactions, structural and kinetic investigations were carried out using mutants where Lys-101 was replaced by alanine, glutamate, or arginine. Crystal structures of the K101A and K101R mutants were determined at a resolution of 2.02 and 1.80 Å, respectively (Table S6). There were no major changes compared with the WT (PDB code 5A0P). The arginine residue in one protomer of the K101R mutant interacts with Glu-184 as expected. In the other protomer, it is displaced by a crystal contact. As in most other substrate peptide-free and zinc-bound structures, a Tris molecule from the buffer was coordinated to the catalytic zinc ion. The specific activities of the K101A and K101E mutants against all three substrates, Abz-PP-Dnp, Abz-PA-Dnp, and Abz-AP-Dnp, were dramatically reduced (Fig. 4B), whereas the K101R mutant had a similar activity to the WT (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the exchange of Glu-184 led to a strong reduction in activity. PPEP-1(E184K) showed only a residual activity against all three Abz/Dnp peptides (Fig. 4B), whereas the mutation E184A caused a decline in activity for Abz-PP-Dnp and Abz-AP-Dnp by 85 and 91%, respectively. Only a very small residual activity of 1.2% could be detected for Abz-PA-Dnp. The double mutation K101E/E184K could not restore the activity of the respective single mutants, probably because only two of the four interaction partners were swapped and/or the positive charge of the protonated lysine side chain was moved further away from the catalytic zinc ion. Crystal structures of the E184A, E184K, and E184K/K101E mutants had no major changes compared with the WT. However, both independent protomers of E184K and E184K/K101E are in the closed conformation. To analyze the role of the KEEN interaction interface with regard to the proteolytic mechanism, the kinetic parameters of PPEP-1(E184A) in the presence of the Abz-PP-Dnp substrate were determined. Compared with the WT, the E184A mutant had a 3.6-fold reduced kcat value, whereas Km remained unchanged (Fig. 4C), thus suggesting that the KEEN interface is important for efficient catalysis. To investigate the structural effects of the E184A mutation, the triple mutant PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F/E184A) was cocrystallized with PP-pep and AP-pep. Crystals of PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F/E184A) with PP-pep diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 Å (Table S7). The substitution was clearly visible in the electron density map, whereas the side chain of Lys-101 was only poorly resolved in both protomers, thus indicating that its interactions with Glu-185 and the substrate peptide’s Asn-3* were strongly reduced (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, despite disruption of the KEEN interface, the S-loops of both PPEP-1 protomers were nevertheless found in the closed conformation. This indicates that other interactions between substrate peptide and the S-loop suffice for loop closure. PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F/E184A) in complex with AP-pep yielded a different orthorhombic crystal form (Table S4). All four protomers in the asymmetric unit were similar to the structure of this triple mutant in complex with the PP-pep peptide. The KEEN interaction interface was again disrupted with a disordered side chain of Lys-101 in all four protomers, thus confirming that the E184A mutation strongly reduced the interaction of Lys-101 with Glu-185 and Asn-3*. To assess the influence of the asparagine residue at position P2 in PPEP-1 substrates on the formation of the KEEN interaction interface, PPEP-1(E143A/Y178F) was cocrystallized with substrate peptide APP-pep in which the canonical asparagine residue Asn-3* at the P2 position was replaced by an alanine (Tables 2 and S8). APP-pep was bound to PPEP-1 in a conformation identical to that observed for PP-pep. This suggested that the asparagine side chain was not required for proper positioning of the substrate. Furthermore, the electron density of the side chain of Lys-101 was fully defined in both PPEP-1 protomers present in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4D). Lys-101 was also bound here to the γ-carboxylate groups of Glu-184 and Glu-185, indicating that an asparagine residue at the substrate P2 was not strictly required for this interaction, although it probably contributed to its stability. PPEP-1 has been reported to cleave in vitro IgA1/IgA2, Hsp90β, and fibrinogen at noncanonical recognition sequences (1Cafardi V. Biagini M. Martinelli M. Leuzzi R. Rubino J.T. Cantini F. Norais N.

They are therefore commonly used for the production of these high-value sugars. This study presents the recombinant production, together with biochemical and structural data, of the NAL from the psychrophilic bacterium Aliivibrio salmonicida LFI1238 (AsNAL). Our characterization shows that AsNAL possesses high activity and stability at alkaline pH. We confirm that these properties allow for the use in a one-pot reaction at alkaline pH for the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, the most common sialic acid) from the inexpensive precursor N-acetylglucosamine. We also show that the enzyme has a cold active nature with an optimum temperature for Neu5Ac synthesis at 20°C. The equilibrium constant for the reaction was calculated at different temperatures, and the formation of Neu5Ac acid is favored at low temperatures, making the cold active enzyme a well-suited candidate for use in such exothermic reactions. The specific activity is high compared to the homologue from Escherichia coli at three tested temperatures, and the enzyme shows a higher catalytic efficiency and turnover number for cleavage at 37°C. Mutational studies reveal that amino acid residue Asn 168 is important for the high kcat. The crystal structure of AsNAL was solved to 1.65 Å resolution and reveals a compact, tetrameric protein similar to other NAL structures. The data presented provides a framework to guide further optimization of its application in sialic acid production and opens the possibility for further design of the enzyme."

Additionally, the defect of an exo1-K185A mutant in duplex digestion was partially rescued by longer overhanging DNA. However, we noted that the enhanced Exo1 nuclease activity by longer overhanging DNA is largely eliminated by replication protein A (RPA), likely because of the previously reported RPA activity that strips Exo1 off the ssDNA.

The functions of Exo1 are largely fulfilled via its 5′-to-3′ dsDNA exonuclease activity, which is capable of digesting a 5′ end embedded in a double-strand break or a gapped or nicked duplex. In mismatch repair, Exo1 removes long tracts of DNA, including the mispaired nucleotide (2Genschel J. Modrich P. Mechanism of 5′-directed excision in human mismatch repair.Mol.

The crystal structure of the human EXO1 (hEXO1) catalytic core (1–352) in complex with its substrate DNA has been solved, which elucidated the molecular details of the Exo1 nuclease reaction. Based on the crystal structures, hEXO1 has been proposed to accommodate substrates subjected to both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic digestion with a well-superimposed conformation, catalyzing both reactions with the same catalytic center (21Orans J.

Interestingly, binding of hEXO1 to the duplex region of its substrate DNA was captured as the first snapshot in a further time-resolved crystallography study (22Shi Y. Hellinga H.W. Beese L.S.

However, this premise remains to be tested in functional assays. Besides duplex and 5′ flap DNA, Exo1 is also able to degrade ssDNA (11Cannavo E. Cejka P. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Niu H. Sung P. Klein H.L. Avoidance of ribonucleotide-induced mutations by RNase H2 and Srs2-Exo1 mechanisms.Nature. 2014; 511 (24896181): 251-25410.1038/nature13292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The drastic difference between a regular oligonucleotide and a poly(dT) as substrate for Exo1, however, provides a unique system to define the mechanism of Exo1 activation. Here, with this system, we determined that Exo1 is highly versatile in capturing transient hairpin structures with a stem size of 4 bp or longer, which, in turn, activates Exo1 to digest ssDNA via a combination of endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic mechanisms. The available hEXO1 crystal structures led us to further identify a highly conserved lysine 185 from hEXO1/Exo1, which interacts with the phosphate group bridging the third and fourth nucleotide on the digestion strand of the substrate DNA. Importantly, the corresponding lysine-to-alanine mutation of Lys185 not only disrupted ssDNA digestion by Exo1 but also largely impaired Exo1-catalyzed digestion of a duplex DNA and failed to fully complement the CPT sensitivity of exo1Δ in yeast. Thus, duplex contact by Exo1 is a general mechanism to control Exo1 activation. Exo1 has been reported to digest regular ssDNA substrates (11Cannavo E. Cejka P. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Recombinant budding yeast Exo1 with a WT coding sequence is poorly expressed in Escherichia coli; hence, current biochemical studies employ either insect cells or yeast as the host system to express and purify recombinant Exo1 (4Fiorentini P.

By codon-optimizing Exo1’s primary coding sequence, we managed to express and purify the full-length Exo1 and a nuclease-dead mutant, exo1-D173A, from E. coli (Fig. S1A).

Moreover, poly(dA), poly(dT), poly(dC), and poly(dG) oligonucleotides were all refractory to Exo1 digestion (Fig. S1B). Thus, ssDNA digestion by Exo1 is not simply due to its preference to cleave at a certain nucleotide. A titration of Exo1 on 3′ end–labeled H80 revealed intermediates that gradually decreased in size (Fig. 1A) and clustered between 7 and 22 nt from the 5′ end of H80. With an increasing amount of Exo1, the digestion reached as far as ∼ 7 nt toward the 3′ end. Sequence analysis of the H80 oligonucleotide revealed two relative stable hairpins, each with a stem region of 5 bp in length (Fig. 1B). One hairpin is located at the very 3′ end of H80. The other hairpin, with a stem size of 5 bp plus a G-A mismatch within the stem, is located between 8 and 23 nt from the 5′ end (Fig. 1B), a position where the digestion intermediates proximal to the 5′ end were clustered. Importantly, deletion of 40 bases from the 3′ end of H80 or replacing them with thymidine nucleotides, which remove the 3′ hairpin and result in H40 and H40–40T oligonucleotides, respectively, limited the bulk of digestion to a position prior to the end of 5′ hairpin (Fig. 1A). Thus, in Exo1-catalyzed ssDNA degradation, an embedded hairpin is important to trigger Exo1 digestion of its 5′ upstream DNA. When the digestion of 3′ end-labeled H80 by Exo1 was examined closely, the step size of intermediates showed a mixture of both endo- and exonucleolytic cleavage events (Fig. 1A). To confirm this, H80, H40–40T, and H40 were 5′ end–labeled and tested for their initial cleavage by Exo1. For H80 and H40–40T, both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic products were detected, with the major endonucleolytic cleavage sites located in the 5′ hairpin loop of H80 and H40–40T (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, unlike H40–40T, deletion of the 3′ hairpin in H40 not only decreased the overall reaction rate but also caused a nearly 3-fold reduction in endonucleolytic product formation (Fig. 1C). Notably, the only difference between H40–40T and H40 is the length of 3′ ssDNA adjoining the 5′ hairpin, where a longer 3′ ssDNA in H40–40T stimulates hairpin-activated ssDNA cleavage by Exo1. human EXO1 is a threading enzyme for endonucleolytic digestion, where a 5′ flap needs to thread through the binding pocket for its cleavage (22Shi Y. Hellinga H.W. Beese L.S. Interplay of catalysis, fidelity, threading, and processivity in the exo- and endonucleolytic reactions of human exonuclease I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28533382): 6010-601510.1073/pnas.1704845114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding of streptavidin to a 3′-biotinylated (dT)40 oligonucleotide, which presumably traps Exo1 on ssDNA, did not activate its digestion by Exo1 (Fig. S1C). Therefore, the hairpin-activated Exo1 cleavage of ssDNA is not simply due to hairpin-mediated pausing of Exo1 during its ssDNA threading. Alternatively, we surmise that a transient duplex region donated by the embedded hairpin may facilitate Exo1 loading. Therefore, EMSAs were conducted with exo1-D173A, a nuclease-dead version of Exo1, to avoid substrate digestion. Under physiological salt conditions (150 mm KCl), tight binding of exo1-D173A to ssDNA was observed, with a low nanomolar apparent Kd (Fig. 1D). Importantly, exo1-D173A displayed a nearly 2-fold higher affinity for the hairpin-forming H80 over (dT)80 (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the hairpin structures embedded in ssDNA likely facilitate its complex formation with Exo1. Hairpins in H80 have a maximum stem size of 5 bp and are likely dynamic but sufficient for Exo1 to capture. To further characterize the transient nature of DNA hairpins utilized by Exo1, ssDNA substrates with more defined hairpins were constructed, where three, four, or six adenine nucleotide runs were engineered proximal to the 3′ end of a (dT)35 oligonucleotide to allow formation of hairpin DNA but with the potential of various loop sizes (Fig. 2A). As a control, a fixed hairpin DNA (3′-6GC) based on six G-C pairs was also designed (Fig. 2A). Consistent with an early report where the presence of a hairpin strongly interrupts heteroduplex formation (28Gao Y. Wolf L.K. Georgiadis R.M. Secondary structure effects on DNA hybridization kinetics: a solution versus surface comparison.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (16822858): 3370-337710.1093/nar/gkl422Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), minimal interstrand pairing was observed when the 5′ end–labeled oligonucleotides were analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. S2A). Upon their incubation with Exo1, little reaction was observed with 3′-3A (Fig. 2B). Digestion occurred on 3′-4A and 3′-6A, with both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic products detected. The 3′-6A substrate is around 2-fold more reactive than the 3′-4A substrate (Fig. 2B). Notably, on the 3′-6GC substrate with a fixed hairpin, exonucleolytic digestion is considerably less compared with 3′-4A and 3′-6A (Fig. 2B). We surmise that the 5′ Ts in 3′-4A and 3′-6A may pair with the As at the 3′ end to promote exonucleolytic digestion, which would not occur in 3′-6GC. To summarize, the results suggest that a hairpin with a stem size of 4 bp or longer in ssDNA is able to trigger its cleavage by Exo1. To find the endpoint of Exo1 digestion on hairpin-containing ssDNA, we installed a series of adenine nucleotide runs 3 nt away from the 5′ end of a (dT)35 oligonucleotide, which allows potential hairpin formation proximal to the 5′ end of ssDNA (Fig. S2B). Again, minimal digestion occurred on the 5′-3A substrate. With the 5′-4A substrate, the major products observed are single and dinucleotide removal (Fig. S2B). Increasing the insertion length to six As drives the cleavage to 5–6 nt from the 5′ end, with three or four As retained (Fig. S2B). Further increasing the insertion length to eight As extends the cleavage to 6–7 nt from the 5′ end, with four or five As retained (Fig. S2B). These results, again, confirm the minimal requirement of a 4-bp stem length to activate Exo1. Second, hairpin-activated ssDNA digestion by Exo1 is limited prior to the 3′ end of the hairpin structure. Exo1 has a highly conserved nuclease core at its N terminus and a less conserved C-terminal tail. To determine whether hairpin-mediated ssDNA digestion requires the C terminus of Exo1, we first mapped the core domain of yeast Exo1, which retains its full nuclease activity. The crystallized nuclease core domain of hEXO1 contains its N-terminal 352 amino acids and is fully active in vitro (21Orans J. McSweeney E.A. Iyer R.R. Hast M.A. Hellinga H.W. Modrich P. Beese L.S. Structures of human exonuclease 1 DNA complexes suggest a unified mechanism for nuclease family.Cell. 2011; 145 (21496642): 212-22310.1016/j.cell.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The yeast exo1(1–348), which spans the nuclease core region conserved between yeast and human, is, however, nearly 10-fold less active regarding its exonuclease activity against a 5′-recessed DNA end bearing a 7-nt ssDNA overhang (Fig. S3A). Extension of the C terminus to amino acid 403 fully restored its nuclease activity (Fig. S3A), which thus represents a minimal catalytic core of Exo1. Importantly, the ability of exo1(1–403) to digest ssDNA resembles that of the full-length Exo1 (Fig. S3B). We conclude that hairpin-mediated ssDNA digestion is an attribute of the Exo1 nuclease core domain. Exo1 is a threading enzyme (21Orans J. McSweeney E.A. Iyer R.R. Hast M.A. Hellinga H.W. Modrich P. Beese L.S. Structures of human exonuclease 1 DNA complexes suggest a unified mechanism for nuclease family.Cell. 2011; 145 (21496642): 212-22310.1016/j.cell.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Binding of RPA to ssDNA may impose a barrier for threading, inhibiting ssDNA digestion by Exo1 (11Cannavo E. Cejka P. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Similarly, as reported, digestion of 3′ end–labeled H80 by Exo1 is inhibited by RPA but not RPA-A−B−, an RPA mutant defective in DNA binding (Fig. 3A). Importantly, in a similar reaction but with 5′ end–labeled H80, RPA inhibits not only endonucleolytic digestion but also exonucleolytic cleavage (Fig. 3B). We speculate that binding of RPA to ssDNA also removes DNA hairpins, blocking Exo1. Our study of hairpin-directed ssDNA digestion by Exo1 showed that a duplex region with a minimum length of 4 bp is necessary to support Exo1 digestion. In the crystal structure of hEXO1 bound to its substrate duplex DNA with a recessed 5′ end (22Shi Y. Hellinga H.W. Beese L.S.

All hospital stays with a diagnostic code for AUB and an appropriate surgical procedure code between 2009 and 2015 inclusive were identified, concerning 109,884 women overall. Outcomes were compared between second generation procedures (2G surgery), first-generation procedures (1G surgery), curettage and hysterectomy. Clinical outcomes were treatment failure and complications during the follow-up period. Costs were attributed using standard French hospital tariffs.7,863 women underwent a 2G procedure (7.2%), 39,935 a 1G procedure, (36.3%), 38,923 curettage (35.4%) and 23,163 hysterectomy (21.1%). Failure rates at 18 months were 9.9% for 2G surgery, 12.7% for 1G surgery, 20.6% for curettage and 2.8% for hysterectomy. Complication rates at 18 months were 1.9% for 2G surgery, 1.5% for 1G surgery, 1.4% for curettage and 5.3% for hysterectomy. Median 18-month costs were € 1 173 for 2G surgery, € 1 059 for 1G surgery, € 782 for curettage and € 3 090 for hysterectomy.Curettage has the highest failure rate. Hysterectomy has the lowest failure rate but the highest complication rate and is also the most expensive. Despite good clinical outcomes and relatively low cost, 1G and 2G procedures are not widely used. Current guidelines for treatment of AUB are not respected, the recommended 2G procedures being only used in <10% of cases."
https://openalex.org/W2953365529,"The human dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3 is involved in substance use disorders (SUDs) among many other common neuropsychiatric illnesses but allelic association results including those with its classic genetic markers 3’VNTR or Int8VNTR remain mixed and unexplainable. To better understand the genetics for reproducible association signals, we report the presence of recombination hotspots based on sequencing of the entire 5’ promoter regions in two small SUDs cohorts, 30 African Americans (AAs) and 30 European Americans (EAs). Recombination rate was the highest near the transcription start site (TSS) in both cohorts. In addition, each cohort carried 57 different promoter haplotypes out of 60 and no haplotypes were shared between the two ethnicities. A quarter of the haplotypes evolved in an ethnicity-specific manner. Finally, analysis of five hundred subjects of European ancestry, from the 1000 Genome Project, confirmed the promoter recombination hotspots and also revealed several additional ones in non-coding regions only. These findings provide an explanation for the mixed results as well as guidance for selection of effective markers to be used in next generation association validation (NGAV), facilitating the delineation of pathogenic variation in this critical neuropsychiatric gene."

The aim of this study was to assess cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Seventeen patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, as well as 11 healthy blood donors in the control group, were assessed for cerebrovascular reactivity according to the well-established breath-holding test that uses the transcranial color Doppler for measurement of blood flow velocity. Results obtained during the breath-holding revealed significantly lower average peak systolic (AvPS start, P = 0.018), end-diastolic (AvED start, P = 0.031) and mean velocity values at the very beginning of the breath-holding procedure (AvmeanV start, P = 0.02), as well as a lower mean peak systolic velocity at the end of the breath-holding test (AvPS max, P = 0.02) in the hepatitis C group. Vascular reactivity values, calculated as the breath-holding index, were also significantly lower (P = 0.045) in the hepatitis C group. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest an association between chronic HCV infection and altered cerebrovascular reactivity which may ultimately have an unfavorable effect on cerebrovascular hemodynamics and lead to increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2949745831,"To assess the impact of specialist contraceptive support after abortion on effective contraceptive use at six months and subsequent abortions within two years.Multicentre randomised controlled trial among women undergoing induced abortion in three London boroughs. Allocation was through electronically concealed stratified randomisation by centre, blinding clinicians and participants to arm allocation until interventions. Control group received standard care, comprising advice to follow up with their general practitioner or contraceptive clinic as needed. Intervention group additionally received specialist contraceptive support via telephone or face-to-face consultation at 2-4 weeks and 3 months post-abortion. Primary outcome was rate of effective contraceptive use at six months post-abortion. Secondary outcomes were subsequent abortions within two years.569 women were recruited between October 2011 and February 2013, randomised to intervention (282) and control (287) groups; 290 (142 intervention, 148 control) were available for primary outcome analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in effective contraceptive use after abortion (62%, vs 54%, p = 0·172), long-acting contraceptive use (42% versus 32%, p = 0·084), and subsequent abortion (similar rates, at 1 year: 10%, p = 0·895, between 1-2 years: 6%, p = 0·944). Per-protocol analysis showed those who received the complete intervention package were significantly more likely to use effective contraception (67% versus 54%, p = 0·048), in particular long-acting contraception (49% versus 32%, p = 0·010) and showed a non-significant reduction in subsequent abortions within 2 years (at 1 year: 5% versus 10%, p = 0·098; and between 1-2 years: 3% versus 6%, p = 0·164, respectively).Structured specialist support post-abortion did not result in significant use of effective contraception at six months or reduction in subsequent abortions within two years. Participants engaging with the intervention showed positive effect on effective contraception at six months post-abortion. The potential benefit of such intervention may become evident through further studies with increased patient participation."
https://openalex.org/W2952033634,"During emergence from general anesthesia, coughing caused by the endotracheal tube frequently occurs and is associated with various adverse complications. In patients undergoing endovascular neurointervention, achieving smooth emergence from general anesthesia without coughing is emphasized since coughing is associated with intracranial hypertension. Therefore, the up-and-down method was introduced to determine the effective effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent coughing in 50% and 95% (EC50 and EC95) of patients during emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia for endovascular neurointervention. A total of 43 participants, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I or II participants, aged from 20 to 70 years who were undergoing endovascular neurointervention through transfemoral catheter for cerebrovascular disease were enrolled. Using the up-and-down method with isotonic regression, the EC50 and EC95 of remifentanil to prevent coughing during emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia were determined. We also investigated differences of hemodynamic and recovery profiles between the cough suppression group and the cough group. In total, 38 of 43 patients were included for estimation of EC50 and EC95. The EC50 and EC95 of remifentanil to prevent coughing were 1.42 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.56 ng/mL) and 1.70 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.67-2.60 ng/mL), respectively. There was comparable emergence and recovery data between the cough suppression group (n = 22) and the cough group (n = 16). However, the Ce of remifentanil and total dose of remifentanil were significantly higher in the cough suppression group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004, respectively). Target-controlled infusion of remifentanil at 1.70 ng/mL could effectively prevent extubation-related coughing in 95% of neurointervention patients, which could ensure smooth emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2952451718,"Individual variability in word generation is a product of genetic and environmental influences. The genetic effects on semantic verbal fluency were estimated in 1,735 participants from the Brazilian Baependi Heart Study. The numbers of exemplars produced in 60 s were broken down into time quartiles because of the involvement of different cognitive processes—predominantly automatic at the beginning, controlled/executive at the end. Heritability in the unadjusted model for the 60-s measure was 0.32. The best-fit model contained age, sex, years of schooling, and time of day as covariates, giving a heritability of 0.21. Schooling had the highest moderating effect. The highest heritability (0.17) was observed in the first quartile, decreasing to 0.09, 0.12, and 0.0003 in the following ones. Heritability for average production starting point (intercept) was 0.18, indicating genetic influences for automatic cognitive processes. Production decay (slope), indicative of controlled processes, was not significant. The genetic influence on different quartiles of the semantic verbal fluency test could potentially be exploited in clinical practice and genome-wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2953040268,"Net energy accounts for the proportion of energy expenditure attributed to the digestion, metabolism, and absorption of ingested food. Currently, there are no models available to predict net energy density of food for domestic cats. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to measure the heat increment of feeding in cats, and to model the net energy of commercial diets. Metabolizable energy and calorimetry data from two previous studies was reanalyzed to create net energy models in the present study. Energy expenditure was calculated using measurements of CO2 production and O2 consumption. Net energy was determined as the metabolizable energy of the diets minus the heat increment of feeding. The heat increment of feeding was determined as the area under the energy expenditure curve above the resting fed metabolic rate. Eight net energy models were developed using metabolizable energy, 1 of 4 dietary parameters (crude protein, fat, fiber, and starch), and heat increment of feeding values from 0-2 h or 0-21 h. Two hours postprandial, and over the full calorimetry period, the heat increment of feeding amounted for 1.74, and 20.9% of the metabolizable energy, respectively. Of the models tested, the models using crude protein in combination with metabolizable energy as dietary parameters best fit the observed data, thus providing a more accurate estimate of dietary energy availability for cats."
https://openalex.org/W2977774272,"The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to present comprehensive information about the age-dependent change of skeletal characteristics in captive cheetahs with known age and to assess the benefit of these variables for age estimation in this species. Radiographs of 162 known-age captive and semi-captive cheetahs were retrospectively examined and age-related changes of skull, axial and appendicular skeletal systems were documented. Metric and non-metric variables were used. These parameters were checked for the best correlation with age using a multiple stepwise regression analysis. An overview about the time frames, in which ossification centers appeared and physeal closure occurred is presented. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the status of closure of the coronal suture, the maximum length of the frontal sinus, the condylobasal-, hard palate, and facial length are most significantly correlated with age. Together with the pulp size of the upper canine, these values can be used for an age approximation in cheetahs."
