https://openalex.org/W2065344667,"Two chromatin nonhistone proteins (from calf thymus) of the high mobility group, HMG1 and HMG2, reduce the linking number (topological winding number) of a circular DNA if the covalent closure of the DNA is carried out in their presence. This indicates that these proteins can either unwind the double helix, or induce a supercoiling of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1631855017,"A photosensitive insulin derivative was synthesized by reacting radioactive iodinated bovine insulin with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-azidobenzolic acid. The photo-sensitivity and specificity of this insulin derivative were established by its covalent nonspecific cross-link to albumin and its covalent specific cross-link to the heavy and light chains of anti-insulin immunoglobulin. Plasma membrane preparations of rate adipocytes were incubated with the photosensitive insulin derivative and irradiated with light. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of these plasma membrane preparations after solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate and reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol showed that a protein having a molecular weight of 130,000 was specifically labeled by the radioactive photosensitive insulin, suggesting that this protein may be the insulin receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2040343112,The optic tectum of pit vipers (Crotalinae) contains a layer of infrared-sensitive neurons subjacent to the visual layer; these indirectly receive input from the facial pit organs. They respond transiently to the appearance or motion of warm objects within their 25° to 70° excitatory receptive fields (some have inhibitory regions) and presumably allow the snake to orient or strike toward prey. The infrared and visual spatiotopic tectal maps have similar but not identical axes; the infrared magnification is greater than that for vision. Bimodal neurons have receptive fields for each modality that reflect the disparity of the two maps. This finding suggests that (i) during development the infrared and visual fibers spread out independently to fill available tectal sites and (ii) bimodal neurons form local connections without regard to establishing spatial correspondence between the two modalities.
https://openalex.org/W2068464511,"Glucan is a potent reticuloendothelial stimulant whose immunobiological activity is mediated, in part, by an increase in the number and function of macrophages. In studying the role of glucan as a mediator of antibacterial activity, we attempted to ascertain the ability of glucan to modify the mortality of mice with experimentally induced Gram-positive bacteremia, and to enhance antibacterial defenses in rats as denoted by serum lysozyme and phagocytic activity. After intravenous administration of glucan, serum lysozyme concentrations were increased approximately sevenfold over control concentrations. The increase in serum lysozyme appeared to parallel the glucan-induced increase in phagocytosis and induced hyperplasia of macrophages. Prior treatment of mice with glucan significantly enhanced their survival when they were challenged systemically with Staphylococcus aureus. These studies indicate that glucan confers an enhanced state of host defense against bacterial infections."

In the posterior visual field stability and optokinetic reactions are normal, as in all parts of the pigmented rabbit's visual field. This phenomenon may be one more of the complex of visual system defects linked to albinism."

Derivatives of ribonuclease dimer that contained up to 10 Nepsilon-1-(1-deoxylactitolyl)-lysine residues per molecule had greater than 75% of the enzymic activity of the unmodified enzyme toward yeast RNA. Upon intravenous injection of the 14C-labeled (enzymically inactivated by 14C-carboxymethylation) derivatives into rats, their uptake by the liver was a function of the number of lactose residues coupled. At 10 min, 69% of the injected derivative of ribonuclease dimer containing eight 1-deoxylactitolyl-lysine residues/molecule was found in the liver; with the non-glycosylated enzyme, the liver uptake at 10 min was only 4%, and 75% of the radioactivity was found in the kidneys."

In cultures from persons with sickling disorders, amounts of hemoglobin F that are known to inhibit sickling in vivo are produced. The results provide evidence that primitive erythroid progenitors are able to express the hemoglobin F production program and that cultures of mononuclear cells of the adult blood can be used to investigate the mechanisms involved in regulation of gamma-globin gene switching."

https://openalex.org/W1527209820,"The kinetic mechanism of the phosphorylase kinase reaction was studied using a synthetic tetradecapeptide and phosphorylase b as substrates. The synthetic peptide contained the amino acid sequence, Se+Asp-Gln-Glu-LysArg1”-Lys-Gln-Ile-Ser-Va115-Arg-Gly-Leu as found in rabbit muscle phosphorylase 6. From initial rate studies and from the use of substrate analogs as competitive inhibitors, it was determined that the initial rate data were consistent with the Random Ri Ri mechanism for the phosphorylase kinase reaction. Although the synthetic tetradecapeptide appeared to be a good substrate for phosphorylase kinase (V, was only one-half of that with phosphorylase b as substrate), the K, of the peptide was 75-fold larger than the K,, of phosphorylase b. Various peptide analogs of the synthetic substrate were used to study the effect of size, charge at the NH,-terminal and the COOH-terminal residue, and substitution of arginine-16 on the kinetic parameters of activated phosphorylase kinase. Deletion of the first 4 residues and charged end groups on the peptide affected the rate of phosphorylation. Replacement of arginine-16 with a conservative or nonconservative substitution affected both the K, and rate of phosphorylation. A cyanogen bromide fragment derived from and containing the NH,-terminal segment of phosphorylase was tested for its ability to serve as substrate for activated phosphorylase kinase. The K,,, for activated phosphorylase kinase was intermediate for that of tetradecapeptide and phosphorylase b, while the V,,, was lower than with tetradecapeptide as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1643234211,"The interaction of bilirubin and various lipids was studied by a static fluorescence quenching method. A quenching equation was developed to determine the binding constant. This method was tested first by a 5-dimethylaminoaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl).bovine albumin system and then applied to a fluorescent probe containing lipid. Both systems can yield binding parameters. For certain lipid systems, some dynamic quenching was observed at the part of the curve where bilirubin concentrations were at the extreme. Of the lipids tested, sphingomyelin showed the highest association constant; this may be related to the central nervous system toxicity of this bile pigment. The association constants determined with pure lipids were 2.4 x 10(5) M-1 for phosphatidylserine; 3.7 x 10(6) M-1 for sphingomyelin; 2.4 x 10(6) M-1 for diphosphatidylcholine with 5% cholesterol; 9.8 x 10(5) M-1 for diphosphatidycholine alone; 2.2 x 10(5) M-1 for phosphatidylethanolamine; and 1.6 x 10(5) M-1 for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin); and those with mixed lipids were 4.2 to 5 x 10(5) M-1 for total brain lipid if cow and 3 to 3.6 x 10(5) M-1 for total skin lipid of pig."

https://openalex.org/W1583688556,"The potential cross-link acceptor sites of fibrin were specifically labeled with the fluorescent, substitute cross-link donor monodansyl cadaverine (MDC). Several fluorescent alpha-chain peptides generated from enzymatic and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of the labeled fibrin were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis; they were isolated and then characterized by amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal sequence analysis, and chromatographic and electrophoretic analyses of their digestion products. Ancrod cleavage of MDC-labeled fibrin produced a series of six alpha-chain peptides of molecular weights 34,000 to 12,000, each of which contained an MDC-labeled acceptor site, and an NH2-terminal alpha-chain derivative of molecular weight 37,500. The latter remains disulfide bound in the residual fibrin and has two MDC-labeled sit-s which are separable by CNBr cleavage. Mild plasmin digestion of MDC-labeled fibrin generated fluorescent alpha-chain peptides of molecular weights 45,000, 42,000, 35,000, 23,000, 21,000, and 2,500 in the supernatant and a nonfluorescent NH2-terminal alpha-chain derivative of molecular weight 25,000 which remained in the insoluble residual fibrin. The alignment of these plasmic supernatant peptides was determined from NH2-terminal sequence analyses which indicated that an MDC acceptor site was located at approximately residue 255 of the Aalpha-chain. Cleavage of the MDC-labeled alpha-chain by CNBr, however, localized most of its fluorescence (approximately 80%) to a fragment of molecular weight 29,000 which had the same NH2-terminal sequence as the labeled plasmic peptide of molecular weight 21,000. Both peptides were cleaved by ancrod into two acceptor site-containing peptides of approximately equal fluorescence. The preliminary NH2-terminal sequence analyses of these peptides, when combined with the above findings, indicated that these two other cross-link acceptor sites are in a peptide segment which comprises the middle 17% of the Aalpha-chain."

https://openalex.org/W1634793905,"The observed rate constants for base-catalyzed hydrogen exchange reactions between solvent water and peptide nitrogen in lysozyme, ribonculease A, oxidized ribonuclease A, and poly(DL-lysine) are all enhanced by an increase in pressure. Activation volumes have been calculated from the pressure effect on these rate constants. For the folded proteins lysozyme and ribonuclease A, deltaV for base-catalyzed exchange changes from about +9 ml/mol at atmospheric pressure -3 ml/mol at 2500 kg/cm2. The same quantity, determined for the random coil polypeptides oxidized ribonuclease A and poly(DL-lysine), does not show this dependence upon pressure. These effects can be understood either in terms of solvent penetration on the folded proteins or the onset of a small degree of pressure induced unfolding. Possible mechanisms by which such penetration could occur are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1898144467,"Bovine thyroglobulin was extracted from unfrozen glands, purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and fractionated into a narrow range in iodine content by RbCl isopycnic centrifugation. The subunit composition of these preparations was studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The extent of dissociation of 19 S into 12 S half-molecules followed the known relationship with iodine, i.e. decreased dissociability of 19 S with increased iodine content. The undissociated 19 S band always consisted of three closely spaced, equidistant bands. Reduction of the disulfide bonds of thyroglobulin by mercaptoethanol in SDS solution resulted in the formation of two major and one minor components (S, F, and A). The concentration of A was always less than 10% of the total. The ratio of S to F was, however, about equal in thyroglobulin preparations which ranged in iodine content from 0.2 to 1%. The final ratios were obtained before all the disulfides were reduced. The relative mobilitis of S, F, and A, decreased with increasing extent of reduction. Fully reduced S and F, but not A, migrated slower than unreduced 12 S. The three reduced alkylated polypeptides were purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their molecular weights were determined by sedimentation equilibrium in 8 M urea. Their Mw and Mz values agreed closely with that of the unreduced 12 S half-molecule subunit, thus indicating that reduction of the disulfide bonds changes the shape but not the molecular weights of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1591695179,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to examine the polypeptide patterns of rat liver rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane fractions stripped of ribosomes. Approximately 67 polypeptides were resolved from the rough ER membrane fraction. The polypeptide pattern of the smooth ER membrane fraction was similar to that of the rough ER membrane fraction, but exhibited substantially lower amounts of some seven polypeptides. Three of these polypeptides, of apparent molecular weights 63,000, 65,000, and 87,000, were of particular interest, as they could not be ascribed to contamination of stripped rough ER membrane fractions by residual ribosomal polypeptides. Conditions of treatment with low concentrations of trypsin were established that markedly diminished the capacity of the stripped rough ER membrane fraction to bind ribosomes in vitro and that also effected a partial detachment of ribosomes from nonstripped rough ER membranes; the results of electrophoretic analyses of rough ER membrane fractions treated in these manners are described. Comparison of the polypeptide patterns of guinea pig, mouse, and rabbit liver ER membrane fractions with rat liver ER membrane fractions revealed considerable variations in the distribution of the polypeptides of 63,000, 65,000, and 87,000 molecular weight among the ER membrane fractions of these species. The combined results of these studies indicate that the polypeptide of 87,000 molecular weight, although particularly sensitive to attack by trypsin, is not involved in the binding of ribosomes to the rough ER membrane fraction. Studies by others (cf. Kreibich, G., Grebenau, R., Mok, W., Pereyra, B., Rodriguez-Boulan, E., and Sabatini, D. D. (1977) Fed. Proc. 36, 656) have implicated the polypeptides of 63,000 and 65,000 molecular weight in this process. The patterns of phosphorylated polypeptides of rough and smooth ER membrane fractions of rat and mouse liver were also examined, using labeling in vivo with sodium [32p]phosphate or in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP. Approximately 25 phosphorylated components were resolved by electrophoresis in the ER membrane fractions of both species. Evidence is presented that suggests that the great majority of these components are phosphopolypeptides. Differences were noted in the patterns of phosphorylation produced by in vivo and in vitro labeling; minor differences were also observed between the patterns of phosphorylation of the rough and smooth ER membrane fractions in either situation. The overall results afford an indirect approach toward evaluating the possible involvement of specific rough ER membrane polypeptides in ribosome-binding and reveal that liver ER membranes contain a substantially greater number of phosphorylated polypeptides thatn previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1549043944,"A physical map of the DNA containing the gene for silk fibroin was developed from direct hybridization analysis of restriction endonuclease digests of total Bombyx mori DNA using fibroin 125I-mRNA. The orientation of mRNA transcription relative to this map was deduced from the sensitivity of the mRNA coding strand within certain DNA restriction segments to lambda-exonuclease and exonuclease III. The map includes the entire gene coding region (Mr approximately 11 x 10(6)) and large DNA elements which flank the gene at its 5' end (Mr approximately 3 x 10(6)) and 3' end (Mr approximately 6.5 x 10(6)). The coding region is remarkably uniform in its sensitivity to restriction endonucleases. It is completely devoid of sites for most of the enzymes tested, including Hae III, the recognition sequence (d-pG-G C-C) of which might be expected to occur frequently in this large DNA block of 60% G + C content. The fibroin coding region does contain an enormous number of sites for enzymes predicted to have activity from known fibroin mRNA sequences. These results suggeste that the fibroin gene core is a large homogeneously repetitive block of DNA with little evidence for sequence divergence, or the presence of qualitatively different sequences, which might creat other restriction sensitivities. The map also allowed a comparison to be made of the fibroin gene context in DNA from tissues either active or inactive in fibroin synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1494302198,"Meta- and para-azidobenzamidine have been prepared and evaluated as photoaffinity labels. The compounds inhibit trypsin reversible in the dark and are competitive with substrate binding. Upon photolysis, irreversible noncompetitive inhibition is observed and is dependent upon concentration, photolysis time, and pH. Specificity of the probes is indicated by experiments in which p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, a trypsin substrate, is used to protect against photoinactivation. Maximum inactivation of trypsin is achieved at pH 6.2 using either azidobenzamidine derivative. Evaluation of the pH dependence of photoaffinity labeling may provide a sensitive tool for probing conformational changes in inhibitor binding sites. These studies provide a basis for the use of azidobenzamidines as photoaffinity analogs of lysine and arginine side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1543399811,"Spectroscopic evidence is presented which indicates that the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and the peptide antibiotic valinomycin form a complex in the presence of potassium. Complex formation has been observed both in aqueous and nonaqueous media. Several techniques have been used to indicate the existence of a complex in aqueous solution. In the presence of valinomycin and K+, the absorption spectrum of FCCP is significantly perturbed, and there is also a large induced circular dichroism signal. In addition, the previously characterized complex which forms between valinomycin, K+, and the fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) in aqueous solution is apparently disrupted by the addition of FCCP. The result is an effective quenching of the fluorescence due to the bound probe as it is displaced from the valinomycin.K+ by the uncoupler. In a nonpolar solvent, the absorption spectrum of FCCP is also perturbed by valinomycin in the presence of K+, again indicating the formation of a complex. These data point to the importance of considering the role of valinomycin.K+.uncoupler complex in interpreting physiological or ion transport data in which these substances have been used together."
https://openalex.org/W1509992511,"The B variant of beta-casein was phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP using four different protein kinases isolated from rabbit reticulocytes. Casein was maximally phosphorylated by the individual protein kinase activities and subjected to chymotrptic digestion. The peptides were separated by a two-dimensional peptide fingerprinting technique, and the phosphorylated peptides were identified by autoradiography, The two phosphorylated peptides obtained from the action of casein kinase I were shown to have different migration patterns from those obtained with casein kinase II. The cAMP-regulated protein kinases had the same substrate specificity with beta-casein B, and the two phosphorylated peptides obtained using these enzymes were distinct from those phosphorylated by the cAMP-independent enzymes. Thus, the different protein kinases can be identified by substrate specificity using beta-casein."

This protein is different from a previously found form of ricin (also present in the same seeds), the only ricin for which a preliminary x-ray investigation has been reported so far. Ricin D crystallizes from an aqueous solution in an orthorhombic unit cell of symmetry P2(1)2(1)2(1) and a = 79.0, b = 114.7, and c = 72.8 A. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule with an average molecular weight of 62,400. The crystal is fairly stable to x-radiation and has a water content of approximately 54% by volume. It appears to comprise two closely related species of proteins, the major species corresponding to recin D and the other presumably corresponding to a deamidation product of ricin D.

Contrary to earlier reports, we find that the nonexchangeable nucleotide (N-site) is not a substrate. This conclusion is based upon comparison of: (a) rates of hydrolysis of endogenous tubulin-associated GTP and added [32p]GTP: (b) hydrolysis rates for added [32p]GTP and [3h]GTP; (c) the 32P/3H ratio in bound and free GTP after reaction with [3h, 32p]gTP. During the course of the above studies we have made the unusual observation of a time dependent augmentation in the expected amount of GTP relative to GDP at the E-site; there is either a net conversion of E-site GDP to E-site GTP, or a means for providing additional E-site GTP from another source."

https://openalex.org/W1573402730,"The cleavage products from the conversion of proparathormone to parathormone by a bovine and porcine parathyroid microsomal converting activity have been analyzed. In the conversion reaction, the first 6 amino acid residues of the prohormone (Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-) are released as an intact hexapeptide. This is rapidly converted to a pentapeptide by removal of the NH2-terminal lysine and then to a tetrapeptide by removal of the COOH-terminal arginine. In order to test for the presence of a postulated COOH-terminal extension of the parathormone sequence in proparathormone, mixtures of 14C-proparathormone and 3H-parathormone were subjected to digestion by trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease. The resulting radioactive peptides from the hormone and its precursor were compared. There was no evidence that any fragments different from those from the hormone were released from the prohormone except those accounted for by the NH2-terminal hexapeptide adduct on proparathormone. Thus, the conversion of the prohormone to the hormone catalyzed by the microsomal membrane activity requires only the cleavage of this hexapeptide."

Their order of effectiveness with millimolar concentration required for 50% inhibition given in parentheses, was: Compound UK-5099 (alpha-cyano-beta-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)acrylate) (0.1); alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (0.17); alpha-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamate (1); alpha-cyanocinnamate (1); alpha-fluorocinnamate (7); transcinnamate (10); p-hydroxycinnamate (10); phenylpyruvate (22); p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (25). Kinetically, the alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate inhibition was mixed and the p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to external (-)-carnitine. The alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate inhibition was reversible and resulted from its ability to act as a thiol reagent. In general, alpha-cyanocinnamate and its derivatives inhibit carnitine transport at concentrations 100 to 5000 times as high as those known to pyruvate transport. At millimolar concentrations, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate inhibited the mitochondrial transport of molecules other than carnitine as well as the activity of carnitine acyltransferases. Pyruvate and carnitine did not complete for transport into and out of mitochondria. These results establish that transmitochondrial transport mechanisms for carnitine and pyruvate involve different carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2107157841,"In the absence of substrate oxidation, membrane vesicles of Mycobacterium phlei were shown to accumulate proline, glutamine, and glutamic acid mediated by Cu”+. The Cu’+- mediated uptake of amino acids was found to be an active process and required the presence of amino acid binding protein(s). Thus, membrane vesicles which lack active transport of a particular amino acid because of the loss of specific binding protein(s) do not accumulate these amino acids even in the presence of Cu+. The Cu’+-mediated uptake of proline exhibited a specific requirement for Na+. The Cu”--mediated uptake process was not inhibited by anaerobiosis and respiratory inhibitors, such as sodium azide and m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone. How- ever, atebrin and o-phenanthroline were found to inhibit the uptake process. The results with various sulfhydryl blocking agents suggests that oxidation of available sulfhy- dry1 residues of the membrane protein(s) is required for the Cu”+-mediated uptake process. The uptake of amino acid was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid or X-ethylmaleimide when added prior to the addition of Cu’+. In addition, efflux of amino acids, previously accumulated to the steady state level occurred when sulfhydryl reducing agents such as glutathione, cysteine, or dithiothreitol were added. Evidence is presented that disulfide configuration of the carrier or membrane protein(s) favors the transport of amino acids against the concentration gradient, whereas the sulfhydryl state of these proteins induces the efflux process. Studies show that there was 1:l stoichiometry for the oxidation of available sulfhydryl residues in the mem- brane to the reduction of Cu”, and the proton gradient generated as a result of the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups is presumably the driving force for the uptake of these amino acids.
