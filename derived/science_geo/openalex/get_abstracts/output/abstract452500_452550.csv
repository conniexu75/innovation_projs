However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in approximately 20% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103, neutralized approximately 55% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination. Longitudinal sampling is used to map the evolution of an HIV-1 virus from the time of infection, and the co-evolution of a broadly neutralizing antibody in the same infected patient; the findings have important implications for HIV vaccine development. Hua-Xin Liao et al. followed the evolution of an HIV-1 virus, and the concurrent co-evolution of a CD4-binding-site broadly neutralizing antibody (BnAb), from the time of infection of a single African patient for a period of more than 3 years. The neutralizing antibody, of CH103 lineage, is a new type of BnAb that binds in a completely loop-based manner that differs from that of VRC01 class monoclonal antibodies — the CH103 lineage is less mutated, with fewer unusual macromutations and may be easier to induce. This work has implications for HIV vaccine development, suggesting viral strains that might generate broadly neutralizing antibodies within the host."

https://openalex.org/W1972924731,"The Sir2 family of enzymes or sirtuins are known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases and have been implicated in the regulation of transcription, genome stability, metabolism and lifespan. However, four of the seven mammalian sirtuins have very weak deacetylase activity in vitro. Here we show that human SIRT6 efficiently removes long-chain fatty acyl groups, such as myristoyl, from lysine residues. The crystal structure of SIRT6 reveals a large hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate long-chain fatty acyl groups. We demonstrate further that SIRT6 promotes the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by removing the fatty acyl modification on K19 and K20 of TNF-α. Protein lysine fatty acylation has been known to occur in mammalian cells, but the function and regulatory mechanisms of this modification were unknown. Our data indicate that protein lysine fatty acylation is a novel mechanism that regulates protein secretion. The discovery of SIRT6 as an enzyme that controls protein lysine fatty acylation provides new opportunities to investigate the physiological function of a protein post-translational modification that has been little studied until now."

https://openalex.org/W1982782013,"A study of mouse visual cortex relating patterns of excitatory synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring neurons shows that, after eye opening, local connectivity reorganizes extensively: more connections form selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections are eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity rate does not change. Intrinsic and experiential factors guide the patterning of neural pathways and the establishment of sensory response properties during postnatal development. Although sensory processing is known to depend on the precise wiring of cortical microcircuits, how this functional connectivity develops remains unclear. Based on electrical recordings of neighbouring neurons and changing network dynamics measures using calcium imaging, Thomas Mrsic-Flogel and colleagues offer a proposal that neuronal feature preference is initially acquired before sensory experience in a feed-forward manner, and with patterned input later driving the formation of precision within the network following the appropriate re-arrangement of synaptic connections. Sensory processing occurs in neocortical microcircuits in which synaptic connectivity is highly structured1,2,3,4 and excitatory neurons form subnetworks that process related sensory information5,6. However, the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of functionally organized connectivity in cortical microcircuits remain unknown. Here we directly relate patterns of excitatory synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex at different postnatal ages, using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and multiple whole-cell recordings in vitro. Although neural responses were already highly selective for visual stimuli at eye opening, neurons responding to similar visual features were not yet preferentially connected, indicating that the emergence of feature selectivity does not depend on the precise arrangement of local synaptic connections. After eye opening, local connectivity reorganized extensively: more connections formed selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections were eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity rate did not change. We propose a sequential model of cortical microcircuit development based on activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity whereby neurons first acquire feature preference by selecting feedforward inputs before the onset of sensory experience—a process that may be facilitated by early electrical coupling between neuronal subsets7,8,9—and then patterned input drives the formation of functional subnetworks through a redistribution of recurrent synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W2031271762,"Membranes allow the compartmentalization of biochemical processes and are therefore fundamental to life. The conservation of the cellular membrane, combined with its accessibility to secreted proteins, has made it a common target of factors mediating antagonistic interactions between diverse organisms. Here we report the discovery of a diverse superfamily of bacterial phospholipase enzymes. Within this superfamily, we defined enzymes with phospholipase A1 and A2 activity, which are common in host-cell-targeting bacterial toxins and the venoms of certain insects and reptiles. However, we find that the fundamental role of the superfamily is to mediate antagonistic bacterial interactions as effectors of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) translocation apparatus; accordingly, we name these proteins type VI lipase effectors. Our analyses indicate that PldA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a eukaryotic-like phospholipase D, is a member of the type VI lipase effector superfamily and the founding substrate of the haemolysin co-regulated protein secretion island II T6SS (H2-T6SS). Although previous studies have specifically implicated PldA and the H2-T6SS in pathogenesis, we uncovered a specific role for the effector and its secretory machinery in intra- and interspecies bacterial interactions. Furthermore, we find that this effector achieves its antibacterial activity by degrading phosphatidylethanolamine, the major component of bacterial membranes. The surprising finding that virulence-associated phospholipases can serve as specific antibacterial effectors suggests that interbacterial interactions are a relevant factor driving the continuing evolution of pathogenesis."

Ascorbate (vitamin C) is best known for its role in scurvy, in which the hydroxylation of collagen catalyzed by dioxygenases is incomplete due to ascorbate deficiency. Here, we report a novel function of ascorbate in the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA catalyzed by Tet (ten-eleven translocation) methylcytosine dioxygenase. The content of 5-hmC is extremely low in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cultured in ascorbate-free medium. Additions of ascorbate dose- and time-dependently enhance the generation of 5-hmC, without any effects on the expression of Tet genes. Treatment with another reducer glutathione (GSH) does not change the level of 5-hmC. Further, blocking ascorbate entry into cells by phloretin and knocking down Tet (Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3) expression by short interference RNAs (siRNA) significantly inhibit the effect of ascorbate on 5-hmC. These results suggest that ascorbate enhances 5-hmC generation, most likely by acting as a co-factor for Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase to hydroxylate 5-mC. Thus, we have uncovered a novel role for ascorbate in modulating the epigenetic control of genome activity."

https://openalex.org/W1983132684,"The western quarter of North America consists of accreted terranes--crustal blocks added over the past 200 million years--but the reason for this is unclear. The widely accepted explanation posits that the oceanic Farallon plate acted as a conveyor belt, sweeping terranes into the continental margin while subducting under it. Here we show that this hypothesis, which fails to explain many terrane complexities, is also inconsistent with new tomographic images of lower-mantle slabs, and with their locations relative to plate reconstructions. We offer a reinterpretation of North American palaeogeography and test it quantitatively: collision events are clearly recorded by slab geometry, and can be time calibrated and reconciled with plate reconstructions and surface geology. The seas west of Cretaceous North America must have resembled today's western Pacific, strung with island arcs. All proto-Pacific plates initially subducted into almost stationary, intra-oceanic trenches, and accumulated below as massive vertical slab walls. Above the slabs, long-lived volcanic archipelagos and subduction complexes grew. Crustal accretion occurred when North America overrode the archipelagos, causing major episodes of Cordilleran mountain building."

https://openalex.org/W2008810019,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), monitor the brain for disturbances of tissue homeostasis by constantly moving their fine processes. Microglia respond to tissue damage through activation of ATP/ADP receptors followed by directional process extension to the damaged area. A common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases is the loss of norepinephrine, which might contribute to the associated neuroinflammation. We carried out a high resolution analysis of the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on microglial process dynamics in acute brain slices from mice that exhibit microglia-specific enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. Bath application of NE to the slices resulted in significant process retraction in microglia. Analysis of adrenergic receptor expression with quantitative PCR indicated that resting microglia primarily express β2 receptors but switch expression to α2A receptors under proinflammatory conditions modeled by LPS treatment. Despite the differential receptor expression, NE caused process retraction in both resting and LPS-activated microglia cultured in the gelatinous substrate Matrigel in vitro. The use of subtype-selective receptor agonists and antagonists confirmed the involvement of β2 receptors in mediating microglial process dynamics in resting cells and α2A receptors in activated cells. Co-application of NE with ATP to resting microglia blocked the ATP-induced process extension and migration in isolated microglia, and β2 receptor antagonists prolonged ATP effects in brain slice tissues, suggesting the presence of cross-talk between adrenergic and purinergic signaling in microglia. These data show that the neurotransmitter NE can modulate microglial motility, which could affect microglial functions in pathogenic situations of either elevated or reduced NE levels."

We show that MCoTI-II is a significantly more potent matriptase inhibitor than SFTI-1 and that all alanine mutants of both peptides, generated using positional scanning mutagenesis, have decreased trypsin affinity, whereas several mutations either maintain or result in enhanced matriptase inhibitory activity. These intriguing results were used to design one of the most potent matriptase inhibitors known to date with a 290 pm equilibrium dissociation constant, and provide the first indication on how to modulate affinity for matriptase over trypsin in cyclic peptides.

Little is known about the physical relationships among protein and RNA subunits within a biologically functional holoenzyme. Here we describe the architecture of Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase holoenzyme determined by electron microscopy. Six of the seven proteins and the TERT-binding regions of telomerase RNA (TER) have been localized by affinity labelling. Fitting with high-resolution structures reveals the organization of TERT, TER and p65 in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) catalytic core. p50 has an unanticipated role as a hub between the RNP catalytic core, p75-p19-p45 subcomplex, and the DNA-binding Teb1. A complete in vitro holoenzyme reconstitution assigns function to these interactions in processive telomeric repeat synthesis. These studies provide the first view of the extensive network of subunit associations necessary for telomerase holoenzyme assembly and physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W1969606753,"Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by α-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Aβ. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3′-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Aβ. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.

In this study, we used a combination of bioinformatics and experimental techniques to demonstrate that miR-144 is a negative regulator of ADAM10, and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which can be activated by Aβ and is implicated in AD pathogenesis, is involved in the regulation of miR-144 expression. In the presence of Aβ, miR-144 is up-regulated and contributes to ADAM10 down-regulation caused by Aβ. Thus, this study presents a mechanism for the ADAM10 protein repression observed in AD patients and provides potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and/or treatment of the disease. Prediction of miRNA targets was conducted using miRanda. Prediction of the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of primary microRNAs was performed using miRStart.

Human Aβ42 peptide was obtained from AnaSpec and Sigma. miRNA mimics, inhibitors, and the corresponding negative controls were obtained from RiboBio. To construct the reporter plasmid pmirGLO-ADAM10 3′-UTR, the 3′-UTR region of ADAM10 was amplified from human cDNA. The PCR product was digested with SacI and XhoI. Then the fragment, which spans 1267 bp starting from the 35th bp upstream of the stop codon, was cloned into the pmirGLO Dual Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector (Promega). To construct the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-promoter-2808, promoter-2554, promoter-1895, promoter-1019, promoter-453, and promoter-307, each promoter region of miR-144 was amplified from human genomic DNA and subsequently cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega). The transcription factor overexpression constructs were amplified from human cDNA and then cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His A at the KpnI and XhoI or BamHI and XbaI sites. The ADAM10 3′-UTR luciferase mutant construct that lacks the putative miR-144 MRE, the ADAM10 3′-UTR luciferase mutant construct that lacks the putative miR-451 MRE, and the miR-144 promoter reporter plasmids containing single or double site-specific deletion for each transcription factor AP-1 binding site were generated by using a PCR-mediated deletion mutagenesis protocol (31Hansson M.D. Rzeznicka K.

Protein samples were separated by 10–15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL, GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-ADAM10 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-APP C-terminal (1:4000, Sigma), or anti-GAPDH (1:2000, CWBIO). Then, they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, ZSGB-BIO) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000, ZSGB-BIO).

Moreover, bioinformatics analysis revealed that the putative MRE for miR-144 in the ADAM10 3′-UTR is strictly conserved in vertebrates (Table 3). These observations further prompted us to analyze the function of miR-144 on ADAM10 expression. In miR-144 loss-of-function experiments, we found that the miR-144 inhibitor up-regulated the luciferase activity of the ADAM10 3′-UTR reporter (Fig. 1B). Moreover, ADAM10 protein levels are remarkably decreased upon transient overexpression of miR-144 in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1, C and D). However, ADAM10 protein levels were not altered after overexpression of miR-9, which also possesses a putative MRE in the ADAM10 3′-UTR, indicating the specificity of miR-144 in the regulation of ADAM10 levels. Identical data were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). In addition, a decrease in the mRNA level of ADAM10 upon miR-144 overexpression was not observed (Fig. 1E). These results thus identify miR-144 as a negative regulator of ADAM10 and suggest that repression of the ADAM10 protein induced by miR-144 does not occur via ADAM10 mRNA degradation but ma"

The Jumonji C domain Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate family of proteins performs the majority of histone demethylation. We demonstrate that nitric oxide (•NO) directly inhibits the activity of the demethylase KDM3A by forming a nitrosyliron complex in the catalytic pocket. Exposing cells to either chemical or cellular sources of •NO resulted in a significant increase in dimethyl Lys-9 on histone 3 (H3K9me2), the preferred substrate for KDM3A.

https://openalex.org/W2006016083,"The role of Smad-independent TGF-β signaling in craniofacial development is poorly elucidated.In craniofacial mesenchymal cells, Tak1 regulates both R-Smad C-terminal and linker region phosphorylation in TGF-β signaling.Tak1 plays an irreplaceable role in craniofacial ecto-mesenchyme during embryogenesis.Understanding the mechanisms of TGF-β signaling contributes to knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms underlying common craniofacial birth defects. Although the importance of TGF-β superfamily signaling in craniofacial growth and patterning is well established, the precise details of its signaling mechanisms are still poorly understood. This is in part because of the concentration of studies on the role of the Smad-dependent (so-called ""canonical"") signaling pathways relative to the Smad-independent ones in many biological processes. Here, we have addressed the role of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (Tak1, Map3k7), one of the key mediators of Smad-independent (noncanonical) TGF-β superfamily signaling in craniofacial development, by deleting Tak1 specifically in the neural crest lineage. Tak1-deficient mutants display a round skull, hypoplastic maxilla and mandible, and cleft palate resulting from a failure of palatal shelves to appropriately elevate and fuse. Our studies show that in neural crest-derived craniofacial ecto-mesenchymal cells, Tak1 is not only required for TGF-β- and bone morphogenetic protein-induced p38 Mapk activation but also plays a role in agonist-induced C-terminal and linker region phosphorylation of the receptor-mediated R-Smads. Specifically, we demonstrate that the agonist-induced linker region phosphorylation of Smad2 at Thr-220, which has been shown to be critical for full transcriptional activity of Smad2, is dependent on Tak1 activity and that in palatal mesenchymal cells TGFβRI and Tak1 kinases mediate both overlapping and distinct TGF-β2-induced transcriptional responses. To summarize, our results suggest that in neural crest-derived ecto-mesenchymal cells, Tak1 provides a critical point of intersection in a complex dialogue between the canonical and noncanonical arms of TGF-β superfamily signaling required for normal craniofacial development."
https://openalex.org/W2038727835,"The colonic epithelial surface is protected by an inner mucus layer that the commensal microflora cannot penetrate. We previously demonstrated that Entamoeba histolytica secretes a protease capable of dissolving this layer that is required for parasite penetration. Here, we asked whether there are bacteria that can secrete similar proteases. We screened bacterial culture supernatants for such activity using recombinant fragments of the MUC2 mucin, the major structural component, and the only gel-forming mucin in the colonic mucus. MUC2 has two central heavily O-glycosylated mucin domains that are protease-resistant and has cysteine-rich N and C termini responsible for polymerization. Culture supernatants of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium that secretes proteases responsible for periodontitis, cleaved the MUC2 C-terminal region, whereas the N-terminal region was unaffected. The active enzyme was isolated and identified as Arg-gingipain B (RgpB). Two cleavage sites were localized to IR↓TT and NR↓QA. IR↓TT cleavage will disrupt the MUC2 polymers. Because this site has two potential O-glycosylation sites, we tested whether recombinant GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) could glycosylate a synthetic peptide covering the IRTT sequence. Only GalNAc-T3 was able to glycosylate the second Thr in IRTT, rendering the sequence resistant to cleavage by RgpB. Furthermore, when GalNAc-T3 was expressed in CHO cells expressing the MUC2 C terminus, the second threonine was glycosylated, and the protein became resistant to RgpB cleavage. These findings suggest that bacteria can produce proteases capable of dissolving the inner protective mucus layer by specific cleavages in the MUC2 mucin and that this cleavage can be modulated by site-specific O-glycosylation."

We demonstrate that core components of the α-proteobacterial general stress response (GSR) system, PhyR and σE1, are required for Brucella abortus stress survival in vitro and maintenance of chronic murine infection in vivo. ΔphyR and ΔrpoE1 null mutants exhibit decreased survival under acute oxidative and acid stress but are not defective in infection of primary murine macrophages or in initial colonization of BALB/c mouse spleens. However, ΔphyR and ΔrpoE1 mutants are attenuated in spleens beginning 1 month postinfection. Thus, the B. abortus GSR system is dispensable for colonization but is required to maintain chronic infection. A genome-scale analysis of the B. abortus GSR regulon identified stress response genes previously linked to virulence and genes that affect immunomodulatory components of the cell envelope. These data support a model in which the GSR system affects both stress survival and the interface between B. abortus and the host immune system. We further demonstrate that PhyR proteolysis is a unique feature of GSR control in B. abortus. Proteolysis of PhyR provides a mechanism to avoid spurious PhyR protein interactions that inappropriately activate GSR-dependent transcription. We conclude that the B. abortus GSR system regulates acute stress adaptation and long term survival within a mammalian host and that PhyR proteolysis is a novel regulatory feature in B. abortus that ensures proper control of GSR transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2031470858,"The phenoloxidase (PO) cascade regulates the melanization of blood (hemolymph) in insects and other arthropods. Most studies indicate that microbial elicitors activate the PO cascade, which results in processing of the zymogen PPO to PO. PO is then thought to oxidize tyrosine and o-diphenols to quinones, which leads to melanin. However, different lines of investigation raise questions as to whether these views are fully correct. Here we report that hemolymph from the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, rapidly melanizes after collection from a wound site. Prior studies indicated that in vitro activated PPO hydroxylates Tyr inefficiently. Measurement of in vivo substrate titers, however, suggested that Tyr was the only PO substrate initially present in B. mori plasma and that it is rapidly metabolized by PO. Fractionation of plasma by gel filtration chromatography followed by bioassays indicated that melanization activity was primarily associated with a high mass complex (~670 kDa) that contained PO. The prophenoloxidase-activating protease inhibitor Egf1.0 blocked formation of this complex and Tyr metabolism, but the addition of phenylthiourea to plasma before fractionation enhanced complex formation and Tyr metabolism. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the complex contained PO plus other proteins. Taken together, our results indicate that wounding alone activates the PO cascade in B. mori. They also suggest that complex formation is required for efficient use of Tyr as a substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2113742214,"(S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonate ((S)-2-HPP) epoxidase (HppE) is a mononuclear non-haem-iron-dependent enzyme responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of the clinically useful antibiotic fosfomycin. Enzymes of this class typically catalyse oxygenation reactions that proceed via the formation of substrate radical intermediates. By contrast, HppE catalyses an unusual dehydrogenation reaction while converting the secondary alcohol of (S)-2-HPP to the epoxide ring of fosfomycin. Here we show that HppE also catalyses a biologically unprecedented 1,2-phosphono migration with the alternative substrate (R)-1-HPP. This transformation probably involves an intermediary carbocation, based on observations with additional substrate analogues, such as (1R)-1-hydroxyl-2-aminopropylphosphonate, and model reactions for both radical- and carbocation-mediated migration. The ability of HppE to catalyse distinct reactions depending on the regio- and stereochemical properties of the substrate is given a structural basis using X-ray crystallography. These results provide compelling evidence for the formation of a substrate-derived cation intermediate in the catalytic cycle of a mononuclear non-haem-iron-dependent enzyme. The underlying chemistry of this unusual phosphono migration may represent a new paradigm for the in vivo construction of phosphonate-containing natural products that can be exploited for the preparation of new phosphonate derivatives."

We previously found that activated lymphocyte-derived self-apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA) immunization led to pathological macrophage activation and M2b polarization, which could initiate and propagate murine lupus nephritis. However, the specific DNA sensor(s) as well as underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease remains unknown. In this study, we reported that DAI expression was significantly increased in SLE patients as well as in lupus mice. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that DAI was involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage activation and M2b polarization. Moreover, ALD-DNA notably induced dimerization/oligomerization of DAI and consequently activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathways via calcium signaling, resulting in macrophage activation and M2b polarization. More importantly, blockade of DAI in vivo or selective knockdown of DAI in macrophages could ameliorate SLE syndrome via blunting macrophage M2b polarization and inhibiting inflammatory response in lupus mice.

We systematically examined the interaction between each Mcm2–7 subunit with Dbf4 and Cdc7 through two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Strikingly different binding patterns were observed, as Dbf4 interacted most strongly with Mcm2, whereas Cdc7 displayed association with both Mcm4 and Mcm5.

An important role of BV8 in mobilization of myeloid cells and myeloid cell-dependent angiogenesis has been established. Recently, it has also been shown that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced BV8 expression is STAT3 dependent in CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cells. However, the BV8 downstream signaling pathway(s) intrinsic to myeloid cells crucial for angiogenesis, and potentially also for development of cancers of myeloid origin, remains largely unknown. Here we show that BV8 activates STAT3, which is critical for regulating genes important for both tumor cell proliferation/survival and tumor angiogenesis, in both normal and malignant myeloid cells. Further, BV8-induced STAT3 activation requires Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) activity as shown by both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition. Knocking down BV8 in human myeloid leukemia cells inhibits STAT3 activity and expression of STAT3 downstream angiogenic and pro-proliferation/survival genes, leading to a decrease in tumor cell viability. BV8 shRNA expressing leukemia cells exhibit reduced STAT3 activity and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, we have delineated a signaling pathway downstream of BV8 that plays critical roles in both the tumor microenvironment and malignant myeloid cells for angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation/survival."

Here we investigated the role of CD14 in the immune recognition of bacterial amyloids. We used HeLa 57A cells, a human cervical cancer cell line containing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an NF-κB promoter. When HeLa 57A cells were transiently transfected with combinations of human expression vectors containing genes for TLR2, TLR1, and CD14, membrane-bound CD14 enhanced NF-κB activation through the TLR2/TLR1 complex stimulated with curli fibers or recombinant CsgA, the curli major subunit. Similarly, soluble CD14 augmented the TLR2/TLR1 response to curli fibers in the absence of membrane-bound CD14.

Moreover, we found that caspase-2 activation in the extract occurred only after specific metabolic changes (e.g. depletion of NADPH and NAD+) and more importantly could be suppressed by supplementing the extract with metabolites expected to lead to NADPH production either through malic enzyme or the pentose phosphate pathway (21Nutt L.K.

Based in part on these observations, we suspected that the spontaneous activation of caspase-2 occurs in response to a progressive metabolic stress or depletion of specific metabolites. In an attempt to more thoroughly understand the metabolic changes that underlie caspase-2 activation, we performed metabolomic profiling on the egg extract at time points leading up to caspase-2 activation. Consistent with previous studies on egg metabolism, we observed a robust decrease in aspartate upon extract incubation, indicating the usage of amino acids as a fuel source in this cell type (24Dworkin M.B.

The most notable change preceding caspase-2 activation, however, was a marked increase in LCFA metabolites. We show here that metabolic treatments that suppressed caspase-2 activation specifically blocked this increase in LCFA metabolites, suggesting that a buildup of lipids may engage the apoptotic pathway/caspase-2 in egg extract. Moreover, the caspase-suppressive effect of such metabolic treatments could be overridden by supplementing the extract with the saturated LCFA palmitate. Extending this finding, we demonstrate that caspase-2 was activated by recruitment to a high molecular weight complex in mammalian cells following palmitate treatment. Caspase-2 activity was significantly increased following palmitate treatment, and down-regulation of caspase-2 significantly impaired cell death induced by saturated LCFAs, revealing a conserved, critical role for caspase-2 in mediating LCFA-induced lipoapoptosis. These findings may have clinical implications for the treatment of diseases associated with lipid accumulations.

Freshly prepared Xenopus egg extracts (300 μl) or extracts incubated at room temperature for 3–4 h (300 μl) were used for metabolic profiling. Proteins were first removed by precipitation with methanol (1200 μl) or acidified acetonitrile (750 μl of acetonitrile + 450 μl of 1% formic acid). Samples were mixed well by vortexing and spun down, and supernatants were removed immediately for amino acid, organic acid, and acylcarnitine analysis. Measurements of amino acid and acylcarnitine were made by flow injection electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of their butyl and methyl esters, respectively (27An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B. Hepatic expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase reverses muscle, liver and whole-animal insulin resistance.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), using a Waters AcquityTM UPLC system equipped with a triple quadrupole detector and a data system controlled by MassLynx 4.1 operating system (Waters, Milford, MA). For organic acid, analytes were extracted into ethyl acetate, dried, and then converted to trimethylsilyl esters by N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with protection of α-keto groups by oximation with ethoxyamine hydrochloride. Organic acids were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using a TRACE DSQ instrument (Thermo Electron Corp., Austin, TX). All MS analyses used stable isotope dilution with internal standards from Isotec (St. Louis, MO), Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA), and CDN Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). NADH levels were measured using an NAD+/NADH quantitation kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Oxygen (O2) consumption rates were measured using the Seahorse extracellular flux XF24 analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA). Briefly, freshly prepared egg extracts were added in triplicate to a 24-well plate and analyzed for 4 h. O2 consumption rates were assessed using the “(Level) Direct (Ksv)” method. For egg extract experiments, caspase-3 activity was measured spectrophotometrically by assessing the cleavage of the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. Briefly, 5-μl aliquots of extract were removed, transferred to 85 μl of DEVDase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), and kept on ice. Following collection of all samples, 10 μl of Ac-DEVD-pNA (200 μm) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Caspase-2 activity assays were performed according to the BioVision caspase-2 colorimetric assay kit specifications. Briefly, for extract experiments, 10-μl aliquots of extract were transferred to 40 μl of cell lysis buffer and diluted with 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer and 10 μl of VDVAD-pNA (4 mm) at 37 °C for 60–120 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. 35S-Labeled caspase-2 proteins were synthesized using the TnT SP6 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 20 ng/ml pSP64T caspase-2 cDNA was added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 0.4 mCi/ml 35S Translabel along with additional components in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Radiolabeled proteins were added to the extract, and proenzyme processing was assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager detection (GE Healthcare). All cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum with the exception of the AML12 cells, which were cultured according to ATCC specifications. Custom caspase-2 oligos targeting to the 3′-untranslated region of caspase-2 were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. The sequence for the caspase-2 siRNA used was UGGAAGUAUUUGAGAGAGA[dT][dT] (square brackets represent nucleotide overhang). SMARTpool mouse caspase-2 siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon (catalogue number M-044184-00), and ON-TARGETplus Control siRNA 1 was obtained from Dharmacon (catalogue number D-001810-01-05). RNAi reagents were transfected with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. To avoid the addition of organic solvents to the cell culture medium, solutions containing fatty acid sodium salts bound to albumin were prepared from stock solutions of the fatty acid sodium salt (100 mm) and fatty acid-free BSA (2%). For example, 28 mg of sodium palmitate was dissolved in 1 ml of sterile H2O at 70 °C, and this solution was added to cell culture medium containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA. These solutions were used after filtration through 0.22-μm filters. Caspase-2 activity assays were performed according to the BioVision caspase-2 colorimetric assay kit specifications. For flow cytometric analysis of cell death, cells were collected, resuspended in 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (dissolved in PBS), and kept on ice until analysis. 293T cells were treated with 2% BSA or 2% BSA + 1 mm palmitate for 18 h before lysis by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13.2 rpm, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. 500 μl of 8 mg/ml lysates was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min to collect fractions. Anti-caspase-2 (polyclonal; 1:1000) was purchased from Abcam (ab7979); anti-caspase-2 (monoclonal; 1:1000) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Clone G310–1248), and anti-actin (polyclonal; 1:1000) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (I-19). Aminooxyacetate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 10 mm. d-Glucose 6-phosphate sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 20 mm. Triacsin C, etomoxir, and fatty acid sodium salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the exception of sodium palmitoleate, which was purchased from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. Bovine serum albumin (Fraction V; heat shock; fatty acid ultra-free) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Active caspase-2 has been shown to trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release in a number of settings, and we have shown that it is required upstream of mitochondria to induce cell-free apoptosis in the Xenopus egg extract system (21Nutt L.K. Margolis S.S. Jensen M. Herman C.E. Dunphy W.G. Rathmell J.C. Kornbluth S. Metabolic regulation of oocyte cell death through the CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-2.Cell. 2005; 123: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We initially observed that activation of caspase-2 in this setting could be blocked by supplementing egg extract with metabolic intermediates, suggesting that metabolic changes preceded caspase-2 activation. However, the precise nature of these metabolic changes was unclear. Thus, in an effort to understand the mechanisms underlying caspase-2 activation, we performed metabolomics on Xenopus egg extract, comparing fresh, unaged extract with extract incubated at room temperature for several hours and harvested just prior to caspase-2 activation (aged). All samples were analyzed for amino acid, organic acid, and acylcarnitine changes. In agreement with previous studies on egg metabolism, the two most abundant amino acids in Xenopus egg extract were aspartate and glutamate (28Shiokawa K. Tashiro K. Atsuchi Y. Kawazoe Y. Alteration of the pool of free amino acids during oogenesis, oocyte maturation and embryogenesis of Xenopus laevisXenopus borealis.Zool. Sci. 1986; 3: 793-799Google Scholar, 29Vastag L. Jorgensen P. Peshkin L. Wei R. Rabinowitz J.D. Kirschner M.W. Remodeling of the metabolome during early frog development.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon room temperature incubation of the extract, we observed a notable decrease in aspartate along with a corresponding increase in alanine with very little change in the other amino acids profiled (Fig. 1A). These changes are likely occurring via transamination reactions whereby aspartate is converted to oxaloacetate and pyruvate is converted to alanine via transamination of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, respectively (Fig. 1B). The decrease in aspartate suggests that this amino acid is likely serving as a carbon source to support extract metabolism as has been shown previously in intact Xenopus eggs (24Dworkin M.B. Dworkin-Rastl E. Regulation of carbon flux from amino acids into sugar phosphates in Xenopus embryos.Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also observed changes in the organic acid profile of fresh and aged extracts, including an increase in both pyruvate and lactate following extract incubation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle decreased moderately with the exception of succinate, which showed significant accumulation (Fig. 1C). Increased levels of succinate are often observed under conditions in which the electron transport chain is inhibited (30Folbergrová J. Ljunggren B. Norberg K. Siesjö B.K.

Metabolite profiles reveal energy failure and impaired β-oxidation in liver of mice with complex III deficiency due to a BCS1L mutation.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e41156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hypoxia (or the lack of oxygen) has been shown to inhibit electron transport chain function as well as result in increased levels of succinate. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, the formation of succinate has been shown to be coupled to amino acid utilization, specifically that of aspartate and glutamate (33Hochachka P.W. Owen T.G. Allen J.F. Whittow G.C. Multiple end products of anaerobiosis in diving vertebrates.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1975; 50: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Taegtmeyer H. Metabolic responses to cardiac hypoxia. Increased production of succinate by rabbit papillary muscles.Circ. Res. 1978; 43: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Given the similarities between these observations and our data, we wanted to determine whether there were any other metabolic changes that might indicate a loss of mitochondrial respiration. Because electron transport chain inhibition results in a block in β-oxidation and a decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio, we examined both the lipid profile and redox status of incubated extract. Consistent with a lack of electron transport chain function, we observed an accumulation of multiple long-chain acylcarnitines reflective of the long-chain acyl-CoA pools as well as a progressive decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio following extract incubation (Fig. 1, D and E). Furthermore, because changes in the cytosolic levels of NADH and NAD+ are reflected in the balance between lactate and pyruvate, we assessed the lactate/pyruvate ratio and found that the ratio was significantly increased from 17.3 to 188.7 in aged extracts, supporting the observed accumulation of NADH. Given these data, we wanted to more directly assess whether the extract might be experiencing hypoxia. Rather than assessing the dissolved oxygen content in the extract as a readout of hypoxia as it would be hard to define what dissolved oxygen percentage in egg extracts would result in hypoxic phenotypes, we chose to more directly assess mitochondrial respiration. Using the Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular flux analyzer, we monitored the O2 consumption rate of aging egg extracts for 4 h. Indeed, extracts showed little O2 consumption with respiration virtually going to zero over time (Fig. 1F). Together, these data suggest that the observed metabolic changes are linked to inhibited mitochondrial respiration, including the formation of succinate from the amino acid aspartate, the buildup of NADH, and the accumulation of LCFA metabolites (acylcarnitines/acyl-CoAs). Because we knew from previous studies that the activation of caspase-2 and downstream apoptotic events could be blocked in this system by supplementing the extract with metabolic intermediates (21Nutt L.K. Margolis S.S. Jensen M. Herman C.E. Dunphy W.G. Rathmell J.C. Kornbluth S. Metabolic regulation of oocyte cell death through the CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-2.Cell. 2005; 123: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we postulated that one of these underlying metabolic changes might be triggering caspase-2 activation. Given the potential dependence of the egg extract on amino acid utilization and previous observations that hypoxia-induced succinate formation could be abrogated by inhibiting transamination reactions (34Taegtmeyer H. Metabolic responses to cardiac hypoxia. Increased production of succinate by rabbit papillary muscles.Circ. Res. 1978; 43: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the inhibition of transaminase activity would affect caspase activation in the extract. To test this, we treated the extract with the general transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate (AOA) and monitored caspase-2 activity via cleavage of the model substrate, VDVAD-pNA, over time. Surprisingly, the inhibition of transaminase activity suppressed VDVAD cleavage activity in the extract (Fig. 2A; note that the absolute time course of caspase activation varies from extract to extract, but the relative rates of caspase activation following different treatments is constant). We also found that caspase-2 processing, which occurs following caspase-2 activation as a means to stabilize the active dimeric protease, was suppressed by AOA treatment (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, downstream activation of the executioner caspase, caspase-3, was also suppressed by AOA treatment (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the loss of amino acid transamination can suppress caspase activation in the extract. In an effort to understand how inhibition of amino acid transamination can suppress caspase activation, we compared the metabolic profiles of extracts treated with and without AOA. AOA caused aspartate and alanine levels to return to basal levels in aged extracts, consistent with our suggestion that the changes in these amino acids are driven by aspartate transamination and further catabolism (Fig. 3A). Treatment of extracts with AOA caused a substantial decrease in TCA cycle intermedia"
https://openalex.org/W2022791047,"The binding of selectins to carbohydrate ligands expressed on leukocytes regulates immunity and inflammation. Among the human selectin ligands, the O-linked glycans at the N-terminus of the leukocyte cell-surface molecule P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, CD162) are important because they bind all selectins (L-, E-, and P-selectin) with high affinity under hydrodynamic shear conditions. Analysis of glycan microheterogeneity at this site is complicated by the presence of 72 additional potential O-linked glycosylation sites on this mucinous protein. To overcome this limitation, truncated forms of PSGL-1, called ""PSGL-1 peptide probes,"" were developed. Ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometry analysis of glycans released from such probes along with glycoproteomic analysis demonstrate the presence of both the sialyl Lewis-X (sLe(X)) and the di-sialylated T-antigen (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3(NeuAcα2,6)GalNAc) at the PSGL-1 N-terminus. Overexpression of glycoprotein-specific ST6GalNAc-transferases (ST6GalNAc1, -2, or -4) in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells altered glycan structures and cell adhesion properties. In particular, ST6GalNAc2 overexpression abrogated cell surface HECA-452/CLA expression, reduced the number of rolling leukocytes on P- and L-selectin-bearing substrates by ~85%, and increased median rolling velocity of remaining cells by 80-150%. Cell rolling on E-selectin was unaltered although the number of adherent cells was reduced by 60%. ST6GalNAc2 partially co-localizes in the Golgi with the core-2 β(1,6)GlcNAc-transferase C2GnT-1. Overall, the data describe the glycan microheterogeneity at the PSGL-1 N-terminus. They suggest that a competition between ST6GalNAc2 and C2GnT-1 for the core-1/Galβ1,3GalNAc glycan may regulate leukocyte adhesion under fluid shear."
https://openalex.org/W2092559596,"The PSII repair cycle is required for sustainable photosynthesis in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. In cyanobacteria and higher plants, proteolysis of the precursor D1 protein (pD1) to expose a C-terminal carboxylate group is an essential step leading to coordination of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, the site of water oxidation. Psb27 appears to associate with both pD1- and D1-containing PSII assembly intermediates by closely interacting with CP43. Here, we report that reduced binding affinity between CP43 and Psb27 is triggered by the removal of the C-terminal extension of the pD1 protein. A mass spectrometry-based footprinting strategy was adopted to probe solvent-exposed aspartic and glutamic acid residues on the CP43 protein. By comparing the extent of footprinting between HT3ΔctpAΔ27PSII and HT3ΔctpAPSII, two genetically modified PSII assembly complexes, we found that Psb27 binds to CP43 on the side of Loop E distal to the pseudo-symmetrical D1-D2 axis. By comparing a second pair of PSII assembly complexes, we discovered that Loop E of CP43 undergoes a significant conformational rearrangement due to the removal of the pD1 C-terminal extension, altering the Psb27-CP43 binding interface. The significance of this conformational rearrangement is discussed in the context of recruitment of the PSII lumenal extrinsic proteins and Mn4CaO5 cluster assembly. In addition to CP43's previously known function as one of the core PSII antenna proteins, this work demonstrates that Loop E of CP43 plays an important role in the functional assembly of the Water Oxidizing Center (WOC) during PSII biogenesis."

MSCs were activated with concanavalin A (ConA), a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-6 agonist as well as a membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) inducer, which increased granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF, CSF-2), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF, CSF-3), and MT1-MMP gene expression. EGCG antagonized the ConA-induced CSF-2 and CSF-3 gene expression, and this process required an MT1-MMP-mediated sequential activation of the Src and JAK/STAT pathways.

The Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixK2 protein (16Mesa S. Hauser F. Friberg M. Malaguti E. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a key regulator for the control of >200 genes required for microoxic, anoxic, and symbiotic growth. In root nodule symbiosis with soybean, the bacterium fixes molecular nitrogen. FixK2 belongs to the FixK subgroup of the CRP/FNR superfamily, but as opposed to other superfamily members, evidence for the involvement of a coregulator in modulating the transcription-activating activity is missing. The FixK2 amino acid sequence lacks a predicted binding site for a cofactor, and more importantly, purified protein from aerobically grown FixK2-overproducing Escherichia coli cells is active as a homodimer in an in vitro transcription (IVT) activation assay without a recognizable coactivator (18Mesa S. Ucurum Z. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory protein FixK2.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, FixK2 activity is influenced but in a different way. Due to a unique cysteine at position 183 near the HTH motif of the DNA-binding domain, FixK2 is oxidation-sensitive. Oxidation of this cysteine in vitro triggers the formation of a reversible intermolecular disulfide bridge between two monomers. In vivo, however, the more likely oxidation mechanism is the conversion of the cysteine thiol into a sulfenic, sulfinic, or sulfonic acid, which inactivates the protein (19Mesa S. Reutimann L. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Posttranslational control of transcription factor FixK2, a key regulator for the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21860-21865Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The relevance of FixK2 oxidation in vivo is based on indirect evidence. In particular, microarray analysis had shown that most of the direct FixK2-activatable target genes displayed decreased expression in hydrogen peroxide-stressed B. japonicum wild-type cells, but not in a strain having a FixK2 variant with Cys-183 replaced by alanine (19Mesa S. Reutimann L. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Posttranslational control of transcription factor FixK2, a key regulator for the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21860-21865Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). FixK2 oxidation might be relevant for instantly shutting off its activity in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo. ROS are produced (i) in the early stage of root hair infection, (ii) in the process of endosymbiotic respiration, and (iii) late during nodule senescence (20Pauly N. Pucciariello C. Mandon K. Innocenti G. Jamet A. Baudouin E. Hérouart D. Frendo P. Puppo A. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and glutathione: key players in the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis.J. Exp.

Oxidative burst in alfalfa-Sinorhizobium meliloti symbiotic interaction.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In all of these conditions, FixK2 activity might not be either necessary or desirable. Apart from this oxidative post-translational control, FixK2 is also subject to proteolysis. We have recently shown that FixK2 is degraded by the housekeeping chaperone protease ClpAP1 and that the preferential protease-sensitive site is located at the C terminus (23Bonnet M. Stegmann M. Maglica Ž. Stiegeler E. Weber-Ban E. Hennecke H. Mesa S. FixK2, a key regulator in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, is a substrate for the protease ClpAP in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to crystallize FixK2 and to determine its structure by x-ray crystallography. We hoped that this would help us understand how the oxidation of Cys-183 interferes with FixK2 activity and why the C terminus is prone to proteolysis. Moreover, as it turned out that crystals were formed only when FixK2 was complexed with DNA, the structure also uncovered the precise protein-DNA contact sites. The Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method was used to exchange the codon for Cys-183 against a serine codon using the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GATGGCGCTGCCGATGTCCCGCCGCGATATCGGCG-3′ and 3′-CGCCGATATCGCGGCGGGACATCGGCAGCGCCATC-5′ (with the serine codons underlined) and pRJ9058 (18Mesa S. Ucurum Z. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory protein FixK2.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as a template, which yielded plasmid pRJ8848. To construct the plasmid coding for N-terminally fused His6-tagged FixK2(C183S), the fixK2-containing DNA fragment was cut out with NdeI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned in-frame with the His6 tag DNA into pET-28b(+) (Novagen), yielding plasmid pRJ8850. To obtain C-terminally fused His6-tagged FixK2(C183S), the fixK2 gene was first amplified by PCR from pRJ8848 with the appropriate primers (forward, 5′-GCGCATATGCTGACCCAGACAC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGGCGGCCGCGGCGTCGAGATTGTGCAGGC-3′), which contained sequences for the NdeI and NotI restriction sites (underlined). The PCR-amplified DNA was then cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), cut out with the aforementioned enzymes, and cloned in-frame with the His6 tag DNA into pET-24c(+) (Novagen), yielding the consecutive plasmids pRJ0003 and pRJ0004. All fusion constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The His6-FixK2(C183S) and FixK2(C183S)-His6 proteins, carrying the N- and C-terminal His6 tags, respectively, were expressed and purified as described previously (18Mesa S. Ucurum Z. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory protein FixK2.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) unless specified otherwise (see below). Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled FixK2(C183S)-His6 was generated using the methionine auxotrophic E. coli B834(DE3) strain (Novagen). The recombinant strain was grown in SelenoMetTM medium (Molecular Dimensions Ltd., Newmarket, United Kingdom) at 30 °C for 3 h. SeMet-labeled FixK2(C183S)-His6 was purified in the same way as the unlabeled protein. SeMet had replaced all eight methionines as confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. Multiple-round IVT activation was carried out at 37 °C as described previously (18Mesa S. Ucurum Z. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory protein FixK2.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1–1 μm FixK2(C183S)-His6 in modified IVT buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 150 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) plus the four nucleotide triphosphates was incubated in the presence of 50 nm B. japonicum RNA polymerase (holoenzyme) and 20 nm template plasmid pRJ8816 at 37 °C for 30 min. This plasmid harbors the fixN promoter region and a small part of the fixN gene upstream of a B. japonicum transcription terminator from the rrn operon. The electrophoretically separated transcripts were analyzed using a PhosphorImager SF system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and signal intensities were determined with the Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Unlabeled native and SeMet-labeled FixK2(C183S)-His6 were crystallized in the presence of 30-mer double-stranded target DNA from the FixK2-binding site of the fixN promoter (CCACCTATCTTGATTTCAATCAATTCCCCG, with the two binding half-sites underlined). This fixN oligonucleotide (1 μm scale; Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) was prepared by heating equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded DNAs at 98 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling the mixture down to room temperature afterward. The proteins (9 mg/ml) that had been purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography were mixed with a 1.5-fold molar excess of fixN double-stranded DNA and incubated for 5 min on ice. The protein-DNA complex formed was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 HR column (GE Healthcare) with modified IVT buffer as the running buffer and concentrated using a Microcon membrane (Millipore) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. Crystals of both the native and SeMet-labeled FixK2 derivatives complexed with DNA (185 mg of complex/ml) were grown at 277 K by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in 0.1 m BisTris (pH 6), 0.1 m NH4 acetate, and 16–22% PEG 10,000 for a period of 2–4 days. The complex crystallized as a protein dimer bound to DNA, and the crystals were thin and plate-like (Fig. 1). Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid propane after sequential soaking in mother liquor containing 5–20% PEG 400. Diffraction data were collected at 90 K at the Swiss Light Source X06SA beamline (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) using a PILATUS 6M detector (Dectris AG, Baden, Switzerland) at wavelengths of 1 Å (native protein) and 0.997 Å (SeMet derivative). The FixK2 structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using the SeMet-labeled protein. Data for the native and SeMet proteins were processed using the XDS software package (24Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11222) Google Scholar). The SeMet positions were located using the SHELX program suite (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Substructure solution with SHELXD.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23218) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined first with PHENIX and then with REFMAC5 from CCP4i (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13851) Google Scholar), including TLS refinement. The structure of FixK2(C183S)-His6 includes amino acids 38–232 (both monomers) of the mature 232-amino acid protein, with one FixK2 dimer in the asymmetric unit. No density was observed for N-terminal residues 1–37 in either monomer. The four additional C-terminal residues are part of the linker region between the protein and the His6 affinity tag, which itself is not visible in the structure. 25 and 24 of the 30 bp of the bound fixN promoter double-stranded DNA were structurally assigned (strands W and X, respectively). The nucleotides at both ends that could not be assigned will be addressed below (i.e. two at the 5′-end and three at the 3′-end of strand W; two at the 3′-end and four at the 5′-end of strand X). MolProbity was used to assess the quality of the crystal structure. The data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Structural figures were generated using PyMOL. Secondary structure matching (SSM), implemented in Coot, was used to compare the FixK2 structure with other structures of the protein superfamily.TABLE 1Statistics of data collection and structural refinement of native and SeMet-labeled FixK2(C183S)-His6-DNA complexesSeMet-Labeled FixK2(C183S)-His6 (SAD data)Native FixK2(C183S)-His6Data collectionWavelength (Å)0.979611.00002Resolution range (Å)43.97–3.00 (3.08–3.00)43.58–1.77 (1.83–1.77)Space groupP1211P1211Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)111.48, 43.97, 69.92111.33, 43.88, 70.11α, β, γ90°, 89.98°, 90°90°, 90.04°, 90°Unique reflections26,587 (1987)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.66,473 (6610)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.Redundancy9.5 (9.5)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.6.6 (6.8)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.Completeness (%)99.9 (100)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.99.7 (100)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.〈I/σ(I)〉17.08 (4.66)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.21.82 (3.8)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.RefinementNo. of reflections (work set/test set)66,510/3315R factorbR factor = Σh|Fo − Fc|/Σh|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for each reflection h./RfreecRfree was calculated for a randomly selected 10% of data omitted from refinement.

Open table in a new tab Two major obstacles stood in the way of crystallization of FixK2: the oxidation sensitivity of the protein and its sensitivity to proteolysis. Initially, N-terminally His6-tagged wild-type FixK2 was used, which failed to produce crystals. Static light scattering analyses revealed that the protein solution was highly polydisperse (data not shown), likely reflecting the monomer-dimer equilibrium of FixK2 (18Mesa S. Ucurum Z. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory protein FixK2.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the different oxidation states at Cys-183 (19Mesa S. Reutimann L. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Posttranslational control of transcription factor FixK2, a key regulator for the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21860-21865Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To avoid oxidation, Cys-183 was exchanged with serine, resulting in the N-terminally His6-tagged construct (His6-FixK2(C183S)). This protein variant was active in an IVT activation assay and resistant to oxidation (data not shown), but it did not crystallize either. Furthermore, His6-FixK2(C183S) copurified with a truncated form, which was identified by mass spectrometry as a 220-amino acid derivative lacking 12 amino acids from the C terminus (named His6-FixK2(C183S)-220) (Fig. 2a). Although this cleaved variant remained soluble, it was inactive in the IVT activation test (data not shown). Exchange of Val-220 and Leu-221 before and after the cleavage site with asparagine or threonine did not abolish cleavage. Cleavage was prevented, however, by using the C-terminally His6-tagged FixK2 variant (FixK2(C183S)-His6). This variant was purified with high yield as an apparently homogeneous full-length protein (molecular mass of 26,883 Da) (Fig. 2a). Despite the relative proximity of the His6 tag to the DNA-binding domain, the FixK2(C183S)-His6 variant was active in the IVT activation assay (Fig. 2b) and was successfully used in subsequent crystallization trials. As of today, three structures of proteins from the CRP/FNR family are available in their cofactor-free apo form (6Sharma H. Yu S. Kong J. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is associated with the disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the nature of the signals activating UPR under these conditions remains largely unknown. Using a method that we recently optimized to directly measure UPR sensor activation, we screened the effect of various metabolic drugs on UPR activation and show that the anti-diabetic drug phenformin activates UPR sensors IRE1α and pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) in both an ER-dependent and ER-independent manner. Mechanistically, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation is required but not sufficient to initiate phenformin-mediated IRE1α and PERK activation, suggesting the involvement of additional factor(s). Interestingly, activation of the IRE1α (but not PERK) pathway is partially responsible for the cytotoxic effect of phenformin. Together, our data show the existence of a non-canonical UPR whose activation requires the cytosolic kinase AMPK, adding another layer of complexity to UPR activation upon metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2137941843,"Trypanosoma brucei sp. causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; African sleeping sickness). The parasites initially proliferate in the hemolymphatic system and then invade the central nervous system, which is lethal if not treated. New drugs are needed for HAT because the approved drugs are few, toxic, and difficult to administer, and drug resistance is spreading. We showed by RNAi knockdown that T. brucei isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is essential for the parasites in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of infection. By structure prediction and experimental analysis, we also identified small molecules that inhibit recombinant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and that are lethal to the parasites in vitro and highly selective compared with mammalian cells. One of these molecules acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme and cures mice of the infection. Because members of this class of molecules are known to cross the blood-brain barrier in humans and to be tolerated, they may be attractive as leading candidates for drug development for HAT."

Here, we identify and characterize M. smegmatis Lhr as the exemplar of a novel clade of superfamily II helicases, by virtue of its biochemical specificities and signature domain organization. Lhr is a 1507-amino acid monomeric nucleic acid-dependent ATPase that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive unidirectional 3'-to-5' translocation along single strand DNA and to unwind duplexes en route. The ATPase is more active in the presence of calcium than magnesium. ATP hydrolysis is triggered by either single strand DNA or single strand RNA, yet the apparent affinity for a DNA activator is 11-fold higher than for an RNA strand of identical size and nucleobase sequence. Lhr is 8-fold better at unwinding an RNA:DNA hybrid than it is at displacing a DNA:DNA duplex of identical nucleobase sequence. The truncated derivative Lhr-(1-856) is an autonomous ATPase, 3'-to-5' translocase, and RNA:DNA helicase. Lhr-(1-856) is 100-fold better RNA:DNA helicase than DNA:DNA helicase. Lhr homologs are found in bacteria representing eight different phyla, being especially prevalent in Actinobacteria (including M. tuberculosis) and Proteobacteria (including Escherichia coli)."
https://openalex.org/W2076978443,"Multimodal activation by various stimuli is a fundamental characteristic of TRP channels. We identified a fungal TRP channel, TRPGz, exhibiting activation by hyperosmolarity, temperature increase, cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation, membrane potential, and H2O2 application, and thus it is expected to represent a prototypic multimodal TRP channel. TRPGz possesses a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD), primarily composed of intrinsically disordered regions with some regulatory modules, a putative coiled-coil region and a basic residue cluster. The CTD oligomerization mediated by the coiled-coil region is required for the hyperosmotic and temperature increase activations but not for the tetrameric channel formation or other activation modalities. In contrast, the basic cluster is responsible for general channel inhibition, by binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The crystal structure of the presumed coiled-coil region revealed a tetrameric assembly in an offset spiral rather than a canonical coiled-coil. This structure underlies the observed moderate oligomerization affinity enabling the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the CTD during channel functions, which are compatible with the multimodal regulation mediated by each functional module."

The uncharged form, NH3, diffuses across lipid bilayers more than 35 times faster than water (1Walter A. Gutknecht J. Permeability of small nonelectrolytes through lipid bilayer membranes.J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). When the rate of NH3 diffusion becomes growth limiting protein-mediated transport of ammonium by the Amt family of channels is required (2Andrade S.L. Einsle O.

It has been proposed that this twin-histidine element plays a critical role in mediating substrate transport (7Khademi S. O'Connell 3rd, J. Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M.

However, recent work by one of us demonstrated that the E. coli AmtB protein can accommodate acidic residues at one or both positions of its His168/His318 twin-histidine pairing while retaining good to excellent ammonium transport activity (14Hall J.A.

Here, we report that certain AmtB twin-histidine variants are gain-of-function mutants that conduct K+, a cation having an ionic radius similar to that of NH4+ but normally not transported by Amt proteins (17Ludewig U. von Wirén N.

Our analysis shows that the twin-histidine element serves as a substrate selectivity filter and leads us to suggest that Amt channels utilize an electrogenic transport mechanism in which ammonium crosses the phenyl ring constriction as NH4+, deprotonates and traverses the conduction pore in close association with its H+, and finally reprotonates prior to entering the cytoplasm.

The three AmtB variants studied here were produced in amounts similar to that of the wild-type strain (60–100%) when glutamine served as the sole nitrogen source (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). However, whereas AmtBH168D and AmtBH318D accumulated to 30–40% wild-type levels under this growth condition, AmtBH168D,H318E was present in amounts ≤5% of its wild-type counterpart.

To analyze K+ uptake, resuspended cells were washed twice and finally suspended at an A600 = 1.0 in Na+-based N−C− medium containing 100 mm NaCl, and then treated with 5 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol for 30 min.

K+-depleted cells were harvested, washed twice with Na+-based N−C− medium supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, resuspended at an A600 = 1.0 in the same medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, and held on ice until use. To initiate tests of K+ transport, cell suspensions were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of an equal volume of Na+-based N−C− medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and suitable mixtures of KCl, NH4Cl, and NaCl (combined concentration of 100 mm). After a 1 min incubation aliquots were collected on Millipore filters (0.45-μm pore size; type HAWP), rinsed twice with 5 ml of Na+-based N−C− medium supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, and dried.

In addition to modified LDL, free cholesterol (FC) is thought to play an important role in the development of endothelial dysfunction, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction induced by an FC-rich environment. Loading cultured human aortic endothelial cells with FC induced the formation of vesicular structures composed of FC-rich membranes. Raft proteins such as phospho-caveolin-1 (Tyr-14) and small GTPase Rac were accumulated toward FC-rich membranes around vesicular structures. In the presence of these vesicles, angiotensin II-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was considerably enhanced. This ROS shifted endothelial NOS (eNOS) toward vesicle membranes and vesicles with a FC-rich domain trafficked toward perinuclear late endosomes/lysosomes, which resulted in the deterioration of eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation and NO production. Angiotensin II-induced ROS decreased the bioavailability of eNOS under the FC-enriched condition."

In this study, we investigated the homeostasis of GABA metabolism by disrupting genes related to GABA metabolism and signaling. Extracellular levels of GABA are tightly regulated during early development, and GABA is generated by the glutamate decarboxylase, GadB, during growth and in early development. However, overexpression of the prespore-specific homologue, GadA, in the presence of GadB reduces production of extracellular GABA. Perturbation of extracellular GABA levels delays the process of aggregation. Cytosolic GABA is degraded by the GABA transaminase, GabT, in the mitochondria. Disruption of a putative vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) homologue DdvGAT reduces secreted GABA. We identified the GABAB receptor-like family member GrlB as the major GABA receptor during early development, and either disruption or overexpression of GrlB delays aggregation. This delay is likely the result of an abolished pre-starvation response and late expression of several ""early"" developmental genes. Distinct genes are employed for GABA generation during sporulation. During sporulation, GadA alone is required for generating GABA and DdvGAT is likely responsible for GABA secretion. GrlE but not GrlB is the GABA receptor during late development."

By weekly stimulations of T lymphocytes harvested from seven HLA-DR-typed healthy donors, we derived CD4+ T cell lines specific for eight MDK peptides. Most of the T cell lines reacted with the peptides 9–23 and 14–28, located in and overlapping the MDK signal peptide, respectively. Accordingly, the MDK signal peptide appeared to be rich in good binders to common HLA-DR molecules. The peptide 9–23-specific T cell lines were specifically stimulated by autologous dendritic cells loaded with lysates of MDK-transfected cells or with lysates of tumor cells naturally expressing the MDK protein. One T cell line was stimulated by HLA-compatible MDK-transfected tumor cells. By contrast, the peptide 14–28-specific T cell lines were not stimulated in any of these conditions. Our data demonstrate that CD4+ T cell epitopes present in the signal peptide can be accessible to recognition by CD4+ T cells and may therefore contribute to tumor immunity, whereas a peptide overlapping the junction between the signal peptide and the mature protein is not.

They function as modules that mediate the interaction between proteins by recognizing a phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) in the target proteins. Structural and quantitative binding analyses of many SH2 domains in complexes with related ligand peptides have shown that SH2 domains generally recognize Tyr(P) with three amino acid residues toward the C terminus (Tyr(P)-Xaa1-Xaa2-Xaa3) of the target ligands using two recognition pockets on the surface of the SH2 domains (1Waksman G.

One pocket recognizes Tyr(P) of the target primarily through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, whereas the other recognizes the remaining three amino acids (Xaa1-Xaa2-Xaa3) specifically through hydrophobic interactions. This specificity is considered to generate versatility in the interaction of SH2 domains (5Piccione E. Case R.D. Domchek S.M. Hu P. Chaudhuri M. Backer J.M. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E.

However, it is still controversial whether the latter pocket alone is sufficient to determine the specificity of the associated interactions (4Pawson T. Nash P.

The protein C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) includes SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. This kinase specifically phosphorylates a regulatory Tyr in the C-terminal tail of Src Tyr kinases (SFKs) (8Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Constitutive activation of Src family kinases in mouse embryos that lack Csk.Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 9Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A.

Cloning of a complementary DNA for a protein-tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates a negative regulatory site of p60c-src.Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This event leads to an intramolecular interaction between the Tyr(P)-containing tail and the SH2 domain of the phosphorylated SFK, shifting it to an inactive closed conformation. Thus, Csk negatively regulates the kinase activity of SFKs and plays an important role in physiological functions via signaling pathways for cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration (10Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Negative regulation of T-cell receptor signalling by tyrosine protein kinase p50csk.Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although SFKs are anchored to membranes via their fatty-acylated N termini, Csk, which lacks such a fatty acylation site, exists in the cytoplasm (9Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Cloning of a complementary DNA for a protein-tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates a negative regulatory site of p60c-src.Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Thus, for Csk to efficiently access SFKs, Csk interacts with the Csk-binding protein (Cbp/PAG), which is localized to membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and lipid rafts, and it is subsequently recruited to the reaction space (11Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M.

Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This interaction is known to occur between the SH2 domain of Csk and the SFK-phosphorylated Tyr-314 of Cbp, but it remains unknown whether any other region in Cbp is involved in the interaction (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. Transmembrane phosphoprotein Cbp positively regulates the activity of the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase, Csk.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike SFKs, which conserve specific Tyr in their C-terminal tails for regulating activity, Csk lacks such a functional tail (9Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Cloning of a complementary DNA for a protein-tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates a negative regulatory site of p60c-src.Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the crystal structure of Csk by itself exhibited the existence of two conformers corresponding to active and inactive forms (14Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. Structure of the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase, Csk.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Csk activation is described in detail in a previous review (15Ia K.K. Mills R.D. Hossain M.I. Chan K.C. Jarasrassamee B. Jorissen R.N. Cheng H.C. Structural elements and allosteric mechanisms governing regulation and catalysis of CSK-family kinases and their inhibition of Src-family kinases.Growth Factors. 2010; 28: 329-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain appears to be required for stabilizing the active form of Csk through connection between the βB/βC loop (SH2) and the β3/αC loop (kinase). It was also reported that Csk activity is increased through interactions with phosphorylated Cbp or its peptides (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M.

Therefore, it can be speculated that Cbp binding shifts the dynamic equilibrium of at least these two conformers to the more active form. However, the mechanism through which Cbp binding increases Csk activity remains unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms, we first analyzed the interaction of Csk with various lengths of Tyr-314-containing regions of Cbp using gel filtration chromatography. On the basis of this biochemical result, we determined the tertiary solution structure of the complex of Csk-SH2 with a region of Cbp that contained both Tyr-296 and Tyr(P)-314 using liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We found that Csk recognizes not only the four canonical amino acids beginning with Tyr(P)-314 but also a region on the N-terminal side of Tyr(P)-314 that contains Tyr-296. The DNA fragment for rat Cbp peptide (from 289 to 321; Cbp5) was amplified using the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare) containing the DNA fragment encoding the region from 195 to 328 of Cbp (Cbp3) by PCR using 5′-CGC GGA TCC AAG AGA TTT AGT TCC TTG TCA-3′ and 5′-GGC GAA TTC CTA TCC AGG CTT ATT CAC TGA AGA-3′ as primers (Fig. 1A). The amplified DNA fragment was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI, and the resulting gene was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-6P-1. The pGEX-6P-1 plasmid containing the DNA fragment encoding the region from 302 to 321 of Cbp (Cbp6) or a mutant of Cbp5 (Y296F) was produced by the same method as described above using the following primers: 5′-CGC GGA TCC CCA ACT CTT ACA GAA GAG GAG-3′ and 5′-GGC GAA TTC CTA TCC AGG CTT ATT CAC TGA AGA-3′ for Cbp6 and 5′-CGC GGA TCC AAG AGA TTT AGT TCC TTG TCA TTC AAG TCT CGA-3′ and 5′-GGC GAA TTC CTA TCC AGG CTT ATT CAC TGA AGA-3′ for Cbp5-Y296F. The DNA fragment encoding the region from 312 to 321 of Cbp (Cbp7) was amplified by annealing 5′-GATCC ATG TAT TCT TCA GTG AAT AAG CCT GGA TAG G-3′ and 5′-ATTTC CTA TCC AGG CTT ATT CAC TGA AGA ATA CAT G-3′, and the amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-6P-1. For a doubly phosphorylated Tyr(P)-296/Tyr(P)-314 peptide, a synthetic product (TORAY) was used. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pGEX-6P-1 containing DNA encoding each of the Cbp peptides and grown in LB media. The cells were incubated at 25 °C with shaking at 240 rpm for 12 h. The expression of GST-fused Cbp peptides was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm when the absorbance at 600 nm was between 0.3 and 0.6. The cells were further incubated overnight, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. For purification, the cells were dissolved at 4 °C and disrupted by sonication in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer). After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the GSTrap FF affinity column (GE Healthcare), and adsorbed proteins were eluted using lysis buffer (pH 9.0) containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. All purified GST-Cbp fusion proteins were phosphorylated using recombinant Fyn (Millipore) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 mm ATP. Full-length (amino acids 1–450) rat Csk was expressed using a baculovirus vector in Sf9 insect cells, as described previously (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. Transmembrane phosphoprotein Cbp positively regulates the activity of the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase, Csk.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed using the above-mentioned lysis buffer containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque) and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and applied to the HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% octyl-d-glucoside (buffer A). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 75–300 mm NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were applied to the HiTrap SP HP cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The protein, eluted with a linear gradient of 50–300 mm NaCl, was applied to the Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). To obtain 13C- and 15N-labeled proteins, E. coli Origami B(DE3) cells were transformed with pGEX-6P-1(GE Healthcare) containing the gene of Csk-SH2 and were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2.0 g/liter d-[U-13C6]glucose, as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. For the expression of uniformly 15N-labeled proteins, d-[U-13C6]glucose was replaced with 4.0 g/liter d-glucose, and 0.1% glycerol was added to the minimal medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking. The expression of proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the absorbance of cells reached an A600 of 0.6. Bacteria were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernatant solution was passed through the DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) to remove contaminating nucleic acids. The eluate was applied to the GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), and the proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluate was dialyzed for a few hours at 4 °C against 2 liters of the sonication buffer. After addition of 20 μl of PreScission protease (2 units/μl; GE Healthcare) to the solution, it was further dialyzed over 17 h for cleavage of the fusion proteins. In some cases, GST was cut off by the same protease before elution of the fusion protein from the GSTrap FF column during overnight incubation at 4 °C. The proteins were concentrated using an Amicon ultra-4-centrifugal filter unit (Millipore; molecular cutoff, 3000) and were applied to the Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) with a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) containing 50 mm NaCl. The obtained protein (Csk-SH2) ranged from Met-80 to Met-173 with a tag derived from the expression vector (H2N-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-) attached to the N terminus. Protein concentration was estimated using absorbance at 280 nm (A280) with the calculated molar absorption coefficient of 16,000. The Cbp5 peptide was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Takara) as a fusion protein with GST, which was labeled with 13C- and 15N-stable isotopes. The procedures for expression and purification were almost the same as those for Csk-SH2. After elution from the GSTrap FF column, the eluate was diluted with the same amount of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The solution was applied to the HiTrap DEAE FF anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), and the Cbp peptide was phosphorylated by addition of Fyn and ATP prior to removal of GST. A solution containing Csk-SH2 and Cbp5 was applied to the gel filtration column, and the fractions containing the complex were collected. Each peptide was mixed with equimolar intact Csk or Csk-SH2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 150 mm NaCl or 1 m (NH4)2SO4, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% octyl-d-glucoside with or without ATP. The solution was applied to the Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column; A280 was monitored, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The synthesized peptide and Csk were mixed in a molar ratio of 2:1, and the mixture was assayed as described above. All NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K, except the three-dimensional aromatic 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), which was performed at 288 K (20Lin Z. Xu Y. Yang S. Yang D.

For assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances, a series of two- and three-dimensional experiments were performed (21Bax A.

Two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single- quantum correlation (HSQC), three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and HBHA(CBCACO)NH spectra were acquired for assignment of backbone signals. For assignment of the aliphatic side-chain signals, two-dimensional 1H-13C constant time HSQC, three-dimensional 15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) with a mixing time of 79.4 ms, HCCH-TOCSY with a mixing time of 22.6 ms, and C(CO)NH and H(CCO)NH with a mixing time of 22.6 ms spectra were used. For assignment of the aromatic side-chain signals, two-dimensional 1H-1H double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (22Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. Multiple quantum filters for elucidating NMR coupling networks.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 23Shaka A.J. Freeman R.

Rapid-pulsing artifacts in double-quantum-filtered cosy.J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar) and three-dimensional aromatic 13C-edited NOESY with a mixing time of 100 ms were used. The chemical shifts of the 1Hδ/ϵ spins in the aromatic residues were assigned by means of two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδ)Hδ and (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδCϵ)Hϵ experiments (25Yamazaki T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. 2-Dimensional Nmr experiments for correlating C-13-β and H-1-δ/ϵ chemical-shifts of aromatic residues in C-13-labeled proteins via scalar couplings.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). For detection of intermolecular NOEs, a series of filter-related experiments were conducted, namely a 13C-filtered/13C-edited NOESY using 13C,15N-labeled Csk-SH2 complexed with nonlabeled Cbp5 peptide and a 13C-filtered/13C-edited NOESY and 13C,15N-filtered/15N-edited NOESY using 13C,15N-labeled Cbp5 peptide complexed with nonlabeled Csk-SH2 (26Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. Methods for measurement of intermolecular NOEs by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy: Application to a bacteriophage λN-peptide/boxB RNA complex.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The NOE peaks were manually assigned using Sparky. Distance restraints were generated according to the assignment of the NOE cross-peaks, and pseudo-atom corrections were applied to the upper bound restraints involving methyl, methylene, and aromatic ring protons as described previously (27Umitsu M. Morishita H. Murata Y. Udaka K. Akutsu H. Yagi T. Ikegami T. 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of the first cadherin domain of cadherin-related neuronal receptor (CNR)/protocadherin α.J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Torsion angle restraints were derived using TALOS+ (28Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) with the assigned chemical shifts of 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13CO, and 15N, in reference to the x-ray structure of intact Csk (14Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. Structure of the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase, Csk.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints, 2.5–3.3 Å for N-O pairs and 1.8–2.3 Å for H-O pairs, were added only to secondary structural regions as confirmed through the corresponding NOE patterns. One disulfide bond between Cys-122 and Cys-164 was confirmed through characteristic 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts (29Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. C-13 NMR chemical shifts can predict disulfide bond formation.J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and used as a restraint for structure calculations. Structure calculations with torsion angle dynamics were performed using CYANA-2.1 (30Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. Torsion angle dynamics for NMR structure calculation with the new program DYANA.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). A total of 100 structures were calculated with 40,000 steps, and after a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the backbone atoms had reached 1.0 Å, the r−6 sum averaging method, originally implemented in the CYANA calculations, was applied instead of the pseudo-atom corrections. Finally, the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected. Molecular models were prepared using MOLMOL (31Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. MOLMOL: a program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) and UCSF Chimera (32Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27933) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds in the complex structure were defined using UCSF Chimera. An accessible surface area for each residue was calculated using MOLMOL. The electrostatic potential of the complex structure was calculated using Delphi (33Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. Calculating the electrostatic potential of molecules in solution–Method and error assessment.J. Comput. Chem. 1988; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). All the amino acid sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW, version 2.0 (34Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A.

The 15N-spin longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates and {1H}–15N steady-state NOE values were acquired on Bruker DRX-500 and AvanceII-800 spectrometers (26Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. Methods for measurement of intermolecular NOEs by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy: Application to a bacteriophage λN-peptide/boxB RNA complex.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). R1 relaxation delays were set at 5, 100, 200, 300, 400, 550, 700, 850, 1000, 1150, and 1300 ms, and R2 relaxation delays were set at 7.2, 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, and 360 ms in corresponding experiments. Single exponential curve fitting was performed using Sparky (35Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA1999Google Scholar). The model-free analysis developed by Lipari and Szabo (36Lipari G. Szabo A. Model-free approach to the interpretation of nuclear magnetic-resonance relaxation in macromolecules. 1. Theory and range of validity.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3395) Google Scholar), with the isotropic rotational diffusion model assumed, was performed using Tensor2 (37Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. Efficient analysis of macromolecular rotational diffusion from heteronuclear relaxation data.J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). All NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (38Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and Sparky, respectively. Chemical exchange associated with the interaction was monitored using 15N-labeled Csk-SH2 mixed with each of the nonlabeled phosphopeptides, Cbp5, Cbp6, and Cbp7, at a molar ratio of 2:1 by two-dimensional 15N zz-exchange spectroscopy (39Farrow N.A.

The spectra were acquired with mixing times, τm, of 0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 350, 550, and 800 ms. For each time point, four peaks observed with intensities denoted by IAA(τm), IBB(τm), IBA(τm), and IAB(τm) are, respectively, governed by Equation 1, lAA(τm)=lAA(0)[pA+pBexp(−kexτm)]exp(−R1τm)lBB(τm)=lBB(0)[pB+pAexp(−kexτm)]exp(−R1τm)lBA(τm)=lAA(0)[pB(1−exp(−kexτm)]exp(−R1τm)lAB(τm)=lBB(0)[pA(1−exp(−kexτm)]exp(−R1τm)(Eq. 1) where pi represents the relative population for the site i; kex represents the sum of the forward, k1, and reverse, koff, kinetic rate constants for interconversion between the sites; and R1 represents the longitudinal relaxation rate of the 15N nucleus in the observed spin system.

https://openalex.org/W2046941864,"We demonstrate for the first time that endomembrane-delimited H-Ras mediates VEGF-induced activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and migratory response of human endothelial cells. Using thiol labeling strategies and immunofluorescent cell staining, we found that only 31% of total H-Ras is S-palmitoylated, tethering the small GTPase to the plasma membrane but leaving the function of the large majority of endomembrane-localized H-Ras unexplained. Knockdown of H-Ras blocked VEGF-induced PI3K-dependent Akt (Ser-473) and eNOS (Ser-1177) phosphorylation and nitric oxide-dependent cell migration, demonstrating the essential role of H-Ras. Activation of endogenous H-Ras led to recruitment and phosphorylation of eNOS at endomembranes. The loss of migratory response in cells lacking endogenous H-Ras was fully restored by modest overexpression of an endomembrane-delimited H-Ras palmitoylation mutant. These studies define a newly recognized role for endomembrane-localized H-Ras in mediating nitric oxide-dependent proangiogenic signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2147071174,"Integrin α4β7 mediates rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocytes pre- and post-activation, which is distinct from most integrins only mediating firm cell adhesion upon activation. This two-phase cell adhesion suggests a unique molecular basis for the dynamic interaction of α4β7 with its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1). Here we report that a disulfide bond-stabilized W1 β4-β1 loop in α4 β-propeller domain plays critical roles in regulating integrin α4β7 affinity and signaling. Either breaking the disulfide bond or deleting the disulfide bond-occluded segment in the W1 β4-β1 loop inhibited rolling cell adhesion supported by the low-affinity interaction between MAdCAM-1 and inactive α4β7 but negligibly affected firm cell adhesion supported by the high-affinity interaction between MAdCAM-1 and Mn(2+)-activated α4β7. Additionally, disrupting the disulfide bond or deleting the disulfide bond-occluded segment not only blocked the conformational change and activation of α4β7 triggered by talin or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate via inside-out signaling but also disrupted integrin-mediated outside-in signaling and impaired phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Thus, these findings reveal a particular molecular basis for α4β7-mediated rolling cell adhesion and a novel regulatory element of integrin affinity and signaling."
