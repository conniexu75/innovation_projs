https://openalex.org/W2031190106,"Measurements of the cesium-137 content of people and of foodstuffs indicate that this nuclide is unlikely to be a decisive factor in the long-term hazards from weapons testing and reactor waste disposal. The amount of cesium-137 now present in the population of the United States averages 0.006 microcurie and shows no marked dependence on geographic location. The average radiation dose received from cesium-137 is one-twentieth of that received from natural radiopotassium and 1 percent of the average total dose from all natural sources. Because of the short biological half-life of cesium of about 140 days, it does not accumulate in the body as does strontium-90. The study of the distribution of cesium-137 is being continued to furnish information on the mechanisms of the fallout process and provide a measure of the rate of fallout and of stratospheric storage."

As genetics is a central theme in the science of biology, so we may expect genetic chemistry to become, in time, an integrating core for cellular biochemistry."

The general method was the same as that used on the eye and the ear. In four experiments, three different kinds of electrically actuated mechanical stimulators were used: a modified loud speaker motor, a magnetic phonograph cutting head, and a miniature vibration generator."
