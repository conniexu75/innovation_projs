https://openalex.org/W2075782454,"The atmospheric input of carbon dioxide from burning wood, in particular from forest fires in boreal and temperate regions resulting from both natural and man-made causes and predominantly from forest fires in tropical regions caused by shifting cultivation, is estimated to be 5.7 × 1015 grams of carbon per year as gross input and 1.5 × 1015 grams of carbon per year as net input. This is a significant amount as compared to the fossil fuel carbon dioxide produced from the utilization of oil, gas, coal, and limestone, and bears on the hypothesis of the enhanced sedimentation of marine detritus as a removal mechanism of excess atmospheric carbon dioxide."

In response to this variation, individuals alter the age at which they change sex. This response is predicted by a genetic model that assumes that an individual shrimp maximizes its genetic contribution to the next generation."
https://openalex.org/W2030136602,"Brazil's energy options and current outlook are examined, and a summary of known reserves of fossil and renewable energy resources is given. Brazil has abundant renewable energy resources but very modest reserves of fossil fuels. Consequently, the emphasis in the future will have to be on the utilization of solar energy, hydroelectric power, and biomass in a program designed to preserve local traditions and culture."
https://openalex.org/W1983081562,"Long-term limits to growth in energy will be imposed not by inability to expand supply, but by the rising environmental and social costs of doing so. These costs will therefore be central issues in choosing long-term options. Fusion, like solar energy, is not one possibility but many, some with very attractive environmental characteristics and others perhaps little better in these regards than fission. None of the fusion options will be cheap, and none is likely to be widely available before the year 2010. The most attractive forms of fusion may require greater investments of time and money to achieve, but they are the real reason for wanting fusion at all."

https://openalex.org/W4236057889,"The basic features of the U.S. energy supply and utilization system change so slowly that an understanding of the dynamics of major change requires projections that extend several decades. Over such a time most energy-consuming capital stock is replaced, life-styles change, and technology evolves. This study of plausible low energy futures leans heavily on detailed engineering analysis of demand by sector, combined with econometric techniques where appropriate. The results indicate that, given time for the system to respond to prices, regulations, and incentives, U.S. energy demand is very elastic. Consequently, a major slowdown in demand growth can be achieved simultaneously with significant economic growth by substituting technological sophistication for energy consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2005361896,"The inevitable by-product of societal concern over the side effects of coal production and use is greater than recognized difficulties to meet coal production goals. Thus, society faces the need to make trade-offs it is not adequately anticipating. The primary influences have come from air pollution regulation dealing with sulfur oxides; regulations in this realm were strengthened in 1977. Questions exist about the ability to meet these requirements and about whether tighter controls will be imposed on other pollutants. Problems also exist on the production side-labor unrest, stripmine reclamation requirements, and delays in leasing federally owned coal."

https://openalex.org/W2085465440,"Western Europe, now largely dependent on oil imports, has to prepare for strong competition for oil and energy imports in general before the year 2000. The more unlikely it is for Western Europe to secure from outside rich supplies of coal or uranium at readily acceptable economic and political conditions, the more serious this competition becomes. Even exceptionally low projections of economic growth and optimistic assumptions about energy conservation urgently call for vigorous and simultaneous development of indigenous coal and nuclear sources, including the breeder. Long-term contracts for the possession and deployment of foreign oil, gas, and coal deposits are mandatory and should be negotiated in view of the possible aggravation of north-south confrontation."

https://openalex.org/W2101517009,"This article discusses the importance of generic applied research with the aim of encouraging both the technical and political support of a program that would be appropriate and useful for the common good. A number of past, present, and future examples of applied research efforts related to fuel conservation are described, and an institutionalization of the means by which such efforts can be organized and utilized for an effective long-term fuel conservation program are suggested. The role of applied research in conservation is described and used as an example to show what a well-organized applied research program can produce. The same approach can also contribute to the attainment of such national goals as reducing atmospheric pollution, increasing industrial productivity, conserving scarce materials and developing renewable sources of energy. The development and improvement of electrical power generation as an example of the past role of applied research is described. Current efforts in applied research such as ceramic gas-turbine components, magnetohydrodynamic electric power generation, fluidezied bed combustion, and supercritical airfoil are also described. The most significant opportunities for future successes appear to be in automotive technologies, specifically aerodynamic drag and tribology (the science of friction, lubrication and wear). The institutionalization of applied research is examined and it is noted that what is needed primarily is a mechanism for generating appropriate applied research topics. The classical function of federally supported R&D is to develop technologies whose eventual payoff is potentially high but which entails too much risk for prudent private sector investment. The chief mechanism for ensuring that the responsibilities of a national program for applied research are properly discharged is a national forum for program planning and review. Engineering societies it is noted can provide the effective institutional umbrellas for such a national forum."
