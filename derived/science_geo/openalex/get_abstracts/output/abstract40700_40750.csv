https://openalex.org/W1972872628,"The formation of multinucleated giant cells with progression to cell death is a characteristic manifestation of the cytopathology induced by the AIDS retrovirus in infected T lymphoid cells. The mechanism of giant cell formation was studied in the CD4 (T4/Leu 3) positive T cell lines JM (Jurkat) and VB and in variants of these lines that are negative for cell surface CD4 antigen. By means of a two-color fluorescent labeling technique, multinucleated giant cells in infected cultures were shown to form through cell fusion. Antibody to CD4 specifically inhibited fusion, and uninfected CD4 negative cells, in contrast to uninfected CD4 positive cells, did not undergo fusion with infected cells, suggesting a direct role for the CD4 antigen in the process of syncytium formation. These results suggest that, in vivo, cell fusion involving the CD4 molecule may represent a mechanism whereby uninfected cells can be incorporated into AIDS virus infected syncytia. Because the giant cells die soon after they are formed, this process may contribute to the depletion of helper/inducer T cells characteristically observed in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1987905586,"We have constructed a transgenic mouse strain in which a mammary tumor virus fusion gene is anomalously expressed in a wide variety of tissues. The deregulated c-myc transgene, now glucocorticoid inducible, contributes to an increased incidence of a variety of tumors, including those of testicular, breast, lymphocytic (B cell and T cell), and mast cell origin. The deregulated gene does not, however, otherwise disturb cell proliferation, nor does it interfere with normal development in these animals. Moreover, since not all tissues that express the transgene develop neoplasms, these results begin to define the transforming spectrum of the c-myc oncogene. They also extend to several organ systems the notion that elements in addition to an activated c-myc gene are required to induce malignancy in the living organism."
https://openalex.org/W2051468219,"The poliovirus polyprotein is cleaved at three different amino acid pairs. Viral polypeptide 3C is responsible for processing at the most common pair (glutamine-glycine). We have found that a cDNA fragment encoding parts of the capsid protein region (P1) and the nonstructural protein region (P2), and including the P1-P2 processing site (tyrosine-glycine), can be expressed in E. coli. The translation product was correctly processed. Disruption of the coding sequence of 2A, a nonstructural polypeptide mapping carboxy-terminal to the tyrosine-glycine cleavage site, by linker mutagenesis or deletion, prevented processing. Deletion of the adjacent polypeptide 2B had no such effect. Antibodies against 2A specifically inhibited processing at the 3C′-3D′ processing site (tyrosine-glycine) in vitro. We conclude that poliovirus encodes the second proteinase 2A, which processes the polyprotein at tyrosine-glycine cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W2154671319,"Single-chain pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) is present both in the medium and lysate of the A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Most of the cell-associated pro-uPA is on the cell surface, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence and by surface lodination. Pro-uPA is not an integral membrane protein but is bound to a specific surface receptor that is completely saturated. A mild acid treatment uncovers the surface receptors by dissociating pro-uPA. Resaturation of uncovered receptors has been studied by reincubating cells in normal medium; within 40 min, 50% of the free sites are reoccupied. Excess uPA-specific antibodies prevent rebinding of ligand to the receptors. Thus, A431 cells first secrete uPA, which then binds to the surface receptor. We propose that the synthesis of uPA and uPA receptor by the same cell may provide a pathway for the activation of the metastatic potential of malignant cells."

https://openalex.org/W2055958530,"A cytosol extract from human 293 cells supports efficient replication of SV40 origin-containing plasmid DNA in the presence of the SV40 T antigen. Addition of a nuclear extract from the same cells promotes negative supercoiling of the replicated DNA but not the bulk of the unreplicated DNA. The level of superhelicity is affected by the concentrations of T antigen and nuclear extract factors and by the time of addition of the nuclear extract. The replicated DNA in isolated DNA-protein complexes resists relaxation by purified HeLa cell topoisomerase I. Micrococcal nuclease digestion, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and electron microscopy demonstrate that the negative supercoils result from assembly of the replicating DNA into a chromatin structure. These results suggest that, during DNA replication, the core histones can be assembled on both sides of the replication fork by an active, replication-linked mechanism that does not require a template of preexisting nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1992308207,"Electrical stimulation of fibers in the stratum radiatum causes an excitatory postsynaptic potential in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. Other excitatory inputs to or direct depolarization of these CA1 neurons during stimulation of the stratum radiatum caused a subsequent increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potential. This enhancement was characterized as a brief potentiation (2 to 3 minutes, similar to posttetanic potentiation) and a long-term potentiation (presumed to be involved in learning and memory). These potentiations are probably induced by an interaction of the postsynaptic cell or other presynaptic terminals with the test presynaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W1630061106,"The nucleotide sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) gene has been established. A total of 36,594 base pairs (bp) was sequenced; this included 32,720 bp from the site of initiation of transcription to the polyadenylation site, in addition to 3,530 and 344 bp of 5' and 3' flanking DNA, respectively. Thirteen intervening sequences divide the gene into 14 coding regions; the size range for exons is 43-914 bp, while that for introns is 111-14,257 bp. The gene and 5' flanking region contain 28 copies of Alu repetitive DNA and a single KpnI repeat. The transcription initiation site was identified by S1 nuclease, exonuclease VII, and primer extension analysis as an A residue; TATA and CAAT boxes are located in the expected positions upstream of this proposed site. Results of the analysis of the gene sequence and its comparison with data banks are described. The protein and gene structures of tissue and urokinase plasminogen activator are compared; based on these features the evolutionary relationship of the two human plasminogen activators appears to be close."
https://openalex.org/W1508450059,"The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and ferrous EDTA generates an oxidizing intermediate (I1) which is not the hydroxyl radical. It oxidizes ferrocytochrome c and also reacts with hydrogen peroxide (k5 = 3.2 X 10(3) M-1 S-1) to form a second oxidizing transient (I2). I1 is not scavenged by t-butyl alcohol whereas I2 is. I1 is found to be significantly less reactive than the hydroxyl radical toward benzoate ion, t-butyl alcohol, acetate ion, arginine, and serine, but is scavenged by compounds with readily oxidizable functional groups such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. This indicates that I1 does not undergo the characteristic reactions of the hydroxyl radical but shows a pattern of reactivity more associated with a metal ion oxidant like a ferryl (FeO2+)-EDTA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1558275258,"Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP) synthetase of Escherichia coli has been purified to near homogeneity from a strain harboring the prs gene, encoding P-Rib-PP synthetase, on a multicopy plasmid. Analysis of the enzyme showed that it required inorganic phosphate for activity and for stability. Magnesium ions were required both as a complex with the substrate ATP and as a free cation. P-Rib-PP synthetase activity was inhibited strongly by ADP. Kinetic analysis indicated multiple sites of action of ADP. In addition apparent substrate inhibition was exerted by ribose 5-phosphate in the presence of ADP. The nucleotide sequence of the E. coli prs gene has been determined and the coding segment established. The deduced amino acid sequence of P-Rib-PP synthetase contained 314 amino acid residues and the molecular weight was calculated as 34,060. The initiation site of transcription was determined. This site was preceded by well conserved -10 and -35 consensus sequences (pdT-dA-dG-dA-dA-dT and pdT-dT-dG-dA-dT-dG, respectively). The transcription initiation site preceded the potential translation initiation site by 302 nucleotides. Transcription terminated approximately 35 nucleotides downstream from the UAA translation stop codon, within a Thy-rich region following an inverted repeat sequence, indicative of an rho-independent transcription terminator."
https://openalex.org/W2056122772,"Infection of the central nervous system by mouse hepatitis virus strain A59, a murine neurotropic coronavirus, induces class I major histocompatibility complex antigens on mouse oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, cells that do not normally express these antigens on their surfaces. This induction, which occurs through soluble factors elaborated by infected glial cells, potentially allows immunocytes to interact with the glial cells and may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced, immune-mediated demyelination in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1984409688,"DNA strand transfer at the initiation of Mu transposition normally requires a negatively supercoiled transposon donor molecule, containing both ends of Mu in inverted repeat orientation. We propose that the specific relative orientation of the Mu ends is needed only to energetically favor a particular configuration that the ends must adopt in a synaptic complex. The model was tested by constructing special donor DNA substrates that, because of their catenation or knotting, energetically favor this same configuration of the Mu ends, even though they are on separate molecules or in direct repeat orientation. These structures are efficient substrates for the strand transfer reaction, whereas appropriate control structures are not. The result eliminates tracking or protein scaffold models for orientation preference. Several other systems in which the relative orientation of two DNA segments is sensed may utilize the same mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2146558355,"Penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-2 and the RodA protein are known to function in determining the rod shape of Escherichia coli cells. Peptidoglycan biosynthetic reactions that required these two proteins were demonstrated in the membrane fraction prepared from an E. coli strain that overproduced both of these two proteins and which lacked PBP-1B activity (the major peptidoglycan synthetase activity in the normal E. coli membranes). The cross-linked peptidoglycan was synthesized from UDP-N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in the presence of a high concentration of cefmetazole that inhibited all of PBPs except PBP-2. The peptidoglycan was synthesized via a lipid intermediate and showed up to 30% cross-linking. The cross-linking reaction was strongly inhibited by the amidinopenicillin, mecillinam, and by other beta-lactam antibiotics that have a high affinity for PBP-2, but not by beta-lactams that had very low affinity for PBP-2. The formation of peptidoglycan required the presence of high levels of both PBP-2 and the RodA protein in the membranes, but it is unclear which of the two proteins was primarily responsible for the extension of the glycan chains (transglycosylation). However, the sensitivity of the cross-linking reaction to specific beta-lactam antibiotics strongly suggested that it was catalyzed by PBP-2. The transglycosylase activity of the membranes was sensitive to enramycin and vancomycin and was unusual in being stimulated greatly by a high concentration of a chelating agent."

https://openalex.org/W1511762296,"Diacylglycerol kinase is though to play a central role in the metabolism of diacylglycerol second messengers in agonist-stimulated cells. A series of diacylglycerol analogs were tested for their ability to act as substrates or inhibitors of diacylglycerol kinase with the goal of determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme, and of discovering inhibitors. Screening of these compounds was performed using a partially purified diacylglycerol kinase from pig brain. Modified assays for this enzyme using co-sonicated mixtures of diacylglycerol and anionic phospholipids were developed. This enzyme was found to be quite specific for sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (KM 24 microM for dioctanoyl-glycerol). Among the analogs investigated, only 1,2-dioctanoyl-2-amino-1,3-propanediol was utilized at a significant rate. Two analogs, dioctanoylethylene glycol (KI 58 microM) and 1-monooleoylglycerol (KI 91 microM), were potent inhibitors in vitro. These compounds were tested for effects on diacylglycerol formation and metabolism in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. Dioctanoylethylene glycol inhibited diacylglycerol phosphorylation in platelets (70-100% at 100 microM) leading to a longer-lived diacylglycerol signal. This compound may be a useful tool for studies of diacylglycerol kinase in other cell types. 1-Monooleoylglycerol treatment elevated diacylglycerol levels up to 4-fold in unstimulated platelets and up to 10-fold in thrombin-stimulated platelets. The implications with regard to the pathways of diacylglycerol metabolism in human platelets are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2022910611,The human T-lymphotropic viruses types I and II (HTLV-I and -II) have been etiologically linked with certain T-cell leukemias and lymphomas that characteristically display membrane receptors for interleukin-2. The relation of these viruses to this growth factor receptor has remained unexplained. It is demonstrated here that introduction of the trans-activator (tat) gene of HTLV-II into the Jurkat T-lymphoid cell line results in the induction of both interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-2 gene expression. The coexpression of these cellular genes may play a role in the altering T-cell growth following retroviral infection.
https://openalex.org/W2006106830,"A molecular clone of the AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV-2) was transfected into human T lymphocyte and monocyte cell lines as well as mouse, mink, monkey, and human fibroblast lines. A replicating virus with cytopathic and biologic properties of ARV-2 was recovered from all the cell lines. The animal and human fibroblast cells are resistant to direct infection by ARV, and in these experiments virus production in the fibroblast lines, especially mouse, was reduced compared to human lymphocytes. However, human fibroblasts were more permissive to virus expression than mouse cells. These results show that, whereas the primary block to ARV infection in certain cells may occur at the cell surface, intracellular mechanisms can also participate in controlling virus replication. The results have relevance to vaccine development and encourage further work with modified molecular clones to examine regions of the ARV genome necessary for cytopathology and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2082620787,"An antiserum prepared against thymosin α1, a hormone secreted by the thymus gland, effectively neutralized the AIDS-associated virus [HTLV-III/LAV (clone BH-10)] and blocked its replication in H9 cells. Reverse transcriptase activity and expression of the HTLV-III/LAV antigens p15 and p24 were inhibited by purified immunoglobulin G preparations of antisera to thymosin α1. The antiviral activity of the antiserum was found to be due to a region of homology between thymosin α1 and p17, a product of the gag gene of HTLV-III/LAV. Comparison of the primary sequences of thymosin α1 and the gag protein revealed a 44% to 50% homology in an 18-amino acid region, between positions 11 and 28 on thymosin α1 and 92 and 109 on the gag protein. The effectiveness of the thymosin α1 antiserum and of immunoglobulin G-enriched preparations in blocking replication of HTLV-III(BH-10) in H9 cells suggests a novel approach to the development of an AIDS vaccine. A vaccine directed against the gag protein might overcome the problem of genetic drift in the envelope region of the virus and be useful against all genetic variants of HTLV-III/LAV."
https://openalex.org/W2002739835,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a product of mononuclear phagocytes that mediates changes characteristic of the response to inflammation or tissue injury (the acute-phase response). One of two structurally and functionally homologous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III genes encodes a positive acute-phase protein, complement factor B. The closely linked complement C2 gene is not affected during the acute-phase response. Purified human IL-1, pH 7.0, and recombinant-generated murine IL-1, pH 5.0, increased the expression of factor B and other positive acute-phase proteins in human hepatoma cells but decreased the expression of albumin, a negative acute-phase reactant. Furthermore, in a murine fibroblast L-cell line transfected with cosmid DNA bearing the human C2 and factor B genes, IL-1 mediated a reversible dose- and time-dependent increase in factor B expression in the transfected cells. Expression of the C2 gene was not affected by IL-1. The effect of IL-1 on factor B expression involves a mechanism acting at a pre-translational level as demonstrated by an increase in specific messenger RNA content and a corresponding increase in biosynthesis and secretion of factor B. The structural basis and mechanism for selective and independent regulation of these genes provides insight into the molecular control of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1482367175,"It has been proposed that recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is accomplished by hydrogen bond formation between the protein and particular groups that are accessible in the major and minor grooves of the DNA. We have examined the DNA-protein interactions involved in the recognition of the hexameric DNA sequence, GAATTC, by the EcoRI restriction endonuclease by using derivatives of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide that contain a variety of base analogues. The base analogues hypoxanthine, 2-aminopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, N6-methyladenine, 5-bromouracil, uracil, 5-bromocytosine, and 5-methylcytosine were incorporated as single substitutions into the octadeoxyribonucleotide d(pG-G-A-A-T-T-C-C). The effects of the substitutions on the interactions between the EcoRI endonuclease and its recognition sequence were monitored by determining the steady state kinetic values of the hydrolysis reaction. The substitutions resulted in effects that varied from complete inactivity to enhanced reactivity. The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with those substrates that were reactive, whereas octanucleotide analogues containing N6-methyladenine at either adenine position, uracil at the second thymine position, or 5-bromocytosine or 5-methylcytosine at the cytosine position were unreactive. The results are discussed in terms of possible effects on interactions between the enzyme and its recognition site during the reaction. An accompanying paper presents the results of a similar study using these oligonucleotides with the EcoRI modification methylase."
https://openalex.org/W2045217734,"A monoclonal antibody has been raised against the serine protease, plasminogen activator (PA) produced by Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts (RSVCEF), and selected for its ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of PA. The high specificity and anticatalytic nature of the antibody has allowed probing of the direct role of PA in cellular behavior. Microgram quantities of monoclonal IgG inhibit the overgrowth and the morphological changes associated with RSVCEF transformation and the degradation of extracellular matrix mediated by RSVCEF, indicating a catalytic role for PA in these cellular processes. Specific cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins by immunoaffinity-purified PA in the complete absence of plasminogen demonstrates a direct catalytic involvement of PA in matrix degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2025070363,"We present genetic evidence that the tetracycline resistance element Tn10 transposes by a nonreplicative mechanism. Heteroduplex Tn10 elements containing three single base pair mismatches were constructed on λ phage genomes and allowed to transpose from λ into the bacterial chromosome. Analysis of TetR colonies resulting from such transpositions suggests that information from both strands of the transposing Tn10 element is transmitted faithfully to its transposition product. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the transposing element is excised from the donor molecule and inserted into the target molecule without being replicated. A mismatch 70 base pairs from one end of the transposon is preserved, suggesting that there is little or no replication, even at the termini of the element, during transposition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2112492288,"DNA primase isolated from human mitochondria sediments in glycerol density gradients at 30S and 70S. These unusually high sedimentation coefficients are a result of association of the primase activity with RNA. Treatment of primase with nuclease not only affects its sedimentation behavior, but also inactivates the primase activity. The major RNA species that cofractionates with primase activity is shown by direct sequence analysis to be cytosolic 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Specific degradation of endogenous 5.8S rRNA using ribonuclease H and oligonucleotides complementary to 5.8S rRNA results in reduction of primase activity. Other small RNAs may play a structural role in the formation of an active DNA primase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1520572643,"Metal binding to the iron storage protein apoferritin is the first step in the process by which iron accumulates within the protein shell. In the present study, the stoichiometry of metal binding to apoferritin in solution has been examined using the probe ions Mn(II), VO(IV), and Cd(II) in conjunction with EPR spectroscopic and cadmium ion selective electrode measurements. Binding studies were carried out with the individual ions, in competition with one another, and in competition with Fe(II), Fe(III), and Tb(III). All three probe ions show binding stoichiometries near 0.3 and 0.7 metal ion per subunit, close to the theoretically predicted values of 0.33 and 0.67 for the binding of one and two metal ions, respectively, per three subunits. These results in conjunction with other data are consistent with the binding of one, and possibly two, metal ions within each of the eight hydrophilic channels which are located on 3-fold axes leading to the interior of the protein. Pairs of cadmium binding sites have been located in these channels by x-ray crystallography (Rice, D. W., Ford, G. C., White, J. L., Smith, J. M. A., and Harrison, P. M. (1983) Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 5, 39-49). The possibility that some metal binding occurs elsewhere on the protein is not precluded by the present data, however. In competition experiments between various metal ions, approximately 0.3 metal ion per subunit is readily displaced implying common binding sites in the channels for all of them. The stoichiometry of Mn(II) displacement by Fe(II) is less clear. Oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by molecular oxygen in the presence of Mn(II) regenerates some Mn(II) binding on the protein, suggesting migration of iron(III) to other protein sites, or perhaps to core."
https://openalex.org/W1501036754,"OsO4 in the presence of pyridine specifically modifies the structural distortions of the primary helix of supercoiled pRW777 near the (dA-dC)32 sequence. Modification occurs at the same negative superhelix density value as required for formation of the Z-helix within the polymer block. Fine mapping of the distorted regions, which are probably the B-Z junctions, is presented. OsO4 reactions provide a powerful and sensitive chemical approach to study DNA polymorphism in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2017274030,"The N-terminal segments of the EcoRI endonuclease dimer form part of mobile “arms” that encircle DNA in the recognition complex. By treating endonuclease-TCGCGAATTCGCG complexes with proteases, we have prepared a series of deletion derivatives lacking defined segments of the N-terminal region. The 5–12 segment is essential for DNA cleavage and forms one electrostatic interaction (per subunit) with DNA phosphate. These ionic contacts are directly across the double helix from the scissile phosphodiester bonds; they thus may permit the enfolding arms to immobilize DNA in apposition to the catalytic cleft and/or contribute to the unusual “kinked” conformation of DNA in the complex. Sequence specificity is fully retained when 28 residues are deleted from the N-terminus, but the complexes dissociate more rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1607537230,"The DNase that is associated with a multiprotein form of HeLa cell DNA polymerase alpha (polymerase alpha 2) has two distinct exonuclease activities: the major activity initiates hydrolysis from the 3' terminus and the other from the 5' terminus of single-stranded DNA. The two exonuclease activities show identical rates of thermal inactivation and coincidental migration during chromatofocusing, glycerol gradient centrifugation, and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the DNase. Moreover, the purified DNase shows a single protein band of Mr 69,000 following nondenaturing polyacrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 3'----5' exonuclease activity hydrolyzes only single-stranded DNA substrates and the products are 5' mononucleotides. This activity recognizes and excizes mismatched bases at the 3' terminus of double-stranded DNA substrates. The 3'----5' exonuclease does not hydrolyze 3' phosphoryl terminated single-stranded DNA substrates. The 5'----3' exonuclease activity also only hydrolyzes single-stranded DNA substrates. The rate of hydrolysis, however is only about 1/25th the rate of the 3'----5' exonuclease. This exonuclease activity requires a 5' single-stranded terminus in order to initiate hydrolysis and does not proceed into double-stranded regions. The products of hydrolysis by 5'----3' exonuclease are also 5' nucleoside monophosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2071967100,"A bovine rhodopsin complementary DNA probe was used to detect homologous visual pigment genes in a variety of species. Under stringent DNA hybridization conditions, genomic DNA from most vertebrate species carried a single homologous fragment. Additional homologies were detected in some vertebrates by reducing the hybridization stringency. Homologous fragments were also detected in DNA isolated from invertebrate species, a unicellular alga, and an archaebacterium; many of these fragments were homologous to a Drosophila opsin probe. These results suggest that photosensory pigments in a wide variety of species arose from a common precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2048102096,"We analyzed an S1 nuclease-sensitive site present in supercoiled, but not linear, recombinant plasmids containing the adenovirus late promoter. S1 nicking was detected on both strands, primarily in the TATA box. Analysis of deletion mutants showed that sequences upstream of -47 and downstream of -12 are not required for S1 cutting. However, a number of different base substitution mutations in stretches of G residues upstream and/or downstream of the TATA box were sufficient to eliminate S1 cutting. When the transcriptional activities of these mutant promoters were assayed in vivo, six of seven mutants lacking the ability to form the S1-sensitive structure showed no reduction in transcriptional potential. In fact, several showed increased promoter activities. These data show that the S1 nuclease cutting site in the adenovirus late promoter has precise nucleotide sequence requirements for its formation. However, the ability of recombinant plasmids to adapt this conformation in vitro is not necessary for such plasmids to serve as templates for transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1553262587,"We have examined the DNA-protein interactions involved in the recognition of a specific hexameric sequence, GAATTC, by the EcoRI modification methylase by using derivatives of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide that contain a variety of base analogues. The base analogues 2-aminopurine, 5-bromocytosine, 5-bromouracil, 2,6-diaminopurine, hypoxanthine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-methyladenine, and uracil were incorporated as single substitutions into the octadeoxyribonucleotide d(pG-G-A-A-T-T-C-C). The effects of the substitutions on the ability of the enzyme to methylate the modified substrates were monitored by determining the steady state kinetic values of the reaction in the presence of the cosubstrate, S-adenosylmethionine. The substitutions resulted in effects ranging from complete inactivity to enhanced reactivity. The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with those analogues that were active, whereas the octanucleotides containing hypoxanthine at the guanine site, N6-methyladenine at the first or 2-aminopurine at the second adenine site, or uracil at the second thymine site were completely inactive. The results are discussed in terms of the possible interactions between the methylase and its recognition sequence. In addition, the interactions are compared to those of the EcoRI restriction endonuclease, which has been similarly tested with the same analogue oligonucleotides. The results of that study are reported in an accompanying paper. Although both enzymes recognize the same sequence, they do so in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W1891062175,"The nature of the hepatic receptors that bind glycoproteins through fucose at the non-reducing termini of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins has been examined by three different approaches. First, the clearance from blood of intravenously injected glycoproteins was examined in mice with the aid of neoglycoproteins of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The clearance of fucosyl-BSA was rapid and was not strongly inhibited by glycoproteins that inhibit clearance mediated by the galactose or the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptors of liver. The clearance of Fuc alpha 1,3(Gal beta 1,4)GlcNAc-BSA (where Fuc is fucose) was inhibited weakly by either Fuc-BSA or Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc-BSA but strongly by a mixture of the two neoglycoproteins, suggesting that its clearance was mediated by hepatic galactose receptors as well as by a fucose-binding receptor. Second, the binding of neoglycoproteins to a membrane fraction of mouse liver was examined. Fuc-BSA binding to membranes was Ca2+ dependent but was not inhibited by glycoproteins that would inhibit the galactose or the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptors. In addition, the binding of Fuc-BSA and Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc-BSA differed as a function of pH, in accord with binding of Fuc-BSA through fucose-specific hepatic receptors. Finally, the binding of neoglycoproteins to the pure galactose lectin from rat liver was examined. Neither Fuc-BSA nor Fuc alpha 1,2Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc-BSA bound the galactose lectin, although Fuc alpha 1,3(Gal beta-1,4) GlcNAc-BSA bound avidly. Taken together, these studies suggest that a fucose-binding receptor that differs from the galactose and the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptors may exist in rat and mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W2082874740,"Psoralen-modified DNA was used to study the SV40 enhancer-dependent transcription of the human beta-globin gene. When the enhancer is separated from the beta-globin gene by psoralen adducts on one side and plasmid vector sequences on the other, expression of the gene is strongly inhibited. When placed on the same side of the enhancer as the vector sequences, psoralen adducts have little effect on transcription unless they are located near the transcriptional start site. These results suggest that the inhibition of the transcription of a gene linked to an enhancer in a circular DNA requires the presence of blocking agents on both sides of the gene and that the vector sequences are already blocking enhancer action on one side. Psoralen monoadducts are sufficient to inhibit transcription; the formation of interstrand psoralen cross-links is unnecessary. We assess models for the enhancer mechanism in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1549262782,"recA protein, in the presence of ATP, polymerizes on single-stranded DNA (plus strand) to form a presynaptic nucleoprotein filament that pairs with linear duplex DNA and actively displaces the plus strand from the recipient molecule in a polarized fashion to form a new heteroduplex molecule. The interaction between recA protein and DNA during strand exchange was studied by labeling different strands and probing the intermediate with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) or restriction endonuclease. The incoming single strand was resistant to DNase I in the original nucleoprotein filament and remained resistant even after extensive strand exchange had occurred. Both strands of the parental duplex molecule were sensitive to DNase I in the absence of joint molecule formation; but as strand exchange progressed following homologous pairing, increasing stretches of the parental plus strand became resistant, whereas the complementary parental minus strand remained sensitive to DNase I throughout the reaction. Except for a region of 50-100 base pairs at the end of the newly formed heteroduplex DNA where strand exchange was initiated, the rest of the heteroduplex region was resistant to cleavage by restriction endonucleases. The data suggest that recA protein promotes strand exchange by binding both the incoming and outgoing strands of the same polarity, whereas the complementary strand, which must switch pairing partners, is unhindered by direct contact with the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1613894282,"Resonance Raman (RR) spectra obtained at three excitation wavelengths are reported for various ferric, ferrous, and ferryl derivatives of bovine lactoperoxidase. The RR spectra of the ferric derivatives show the full complement of the vinyl stretching and scissor modes indicating that the two vinyls in the protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group are present in unmodified forms. The cysteine thiol complex exhibits a RR spectrum identical to that of the native enzyme, an observation which strongly suggests a nonheme binding site for the thiol substrates. The different ferrous complexes of lactoperoxidase which result from heme reduction at slightly alkaline and acidic pH gave identical low-frequency RR spectra. Differences are observed, however, in the high-frequency region. Reduction in the presence of cyanide, however, yields two time-resolved complexes. Changes in the ligand field during the conversion to the final form of the cyanoferrous complex are proposed based on the changes observed in the low-frequency vibrational spectrum. Comparisons are made between the low-frequency RR spectra of the limiting form of the cyanoferrous and the nitric oxide lactoperoxidase complexes. The similarity between the RR spectra of these two complexes in the 150-500 cm-1 region supports the assignment of structures for these complexes where the six-coordinate heme iron is displaced from the heme plane and away from the proximal histidine ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2111435786,"The mechanism of action of purified wheat germ RNA ligase has been examined. ATP was absolutely required for the ligation of substrates containing 5'-OH or 5'-P and 2',3'-cyclic P or 2'-P termini. Ligation of 1 mol of 5'-P-2',3'-cyclic P-terminated poly(A) was accompanied by the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP to 1 mol each of AMP and PPi. Purified RNA ligase catalyzed an ATP-PPi exchange reaction, specific for ATP and dATP, and formed a covalent enzyme-adenylate complex that was detected by autoradiography following incubation with [alpha-32P]ATP and separation of the products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein doublet with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa, the major product detected by silver staining, was labeled in these reactions. Isolated E-AMP complex was dissociated by the addition of ligatable poly(A), containing 5'-P-2',3'-cyclic P termini, to yield AMP and by the addition of PPi to yield ATP. The unique feature of the reactions leading to an exchange reaction between ATP and PPi and to the formation of an E-AMP complex was their marked stimulation (up to 400-fold) by the addition of RNA. This property distinguishes the wheat germ RNA ligase from other known RNA and DNA ligases which catalyze ATP-PPi exchange reactions and form E-AMP complexes in the absence of substrate. Thus, RNA appears to function in two capacities in the wheat germ system: as a cofactor, to stimulate the reaction of the enzyme with ATP, and as an authentic substrate for ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1523947765,"In contrast to most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases which are monomers or oligomers of a single polypeptide, Escherichia coli glycyl-tRNA synthetase has an alpha-2, beta-2 structure. The enzyme requires both subunits for catalysis of either adenylate or aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis. The head-to-tail arrangement of the alpha- and beta-chain coding regions in the genome suggests that the two-subunit protein may be tantamount to a single chain. We fused the carboxyl terminus of the alpha-chain to the amino terminus of the beta-chain, through a short peptide linker. Five different amino acid substitutions were placed in the linker. In all instances, the fusion polypeptide is stable in maxicell extracts. In a glyS null strain, a gene encoding any of the fusion proteins substitutes for the wild-type gene. Assays confirm that, in vitro, the engineered polypeptide fusion is active to within 2- to 3-fold of the wild-type, unfused chains. Oligomers of the fusion protein are observed and may be required for activity. Because the creation and limited manipulation of the artificial peptide linker region does not destroy the activity, we also conclude that the C-terminal part of the alpha-chain and the amino-terminal part of the beta-chain are not important for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1578933576,"The enzymatic cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to monoterpenes is thought to proceed through a series of carbocation-pyrophosphate anion paired intermediates. Sulfonium analogs of two putative carbocationic intermediates of the cyclization sequence were shown to be inhibitors of the conversion of the acyclic precursor to the bicyclic monoterpenes (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)-bornyl pyrophosphate by partially purified cyclase preparations from sage (Salvia officinalis). The sulfonium analog of the tertiary allylic, linalyl, intermediate (i.e. methyl-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)vinyl-sulfonium perchlorate) provided respective Ki values of 2.5 microM and 3.0 microM against the cyclization to alpha-pinene and bornyl pyrophosphate at a substrate concentration of 5 microM, whereas the sulfonium analog of the monocyclic, alpha-terpinyl, intermediate (i.e. dimethyl-(4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl) sulfonium iodide) exhibited respective Ki values of 3.4 microM and 3.9 microM against the same two cyclizations. The potency of inhibition in all cases increased with increasing substrate concentration, indicating that the affinity of the enzymes for the sulfonium analogs was increased by the presence of the pyrophosphate ester. Inorganic pyrophosphate at a concentration of 50 microM, which alone had little influence on the cyclizations, increased the effectiveness of inhibition of the sulfonium analogs severalfold, and the apparent Ki for inorganic pyrophosphate was reduced manyfold by the presence of either analog at 5 microM. That the combination of sulfonium analog and pyrophosphate provided synergistic inhibition of the electrophilic cyclizations indicated that the cyclases bind the paired species more tightly than either partner alone. Specificity studies suggested that inhibition by the above sulfonium ion:pyrophosphate pairs was due to both electronic and structural resemblance to intermediates of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1481559242,"Rat hepatocytes incubated in high K+ buffer (all Na+ is replaced by K+) internalize glycoproteins bearing terminal galactose moieties but are not able to deliver them to lysosomes (Baenziger, J. U., and Fiete, D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6007-6009). Instead, internalized ligand accumulates in a prelysosomal compartment(s) with a density similar to that of plasma membrane. We have separated two populations of prelysosomal endocytic vesicles from hepatocytes incubated in high K+ buffer. The vesicle population VR.L has a mean density of 1.14 by sucrose gradient centrifugation and contains functionally active Gal/GalNAc-specific receptor which is able to bind intravesicular ligand. The vesicle population VL has a mean density of 1.19. It contains ligand, but is deficient in Gal/GalNAc-specific receptor when compared to VR.L. These two vesicle populations appear to arise from intracellular organelles which participate in receptor-ligand segregation in rat hepatocytes. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that ligand passes from VR.L to VL. VR.L and VL are also detected in hepatocytes incubated in buffers containing physiologic amounts of Na+; however, the proportion of ligand found in VL is less than in cells incubated in K+-containing buffer. The primary effect of high K+ buffer is to prevent exit of ligand from VL whereas the accumulation of ligand in VR.L is likely secondary to the effect on VL. Membrane protein constituents of VR.L and VL were identified by vectorial lactoperoxidase labeling using a galactosyl conjugate of lactoperoxidase. Vesicles containing Gal-lactoperoxidase were isolated and labeling initiated by addition of 125I, glucose, and glucose oxidase. The labeling patterns for VR.L and VL by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were distinct from the more complex labeling pattern obtained at the cell surface. Analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated a highly selective labeling pattern with only a small number of differences between VR.L and VL. This suggests that the major membrane components of the compartments prior to and following receptor-ligand segregation are the same. Thus, receptors may be selectively removed from these membranes during the process of receptor-ligand segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2024961631,"One postulated mechanism for how the SV40 enhancer stimulates transcription of linked genes involves the enhancer as a binding site for a sequence-specific “gyrase” activity. We sought to test this hypothesis directly by constructing a novel heteroduplex circle, termed a tailed-circle, in which one of the strands contains an extra palindromic sequence base-paired into a hairpin structure. The human β-globin gene is placed in the circle and the SV40 enhancer on the hairpin tail, where a bound topoisomerase cannot supercoil the circle. Upon transfection of this DNA into HeLa cells the SV40 enhancer on the hairpin arm is still able to stimulate transcription of the β-globin gene. Southern blot analysis of the DNA after transfection does not demonstrate any repair or replication of the tailed-circle in vivo. These results argue against the sequence-specific gyrase model for SV40 enhancer action."
https://openalex.org/W1526020850,"An RNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of a 2'-phosphomonoester-3',5'-phosphodiester bond in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ was purified approximately 6000-fold from raw wheat germ. A 5'-hydroxyl polynucleotide kinase activity copurified with RNA ligase through all chromatographic steps. Both activities cosedimented upon glycerol gradient centrifugation even in the presence of high salt and urea. RNA ligase and kinase activities sedimented as a single peak on glycerol gradients with a sedimentation coefficient of 6.2 S. The purified polynucleotide kinase activity required dithiothreitol and a divalent cation for activity and was inhibited by pyrophosphate and by ADP. The kinase phosphorylated a variety of 5'-hydroxyl-terminated polynucleotide chains including some that were substrates for the RNA ligase (e.g. 2',3'-cyclic phosphate-terminated poly(A)) and others that were not ligase substrates (e.g. DNA or RNA containing 3'-hydroxyl termini). RNA molecules containing either 5'-hydroxyl or 5'-phosphate and 2',3'-cyclic or 2'-phosphate termini were substrates for the purified RNA ligase activity. The rate of ligation of 5'-hydroxyl-terminated RNA chains was greater than that of 5'-phosphate-terminated molecules, suggesting that an interaction between the wheat germ kinase and ligase activities occurs during the course of ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1601441394,"Three classes of gonadotropins with different ratios of stimulating to binding activities (S/B ratio) in rat Leydig cells have been identified. An S/B ratio of 1 was observed for rat luteinizing hormone (LH), porcine LH, and equine choriogonadotropin (CG) (class I), whereas ovine and equine LH exhibited and S/B ratio of 10-20 (class II) and human CG (hCG) (class III) an S/B ratio of 60. We coined the term to designate this particular behavior. This phenomenon was further studied by comparing the competitive activities of porcine LH (pLH) and hCG in radioreceptor assays using rat Leydig cell membranes and either radiolabeled oLH or hCG as the tracer, in the presence or absence of 150 mM NaCl. At equilibrium, both native hormones were equipotent in competing with 125I-oLH binding, but hCG was 4-fold more potent than pLH when 125I-hCG was used. Moreover, the binding rates of both hormones were considerably diminished in the presence of NaCl, but hCG binding at equilibrium was not affected, whereas that of oLH was almost completely abolished. From these results and previous data on the binding and internalization of these hormones, we suggest the existence of two interconvertible functional states of the hormone-receptor complex: (formula; see text). The equilibrium constant k3/k4 would be extremely high for hCG and lower and lower for the hormones in class II and class I, respectively. The equilibrium constant k1/k2 would be the one affected by the presence of NaCl and seems to be similar for all the hormones tested. The normal activity or superactivity of gonadotropins would thus be primarily dependent on the equilibrium between HR1 and HR2."
https://openalex.org/W1593329361,"The current studies demonstrate that corticosteroidogenesis can be maintained by primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells under lipoprotein-depleted conditions. The cholesterol necessary as substrate for steroid synthesis was found to arise from de novo synthesis within these cells. Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity 5-fold within 12 h after addition to the medium. The increase in activity apparently represented accumulation of enzyme as determined by protein blotting and immunodetection. The predominant immunodetectable species of HMG-CoA reductase from bovine adrenal cells was 97,000 daltons; no higher molecular mass species was detectable. The ACTH induction of HMG-CoA reductase activity could be prevented after inhibition of cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone with clotrimazole. These results are suggestive that ACTH increases adrenocortical cholesterol biosynthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity after conversion of a cellular pool of cholesterol and/or oxysterol into steroid. The increased rate of cholesterol biosynthesis is then capable of maintaining ACTH-promoted steroid production. This is the first study, in vitro, to demonstrate an ACTH-promoted accumulation of HMG-CoA reductase of adrenocortical cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531575920,"Abstract The sequences encoding the 5'-ends of three chicken fast-white myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes have been determined. When compared with the sequences of two other MHC genes it is apparent that both the exon and intron positions are conserved. All exon sequences are highly conserved; there is absolute amino acid conservation in the second and third exons. In addition, while the first and third introns diverge among the genes, the second intron is highly conserved between the five. This intron contains a 24-bp sequence that is repeated twice in one of the introns and once in the other four. Analyses indicate that this sequence, which is partially homologous to 7SL RNA, appears to be largely restricted to the MHC gene family. Analysis of the 5'-flanking sequences show that while small homologies are present between some of the genes, they have extensively diverged in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1504535495,"The 3' ends of transfer ribonucleic acids were covalently labeled with a nitroxide spin label. The 3' end of initiator tRNA (tRNAMetf) from Escherichia coli shows different motional behavior than the 3' terminus of elongator tRNAs as monitored by EPR. The line shapes of the EPR spectra are quite sensitive to the buffer conditions, as shown by measurements in 4 different buffers. The data are consistent with a constrained or folded back 3' terminus in the initiator tRNA as opposed to the freely rotating elongator 3' terminus. The EPR spectra are also sensitive to aggregation of the tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1489991508,"The interaction of divalent metal ions with a homogeneous 56,000-dalton phosphoprotein phosphatase isolated from rabbit reticulocytes was studied. The effects of the ions on enzymatic activity and on fluorescence from a 3-(4-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methyl-7-(diethylamino)coumarin derivative of the protein were compared. Enzymatic activity is dependent on Mn2+. The apparent association constant for Mn2+ is about 0.5 mM-1 as judged from enzymatic activity and from changes in fluorescence caused by binding of the metal ion; Ca2+ and Mg2+ do not affect enzymatic activity and appear not to bind tightly to the enzyme; however, Co2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ bind to the protein and inhibit the Mn2+-activated enzyme. The 56,000-dalton phosphoprotein phosphatase was found to interact with regulin, a spectrin-associated protein also isolated from reticulocytes, and with skeletal muscle phosphatase inhibitor 2. The interaction was followed by changes in the enzymatic activity and by quenching of fluorescence from the coumarin derivative of the phosphatase. Homogeneous regulin (Mr approximately 230,000) increases the activity of the enzyme severalfold; this stimulation is Mn2+-dependent. Inhibitor 2 decreases enzyme activity but only if the two proteins are preincubated in the absence of Mn2+. Comparable differences in the effect of Mn2+ were also observed in parallel experiments in which changes in fluorescence from the coumarin-labeled 56,000-dalton phosphatase were measured. In these experiments, it was shown that Mn2+ enhances the interaction between regulin and the 56,000-dalton phosphatase, but inhibits the interaction between the phosphatase and inhibitor 2."
https://openalex.org/W1573094056,"A new minor Hb fraction initially designated Hbx, has been found in the hemolysate of an erythremic patient that we have previously described with a complete erythrocyte bisphosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.4) deficiency. Hbx (3.5% of the total) was detected by isoelectric focusing and exhibited electrophoretic and chromatographic properties similar to those of several variants of the Hb central cavity. By density fractionation of red cells, it was demonstrated that Hbx was an aging hemoglobin as in the case of glycated Hb A1c. Functional studies revealed a low oxygen affinity and almost complete inhibition of the allosteric effect of the organic phosphate effectors. Structural studies demonstrated an absence of tryptic cleavage between the peptides beta T9 and beta T10 suggesting the presence of an adduct on Lys beta 82 or on a neighboring residue. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and a specific enzymatic assay with glyoxylate reductase demonstrated that the beta 82 adduct was a glycerate moiety. It was concluded that Hbx was a glycerylated Hb, alpha 2A beta 2(82) (EF6) N epsilon-glyceryllysine, to our knowledge the first example of glycerylated protein. The mechanism of formation of glyceryl Hb, which was found in the four studied subjects with a bisphosphoglyceromutase deficiency, remains to be determined."
