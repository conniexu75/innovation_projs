https://openalex.org/W2807837086,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to significant changes in metabolic activity. Succinate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, has emerged as a metabolic mediator of the innate immune response. However, the involvement of succinate in the generation of the adaptive immune response and establishment of autoimmune response has not been addressed thus far. Here we demonstrated that the succinate-sensing receptor (Sucnr1/GPR91) plays a critical role in the development of immune-mediated arthritis. We found that Sucnr1 acts as a chemotactic gradient sensor that guides dendritic cells (DCs) into the lymph nodes, orchestrating the expansion of the T helper (Th)17-cell population and the development of experimental antigen-induced arthritis. Sucnr1-/- mice show reduced articular hyperalgesia, neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokines in the joint, and reduced frequency of Th17 cells in draining lymph nodes. Adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) DCs into Sucnr1-/- mice restored the development of arthritis. Moreover, DC-depleted mice transferred with Sucnr1-/- DCs developed less arthritis than mice transferred with WT DCs. In contrast, succinate given together with the immunization boosted the recruitment of DCs and the frequency of Th17 cells in draining lymph nodes, increasing arthritis severity. Therefore, the blockade of Sucnr1 may represent a novel therapeutic target of arthritis.-Saraiva, A. L., Veras, F. P., Peres, R. S., Talbot, J., de Lima, K. A., Luiz, J. P., Carballido, J.

https://openalex.org/W2808444289,"Background The ‘chain of survival’—including early call for help, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation—represents the most beneficial approach for favourable patient outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite increasing numbers of publicly accessible automated external defibrillators (AED) and interventions to increase public awareness for basic life support (BLS), the number of their use in real-life emergency situations remains low. Methods In this prospective population-based cross-sectional study, a total of 501 registered inhabitants of Vienna (Austria) were randomly approached via telephone calls between 08/2014 and 09/2014 and invited to answer a standardized questionnaire in order to identify public knowledge and awareness of BLS and AED-use. Results We found that more than 52 percent of participants would presume OHCA correctly and would properly initiate BLS attempts. Of alarming importance, only 33 percent reported that they would be willing to perform CPR and 50 percent would use an AED device. There was a significantly lower willingness to initiate BLS attempts (male: 40% vs. female: 25%; OR: 2.03 [95%CI: 1.39–2.98]; p<0.001) and to use an AED device (male: 58% vs. female: 44%; OR: 1.76 [95%CI: 1.26–2.53]; p = 0.002) in questioned female individuals compared to their male counterparts. Interestingly, we observed a strongly decreasing level of knowledge and willingness for BLS attempts (-14%; OR: 0.72 [95%CI: 0.57–0.92]; p = 0.027) and AED-use (-19%; OR: 0.68 [95%CI: 0.54–0.85]; p = 0.001) with increasing age. Conclusion We found an overall poor knowledge and awareness concerning BLS and the use of AEDs among the Viennese population. Both female and elderly participants reported the lowest willingness to perform BLS and use an AED in case of OHCA. Specially tailored programs to increase awareness and willingness among both the female and elderly community need to be considered for future educational interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2807852229,"TP53 pathway defects contributed to therapy resistance and adverse clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which represents an unmet clinical need with few therapeutic options. Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a novel oncogene, which plays crucial roles in mitotic progression and stem cell maintenance. OTSSP167, an orally administrated inhibitor targeting MELK, is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Yet, no investigation has been elucidated to date regarding the oncogenic role of MELK and effects of OTSSP167 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous studies confirmed MELK inhibition abrogated cancer cell survival via p53 signaling pathway. Thus, we aimed to determine the biological function of MELK and therapeutic potential of OTSSP167 in CLL. Herein, MELK over-expression was observed in CLL cells, and correlated with higher WBC count, advanced stage, elevated LDH, increased β2-MG level, unmutated IGHV, positive ZAP-70, deletion of 17p13 and inferior prognosis of CLL patients. In accordance with functional enrichment analyses in gene expression profiling, CLL cells with depletion or inhibition of MELK exhibited impaired cell proliferation, enhanced fast-onset apoptosis, induced G2/M arrest, attenuated cell chemotaxis and promoted sensitivity to fludarabine and ibrutinib. However, gain-of-function assay showed increased cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis. In addition, OTSSP167 treatment reduced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. It decreased FoxM1 phosphorylation, expression of FoxM1, cyclin B1 and CDK1, while up-regulating p53 and p21 expression. Taken together, MELK served as a candidate of therapeutic target in CLL. OTSSP167 exhibits potent anti-tumor activities in CLL cells, highlighting a novel molecule-based strategy for leukemic interventions."

Because this process leads to a loss of function of the affected polypeptides and to cytotoxic stress, formation of protein aggregates has been recognized as a major pathogenic factor in human diseases. In this study, we determined the impact of physiological heat stress on mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. We found that the heat-stressed mitochondria had lower membrane potential and ATP level and exhibited a decreased production of reactive oxygen species. An analysis of the mitochondrial proteome by 2D PAGE showed that the overall solubility of endogenous proteins was only marginally affected by elevated temperatures. However, a small subset of polypeptides exhibited an high sensitivity to heat stress. The mitochondrial translation elongation factor Tu (Tufm), a protein essential for organellar protein biosynthesis, was highly aggregation-prone and lost its solubility already under mild heat-stress conditions. Moreover, mitochondrial translation and the import of cytosolic proteins were defective in the heat-stressed mitochondria. Both types of nascent polypeptides, produced by translation or imported into the mitochondria, exhibited a strong tendency to aggregate in the heat-exposed mitochondria. We propose that a fast and specific inactivation of elongation factors may prevent the accumulation of misfolded nascent polypeptides and may thereby attenuate proteotoxicity under heat stress.

https://openalex.org/W2808507120,"Enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Ebola and Influenza, are among the most deadly known viruses. Cellular membrane penetration of enveloped viruses is a critical step in the cascade of events that lead to entry into the host cell. Conventional ensemble fusion assays rely on collective responses to membrane fusion events, and do not allow direct and quantitative studies of the subtle and intricate fusion details. Such details are accessible via single particle investigation techniques, however. Here, we implement nano-infrared spectroscopic imaging to investigate the chemical and structural modifications that occur prior to membrane fusion in the single archetypal enveloped virus, influenza X31. We traced in real-space structural and spectroscopic alterations that occur during environmental pH variations in single virus particles. In addition, using nanospectroscopic imaging we quantified the effectiveness of an antiviral compound in stopping viral membrane disruption (a novel mechanism for inhibiting viral entry into cells) during environmental pH variations."
https://openalex.org/W2807882615,"An unusual variant of prostate adenocarcinoma (PC) expressing nuclear p63 in secretory cells instead of the typical basal expression has been reported in men. Nevertheless, the biological behavior and clinical significance of this phenomenon is unknown. In dogs, this unusual PC subtype has not been described. In this study, p63 immunoexpression was investigated in 90 canine PCs and 20 normal prostate tissues (NT). The p63 expression pattern in luminal or basal cells was confirmed in a selected group of 26 PCs and 20 NT by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blotting assays. Eleven canine PC samples aberrantly expressing p63 (p63+) in secretory cells were compared with 15 p63 negative (p63-) cases in the context of several molecular markers (high molecular weight cytokeratin-HMWC, CK8/18, CK5, AR, PSA, chromogranin, NKX3.1, PTEN, AKT and C-MYC). P63+ samples were positive for CK5, HMWC and CK8/18 and negative for PSA, NKX3.1, PTEN and chromogranin. Five p63+ PCs were negative for AR, and the remaining six samples had low AR expression. In contrast, p63- PC showed AR and PSA positive expression in all 15 samples. Only five p63- PCs were positive for CK5. Both p63+ and p63- PC samples showed higher cytoplasmic AKT expression and nuclear C-MYC staining in comparison with normal tissues. Metastatic (N = 12) and non-metastatic (N = 14) PCs showed similar immunoexpression for all markers tested. In contrast to human PC, canine PC aberrantly expressing p63 showed higher expression levels of HMWC and CK5 and lower levels of NKX3.1. Canine p63+ PC is a very rare PC group showing a distinct phenotype compared to typical canine PC, including AR and PSA negative expression. Although in a limited number of cases, p63 expression was not associated with metastasis in canine PC, and cytoplasmic p63 expression was observed in animals with shorter survival time, similar to human PC cases."
https://openalex.org/W2808152773,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system of mammals. A range of bacterial species can synthesize GABA, including Lactobacillus plantarum of which L-monosodium glutamate (L-MSG) is an inducer of its production. In order to synthesize GABA in high concentrations, L-MSG was utilized as the single inducing factor, a chemically defined medium (CDM) was used as the fermentation substrate, with L. plantarum CGMCC 1.2437T cultured in medium supplemented with or without L-MSG. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to explore the differential genes expression of bacterial cells at 36 h of fermentation, where the GABA concentration of CDM with L-MSG reached the peak value and was 7.7 times higher than that of medium without L-MSG at the same timepoint. A total of 87 genes showed significant differential expression induced by L-MSG: of these, 69 were up-regulated genes and 18 were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes were assigned to biological processes and molecular function, while the down-regulated genes covered biological process, cellular process and molecular function. Interrogation of results using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, indicated carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and amino acid metabolism were closely associated with GABA synthesis induced by L-MSG. This study provides insights into L. plantarum-mediated GABA fermentation at the molecular level and will provide a new approach for further studies related to GABA production by the other Lactic acid bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2808479943,"Understanding how climate change affects host-parasite systems and predicting the consequences for ecosystems, economies, and human health has emerged as an important task for science and society. Some basic insight into this complex problem can be gained by comparing the thermal physiology of interacting host and parasite species. In this study, we compared upper thermal tolerance among three component species in a natural host-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid system from Virginia, USA. To assess the ecological relevance of our results, we also examined a record of maximum daily air temperatures collected near the study site in the last 124 years. We found that the caterpillar host Manduca sexta had a critical thermal maximum (CTmax) about 4°C higher than the parasitic wasp, Cotesia congregata, and the hyperparasitic wasp, Conura sp., had a CTmax about 6°C higher than its host, C. congregata. We also found significant differences in CTmax among instars and between parasitized and non-parasitized M. sexta. The highest maximum daily air temperature recorded near the study in the last 124 years was 42°C, which equals the average CTmax of one species (C. congregata) but is several degrees lower than the average CTmax of the other two species (M. sexta, Conura sp.) in this study. Our results combined with other studies suggest that significant differences in thermal performance within and among interacting host and parasite species are common in nature and that climate change may be largely disruptive to these systems with responses that are highly variable and complex."
https://openalex.org/W2807739971,"Target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) is a widely conserved serine/threonine protein kinase. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC2 is essential, playing a key role in plasma membrane homeostasis. In this role, TORC2 regulates diverse processes, including sphingolipid synthesis, glycerol production and efflux, polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, and endocytosis. The major direct substrate of TORC2 is the AGC-family kinase Ypk1. Ypk1 connects TORC2 signaling to actin polarization and to endocytosis via the flippase kinases Fpk1 and Fpk2. Here, we report that Fpk1 mediates TORC2 signaling to control actin polarization, but not endocytosis, via aminophospholipid flippases. To search for specific targets of these flippase kinases, we exploited the fact that Fpk1 prefers to phosphorylate Ser residues within the sequence RXS(L/Y)(D/E), which is present ∼90 times in the yeast proteome. We observed that 25 of these sequences are phosphorylated by Fpk1 in vitro. We focused on one sequence hit, the Ark/Prk-family kinase Akl1, as this kinase previously has been implicated in endocytosis. Using a potent ATP-competitive small molecule, CMB4563, to preferentially inhibit TORC2, we found that Fpk1-mediated Akl1 phosphorylation inhibits Akl1 activity, which, in turn, reduces phosphorylation of Pan1 and of other endocytic coat proteins and ultimately contributes to a slowing of endocytosis kinetics. These results indicate that the regulation of actin polarization and endocytosis downstream of TORC2 is signaled through separate pathways that bifurcate at the level of the flippase kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2807881347,"Cytokinins (CKs) are a group of phytohormones essential to plant growth and development. The presence of these N6-modified adenine derivatives has also been documented in other groups of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and insects. Thus far, however, only a single CK, N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl) adenine-9-riboside (iPR), has been identified in mammals. In plants, the nucleotide form of isopentenyladenine [iPR (either mono-, di-, or tri-) phosphate (iPRP)] is the first form of CK synthesized, and it is further modified to produce other CK types. To determine if a similar biosynthesis pathway exists in mammals, we tested for the presence of 27 CKs in a wide selection of canine organs using HPLC electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Seven forms of CK were detected in the majority of the analyzed samples, including iPR, iPRP, cis-zeatin-9-riboside, cis-zeatin-9-riboside-5' (either mono-, di-, or triphosphate), 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenosine, and 2-methylthio-zeatin. Total CK concentrations ranged from 1.96 pmol/g fresh weight (adrenal glands) to 1.40 × 103 pmol/g fresh weight (thyroid). The results of this study provide evidence that mammalian cells, like plant cells, can synthesize and process a diverse set of CKs including cis- and methylthiol-type CKs.-Seegobin, M., Kisiala, A., Noble, A., Kaplan, D., Brunetti, C., Emery, R.

https://openalex.org/W2807998323,"Aims To assess the impact of an oral healthcare program in nursing homes on the initial treatment backlog and residents’ oral health stability. Materials and methods The study is a longitudinal cohort study in nursing home residents in Flanders, Belgium, to evaluate the oral healthcare programme Gerodent. The program consisted of: (1) the introduction of an oral healthcare team, (2) oral health education, (3) the implementation of oral health guidelines and protocols, and (4) regular visits of a mobile dental team. Data were extracted from the oral health records of 381 residents from 21 nursing homes who received treatments from the mobile dental team between October 2010 and March 2014 (mean follow-up period of 22.5 months). Oral health and treatment need between baseline and follow-up were compared. Results The mean age at baseline was 82.4 years and the mean number of consultations per resident was 3.61 during the follow-up period. The proportion of residents with an oral treatment need was reduced from 65.9% to 31.3%. Among residents with natural teeth, there was significantly lower prevalence of caries (from 70.5% at baseline to 36.5% at follow-up; p<0.001), residual roots (from 54.2% to 25.1%; p<0.001), and need for fillings (from 31.9% to 17.1%; p<0.001) or extractions (from 64.3% to 31.6%; p<0.001). In the group with partial or full dentures (n = 223), 38.1% needed a repair, rebasing or renewal of their existing dentures at baseline and the respective figure at follow-up was 9.0% (p<0.001). In terms of oral health stability, 53% of the residents had no incident restorative and prosthetic treatment need throughout the follow-up period. A lower number of natural teeth at baseline (p<0.001) and a shorter follow-up period (p = 0.002) were associated with higher chances of oral health stability. Conclusion The oral healthcare program Gerodent significantly reduced the treatment backlog and contributed to a considerable proportion of residents being stable in terms of oral health without any incident treatment needs."
https://openalex.org/W2808281859,"The chromatin state is finely tuned to regulate function and specificity for transcription factors such as oestrogen receptor alpha (ER), which contributes to cell growth in breast cancer. ER transcriptional potential is mediated, in large part, by the specific associated proteins and co-factors that interact with it. Despite the identification and characterisation of several ER coregulators, a complete and systematic view of ER-regulating chromatin modifiers is lacking. By exploiting a focused siRNA screen that investigated the requirement for a library of 330 chromatin regulators in ER-mediated cell growth, we find that the NuRD and coREST histone deacetylation complexes are critical for breast cancer cell proliferation. Further, by proteomic and genomics approaches, we discover the transcription factor TRPS1 to be a key interactor of the NuRD and coREST complexes. Interestingly, TRPS1 gene amplification occurs in 28% of human breast tumours and is associated with poor prognosis. We propose that TRPS1 is required to repress spurious binding of ER, where it contributes to the removal of histone acetylation. Our data suggest that TRPS1 is an important ER-associated transcriptional repressor that regulates cell proliferation, chromatin acetylation and ER binding at the chromatin of cis-regulatory elements."

VnaSSP4.2 was recently discovered as a V. nonalfalfae virulence effector protein in the xylem sap of infected hop. Here, we expanded our search for candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) in the V. nonalfalfae predicted secretome using a bioinformatic pipeline built on V. nonalfalfae genome data, RNA-Seq and proteomic studies of the interaction with hop. The secretome, rich in carbohydrate active enzymes, proteases, redox proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism, cellular processing and signaling, includes 263 CSEPs. Several homologs of known fungal effectors (LysM, NLPs, Hce2, Cerato-platanins, Cyanovirin-N lectins, hydrophobins and CFEM domain containing proteins) and avirulence determinants in the PHI database (Avr-Pita1 and MgSM1) were found. The majority of CSEPs were non-annotated and were narrowed down to 44 top priority candidates based on their likelihood of being effectors. These were examined by spatio-temporal gene expression profiling of infected hop. Among the highest in planta expressed CSEPs, five deletion mutants were tested in pathogenicity assays. A deletion mutant of VnaUn.279, a lethal pathotype specific gene with sequence similarity to SAM-dependent methyltransferase (LaeA), had lower infectivity and showed highly reduced virulence, but no changes in morphology, fungal growth or conidiation were observed. Several putative secreted effector proteins that probably contribute to V. nonalfalfae colonization of hop were identified in this study. Among them, LaeA gene homolog was found to act as a potential novel virulence effector of V. nonalfalfae. The combined results will serve for future characterization of V. nonalfalfae effectors, which will advance our understanding of Verticillium wilt disease."

Rice has been reported as the most Al-tolerant crop and the capacity of Al toxicity tolerance is generally evaluated by comparing root growth under Al stress. Here, we performed an association mapping of Al toxicity tolerance using a core collection of 211 indica rice accessions with 700 K high quality SNP data. A total of 21 putative QTL affecting shoot height (SH), root length (RL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW) and shoot water content (SWC) were identified at seedling stage, including three QTL detected only under control condition, eight detected only under Al stress condition, ten simultaneously detected in both control and Al stress conditions, and seven were identified by stress tolerance index of their corresponding traits. Total of 21 candidate genes for 7 important QTL regions associated with Al toxicity tolerance were identified based on combined haplotype analysis and functional annotation, and the most likely candidate gene(s) for each important QTL were also discussed. Also a candidate gene Nrat1 on chromosome 2 was further fine-mapped using BSA-seq and linkage analysis in the F2 population derived from the cross of Al tolerant accession CC105 and super susceptible accession CC180. A new non-synonymous SNP variation was observed at Nrat1 between CC105 and CC180, which resulted in an amino-acid substitution from Ala (A) in CC105 to Asp (D) in CC180. Haplotype analysis of Nrat1 using 327 3K RGP accessions indicated that minor allele variations in aus and indica subpopulations decreased Al toxicity tolerance in rice. The candidate genes identified in this study provide valuable information for improvement of Al toxicity tolerance in rice. Our research indicated that minor alleles are important for QTL mapping and its application in rice breeding when natural gene resources are used."

https://openalex.org/W2808013246,"Background HIV-infected adults have increased risk for age-related diseases and low cardiorespiratory fitness that can be prevented and improved with exercise. Yet, exercise strategies have not been well studied in older adults with HIV and may require substantial adaptation to this special population. Objective To determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic exercise in older HIV-infected men in a randomized trial comparing different levels of exercise intensity. Methods We conducted a pilot exercise trial in 22 HIV-infected men ≥50 years of age receiving antiretroviral therapy who were randomized 1:1 to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (Mod-AEX) or high-intensity aerobic exercise (High-AEX) that was performed three times weekly for 16 weeks in a supervised setting. Primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) measured by treadmill testing. Secondary outcomes were exercise endurance, six-minute walk distance (6-MWD), body composition measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and fasting plasma levels of lipids and glucose. Results VO2peak increased in the High-AEX group (3.6 ±1.2 mL/kg/min, p = 0.02) but not in the Mod-AEX group (0.4 ±1.4 mL/kg/min, p = 0.7) with a significant between group difference (p<0.01). Exercise endurance increased in both the High-AEX group (27 ±11%, p = 0.02) and the Mod-AEX group (11 ±4%, p = 0.04). The 6-MWD increased in both the High-AEX (62 ±18m, p = 0.01) and the Mod-AEX group (54 ±14m, p = 0.01). Changes in VO2peak and 6-MWD were clinically relevant. There were no serious exercise-related adverse events. Dropouts were similar between group (27% overall) and were related to joint pain. Conclusions This pilot exercise trial demonstrates that moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise in older HIV-infected men increases endurance and ambulatory function. However, increased cardiorespiratory fitness was observed only with high-intensity aerobic exercise despite substantial baseline impairment. Future research is needed to determine exercise strategies in older HIV-infected adults that address advanced aging and comorbidity yet are durable and feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2808255057,"The period of transition from pediatric to adult care has been associated with poor health outcomes among 10-19 year old adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV). This has prompted a focus on the quality of transition services, especially in high ALHIV-burden countries. Due to lack of guidelines, there are no healthcare transition standards for Nigeria's estimated 240,000 ALHIV. We conducted a nationwide survey to characterize routine transition procedures for Nigerian ALHIV.This cross-sectional survey was conducted at public healthcare facilities supported by five local HIV service implementing partners. Comprehensive HIV treatment facilities with ≥1 year of HIV service provision and ≥20 ALHIVs enrolled were selected. A structured questionnaire assessed availability of treatment, care and transition services for ALHIV. Transition was defined as a preparatory process catering to the medical, psychosocial, and educational needs of adolescents moving from pediatric to adult care. Comprehensive transition services were defined by 6 core elements: policy, tracking and monitoring, readiness evaluation, planning, transfer of care, and follow-up.All 152 eligible facilities were surveyed and comprised 106 (69.7%) secondary and 46 (30.3%) tertiary centers at which 17,662 ALHIV were enrolled. The majority (73, 48.3%) of the 151 facilities responding to the ""clinic type"" question were family-centered and saw all clients together regardless of age. Only 42 (27.8%) facilities had an adolescent-specific HIV clinic; 53 (35.1%) had separate pediatric/adolescent and adult HIV clinics, of which 39 (73.6%) reported having a transfer/transition policy. Only 6 (15.4%) of these 39 facilities reported having a written protocol. There was a bimodal peak at 15 and 18 years for age of ALHIV transfer to adult care. No surveyed facility met the study definition for comprehensive transition services.Facilities surveyed were more likely to have non-specialized HIV treatment services and had loosely-defined, abrupt transfer versus transition practices, which lacked the core transition elements. Evidence-based standards of transitional care tailored to non-specialized HIV treatment programs need to be established to optimize transition outcomes among ALHIV in Nigeria and in similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W2808635009,"Low back pain (LBP) is a globally prevalent disorder with high social significance. Invasive surgical procedures are increasingly being used to treat LBP despite a lack of solid evidence supporting their long-term benefits. This nationwide retrospective cohort study investigated the association between acupuncture treatment and lumbar surgery rate in patients with LBP.Using the National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort Database for 2002-2013, we identified newly diagnosed LBP patients in Korea between 2004 and 2010 and divided them into an acupuncture group and control group according to whether or not they received acupuncture. Propensity scores based on age, sex, income, and Charlson Comorbidity Index were matched between the two study groups. The lumbar surgery rate in the two years following the first visit (control group) or the first acupuncture session (acupuncture group) was calculated. In addition to the overall analysis, stratified analyses were also conducted in different age, sex, and income strata. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using varying definitions of acupuncture treatment.After matching, 130,089 subjects were included in each study group. The lumbar surgery rate was significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.633, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.576-0.696). Decrease in HR was consistently observed in the acupuncture group for all age strata, except for patients in their 20s (HR 1.031, 95% CI 0.804-1.323). HR for lumbar surgery tended to be further reduced in the older age groups upon acupuncture treatment, with no apparent sex-related differences. Lowered HR in the acupuncture group was continuously observed across all income groups; the higher income group showed a tendency of greater decrease. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of acupuncture sessions had no major impact on the likelihood of lumbar surgery, but also that more intensive acupuncture treatment was associated with further reduction in lumbar surgery rates.The present results found that administration of acupuncture treatment is associated with lower lumbar surgery rates for LBP patients in Korea.

The failure of proper attachment results in muscle injury, which is the underlying cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in which mutations in the dystrophin gene disrupts the firm adhesion. In patients with DMD, even moderate contraction causes damage, leading to progressive muscle degeneration. The damaged muscles are repaired through myogenesis. Consequently, myogenesis is highly active in patients with DMD, and the repeated activation of myogenesis leads to the exhaustion of the myogenic stem cells. Therefore, approaches to reducing the risk of the exhaustion are to develop a treatment that strengthens the interaction between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina and increases the efficiency of the myogenesis. Galectin-3 is an oligosaccharide-binding protein and is known to be involved in cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions. Galectin-3 is expressed in myoblasts and skeletal muscle, although its function in muscle remains elusive. In this study, we found evidence that galectin-3 and the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine, which increases the synthesis of binding partners (oligosaccharides) of galectin-3, promote myogenesis in vitro. Moreover, in the mdx mouse model of DMD, treatment with N-acetylglucosamine increased muscle-force production. The results suggest that treatment with N-acetylglucosamine might mitigate the burden of DMD.-Rancourt, A., Dufresne, S. S., St-Pierre, G., Lévesque, J.-C., Nakamura, H., Kikuchi, Y., Satoh, M.

https://openalex.org/W2808162513,"Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by ionizing radiation leads to formation of micrometer-sized DNA-repair foci, whose organization on the nanometer-scale remains unknown because of the diffraction limit (∼200 nm) of conventional microscopy. Here, we applied diffraction-unlimited, direct stochastic optical-reconstruction microscopy ( dSTORM) with a lateral resolution of ∼20 nm to analyze the focal nanostructure of the DSB marker histone γH2AX and the DNA-repair protein kinase (DNA-PK) in irradiated glioblastoma multiforme cells. Although standard confocal microscopy revealed substantial colocalization of immunostained γH2AX and DNA-PK, in our dSTORM images, the 2 proteins showed very little (if any) colocalization despite their close spatial proximity. We also found that γH2AX foci consisted of distinct circular subunits (""nanofoci"") with a diameter of ∼45 nm, whereas DNA-PK displayed a diffuse, intrafocal distribution. We conclude that γH2AX nanofoci represent the elementary, structural units of DSB repair foci, that is, individual γH2AX-containing nucleosomes. dSTORM-based γH2AX nanofoci counting and distance measurements between nanofoci provided quantitative information on the total amount of chromatin involved in DSB repair as well as on the number and longitudinal distribution of γH2AX-containing nucleosomes in a chromatin fiber. We thus estimate that a single focus involves between ∼0.6 and ∼1.1 Mbp of chromatin, depending on radiation treatment. Because of their ability to unravel the nanostructure of DSB-repair foci, dSTORM and related single-molecule localization nanoscopy methods will likely emerge as powerful tools in biology and medicine to elucidate the effects of DNA damaging agents in cells.-Sisario, D., Memmel, S., Doose, S., Neubauer, J., Zimmermann, H., Flentje, M., Djuzenova, C.

https://openalex.org/W2807771349,"Essential proteins are crucial to living cells. Identification of essential proteins from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks can be applied to pathway analysis and function prediction, furthermore, it can contribute to disease diagnosis and drug design. There have been some experimental and computational methods designed to identify essential proteins, however, the prediction precision remains to be improved. In this paper, we propose a new method for identifying essential proteins based on Participation degree of a protein in protein Complexes and Subgraph Density, named as PCSD. In order to test the performance of PCSD, four PPI datasets (DIP, Krogan, MIPS and Gavin) are used to conduct experiments. The experiment results have demonstrated that PCSD achieves a better performance for predicting essential proteins compared with some competing methods including DC, SC, EC, IC, LAC, NC, WDC, PeC, UDoNC, and compared with the most recent method LBCC, PCSD can correctly predict more essential proteins from certain numbers of top ranked proteins on the DIP dataset, which indicates that PCSD is very effective in discovering essential proteins in most case."
https://openalex.org/W2808299161,"Somites are a pair of epithelial spheres beside a neural tube and are formed with an accurate periodicity during embryogenesis in vertebrates. It has been known that Hes7 is one of the core clock genes for somitogenesis, and its expression domain is restricted in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). However, the molecular mechanism of how Hes7 transcription is regulated is not clear. Here, using transgenic mice and luciferase-based reporter assays and in vitro binding assays, we unravel the mechanism by which Hes7 is expressed exclusively in the PSM. We identified a Hes7 essential region residing −1.5 to −1.1 kb from the transcription start site of mouse Hes7, and this region was indispensable for PSM-specific Hes7 expression. We also present detailed analyses of cis-regulatory elements within the Hes7 essential region that directs Hes7 expression in the PSM. Hes7 expression in the PSM was up-regulated through the E-box, T-box, and RBPj-binding element in the Hes7 essential region, presumably through synergistic signaling involving mesogenin1, T-box6 (Tbx6), and Notch. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tbx18, Ripply2, and Hes7 repress the activation of the Hes7 essential region by the aforementioned transcription factors. Our findings reveal that a unified transcriptional regulatory network involving a Hes7 essential region confers robust PSM-specific Hes7 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2808017125,"Eccentric (ECC) contractions are used to maintain skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy subjects and patients. Here we investigated the effects of ECC training induced by electrical stimulation (ES) on muscle wasting in colon 26 (C-26) tumor-bearing mice. Mice were divided into four groups: control (CNT), CNT + ECC, C-26, and C-26 + ECC. Cancer cachexia was induced by a subcutaneous injection of C-26 cells and developed for four weeks. In experiment 1, muscle protein synthesis rate and mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1 signaling were investigated six hours after one bout of ECC-ES (2 s contraction given every 6 s, 20°/s, 4 sets of 5 contractions). In experiment 2, ECC-ES training, a total of 14 sessions, was performed every other day starting one day after C-26 injection. Compared to the CNT mice, the gastrocnemius muscle weight was significantly decreased in the tumor-bearing mice. This change was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis rate and a marked increase in the expression levels of genes including regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD) 1, forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1, and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1) mRNA. ECC-ES increased the protein synthesis rate and the phosphorylation levels of p70S6K (Thr389) and rpS6 (Ser240/244), markers for mTORC1 signaling, and reversed an upregulation of MuRF-1 mRNA in muscles from C-26 mice. Our findings suggest that ECC-ES training reduces skeletal muscle atrophy in C-26 tumor-bearing mice through activation of mTORC1 signaling and the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, ECC-ES training might be used to effectively ameliorate muscle wasting in patients with cancer cachexia."

Among these, the TOMATO AGAMOUS-LIKE 1 (TAGL1) gene plays an important role in both the development and ripening of fruit. In this study, the TAGL1 gene was successfully silenced by virus-induced gene silencing technology (VIGS), and the global gene expression and metabolites profiles of TAGL1-silenced fruits were analyzed by RNA-sequence analysis (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The TAGL1-silenced fruits phenotypically displayed an orange pericarp, which was in accordance with the results expected from the down-regulation of genes associated with carotenoid synthesis. Levels of several amino acids and organic acids were lower in the TAGL1-silenced fruits than in the wild-type fruits, whereas, α-tomatine content was greatly increased (more than 10-fold) in the TAGL1-silenced fruits compared to wild-type fruits. The findings of this study showed that TAGL1 not only regulates the ripening of tomato fruits, but also affects the synthesis and levels of nutrients in the fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2808226810,"Studying the movements of oceanic migrants has been elusive until the advent of several tracking devices, such as the light-level geolocators. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) offers a complementary approach to infer areas used year-round, but its suitability in oceanic environments remains almost unexplored. To evaluate SIA as a tool for inferring movements of oceanic migrants, we sampled an oceanic seabird, the Bulwer’s petrel, Bulweria bulwerii, in four breeding colonies spread along its Atlantic distribution. We first studied the species moulting pattern from 29 corpses collected in the colonies. Secondly, based on this moult knowledge, we selected three feathers from tracked birds to infer their breeding and non-breeding grounds using SIA: the 1st primary (P1), the 8th secondary (S8) and the 6th rectrix (R6) feathers. Birds migrated to two main non-breeding areas, the Central or the South Atlantic Ocean. P1 showed similar isotopic values among petrels from different breeding colonies, suggesting this feather is replaced early in the non-breeding period in a common area used by most birds, the Central Atlantic. S8 and R6 feathers correctly assigned 92% and 81%, respectively, of the birds to their non-breeding areas, suggesting they were replaced late in season, when birds were settled in their main non-breeding grounds. Our results showed that the isotopic baseline levels of the Central and South Atlantic are propagated through the food web until reaching top predators, suggesting these ratios can be used to infer the movement of long-distance migrants among oceanic water masses."

Reflexed screening for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in remnant blood samples was initially piloted at selected CD4 testing laboratories of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) prior to the implementation of a national screening programme using a lateral flow assay (LFA) (IMMY, Norman, OK, USA). The aim of this study was to assess CrAg positivity nationally, per province and district in combination with the percentage of CD4 samples tested with a CD4 count <100 cells/μl to identify areas with advanced HIV/CrAg disease burden.CrAg and CD4 laboratory result data were extracted from the NHLS corporate data warehouse. Monthly test volumes were used to assess CrAg test volumes and coverage, while bubble charts were used to display the relationship between CD4 <100 cells/μl, CrAg positivity and number of positive CrAg samples by district. ArcGIS software was used to spatially report CrAg positivity.CrAg screening coverage was stable at around 96% after November 2016. Samples with a CD4 <100 cell/μl and CrAg positivity were also stable over the study period at 10% and ~5% respectively. The highest CrAg positivity was reported for the Kwa-Zulu Natal province (7.3%), which also had the lowest percentage of samples with a CD4 <100 cells/μl (7.2%). Uthungulu and Umkhanyakude districts had the highest CrAg positivity (9.3% and 8.9% respectively). Ethekwini and Johannesburg Metro districts contributed to 22% of the total number of CrAg-positive samples tested across South Africa for the period reported.Existing CD4 testing services were used to rapidly scale up CrAg reflex testing in South Africa. Districts with advanced HIV and CrAg disease burden were identified that need further investigation of patient management interventions."

However, the precise mechanisms through which LH circuits orchestrate such dynamics have remained elusive due to the heterogeneity of the intermingled and functionally distinct cell types in this brain region. Here we reveal that a cell type in the mouse LH identified by the expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PVALB; LHPV) is fast-spiking, releases the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and sends long range projections throughout the brain. Thus, our findings challenge long-standing concepts that define neurons with a fast-spiking phenotype as exclusively GABAergic. Furthermore, we provide for the first time a detailed characterization of the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. Our work identifies LHPV neurons as a novel functional component within the LH glutamatergic circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2808581826,"Hepatocellular death or ballooning distinguishes the transition of simple steatosis to irreversible nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the molecular mechanism of hepatocellular apoptosis in NASH is largely unclear, and discovery of endogenous mediators that could prevent or inhibit cell death is thereby critical in intercepting NASH progression. Here, we identified pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a secreted, moonlighting hepatokine as 1 hepatoprotective agent in mice with diet-induced NASH. Hepatic PEDF expression is induced by IL-1β, which is derived from inflammasome activation in liver-resident Kupffer cells, an effect that is negatively regulated by TNF-α and predominantly secreted by monocyte-derived, recruited, hepatic macrophages. Mechanistically, reciprocal and opposing roles for IL-1β and TNF-α in PEDF expression are mediated by differential activation of nf-ΚB. Although augmented TNF-α production leads to temporal reduction of PEDF expression in NASH, PEDF conversely abrogates TNF-α-mediated hepatocyte death by modulating the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Thus, our study highlights PEDF as a functionally important hepatokine in NASH progression by linking inflammasome activation and hepatocellular death.—Adak, M., Das, D., Niyogi, S., Nagalakshmi, C., Ray, D., Chakrabarti, P.

https://openalex.org/W2808099375,"For maltose fermentation, budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae operates a mechanism that involves transporters (MALT), maltases (MALS) and regulators (MALR) collectively known as MAL genes. However, functional relevance of MAL genes during sake brewing process remains largely elusive, since sake yeast is cultured under glucose-rich condition achieved by the co-culture partner Aspergillus spp.. Here we isolated an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized sake yeast strain exhibiting enhanced maltose fermentation compared to the parental strain. The mutant carried a single nucleotide insertion that leads to the extension of the C-terminal region of a previously uncharacterized MALR gene YPR196W-2, which was renamed as MAL73. Introduction of the mutant allele MAL73L with extended C-terminal region into the parental or other sake yeast strains enhanced the growth rate when fed with maltose as the sole carbon source. In contrast, disruption of endogenous MAL73 in the sake yeasts decreased the maltose fermentation ability of sake yeast, confirming that the original MAL73 functions as a MALR. Importantly, the MAL73L-expressing strain fermented more maltose in practical condition compared to the parental strain during sake brewing process. Our data show that MAL73(L) is a novel MALR gene that regulates maltose fermentation, and has been functionally attenuated in sake yeast by single nucleotide deletion during breeding history. Since the MAL73L-expressing strain showed enhanced ability of maltose fermentation, MAL73L might also be a valuable tool for enhancing maltose fermentation in yeast in general."

Development of c-Met-targeted imaging and therapeutic agents would be extremely useful. Previous studies reported that c-Met-binding peptide (Met-pep1, YLFSVHWPPLKA) specifically targets c-Met receptor. Here, we evaluated 18F-labeled Met-pep1 for PET imaging of c-Met positive tumor in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenografted mice. Methods c-Met-binding peptide, Met-pep1, was synthesized and labeled with 4-nitrophenyl [18F]-2-fluoropropionate ([18F]-NPFP) ([18F]FP-Met-pep1). The cell uptake, internalization and efflux of [18F]FP-Met-pep1 were assessed in UM-SCC-22B cells. In vivo pharmacokinetics, blocking and biodistribution of the radiotracers were investigated in tumor-bearing nude mice by microPET imaging. Results The radiolabeling yield for [18F]FP-Met-pep1 was over 55% with 97% purity. [18F]FP-Met-pep1 showed high tumor uptake in UM-SCC-22B tumor-bearing mice with clear visualization. The specificity of the imaging tracer was confirmed by significantly decreased tumor uptake after co-administration of unlabeled Met-pep1 peptides. Prominent uptake and rapid excretion of [18F]FP-Met-pep1 was also observed in the kidney, suggesting this tracer is mainly excreted through the renal-urinary routes. Ex vivo biodistribution showed similar results that were consistent with microPET imaging data. Conclusions These results suggest that 18F-labeled c-Met peptide may potentially be used for imaging c-Met positive HNSCC cancer in vivo and for c-Met-targeted cancer therapy."

Post-diagnosis physical activity, TV viewing, and total sitting time were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.Increasing levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity were related to decreased risk of overall mortality [multivariable-adjusted HRs for <1 hr/wk (reference), 1 to 3 hrs/wk, ≥3 to <7 hrs/wk, and ≥7 hrs/wk = 1.0, 1.16, 0.94, and 0.60 (95% CI = 0.38-0.96; p-trend = 0.03)]. In contrast, television viewing was associated with increased risk of overall mortality in the age- and sex-adjusted model (HR for >4 hrs/d vs. 0 to 2 hrs/d = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.02-2.26; p-trend = 0.04), but the relation was attenuated following further control for other covariates (multivariable-adjusted HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.92-2.24; p-trend = 0.11). Total sitting time was unrelated to all-cause mortality.Among renal cancer patients, moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with decreased risk of overall mortality.

Structural comparison to B3 domains in plant transcription factors and other restriction enzymes identifies key recognition motifs responsible for site-specific DNA binding. Moreover, biochemistry and structural modeling provide a rationale for how H. pylori LlaJI.R1 may bind a target site that differs from the 5-bp sequence recognized by other LlaJI homologs and identify residues critical for this recognition activity.

In this study, we have examined these variants in relation to susceptibility and survival outcomes in colorectal cancer.Genotypes were obtained using TaqMan assays in 427 cases and 408 controls. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were fitted to examine the associations of the BRM-741 and BRM-1321 genotypes adjusting for relevant covariates. Sub-group analyses based on tumor location and patient sex were also performed. In all analyses, indels were examined individually as well as in combination.Our results showed that there was no association between the BRM polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer. However, genotype combinations of the BRM-741 and BRM-1321 variants were associated with the risk of colon cancer. Particularly, patients having at least one variant allele had increased risk of colon cancer when compared to patients with the double wild-type genotype. In the survival analyses, BRM-741 heterozygosity was associated with longer progression-free survival time in the colorectal cancer patients. A stronger association was detected in the male patients under the recessive genetic model where the homozygosity for the variant allele of BRM-741 was associated with shorter progression-free survival time.Our analyses suggest that BRM-741 and BRM-1321 indels are associated with the risk of developing colon cancer and the BRM-741 indel is associated with the disease progression in colorectal cancer patients, especially in the male patients. Although our results show a different relationship between these indels and colorectal cancer compared to other cancer sites, they also suggest that BRM and its promoter variants may have biological roles in susceptibility and survival outcomes in colorectal cancers.

Materials and methods Electronic medical records and diabetes registry data from a large, accountable care organization (ACO) were used to isolate a sample of adult patients with type 2 diabetes who received at least one oral antidiabetes agent and had at least one HbA1C level measurement ≥8.0% (64 mmol/mol; i.e., uncontrolled diabetes) between 7/1/2011 and 6/30/2015. Treatment intensification status was evaluated for each patient during a 120-day treatment intensification window following the index HbA1c measure. Two-level hierarchical generalized linear models, with patients aggregated at the physician level, were used to assess the association between treatment intensification and achieving HbA1C quality performance measures. Results 547 patients met study selection criteria and 480 patients had at least one HbA1C test after the treatment intensification window and were used for the statistical analyses. About 40% of patients who had uncontrolled diabetes received treatment intensification during the 120-day window. Greater index HbA1C, greater patient body mass index, and fewer unique pre-index oral antidiabetes agents were significantly associated with greater likelihood of receiving timely treatment intensification. The odds of receiving treatment intensification were about 1.8 times higher (P = 0.0027) among patients with poor index HbA1C control (HbA1c level >9.0% [75 mmol/mol]) compared to other patients (index HbA1c 8.0% - 9.0%). Hispanic patients (compared to White patients) were significantly more likely to exhibit poor control after treatment intensification (odds ratio [OR] 2.91, P = 0.0304), underscoring the difficulty of controlling diabetes in this vulnerable group. In contrast, being male and being treated primarily by an internist (compared to primary treatment by a family medicine specialist) were both significantly associated with achieving superior control (HbA1c level <8.0%) after treatment intensification (OR 0.53 [P = 0.0165]; OR 0.41 [P = 0.0275], respectively). Conclusions Timely treatment intensification was significantly associated with greater likelihood of patients achieving superior HbA1C control (<8.0%) and better HbA1C control quality performance for the practice. Even in an ACO with resources dedicated to diabetes control, it is incumbent upon clinicians to readily identify and open dialogues with patients who may benefit from closely supervised, individualized attention."
https://openalex.org/W2807857900,"Unlike lower organisms, mammals have 2 C-terminal binding protein (Ctbp) isoforms, Ctbp1 and Ctbp2. Ctbp2 is revealed as a key factor involved in determining cell fate decisions by regulating the epigenetic state in active embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 have different roles remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Ctbp isoform abundance is important for mouse embryonic ESCs (mESCs) to exit from pluripotency. Temporal expression patterns of Ctbp isoforms were quite different; Ctbp2 is more highly expressed in mESCs and decreases during differentiation, while Ctbp1 is constantly expressed at a lower level. Ctbp2 knockdown, but not Ctbp1 knockdown, in mESCs resulted in impaired exit from pluripotency. Interestingly, Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 overexpression in Ctbp2-knockdown mESCs leads to exiting from pluripotency in a manner similar to that of wild-type mESCs. Quantification of Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 revealed that differentiation ability correlates with abundance of Ctbp isoform in undifferentiated mESCs, suggesting that a sufficient amount of Ctbp isoform is a prerequisite for exiting from pluripotency. The results support the contention that 2 redundant Ctbp isoforms regulate elaborate differentiation via temporally distinctive regulatory patterns in mESCs.-Suh, M. Y., Kim, T.

Here, we report an efficient and precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration strategy using a donor plasmid that harbors 2 of the same cleavage sites that flank the cassette at both sides. After the delivery of donor plasmid, together with Cas9 mRNA and guide RNA, into cells or fertilized eggs, concurrent cleavages at both sides of the exogenous cassette and the desired chromosomal site result in precise targeted integration without plasmid backbone. We successfully used this approach to precisely integrate the EGFP reporter gene into the myh6 locus or the GAPDH locus in Xenopus tropicalis or human cells, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that replacing conventional terminators with the endogenous 3UTR of target genes in the cassette greatly improves the expression of reporter gene after integration.

https://openalex.org/W2808455684,"Host specialization is considered a primary driver of the enormous diversity of herbivorous insects. Trade-offs in host use are hypothesized to promote this specialization, but they have mostly been studied in generalist herbivores. We conducted a multi-generation selection experiment to examine the adaptation of the specialist seed-feeding bug, Lygaeus equestris, to three novel host plants (Helianthus annuus, Verbascum thapsus and Centaurea phrygia) and to test whether trade-offs promote specialization. During the selection experiment, body size of L. equestris increased more on the novel host plant H. annuus compared to the primary host plant, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, but this effect was not observed in other fitness related traits. In addition to selection, genetic drift caused variation among the experimental herbivore populations in their ability to exploit the host plants. Microsatellite data indicated that the level of within-population genetic variation decreased and population differentiation increased more in the selection line feeding on H. annuus compared to V. hirundinaria. We found a negative correlation between genetic differentiation and heterozygosity at the end of the experiment, suggesting that differentiation was significantly affected by genetic drift. We did not find fitness trade-offs between L. equestris feeding on the four hosts. Thus, trade-offs do not seem to promote specialization in L. equestris. Our results suggest that this insect herbivore is not likely to adapt to a novel host species in a time-scale of 20 generations despite sufficient genetic variation and that genetic drift disrupted the response to selection."

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by β2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI)-targeting antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) and vascular thrombosis or obstetrical complications. To examine the therapeutic potential of a β2-GPI DNA vaccine, we administered a vaccine mixed with FK506 as an adjuvant to a mouse model of obstetric APS. First, the pCMV3-β2-GPI DNA vaccine, which encodes the full-length human β2-GPI gene, was constructed. Then, we administered the β2-GPI DNA vaccine in 0.1 ml of saline, mixed with or without 100 μg of FK506, intramuscularly to the mice on days 28, 35 and 42. Blood titers of the anti-β2-GPI antibody, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs), and the percentage of fetal loss were measured. We also stimulated murine splenic T cells ex vivo with β2-GPI and determined the T helper cell proportion and cytokine secretion. The administration of the β2-GPI DNA vaccine mixed with FK506 reduced the blood IgG anti-β2-GPI antibody titers and suppressed APS manifestations in mice. The combination also suppressed interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-17A secretion but increased the Treg cell proportion and IL-10 secretion in murine splenic T cells following ex vivo stimulation with β2-GPI. Our results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of a β2-GPI DNA vaccine and FK506 as an adjuvant in a murine model of obstetric APS. Possible mechanisms include the inhibition of Th1 and Th17 responses and the up-regulation of Treg cells."

Here, we present a virtual reality version of the serial reaction time task and show that learning effects emerge as expected despite the novel way in which responses are collected. We also show that response times are distributed as expected. The current experiment was conducted in a blank virtual reality room to verify these basic principles. For future applications, the technology can be used to modify the virtual reality environment in any conceivable way, permitting a wide range of previously impossible experimental manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W2808380905,"Hunting records have proven useful for examining the historical status of wildlife populations. The number of animals harvested can provide information on past population sizes that would have been required to support harvest yields. Therefore, when statistical data on annual harvests are available, a minimum estimate of past population sizes can be calculated. A very simple method for estimating the sizes of historic wildlife populations using only annual hunting records and the maximum annual population increase rate is presented in this study. This method was applied to estimate past population sizes for Japanese sika deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis) in Hokkaido Island, Japan, using hunting records from 1873 to 1882, and assuming 15% and 35% population increase rates. The annual number of deer harvested during 1873 to 1882 ranged from 15,000 to 129,000. The minimum population size in 1873 was estimated as 349,000-473,000. This method was validated by applying it to the eastern population of Hokkaido Island in 1993 when the population size was approximately 260,000, and population sizes estimated by this method were 0.50-1.17 times the nominal population size. Thus, the population estimates from this method were approximately equal to or less than the expected population sizes, and this method can be used to obtain minimum estimates of wildlife populations. Because shorter durations of hunting records result in population size underestimates, it would be better to use hunting record of 10 years or longer in this method. In addition, the degree of underestimation may change with hunting pressure intensity on the populations, other causes of mortality, and maximum annual increase rates of the species. The method can be applied to any wildlife species for which records of annual harvest and maximum annual population increase rates of the species are available. The estimates obtained can provide benchmarks for the population size required for ecosystem conservation, and can be useful for wildlife management as they indicate the lowest limit to maintain the population."
