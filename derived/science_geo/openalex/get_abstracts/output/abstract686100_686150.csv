https://openalex.org/W4200539441,"Humans have infected a wide range of animals with SARS-CoV-21–5, but the establishment of a new natural animal reservoir has not been observed. Here we document that free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, are exposed to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from humans and are capable of sustaining transmission in nature. Using real-time PCR with reverse transcription, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in more than one-third (129 out of 360, 35.8%) of nasal swabs obtained from O. virginianus in northeast Ohio in the USA during January to March 2021. Deer in six locations were infected with three SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.2, B.1.582 and B.1.596). The B.1.2 viruses, dominant in humans in Ohio at the time, infected deer in four locations. We detected probable deer-to-deer transmission of B.1.2, B.1.582 and B.1.596 viruses, enabling the virus to acquire amino acid substitutions in the spike protein (including the receptor-binding domain) and ORF1 that are observed infrequently in humans. No spillback to humans was observed, but these findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been transmitted in wildlife in the USA, potentially opening new pathways for evolution. There is an urgent need to establish comprehensive ‘One Health’ programmes to monitor the environment, deer and other wildlife hosts globally. More than one-third of wild deer tested in northeast Ohio showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human origin."
https://openalex.org/W4200216147,"Abstract The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern suggests viral adaptation to enhance human-to-human transmission 1,2 . Although much effort has focused on the characterization of changes in the spike protein in variants of concern, mutations outside of spike are likely to contribute to adaptation. Here, using unbiased abundance proteomics, phosphoproteomics, RNA sequencing and viral replication assays, we show that isolates of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant 3 suppress innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells more effectively than first-wave isolates. We found that the Alpha variant has markedly increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of the nucleocapsid protein (N), Orf9b and Orf6—all known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70, a mitochondrial protein that is required for activation of the RNA-sensing adaptor MAVS. Moreover, the activity of Orf9b and its association with TOM70 was regulated by phosphorylation. We propose that more effective innate immune suppression, through enhanced expression of specific viral antagonist proteins, increases the likelihood of successful transmission of the Alpha variant, and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection 4 . The importance of mutations outside the spike coding region in the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is underscored by the observation that similar mutations exist in the N and Orf9b regulatory regions of the Delta and Omicron variants."
https://openalex.org/W4200583678,"Expansions of a G4C2 repeat in the C9ORF72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Using C9-ALS/FTD patient-derived cells and C9ORF72 BAC transgenic mice, we generated and optimized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively blunt expression of G4C2 repeat-containing transcripts and effectively suppress tissue levels of poly(GP) dipeptides. ASOs with reduced phosphorothioate content showed improved tolerability without sacrificing efficacy. In a single patient harboring mutant C9ORF72 with the G4C2 repeat expansion, repeated dosing by intrathecal delivery of the optimal ASO was well tolerated, leading to significant reductions in levels of cerebrospinal fluid poly(GP). This report provides insight into the effect of nucleic acid chemistry on toxicity and, to our knowledge, for the first time demonstrates the feasibility of clinical suppression of the C9ORF72 gene. Additional clinical trials will be required to demonstrate safety and efficacy of this therapy in patients with C9ORF72 gene mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4200403158,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes of haemagglutinin on the influenza virus have the potential to provide near universal protection against influenza virus infection1. However, viral mutants that escape broadly neutralizing antibodies have been reported2,3. The identification of broadly neutralizing antibody classes that can neutralize viral escape mutants is critical for universal influenza virus vaccine design. Here we report a distinct class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target a discrete membrane-proximal anchor epitope of the haemagglutinin stalk domain. Anchor epitope-targeting antibodies are broadly neutralizing across H1 viruses and can cross-react with H2 and H5 viruses that are a pandemic threat. Antibodies that target this anchor epitope utilize a highly restricted repertoire, which encodes two public binding motifs that make extensive contacts with conserved residues in the fusion peptide. Moreover, anchor epitope-targeting B cells are common in the human memory B cell repertoire and were recalled in humans by an oil-in-water adjuvanted chimeric haemagglutinin vaccine4,5, which is a potential universal influenza virus vaccine. To maximize protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, vaccines should aim to boost this previously untapped source of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are widespread in the human memory B cell pool."
https://openalex.org/W4200596034,"The purinergic transmitter ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) plays an essential role in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and the ability to directly measure extracellular ATP in real time will increase our understanding of its physiological functions. Here, we developed a sensitive GPCR activation-based ATP sensor called GRABATP1.0, with a robust fluorescence response to extracellular ATP when expressed in several cell types. This sensor has sub-second kinetics, has ATP affinity in the range of tens of nanomolar, and can be used to localize ATP release with subcellular resolution. Using this sensor, we monitored ATP release under a variety of in vitro and in vivo conditions, including stimuli-induced and spontaneous ATP release in primary hippocampal cultures, injury-induced ATP release in a zebrafish model, and lipopolysaccharides-induced ATP-release events in individual astrocytes in the mouse cortex. Thus, the GRABATP1.0 sensor is a sensitive, versatile tool for monitoring ATP release and dynamics under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4225556864,"How tissues acquire complex shapes is a fundamental question in biology and regenerative medicine. Zebrafish semicircular canals form from invaginations in the otic epithelium (buds) that extend and fuse to form the hubs of each canal. We find that conventional actomyosin-driven behaviors are not required. Instead, local secretion of hyaluronan, made by the enzymes uridine 5′-diphosphate dehydrogenase (ugdh) and hyaluronan synthase 3 (has3), drives canal morphogenesis. Charged hyaluronate polymers osmotically swell with water and generate isotropic extracellular pressure to deform the overlying epithelium into buds. The mechanical anisotropy needed to shape buds into tubes is conferred by a polarized distribution of actomyosin and E-cadherin-rich membrane tethers, which we term cytocinches. Most work on tissue morphogenesis ascribes actomyosin contractility as the driving force, while the extracellular matrix shapes tissues through differential stiffness. Our work inverts this expectation. Hyaluronate pressure shaped by anisotropic tissue stiffness may be a widespread mechanism for powering morphological change in organogenesis and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W4200613994,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the world economy in various ways. In particular, the drastic shift to telework has dramatically changed how people work. Whether the new style of working from home (WFH) will remain in our society highly depends on its effects on workers' productivity. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of WFH on productivity are still unclear. By leveraging unique surveys conducted at four manufacturing firms in Japan, we assess within-company productivity differences between those who work from home and those who do not, along with identifying possible factors of productivity changes due to WFH. Our main findings are as follows. First, after ruling out the time-invariant component of individual productivity and separate trends specific to employee attributes, we find that workers who worked from home experienced productivity declines more than those who did not. Second, our analysis shows that poor WFH setups and communication difficulties are the major reasons for productivity losses. Third, we find that the mental health of workers who work from home is better than that of workers who are unable to work from home. Our result suggests that if appropriate investments in upgrading WFH setups and facilitating communication can be made, WFH may improve productivity by improving employees' health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4200012610,"The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has brought an unprecedented focus on public attitudes to vaccines, with intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine fluctuating during the pandemic. However, it is unclear how the pandemic may influence attitudes and behaviour in relation to vaccines in general. The aim of the current study is to examine older adults' changes in vaccination attitudes and behaviour over the first year of the pandemic.In February-March 2020 (before the first COVID-19 national lockdown in the UK), 372 older adults (aged 65+) provided sociodemographic information, self-reported influenza vaccine uptake, and completed two measures of vaccination attitudes: the 5C scale and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale. One-year later, following rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to older adults, participants provided information on their COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in the previous 12 months, and completed the 5C and VAX scales again. Paired samples t-tests were used to examine changes in vaccination attitudes over time.Almost all participants (98.7%) had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and a significant increase in influenza uptake was identified (83.6% in 2020 to 91.6% in 2021). Complacency, mistrust of vaccine benefit, concerns about commercial profiteering, and constraints to vaccination had significantly decreased between Time 1 and Time 2, and collective responsibility had significant increased. However, calculation and worries about unforeseen future effects had increased, indicating that participants now perceived higher risks related to vaccination and were taking a more deliberative information-seeking approach.The results show significant changes in vaccination attitudes across the pandemic. These changes suggest that while older adults became less complacent about the importance of vaccines, concerns about potential risks associated with vaccination increased. It will be important for public health communication to address these concerns for all vaccines offered to this group."
https://openalex.org/W4200163820,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metagenomics are used to quantify population structure, track strains and identify genetic determinants of microbial phenotypes. However, existing alignment-based approaches for metagenomic SNP detection require high-performance computing and enough read coverage to distinguish SNPs from sequencing errors. To address these issues, we developed the GenoTyper for Prokaryotes (GT-Pro), a suite of methods to catalog SNPs from genomes and use unique k-mers to rapidly genotype these SNPs from metagenomes. Compared to methods that use read alignment, GT-Pro is more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster. Using high-quality genomes, we constructed a catalog of 104 million SNPs in 909 human gut species and used unique k-mers targeting this catalog to characterize the global population structure of gut microbes from 7,459 samples. GT-Pro enables fast and memory-efficient metagenotyping of millions of SNPs on a personal computer. Alignment-free SNP calling from metagenomes reduces computational time by two orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W4200485684,"Understanding the core replication complex of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to the development of novel coronavirus-specific antiviral therapeutics. Among the proteins required for faithful replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14), a bifunctional enzyme with an N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase, and its accessory protein, NSP10. The difficulty in producing pure and high quantities of the NSP10/14 complex has hampered the biochemical and structural study of these important proteins. We developed a straightforward protocol for the expression and purification of both NSP10 and NSP14 from Escherichia coli and for the in vitro assembly and purification of a stoichiometric NSP10/14 complex with high yields. Using these methods, we observe that NSP10 provides a 260-fold increase in kcat/Km in the exoribonucleolytic activity of NSP14 and enhances protein stability. We also probed the effect of two small molecules on NSP10/14 activity, remdesivir monophosphate and the methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine. Our analysis highlights two important factors for drug development: first, unlike other exonucleases, the monophosphate nucleoside analog intermediate of remdesivir does not inhibit NSP14 activity; and second, S-adenosylhomocysteine modestly activates NSP14 exonuclease activity. In total, our analysis provides insights for future structure-function studies of SARS-CoV-2 replication fidelity for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019."
https://openalex.org/W4226333602,"Melanin is a major virulence factor in pathogenic fungi that enhances the ability of fungal cells to resist immune clearance. Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogenic fungus that synthesizes melanin from exogenous tissue catecholamine precursors during infection, but the type of melanin made in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is unknown. We analyzed the efficacy of various catecholamines found in brain tissue in supporting melanization using animal brain tissue and synthetic catecholamine mixtures reflecting brain tissue proportions. Solid-state NMR spectra of the melanin pigment produced from such mixtures yielded more melanin than expected if only the preferred constituent dopamine had been incorporated, suggesting uptake of additional catecholamines. Probing the biosynthesis of melanin using radiolabeled catecholamines revealed that C. neoformans melanization simultaneously incorporated more than one catecholamine, implying that the pigment was polytypic in nature. Nonetheless, melanin derived from individual or mixed catecholamines had comparable ability to protect C. neoformans against ultraviolet light and oxidants. Our results indicate that melanin produced during infection differs depending on the catecholamine composition of tissue and that melanin pigment synthesized in vivo is likely to accrue from the polymerization of a mixture of precursors. From a practical standpoint, our results strongly suggest that using dopamine as a polymerization precursor is capable of producing melanin pigment comparable to that produced during infection. On a more fundamental level, our findings uncover additional structural complexity for natural cryptococcal melanin by demonstrating that pigment produced during human infection is likely to be composed of polymerized moieties derived from chemically different precursors."
https://openalex.org/W4200559182,"Ceramide is a lipid moiety synthesized via the enzymatic activity of ceramide synthases (CerSs), six of which have been identified in mammalian cells, and each of which uses a unique subset of acyl-CoAs for ceramide synthesis. The CerSs are part of a larger gene family, the Tram-Lag-CLN8 domain family. Here, we identify a unique, C-terminal motif, the DxRSDxE motif, which is only found in CerSs and not in other Tram-Lag-CLN8 family members. Deletion of this motif in either CerS2 or in CerS6 did not affect the ability of either enzyme to generate ceramide using both an in vitro assay and metabolic labeling, but deletion of this motif did affect the activity of CerS2 when coexpressed with CerS6. Surprisingly, transfection of cells with either CerS2 or CerS6 lacking the motif did not result in changes in cellular ceramide levels. We found that CerS2 and CerS6 interact with each other, as shown by immunoprecipitation, but deletion of the DxRSDxE motif impeded this interaction. Moreover, proteomics analysis of cells transfected with CerS6Δ338-344 indicated that deletion of the C-terminal motif impacted cellular protein expression, and in particular, the levels of ORMDL1, a negative regulator of sphingolipid synthesis. We suggest that this novel C-terminal motif regulates CerS dimer formation and thereby impacts ceramide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4200250225,"White Feces Syndrome (WFS) is an emergent disease of penaeid shrimp (Penaeus monodon and P. vannamei) that is identified by the presence of floating white fecal strings on pond water in grow-out ponds. Although the clinical manifestations of WFS are well defined, the underling etiology remains obscure. WFS has been associated with several enteric pathogens, including Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP). The association is based on studies that found areas where WFS has been reported, the prevalence and severity of EHP infection are high. In this study, we describe an experimental reproduction of WFS in P. vannamei pre-infected with EHP and challenged with a unique isolate of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a shrimp displaying WFS. Upon laboratory challenge, shrimp displaying white fecal strings and white discoloration of the gastrointestinal tract were analyzed by histopathology, in-situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Histological analysis confirmed the lesions of EHP and septic hepatopancreatic necrosis in the hepatopancreas of shrimp exposed to both pathogens. Quantitative PCR showed shrimp infected with both EHP and V. parahaemolyticus had a significantly higher load of EHP compared to shrimp infected with EHP alone. This is the first demonstration of experimental reproduction of WFS under laboratory conditions when animals are infected with EHP and V. parahaemolyticus concurrently. The data revealed a synergistic relation between EHP and V. parahaemolyticus isolate that led to the manifestation of WFS. We propose the gross signs of WFS can be used as an indicator of the presence of EHP infection in association with a particular strain of an enteric Vibrio spp. in countries where EHP is endemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200435783,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are one of the fatal diseases of the lungs that have severe impacts on public health and the global economy. The currently available antibiotics administered orally for the treatment of LRTIs need high doses with frequent administration and cause dose-related adverse effects. To overcome this problem, we investigated the development of ciprofloxacin (CIP) loaded poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) nanoparticles (NPs) for potential pulmonary delivery from dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations against LRTIs. NPs were prepared using a straightforward co-assembly reaction carried out by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding among PEtOx, tannic acid (TA), and CIP. The prepared NPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The CIP was determined by validated HPLC and UV spectrophotometry methods. The CIP loading into the PEtOx was between 21–67% and increased loading was observed with the increasing concentration of CIP. The NP sizes of PEtOx with or without drug loading were between 196–350 nm and increased with increasing drug loading. The in vitro CIP release showed the maximum cumulative release of about 78% in 168 h with a burst release of 50% in the first 12 h. The kinetics of CIP release from NPs followed non-Fickian or anomalous transport thus suggesting the drug release was regulated by both diffusion and polymer degradation. The in vitro aerosolization study carried out using a Twin Stage Impinger (TSI) at 60 L/min air flow showed the fine particle fraction (FPF) between 34.4% and 40.8%. The FPF was increased with increased drug loading. The outcome of this study revealed the potential of the polymer PEtOx as a carrier for developing CIP-loaded PEtOx NPs as DPI formulation for pulmonary delivery against LRTIs."
https://openalex.org/W4200624400,"Strawberry is one of the plants sensitive to salt and alkalinity stress. Light quality affects plant growth and metabolic activities. However, there is no clear answer in the literature on how light can improve the performance of the photosynthetic apparatus of this species under salt and alkalinity stress. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of different spectra of supplemental light on strawberry (cv. Camarosa) under salt and alkalinity stress conditions. Light spectra of blue (with peak 460 nm), red (with peak 660 nm), blue/red (1:3), white/yellow (1:1) (400-700 nm) and ambient light were used as control. There were three stress treatments: control (no stress), alkalinity (40 mM NaHCO3), and salinity (80 mM NaCl). Under stress conditions, red and red/blue light had a positive effect on CO2 assimilation. In addition, blue/red light increased intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) under both stress conditions. Salinity and alkalinity stress decreased OJIP curves compared to the control treatment. Blue light caused an increase in its in plants under salinity stress, and red and blue/red light caused an increase in its in plants under alkalinity. Both salt and alkalinity stress caused a significant reduction in photosystem II (PSII) performance indices and quantum yield parameters. Adjustment of light spectra, especially red light, increased these parameters. It can be concluded that the adverse effects of salt and alkalinity stress on photosynthesis can be partially alleviated by changing the light spectra."
https://openalex.org/W4200305940,"Chloris virgata has become one of the most difficult glyphosate-resistant (GR) grass weeds in summer fallows in the eastern region of Australia. It germinates in several cohorts following rainfall events; therefore, growers are often tempted to wait for most of the weeds to emerge before herbicide application. However, by that time, some seedlings have reached an advanced stage and there is limited information on the efficacy and reliability of alternate herbicides when targeting large plants of GR C. virgata. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of alternate herbicides for the control of GR C. virgata. Haloxyfop (80 g a.i. ha-1) on its own, in mixtures, or sequential applications of haloxyfop and paraquat or glufosinate provided 97 to 100% mortality of the 8-10 leaf stage plants. Glufosinate (1500 g a.i. ha-1) also provided complete control of plants at this growth stage. For larger plants at the 24-28 leaf stage, glufosinate, with or without additional tank-mixed adjuvants, generally did not provide full control, however did show very high levels of biomass reduction and panicle suppression at application rates of 750 or 1500 g a.i. ha-1. Haloxyfop (40 to 160 g a.i. ha-1) and clethodim (180 g a.i. ha-1) on their own achieved 96 to 100% mortality at this growth stage. When applied to large plants (40-50 leaf stage), a tank-mix of isoxaflutole plus paraquat demonstrated significantly higher levels of plant mortality and biomass reduction than either herbicide used alone, and this mixture appears to be synergistic when tested via the Colby equation for synergy or antagonism. Plant mortality was greater (83%) when isoxaflutole (75 g a.i. ha-1) plus paraquat (300 g a.i. ha-1) was taken up through the foliage and soil, compared with the foliage alone. This study identified alternative herbicide options for large plants of GR C. virgata."
https://openalex.org/W4200071216,"The mitochondrial solute carrier family 8 sodium/calcium/lithium exchanger, member B1 (NCLX) is an important mediator of calcium extrusion from mitochondria. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that physiological expression levels of NCLX are essential for maintaining neuronal resilience in the face of excitotoxic challenge. Using an shRNA-mediated approach, we showed that reduced NCLX expression exacerbates neuronal mitochondrial calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) breakdown, and reactive oxygen species generation during excitotoxic stimulation of primary hippocampal cultures. Moreover, NCLX knockdown-which affected both neurons and glia-resulted not only in enhanced neurodegeneration following an excitotoxic insult but also in neuronal and astrocytic cell death under basal conditions. Our data also revealed that synaptic activity, which promotes neuroprotective signaling, can become lethal upon NCLX depletion; expression of NCLX-targeted shRNA impaired the clearance of mitochondrial calcium following action potential bursts, and was associated both with ΔΨm breakdown and substantial neurodegeneration in hippocampal cultures undergoing synaptic activity. Finally, we showed that NCLX knockdown within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region in vivo causes substantial neurodegeneration and astrodegeneration. In summary, we demonstrated that dysregulated NCLX expression not only sensitizes neuroglial networks to excitotoxic stimuli but also notably renders otherwise neuroprotective synaptic activity toxic. These findings may explain the emergence of neurodegeneration and astrodegeneration in patients with disorders characterized by disrupted NCLX expression or function, and suggest that treatments aimed at enhancing or restoring NCLX function may prevent central nervous system damage in these disease states."
https://openalex.org/W4200520994,"Upon the introduction of autonomous vehicles into daily traffic, it becomes increasingly likely that autonomous vehicles become involved in accident scenarios in which decisions have to be made about how to distribute harm among involved parties. In four experiments, participants made moral decisions from the perspective of a passenger, a pedestrian, or an observer. The results show that the preferred action of an autonomous vehicle strongly depends on perspective. Participants' judgments reflect self-protective tendencies even when utilitarian motives clearly favor one of the available options. However, with an increasing number of lives at stake, utilitarian preferences increased. In a fifth experiment, we tested whether these results were tainted by social desirability but this was not the case. Overall, the results confirm that strong differences exist among passengers, pedestrians, and observers about the preferred course of action in critical incidents. It is therefore important that the actions of autonomous vehicles are not only oriented towards the needs of their passengers, but also take the interests of other road users into account. Even though utilitarian motives cannot fully reconcile the conflicting interests of passengers and pedestrians, there seem to be some moral preferences that a majority of the participants agree upon regardless of their perspective, including the utilitarian preference to save several other lives over one's own."
https://openalex.org/W4200343789,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the biggest public health problem worldwide. Intensive international travel and tourism have greatly contributed to its rapid global spreading. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of the travel-associated COVID-19 cases in Vojvodina, Serbia, from March 6 to December 31, 2020 and it concerns permanent residents of Serbia. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the dedicated surveillance database of the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina. Overall, 650 travel-associated COVID-19 cases were recorded in Vojvodina during the observed period, mainly imported from Bosnia and Herzegovina, followed by Austria and Germany (N = 195, 30%; N = 79, 12.15% and N = 75, 11.54%, respectively). The majority of cases were in the working-age groups, 18-44 and 45-64 years (56.46% and 34.15%, respectively). Overall, 54 (8.31%) patients developed pneumonia. In comparison to patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were older (mean age = 55.39 years vs. 41.34 years, p<0.01) and had a higher percentage of comorbidities (57.41% vs. 16.61%). Men were more likely to develop pneumonia than women (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14-4.30, p = 0.02), as well as those in retired-age group (OR = 4.11; 95% CI: 2.0-8.46, p<0.01). Obesity (OR = 14.40; 95% CI: 3.8-54.6, p<0.01), diabetes (OR = 9.82; 95% CI: 3.15-30.61, p<0.01) and hypertension (OR = 7.99; 95% CI: 3.98-16.02, p<0.01) were the most prominent main comorbidities as predictors of pneumonia. Our results represent general epidemiological and clinical dynamics of COVID-19 disease in Vojvodina. Also, they provide evidence that the predictors of pneumonia were: increasing age, male sex, having underlying comorbidities, an increasing number of days from the return to laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12, p<0.01), as well as an increasing number of days from symptoms onset to diagnosis (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.21, p<0.01), while anosmia and ageusia were protective factors for developing it (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.79, p = 0.01)."

https://openalex.org/W4200593790,"Background Clinical clerkship programme in medical schools were developed to provide students with direct interactions with patients and observe clinical teachers in practice. However, professional dilemmas are prone to occur due to the nature of experiential learning. Several studies across different cultures showed that medical students responded differently towards professional dilemma. Aims This study aims to explore how medical students respond to professional dilemmas occurred during their clinical clerkships and to what extent culture influences the responses. Method A qualitative descriptive approach was used in this study. We conducted four focus group discussions with final year medical students who were selected using maximum variety sampling method. Thematic analysis was conducted following the transcription of the focus groups. Results We identified the impact of dilemmas on students’ emotions and concerns, students’ responses towards professional dilemmas, and factors affecting responses to dilemmas in clinical clerkship, which confirmed that cultures played roles in how students responded towards professional dilemmas. Conclusion This study has identified that culture, to some extent, influenced the way students responded to professional dilemmas. Therefore, it is paramount to develop a conducive and culturally sensitive educational environment and students’ ability to learn from professional dilemma experienced in the workplace for developing their professional identity."
https://openalex.org/W4200346004,"The thymus is the central immune organ, but it is known to progressively degenerate with age. As thymus degeneration is paralleled by the wasting of aging skeletal muscle, we speculated that the thymus may play a role in muscle wasting. Here, using thymectomized mice, we show that the thymus is necessary for skeletal muscle regeneration, a process tightly associated with muscle aging. Compared to control mice, the thymectomized mice displayed comparable growth of muscle mass, but decreased muscle regeneration in response to injury, as evidenced by small and sparse regenerative myofibers along with inhibited expression of regeneration-associated genes myh3, myod, and myogenin. Using paired box 7 (Pax7)-immunofluorescence staining and 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-incorporation assay, we determined that the decreased regeneration capacity was caused by a limited satellite cell pool. Interestingly, the conditioned culture medium of isolated thymocytes had a potent capacity to directly stimulate satellite cell expansion in vitro. These expanded cells were enriched in subpopulations of quiescent satellite cells (Pax7highMyoDlowEdUpos) and activated satellite cells (Pax7highMyoDhighEdUpos), which were efficiently incorporated into the regenerative myofibers. We thus propose that the thymus plays an essential role in muscle regeneration by directly promoting satellite cell expansion and may function profoundly in the muscle aging process."
https://openalex.org/W4200547126,"The accurate determination of permeability is one of the parameters essential for the study of fluid flow and transport state. However, a large number of fractured coal bodies are faced during the production of coal mines. The study of permeability of these special media composed of grains of a certain size, whose structure is different from that of raw coal, has been in the exploratory stage. In this paper, inspired by the calculation method of median particle size and the calculation principle of KC's equation, we calculate the permeability parameters of broken coal particles. It is considered that its permeability is closely related to the compaction and re-crushing process of skeletal grains. The lateral limit compression test of the crushed coal body was designed, and the pore-dominated permeability calculation method was given to reveal the mechanism of the action of the effective stress. The dependence relationship between the effective stress and the pore-correlation permeability is obtained by data analysis, and the force and deformation process of the crushed coal grain media is described. In contrast to the conventional Darcy series of permeability discussions, our approach excludes the influence of fluid factors on the permeability of porous media. The permeability of porous media is considered to be determined only by its own pore structure."
https://openalex.org/W4200555156,"Mangrove ecosystems are some of the most productive and important sinks for sediment globally. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in possible causes of stress in mangroves, such as nutrient limitation, high salinity, solar radiation and temperature. We measured different factors casing stress and determined how they influenced oxidative stress and growth biomarkers in six study sites dominated by mangroves; Al Lith, South Jeddah, Dahban, Thuwal, Rabigh and Mastorah. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were recorded in water salinities and temperatures, nitrogen and phosphorus content in sediments, and antioxidant enzyme activities in different study sites. The highest salinity (40.75 ‰) and temperature (29.32°C) were recorded in the Rabigh mangrove stand, which corresponds to the lowest dissolved oxygen (5.21 mg/L). Total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediment across the study areas were in the order Rabigh>Thuwal>Dahban>Al Lith>South Jeddah>Mastorah. Total nitrogen in mangrove leaves at Rabigh was the highest and about 1.3 times higher than the total nitrogen in South Jeddah mangrove ecosystem, very different from the ratio of total nitrogen in the sediments at Rabigh and South Jeddah mangrove ecosystems. The average values of δ13C (-17.60‰) and δ15N (2.84‰) in the six mangrove ecosystems, and the highest δ13C (-13.62‰) and δ15N (4.39‰) at Rabigh in the sediments suggest that nutrient input differed among study sites. Higher nutrient levels at Rabigh mangrove ecosystem were attributed to restricted circulation, camel grazing and land runoff with agricultural waste during seasonal flooding events. However, N limitation and possibly salinity contributed to stress in Al Lith, South Jeddah, Dahban, Thuwal, Rabigh, and Mastorah mangrove ecosystems. Salinity (r = 0.9012) contribute more to stress at Rabigh."
https://openalex.org/W4200268790,"Obesity and being overweight are growing worldwide health problems that also affect women of reproductive age. They impair women's fertility and are associated with lower IVF success rates. The mechanism by which increased body weight disrupts fertility has not yet been established. One possibility is that it affects the process of embryo implantation on the endometrial level. The purpose of our study was to determine the differences in enriched biological pathways in the endometrium of overweight and obese women undergoing IVF procedures. For this purpose, 14 patients (5 pregnant, 9 non-pregnant) were included in the study. Endometrial samples were obtained during the window of implantation and RNA sequencing was performed. There were no differences in general patient's and IVF cycle characteristics between pregnant and non-pregnant women. In the endometrial samples of women who did not conceive, pathways related to the immune response, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species production were over-expressed. Our findings show that the reason for implantation failure in overweight and obese women could lie in the excessive immune and inflammatory response at the endometrial level."
https://openalex.org/W4200360291,"Although they are only home to 16% of the global human population, high-income countries produce approximately one third of the world's waste, the majority of which goes to landfills. To reduce pressure on landfills and natural systems, environmental messaging should focus on reducing consumption. Messages that signal social norms have the potential to influence people to reduce their consumption of comfort goods, such as straws, which are not a necessity for most people. We conducted a randomized field-experiment at a marine park in Portugal to test whether different normative messages reduced visitors' paper straw use when compared to non-normative messages. We found that a message framed around a positive injunctive norm significantly reduced straw use compared to a non-normative message. We estimated that using the message at 17 park concession stands could keep over 27500 straws out of landfills annually and save the park money after two years."

But the detection platform of the variants of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce because its specificity is very challenging to achieve for those with only one or a few nucleotide(s) differences. Here, we report for the first time that chimeric crRNA could be critical in enhancing the specificity of CRISPR-Cas12a detecting of N501Y, which is shared by Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants of SARS-CoV-2 without compromising its sensitivity. This strategy could also be applied to detect other SARS-CoV-2 variants that differ only one or a few nucleotide(s) differences."
https://openalex.org/W4200207443,"Medicinal plants represent a great source of antimicrobial and phytochemical constituents which are increasingly used to treat microbial infections and other ailments such as tuberculosis, anemia, and trachoma. Despite the use of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance continues to be a world issue, in as much as nutrition. This study investigated the presence of phytochemicals, proximate compositions, and antimicrobial activity of methanolic extract of Carapa procera bark. The bark of Carapa procera was collected, cleaned and air dried for 72 h. The powder obtained was treated with diethyl ether and soaked in methanol (99%) for 72 h to obtain crude extract. The extract was used to test for the presence of phytochemicals and antimicrobial activities. The raw bark was used for proximate analysis. The result showed presence of steroids, tannins and saponins, but no alkaloids present. The 100 mg/mL extract had the highest inhibition zone on all tested organisms from 24.00 ± 0.94 to 26.67 ± 1.18, and 50 mg/mL showed the least (16.67 ± 1.24) on Candida albicans . Staphylococcus aureus showed the lowest minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 3.12 mg/mL, whereas the Gram-negative bacteria exhibited variations in their sensitivity with E . coli having the highest MIC of 25 mg/mL. The extract had high MIC (6.25 mg/mL) on Candida albicans than clotrimazole (50 mg/mL). The proximate compositions of Carapa procera were moisture (6.07 ± 0.07%), ash (12.46 ± 0.46%), crude protein (9.54 ± 0.12%), crude fat (1.42 ± 0.06%) and carbohydrate (70.50 ± 0.35%). The energy value was 1413.17 kj. Thus, Carapa procera possesses both antimicrobial and nutritional potentials worth exploring and domesticating for sustainable management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4200208691,"Local relapse of oral squamous cell carcinoma in non-involved mucosal surgical margins indicated possibility of field alteration in the margins, which could be predicted with certain biomarkers. The objectives were to evaluate the expression of Ki-67, Cornulin and ISG15 in non-involved mucosal surgical margins and the association of clinicopathological prognosticators with local relapse in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Surgical margins from the study (relapse) group (n = 23), control (non-relapse) group (n = 32) and normal oral mucosa (n = 5) were immunohistochemically stained using Ki-67, Cornulin and ISG15 antibodies. Association between expression of markers and clinicopathological prognosticators with local relapse in oral squamous cell carcinoma was analyzed statistically.The study group surgical margins demonstrated significantly decreased Cornulin expression (p = 0.032). Low Cornulin expression was significantly associated with local relapse (p = 0.004) and non-tongue primary tumor (p = 0.013). Although not significantly associated with local relapse, expression of Ki-67 was significantly reduced in female patients (p = 0.041). Age above 57.5 years, Chinese & Indian ethnicity, alcohol consumption, epithelial dysplasia in surgical margins, and type III and IV patterns of invasion of tumor were also significantly related to local relapse. Regression analysis showed low expression of Cornulin (p = 0.018), and increased patient's age (p = 0.008) were predictors of local relapse in oral squamous cell carcinoma, with 34-fold risk and 18-fold risk, respectively. Expression of Ki-67 and ISG15 did not show significant association with local relapse in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Low expression of Cornulin is an independent predictor of relapse in oral squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W4200359695,"Glomerulonephritis is an acquired serious glomerular disease, which involves the interplay of many factors such as cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory cells, and heparan sulfate (HS). We previously showed that blocking of inflammatory heparan sulfate domains on cultured glomerular endothelium by specific anti-HS single chain antibodies reduced polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) adhesion and chemokine binding. We hypothesized that injection of anti-HS antibodies in PMN-driven experimental glomerulonephritis should reduce glomerular influx of PMNs and thereby lead to a better renal outcome. In contrast to our hypothesis, co-injection of anti-HS antibodies did not alter the final outcome of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)-induced glomerulonephritis. Glomerular PMN influx, normally peaking 2 hours after induction of glomerulonephritis with anti-GBM IgG was not reduced by co-injection of anti-HS antibodies. Four days after induction of glomerulonephritis, albuminuria, renal function, glomerular hyalinosis and fibrin deposition were similar in mice treated and not treated with anti-HS antibodies. Interestingly, we observed transient effects in mice co-injected with anti-HS antibodies compared to mice that did not receive anti-HS antibodies: (i) a decreased renal function 2 hours and 1 day after induction of glomerulonephritis; (ii) an increased albuminuria after 2 hours and 1 day; (iii) an increased glomerular fibrin deposition after 1 day; (iv) a reduced glomerular macrophage influx after 1 day; (v) a sustained glomerular presence of PMNs at day 1 and 4, accompanied by an increased renal expression of IL-6, CXCL1, ICAM-1, L-selectin, CD11b and NF-κB. The mechanism underlying these observations induced by anti-HS antibodies remains unclear, but may be explained by a temporarily altered glycocalyx and/or altered function of PMNs due to the binding of anti-HS antibodies. Nevertheless, the evaluated anti-HS antibodies do not show therapeutic potential in anti-GBM-induced glomerulonephritis. Future research should evaluate other strategies to target HS domains involved in inflammatory processes during glomerulonephritis."
https://openalex.org/W4200363151,"Objective Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been concerns that social distancing may negatively impact mental health, particularly with regards to loneliness, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. The current study explored how aspects of social distancing, communication, and online support from October 2020 to December 2020 related to loneliness, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Method Participants ( n = 216) who self-identified as having mental health diagnoses were recruited and completed questionnaires online. Results Findings showed that COVID-19 related social contact, particularly electronic social contact, is associated with decreased loneliness, suicidal ideation, and depression. Online emotional support was significantly associated with decreased loneliness and depressive symptoms. Social distancing practices were not associated with increased loneliness, suicidal ideation, and depression. Conclusions Our findings underscore the importance of leveraging electronic methods of social connection, especially among individuals who are at risk for suicide or depression."
https://openalex.org/W4200417959,"The ability to differentiate life history variants is vital for estimating fisheries management parameters, yet traditional survey methods can be inaccurate in mixed-stock fisheries. Such is the case for kokanee, the freshwater resident form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), which exhibits various reproductive ecotypes (stream-, shore-, deep-spawning) that co-occur with each other and/or anadromous O. nerka in some systems across their pan-Pacific distribution. Here, we developed a multi-purpose Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel of 288 targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to enable accurate kokanee stock identification by geographic basin, migratory form, and reproductive ecotype across British Columbia, Canada. The GT-seq panel exhibited high self-assignment accuracy (93.3%) and perfect assignment of individuals not included in the baseline to their geographic basin, migratory form, and reproductive ecotype of origin. The GT-seq panel was subsequently applied to Wood Lake, a valuable mixed-stock fishery, revealing high concordance (>98%) with previous assignments to ecotype using microsatellites and TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays, while improving resolution, extending a long-term time-series, and demonstrating the scalability of this approach for this system and others."

We hypothesize that, when combined with language therapy, daily escitalopram will result in greater improvement than placebo in an untrained picture naming task (Philadelphia Naming Test short form) administered one week after the end of language therapy. We also will examine whether escitalopram's effect on language is independent of its effect on depression, varies with lesion location, or is associated with increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere. Finally, we will examine whether individuals with BDNF met alleles show reduced response to treatment and reduced changes in connectivity. We expect to enroll 88 participants over four years. Participants are given escitalopram or placebo within one week of their stroke for 90 days and receive fifteen 45-minute computer-delivered sessions of language treatment beginning 60 days from the start of drug therapy. Patients then complete a comprehensive assessment of language at one, five, and twenty weeks after the last language therapy session. ELISA is the first randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor on the improvement of language in people with aphasia undergoing language treatment during the acute to subacute post-stroke period.

However, the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on the efficacy of vonoprazan have been inconsistent. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of vonoprazan in antithrombotic drug users, a population that has been excluded from RCTs. Treatment effects were assessed using cross-design synthesis, which can be adjusted for differences in study design and patient characteristics. We used data from an RCT in Japan (70 patients in the vonoprazan group and 69 in the PPI group) and an observational study (408 patients in the vonoprazan group and 870 in the PPI group). After matching, among the antithrombotic drug users in the observational study, post-ESD bleeding was noted in 8 out of 86 patients in the vonoprazan group and 18 out of 86 patients in the PPI group. After pooling the data from the RCT and observational study, the risk difference for antithrombotic drug users was -14.6% (95% CI: -22.0 to -7.2). CDS analysis suggested that vonoprazan is more effective than PPIs in preventing post-ESD bleeding among patients administered antithrombotic medications."

The self-reported questionnaire on Occupational Balance in Informal Caregivers (OBI-Care) is a measurement instrument to assess occupational balance in informal caregivers. Measurement properties of the German version of the OBI-Care had previously been assessed in parents of preterm infants exclusively. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the measurement properties of the questionnaire in a mixed population of informal caregivers.A psychometric study was conducted, applying a multicenter cross-sectional design. Measurement properties (construct validity, internal consistency, and interpretability) of each subscale of the German version of the OBI-Care were examined. Construct validity was explored by assessing dimensionality, item fit and overall fit to the Rasch model, and threshold ordering. Internal consistency was examined with inter-item correlations, item-total correlations, Cronbach's alpha, and person separation index. Interpretability was assessed by inspecting floor and ceiling effects.A total of 196 informal caregivers, 171 (87.2%) female and 25 (12.8%) male participated in this study. Mean age of participants was 52.27 (±12.6) years. Subscale 1 was multidimensional, subscale 2 and subscale 3 were unidimensional. All items demonstrated item fit and overall fit to the Rasch model and displayed ordered thresholds. Cronbach's Alpha and person separation index values were excellent for each subscale. There was no evidence of ceiling or floor effects.We identified satisfying construct validity, internal consistency, and interpretability. Thus, the findings of this study support the application of the German version of the OBI-Care to assess occupational balance in informal caregivers."

Here, for the first time we document a putative mechanosome involving Src, Pyk2 and MBD2 in MLO-Y4 osteocytes with high spatial resolution using FRET-FLIM. Src-Pyk2 complexes were concentrated at the periphery of focal adhesions and the peri-nuclear region. Pyk2-MBD2 complexes were located primarily in the nucleus and peri-nuclear region. Lifetime measurements indicated that Src and MBD2 did not interact directly. Finally, mechanical stimulation by fluid flow induced apparent accumulation of Src-Pyk2 protein complexes in the peri-nuclear/nuclear region, consistent with the proposed behavior of a mechanosome in response to a mechanical stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W4200245459,"The effect of severely compromised teeth on masticatory function has not been properly evaluated in previous studies, as they were often considered equivalent to the healthy tooth or excluded as if absent in the dentition. Hopeless teeth, which refer to non-salvageable teeth that require extraction, can interfere with masticatory function. As posterior occlusion is directly related to the masticatory function, we evaluated pairs opposing posterior teeth (POPs) that reflect the arrangement as well as the number of remaining posterior teeth. This study investigated the relationship of a hopeless tooth to handgrip strength according to POPs in the elderly. This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Among the data of 23,466 participants from 2015 to 2018, participants aged 60 years or older (n = 4,729) were included. In males with POPs scores of 0-7, considered poor posterior occlusion, the association with low handgrip strength persisted in the multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for all confounding variables. The odds ratio (OR) in the absence of hopeless teeth (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.02-3.59) increased in the presence of a hopeless tooth (OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.42-5.47). Even with POPs scores of 8-11, considered good posterior occlusion, the association was significantly high in the presence of a hopeless tooth (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.06-7.52). In females, the association disappeared in adjusted models. The fewer pairs of natural posterior teeth with occlusion, the greater the risk of low handgrip strength. Dentition containing hopeless teeth increases the risk of low handgrip strength, even in dentition with sufficient posterior occlusion. Preserving the posterior teeth in a healthy condition through personal oral hygiene and regular dental management is essential for maintaining components of physical function such as handgrip strength."
https://openalex.org/W4200292585,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utilization of Lean & Six Sigma quality initiatives in healthcare sector in India.The survey questionnaires were sent to 454 hospitals through registered postal in all the states of India. The survey questionnaire was designed to assess different quality initiatives; currently implemented in Indian hospitals, factors align with organization's objectives, reasons for not implementing Lean & Six Sigma and contribution of Lean & Six Sigma projects in healthcare improvement projects etc. A separate section in the questionnaire provides the feedback on implementation of Lean & Six Sigma in various hospitals. The relationships between Lean & Six Sigma and healthcare performance have also been established in this paper.It is found that 15 Nos. of hospitals have implemented the Lean tools while 14 Nos. have implemented the Six Sigma tools out of 109 collected responses. This shows the utilization of Lean & Six Sigma in Indian healthcare sector. The 'Lack of knowledge' and 'Availability of resources' are the major reasons for not implementing Lean & Six Sigma. It is also observed that 22% running projects were related to Lean & Six Sigma out of various improvement projects running in various hospitals.There is lack of evidences of similar studies that determines the utilization of Lean & Six Sigma in Indian healthcare sector at the national level. This paper will provide important breakthrough to academicians and healthcare practitioners, who are involved in Lean & Six Sigma research.The present study will create awareness among healthcare practitioners across India for utilization of quality tools that will provide direct benefits to the society."

This study aims to estimate the actual infection of COVID-19 through a seroprevalence survey and to predict infection fatality rate (IFR) in Tanjung Priok, the hardest-hit sub-district by the COVID-19 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods We conducted a venous blood sampling (phlebotomy) to 3,196 individuals in Tanjung Priok between Nov 23, 2020, and Feb 19, 2021 to detect their antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Using an enumerator-administered questionnaire, we collected data on the respondents’ demographic characteristics, COVID-19 test history, COVID-19 symptoms in the last 14 days, comorbidities, and protective behaviours during the last month. We employed descriptive analysis to estimate the seroprevalence and IFR. Findings The prevalence of Antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was 28.52% (95% CI 25.44–31.81%), with the result being higher in females than males (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.02–1.42). By the end of the data collection (February 9, 2021), the cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Tanjung Priok were reported to be experienced by 9,861 people (2.4%). Those aged 45–65 were more likely to be seropositive than 15–19 years old (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.05–1.92). Nearly one third (31%) of the subjects who developed at least one COVID-19 symptom in the last 14 days of the data collection were seropositive. The estimated IFR was 0.08% (95% CI 0.07–0.09), with a higher figure recorded in males (0.09; 95% CI 0.08–0.10) than females (0.07; 95% CI 0.06–0.08), and oldest age group (45–65) (0.21; 95% CI 0.18–0.23) than other younger groups. Conclusion An under-reporting issue was found between the estimated COVID-19 seroprevalence and the reported cumulative cases in Tanjung Priok. More efforts are required to amplify epidemiological surveillance by the provincial and local governments."
https://openalex.org/W4200532090,"In this study we investigate how β-catenin-dependent WNT signalling impacts midbrain dopaminergic neuron (mDA) specification. mDA cultures at day 65 of differentiation responded to 25 days of the tankyrase inhibitor XAV969 (XAV, 100nM) with reduced expression of markers of an A9 mDA phenotype (KCNJ6, ALDH1A1 and TH) but increased expression of the transcriptional repressors NR0B1 and NR0B2. Overexpression of NR0B1 and or NR0B2 promoted a loss of A9 dopaminergic neuron phenotype markers (KCNJ6, ALDH1A1 and TH). Overexpression of NR0B1, but not NR0B2 promoted a reduction in expression of the β-catenin-dependent WNT signalling pathway activator RSPO2. Analysis of Parkinson's disease (PD) transcriptomic databases shows a profound PD-associated elevation of NR0B1 as well as reduced transcript for RSPO2. We conclude that reduced β-catenin-dependent WNT signalling impacts dopaminergic neuron identity, in vitro, through increased expression of the transcriptional repressor, NR0B1. We also speculate that dopaminergic neuron regulatory mechanisms may be perturbed in PD and that this may have an impact upon both existing nigral neurons and also neural progenitors transplanted as PD therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4200050128,"CRISPR multiplex gRNA systems have been employed in genome engineering in various industrially relevant yeast species. The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC 656 is an alternative host for heterologous protein production. However, the limited secretory capability of this yeast is a bottleneck for protein production. Here, we refined CRISPR-based genome engineering tools for simultaneous mutagenesis and activation of multiple protein secretory pathway genes to improve heterologous protein secretion. We demonstrated that multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 mutation of up to four genes (SOD1, VPS1, YPT7 and YPT35) in one single cell is practicable. We also developed a multiplexed CRISPR-dCas9 system which allows simultaneous activation of multiple genes in this yeast. 27 multiplexed gRNA combinations were tested for activation of three genes (SOD1, VPS1 and YPT7), three of which were demonstrated to increase the secretion of fungal xylanase and phytase up to 29% and 41%, respectively. Altogether, our study provided a toolkit for mutagenesis and activation of multiple genes in O. thermomethanolica, which could be useful for future strain engineering to improve heterologous protein production in this yeast."

Though improvements in the levels of intercultural sensitivity and general academic aspects attained by STSA programs have been previously examined, much less is known regarding the impact such programs have in the mood of students. Here, we examined changes in mood state associated with participation in an STSA program in a group of Japanese university students. Mood states were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6). Results indicated that the POMS mean scores of Vigor-Activity and SWLS peaked at the time immediately following participation in the STSA program; moreover, the same scores were found to be at comparable levels even one month after the end of the program. These results indicate that participation in STSA programs can positively influence the mood state of university students, suggesting that the benefits associated with participation in such programs extend beyond typically reported improvements in the academic domain."
https://openalex.org/W4200316613,"Addressing disparities in arthritis care is an important yet unmet health need for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia (respectfully Aboriginal people herewith). Despite the significant prevalence and burden of arthritis within Aboriginal communities, access to care for arthritis is low. One means to reduce existing disparities in health care is to address current challenges relating to the appropriateness and acceptability of health care information resources for Aboriginal people. Health information sources can help to empower patients and their families to have greater involvement in their care and to engage in self-management of their condition. Despite an extensive range of arthritis information resources being available, currently no resources have been culturally adapted and developed in collaboration with Aboriginal consumers with arthritis. This paper outlines the processes that will be undertaken within the Staying Moving, Staying Strong project. This project aims to develop culturally secure arthritis information for Aboriginal people with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and gout.The overarching principle guiding this project is cultural security, referring to the incorporation of processes such that the research will not compromise the cultural rights, values and expectations of Aboriginal people. This project will prioritise partnerships, community engagement, community benefit, sustainability, transferability, and capacity building and therefore uphold the cultural rights and values of Aboriginal people. In this six-phase project we will; 1) Establish a community reference group and advisory committee; 2) Explore the health information needs and preferences of Aboriginal people with arthritis; 3) Synthesise the existing key recommendations in high quality clinical practice guidelines on arthritis care; 4) Culturally adapt key clinical recommendations; 5) Develop culturally appropriate arthritis resources and; 6) Qualitatively evaluate the developed resources."

Sampling was carried out at five Sample Points (SP) demarcated on trails from the headquarters, with CDC light traps, HP model with dry ice attached to the side, for 48 hours of activity each month. Additionally, active catches were made with a castro catcher in the period of one hour per day in the field, from six to eleven o'clock in the morning, in each PM. After the captures, thematic map was assembled using the ArcGIS 10 software and performing a multidimensional scaling (MDS). A total of 1151 specimens were captured and the presence of culicids already incriminated as vectors of arboviruses circulating in the region was observed: Aedes fluviatilis Lutz, 1904 (71 specimens); Aedes scapularis Rondani, 1848 (55 specimens); Haemagogus leococelaenus Dyar and Shannon, 1924 (29 specimens).

In this sense, we highlight the importance of strengthening the actions of continuous entomological surveillance of the emergence and re-emergence of new arboviruses in ecotourism visitation parks."
https://openalex.org/W4200458912,"Despite the fact that preconditions of political participation were thoroughly examined before, there is still not enough understanding of which factors directly affect political participation and which factors correlate with participation due to common background variables. This article scrutinises the causal relations between the variables associated with participation in online activism and introduces a three-step approach in learning a reliable structure of the participation preconditions’ network to predict political participation. Using Bayesian network analysis and structural equation modeling to stabilise the structure of the causal relations, the analysis showed that only age, political interest, internal political efficacy and no other factors, highlighted by the previous political participation research, have direct effects on participation in online activism. Moreover, the direct effect of political interest is mediated by the indirect effects of internal political efficacy and age via political interest. After fitting the parameters of the Bayesian network dependent on the received structure, it became evident that given prior knowledge of the explanatory factors that proved to be most important in terms of direct effects, the predictive performance of the model increases significantly. Despite this fact, there is still uncertainty when it comes to predicting online participation. This result suggests that there remains a lot to be done in participation research when it comes to identifying and distinguishing factors that stimulate new types of political activities."

We aimed to identify factors associated with severity of Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) pulmonary disease (Mab-PD).All patients diagnosed as Mab-PD based on the official ATS/IDSA statement between 2017 January 1 and 2021 July 31 were included (n = 13). We reviewed medical records, bacteriological and laboratory data of the patients. Severity of lung lesions and esophageal diameters in chest CT were quantitatively evaluated. Gaffky score in the sputum was used as airway mycobacterial burden. We explored the factors associated with high CT score and high Gaffky score.Maximum diameter of esophagus (MDE) in severe disease (CT score≧10) was greater than that in milder disease (CT score<10) (18.0±7.9mm, 9.3±3.1mm, respectively, p = 0.01), and MDE was well correlated with CT score (R = 0.69, p = 0.007). MDE in high mycobacterial burden group (Gaffky score ≧5) tended to be greater than that in low mycobacterial burden group (Gaffky score <5) (16.1±6.8mm, 10.1±5.5mm, respectively, p = 0.12), and MDE was well correlated with Gaffky score (R = 0.68, p = 0.009). Lung lesions were bilateral and predominant in middle or lower lobes.Esophageal dilatation was correlated with severity of Mab-PD and airway mycobacterial burden. Gastroesophageal reflux might be associated with Mab disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4200086314,"Drawing on cumulative advantage/disadvantage and conservation of resources theories, I investigated changes in economic, social, and personal resources and in subjective well-being (SWB) of workers as they stayed continuously employed or continuously unemployed. I considered age, gender, and SES as potential amplifiers of inequality in resources and SWB. Using 28 yearly waves from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP 1985-2012), I conducted multilevel analysis with observations nested within participants. A longer duration of continuous employment predicted slightly higher economic resources and thereby slightly higher SWB over time. A longer organizational tenure had mixed effects on resources and predicted slight reductions in SWB via lower mastery. A longer duration of continuous unemployment predicted marked reductions mainly in economic but also in social resources, which led to modest SWB decreases. Younger workers, women, and workers with higher SES benefited from longer continuous employment and organizational tenure more. At the between-person level, some evidence for self-selection of less resourceful individuals into long-term or repeated unemployment emerged. The highly regulated German labor market and social security system may both dampen the rewards of a strong labor force attachment and buffer against the losses of long-term unemployment."

Ageing tends to be considered by institutions as a set of risks to be managed for older persons, illustrated in particular via the concepts of “ageing well” or “successful ageing”. In this context, this project aims to define the meaning and the conditions for a good life from the point of view of older persons themselves, thereby improving institutions’ recognition and support of older persons’ ways of living well, rather than imposing a general definition of “successful ageing” based on functional capacity. Methods and analysis This qualitative study is designed as an action research underpinned by a Living-Lab approach to co-creation. The aims are to: define the conditions for a good life as accurately as possible with older persons (Step 1); share these findings with different healthcare and service providers to adjust existing services or create new ones (Step 2); and disseminate them more broadly within the regions under study and across the scientific community (Step 3). During Step 1, the features of a “good life” will be analysed in a socio-anthropological study based on semi-directed interviews and observations made in the homes of 70 elderly people living in a wide range of accommodation types and regions. In accordance with French legislation, and as confirmed by our formal Ethics Committee, this study does not require approval. The dissemination stage is integrated into the design of this action research, and notably will provide for the appropriation of research findings by the partners of this study, by setting up creativity sessions (Step 2) and by sharing the general findings through panel discussions bringing together regional and national stakeholders (Step 3)."

Here, we highlight the best practices for candidates and departments to consider when using virtual interviewing. We propose how virtual interviews can be leveraged and adapted for hybrid academic job searches combining virtual and in-person activities in a post-pandemic world."
https://openalex.org/W4200366675,"A highly stable oil-in-water nanoemulsion for topical applications, containing mangostins extracted from the pericarp of mangosteen ( Garcinia mangostana L .), is a promising strategy to protect mangostins as well as to improve penetration of these important antioxidants through the skins. Nanoemulsions consisted of virgin coconut oil as the oil phase, Tween-80 and Span-80 as surfactants, and xanthan gum as the thickening agent, were prepared using the high-energy and low-energy emulsification methods. The nanoemulsions that were stable up to 28 days had oil droplet diameter of 220 nm to 353 nm and zeta potential of -46.9 mV to -63.7 mV. The accelerated stability test showed that the most stable nanoemulsions were those prepared using the low-energy emulsification method with an estimated shelf life of eleven months, composed of 11% oil phase, 17% surfactant, and 72% aqueous phase. The in vitro percutaneous penetration test for the nanoemulsion with added xanthan gum provided high cumulative skin penetration of mangostins of up to 114 μg/cm 2 . The results of this study indicate that virgin coconut oil-based nanoemulsions containing mangostins, prepared using the low-energy emulsification method, stabilized by xanthan gum and mixed at 40°C can prospectively be used for topical applications."
