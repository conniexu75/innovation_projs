But what prevents these cellular condensates from randomly fusing together? Using the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Whi3, Langdon et al. demonstrated that the secondary structure of different RNA components determines the distinct biophysical and biological properties of the two types of condensates that Whi3 forms. Several RBPs, such as FUS and TDP43, contain prion-like domains and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. These RBPs are usually soluble in the nucleus but can form pathological aggregates in the cytoplasm. Maharana et al. showed that local RNA concentrations determine distinct phase separation behaviors in different subcellular locations. The higher RNA concentrations in the nucleus act as a buffer to prevent phase separation of RBPs; when mislocalized to the cytoplasm, lower RNA concentrations trigger aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W3100673245,"Measurements of the fine-structure constant alpha require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: alpha = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 x 10^-10 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Borde interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 parts per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge-2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge-2; a 2.5 sigma tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon's magnetic moment at a 99 percent confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation."

Moreno et al . used Ullmann coupling to polymerize a dibromo-substituted diphenylbianthracene on a gold surface (see the Perspective by Sinitskii). Cyclodehydrogenation of the resulting polymer produced graphene nanoribbons, and cross-coupling of these structures created a nanoporous graphene sheet with pore sizes of about 1 nanometer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic structure in which semiconductor bands with an energy gap of 1 electron volt coexist with localized states created by the pores.

https://openalex.org/W2758259983,"Fundamental questions in chemistry and physics may never be answered due to the exponential complexity of the underlying quantum phenomena. A desire to overcome this challenge has sparked a new industry of quantum technologies with the promise that engineered quantum systems can address these hard problems. A key step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. Here, using 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate path towards quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we are able to generate thousands of unique Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert-space. As the number of qubits in the algorithm is varied, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with techniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which accurately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application of these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observing a transition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these results to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer."

How cells respond when mitochondrial protein import is impaired is poorly understood. Weidberg and Amon showed that upon mitochondrial import stress, yeast cells mounted a response known as the mitoCPR. mitoCPR was activated when mitochondrial protein import was impaired and unimported precursors accumulated on the organelle's surface. mitoCPR restored mitochondrial functions by clearing stalled proteins from the import channels. It did this by inducing expression of Cis1, which recruited the adenosine triphosphatase Msp1 to import channels to remove unimported precursors and target them for degradation by the proteasome.

Adding mechanical stress to silicon chips, for instance, produces transistors with enhanced electron mobility. Ghadimi et al. explore the possibility of enhancing the vibrational properties of a micromechanical oscillator by engineering stress within the structure (see the Perspective by Eichler). By careful design of the micromechanical oscillator, and by building in associated stresses, exceptional vibrational properties can be produced. Such enhanced oscillators could be used as exquisite force sensors. Science , this issue p. 764 ; see also p. 706"

It is possible to manipulate atoms more deliberately with a scanning tunneling microscope tip, but the process is then confined to a surface. Liu et al. directly manipulated individual atoms with light to form single molecules in isolation (see the Perspective by Narevicius).

In some individuals, norovirus persists and is associated with inflammatory bowel disorders. While investigating the cell tropism for murine norovirus, Wilen et al. discovered that a rare cell type, tuft cells, carrying the CD300lf receptor were the virus's specific target. Tuft cells proliferate in response to the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-25, which thereby amplify norovirus infection. Moreover, infected tuft cells are resistant to immune clearance. This effect may explain the associated persistent disease symptoms that humans can suffer. Science , this issue p. 204"
https://openalex.org/W2797311679,"Protons find a path Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases are dynamos that interconvert rotational and chemical energy. Capturing the complete structure of these multisubunit membrane-bound complexes has been hindered by their inherent ability to adopt multiple conformations. Srivastava et al. used protein engineering to freeze mitochondrial ATP synthase from yeast in a single conformation and obtained a structure with the inhibitor oligomycin, which binds to the rotating c-ring within the membrane. Hahn et al. show that chloroplast ATP synthase contains a built-in inhibitor triggered by oxidizing conditions in the dark chloroplast. The mechanisms by which these machines are powered are remarkably similar: Protons are shuttled through a channel to the membrane-embedded c-ring, where they drive nearly a full rotation of the rotor before exiting through another channel on the opposite side of the membrane (see the Perspective by Kane).

In mice, Burnett et al. found that a proportion of B cells could cross-react with similar foreign and self-antigens (see the Perspective by Kara and Nussenzweig). Challenge with self-antigen resulted in anergy (i.e., a lack of immune response), which was reversed by exposure to high-density foreign antigen. Mutations that decreased self-affinity were rapidly selected for, whereas selection for epistatic mutations that enhanced foreign reactivity took longer. Self-reactivity, rather than being an impediment to immunization, resulted in higher affinities against a foreign immunogen. Science , this issue p. 223 ; see also p. 152"

https://openalex.org/W2799416318,"Neochloris oleoabundans is an oleaginous microalgal species that can be cultivated in fresh water as well as salt water. Using salt water gives the opportunity to reduce production costs and the fresh water footprint for large scale cultivation. Production of triacylglycerols (TAG) usually includes a biomass growth phase in nitrogen-replete conditions followed by a TAG accumulation phase under nitrogen-deplete conditions. This is the first report that provides insight in the saline resistance mechanism of a fresh water oleaginous microalgae. To better understand the osmoregulatory mechanism of N. oleoabundans during growth and TAG accumulating conditions, the transcriptome was sequenced under four different conditions: fresh water nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, and salt water (525 mM dissolved salts, 448mM extra NaCl) nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions. In this study, several pathways are identified to be responsible for salt water adaptation of N. oleoabundans under both nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions. Proline and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle seem to be of importance for successful osmoregulation in N. oleoabundans. Genes involved in Proline biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in salt water. This was supported by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which indicated an increase in proline content in the salt water nitrogen-replete condition. Additionally, the lipid accumulation pathway was studied to gain insight in the gene regulation in the first 24 hours after nitrogen was depleted. Oil accumulation is increased under nitrogen-deplete conditions in a comparable way in both fresh and salt water. The mechanism behind the biosynthesis of compatible osmolytes can be used to improve N. oleoabundans and other industrially relevant microalgal strains to create a more robust and sustainable production platform for microalgae derived products in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2805766648,"Erratic blood glucose levels can be a cause and consequence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with diabetes. It is unknown if better glycemic control increases risks of hypoglycemia or improves hemoglobin A1c levels and gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetic gastroparesis. This study investigated the safety and potential efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in poorly controlled diabetes with gastroparesis. Forty-five type 1 or 2 patients with diabetes and gastroparesis and hemoglobin A1c >8% from the NIDDK Gastroparesis Consortium enrolled in a 24 week open-label pilot prospective study of CSII plus CGM. The primary safety outcome was combined numbers of mild, moderate, and severe hypoglycemic events at screening and 24 weeks treatment. Secondary outcomes included glycemic excursions on CGM, hemoglobin A1c, gastroparesis symptoms, quality-of-life, and liquid meal tolerance. Combined mild, moderate, and severe hypoglycemic events occurred similarly during the screening/run-in (1.9/week) versus treatment (2.2/week) phases with a relative risk of 1.18 (95% CI 0.85-1.64, P = 0.33). CGM time in hypoglycemia ( 300 mg/dL) decreased from 14.2% to 7.0% (P = 0.005), and hemoglobin A1c decreased from 9.4±1.4% to 8.3±1.3% (P = 0.001) on CSII plus CGM. Symptom scores decreased from 29.3±7.1 to 21.9±10.2 with lower nausea/vomiting, fullness/early satiety, and bloating/distention scores (P≤0.001). Quality-of-life scores improved from 2.4±1.1 to 3.1±1.1 (P<0.0001) and volumes of liquid nutrient meals tolerated increased from 420±258 to 487±312 mL (P = 0.05) at 24 weeks. In conclusion, CSII plus CGM appeared to be safe with minimal risks of hypoglycemic events and associated improvements in glycemic control, gastroparesis symptoms, quality-of-life, and meal tolerance in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and gastroparesis. This study supports the safety, feasibility, and potential benefits of improving glycemic control in diabetic gastroparesis."
https://openalex.org/W2802340474,"Although associations between oral health and pneumonia have been reported in previous studies, particularly in the institutionalized elderly, few prospective studies have investigated the association between oral condition and pneumonia among community-dwelling people and whether the findings among inpatients or patients in nursing homes are applicable to the general population is still unclear. The oral bacteria propagated in the periodontal regions may drop into the lung and increase the risk of pneumonia. We, therefore, investigated the association of tooth loss with mortality from pneumonia in a cohort study of Japanese dentists. Members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) participated in the LEMONADE (Longitudinal Evaluation of Multi-phasic, Odontological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists) Study. From 2001 to 2006, they completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors including the number of teeth lost (excluding third molars). We followed 19,775 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.4 ± 11.7 years; 1,573 women [8.0%] and 18,202 men [92.0%]) for mortality from pneumonia (ICD-10, J12-J18). Mortality data were collected via the fraternal insurance program of the JDA. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity and diabetes history. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years, we documented 68 deaths from pneumonia. Participants who were edentulous at baseline were at significantly increased risk of mortality from pneumonia. The multivariable-adjusted HRs were 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–3.95) for the edentulous and 1.60 (95% CI, 0.83–3.10) for loss of 15–27 teeth relative to loss of 0–14 teeth (trend p = 0.026). The HR per one tooth loss was also significant; 1.031 (95% CI, 1.004–1.060). In conclusion, a large number of teeth lost may indicate an increased risk of mortality from pneumonia in community-dwelling populations."

https://openalex.org/W2796540051,"On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus Acartia. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that Acartia copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX."
https://openalex.org/W2796706798,"Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian Cladolabes schmeltzii, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms."

https://openalex.org/W2799870991,"Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0-3], [4-8] and [9-18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (Fgfr3ach/+) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating Fgfr3ach/+ mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations."
https://openalex.org/W2797099482,"A new class of TSCs containing piperazine (piperazinylogs) of Triapine, was designed to fulfill the di-substitution pattern at the TSCs N4 position, which is a crucial prerequisite for the high activity of the previously obtained TSC compounds-DpC and Dp44mT. We tested the important physicochemical characteristics of the novel compounds L1-L12. The studied ligands are neutral at physiological pH, which allows them to permeate cell membranes and bind cellular Fe pools more readily than less lipid-soluble ligands, e.g. DFO. The selectivity and anti-cancer activity of the novel TSCs were examined in a variety of cancer cell types. In general, the novel compounds demonstrated the greatest promise as anti-cancer agents with both a potent and selective anti-proliferative activity. We investigated the mechanism of action more deeply, and revealed that studied compounds inhibit the cell cycle (G1/S phase). Additionally we detected apoptosis, which is dependent on cell line's specific genetic profile. Accordingly, structure-activity relationship studies suggest that the combination of the piperazine ring with Triapine allows potent and selective anticancer chelators that warrant further in vivo examination to be identified. Significantly, this study proved the importance of the di-substitution pattern of the amine N4 function."

To prevent premature aggregation, nascent chains interact with chaperones that facilitate folding or prevent misfolding until protein synthesis is complete. Nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) is a ribosome-associated chaperone that is important for protein homeostasis. However, how NAC binds its substrates remains unclear. Using native electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS), limited proteolysis, NMR, and cross-linking, we analyzed the conformational properties of NAC from Caenorhabditis elegans and studied its ability to bind proteins in different conformational states. Our results revealed that NAC adopts an array of compact and expanded conformations and binds weakly to client proteins that are unfolded, folded, or intrinsically disordered, suggestive of broad substrate compatibility. Of note, we found that this weak binding retards aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide critical insights into the structure and function of NAC. Specifically, they reveal the ability of NAC to exploit its conformational plasticity to bind a repertoire of substrates with unrelated sequences and structures, independently of actively translating ribosomes.

Whereas NAC is highly conserved across eukaryotes, archaea possess a NAC homodimer consisting of two α-subunits, and yeast and mammalia possess a heterodimer formed of α- and β-NAC subunits (16Kogan G.L. Gvozdev V.A. Multifunctional nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC).Mol. Biol. 2014; 48: 189-19610.1134/S0026893314020095Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The overall sequence homology between the 215-residue α-NAC and the 206-residue β-NAC subunits is only 26%. However, both subunits contain a highly conserved (41% sequence identity) central NAC domain of ∼61 residues (Fig. 1a). X-ray crystal structures of truncated human NAC (Fig. 1b) show that the α- and β-NAC subunits associate through their six-stranded β-barrel–like central NAC domains, although the structure, function, and interactions made by the N- and C-terminal domains of the α-NAC and β-NAC subunits remain unknown (17Wang L. Zhang W. Wang L. Zhang X.C. Li X. Rao Z. Crystal structures of NAC domains of human nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) and its αNAC subunit.Protein Cell. 2010; 1 (21203952): 406-41610.1007/s13238-010-0049-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Liu Y.

Human heterodimeric NAC has been shown to be more stable than its homodimeric assemblies, and importantly, homodimers of α-NAC do not form in the presence of β-NAC, suggestive of a specific heterodimeric complex despite the close sequence homology of the central NAC domains (17Wang L. Zhang W. Wang L. Zhang X.C. Li X. Rao Z. Crystal structures of NAC domains of human nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) and its αNAC subunit.Protein Cell. 2010; 1 (21203952): 406-41610.1007/s13238-010-0049-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). α-NAC differs from β-NAC in that it contains a single ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that comprises the C-terminal 40 amino acids of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1a) (19Spreter T. Pech M. Beatrix B. The crystal structure of archaeal nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) reveals a unique fold and the presence of a ubiquitin-associated domain.J. Biol.

Although the role of this domain remains unclear, a NAC variant that lacks the UBA domain has been shown to be a more potent suppressor of protein aggregation in vivo suggesting a regulatory role for the UBA domain in the chaperone activity of the complex (20Ott A.-K. Locher L. Koch M. Deuerling E. Functional dissection of the nascent polypeptide–associated complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26618777): e014345710.1371/journal.pone.0143457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous reports have also shown that NAC interacts with translating ribosomes reversibly in a 1:1 stoichiometry, and although α-NAC forms contacts with both the ribosome and the nascent chain, it is the β-NAC subunit that mediates the dynamic interaction with the ribosome via the –RRKKK– motif (residues 71–75 (Fig. 1a)) in its N-terminal region (21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 22Beatrix B.

Previous studies have also shown that NAC is able to protect the emerging nascent chain from proteolysis, confirming its role in guarding nascent chains during their synthesis (24Wang S. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. NAC covers ribosome-associated nascent chains thereby forming a protective environment for regions of nascent chains just emerging from the peptidyl transferase center.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130 (7622554): 519-52810.1083/jcb.130.3.519Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Multiple functions have been suggested for NAC in vivo, including protection of nascent chains from proteolysis and regulation of apoptosis, and there is also evidence of a homodimer of α-NAC bound to DNA and RNA, implying that NAC can take the role of a transcription factor (16Kogan G.L. Gvozdev V.A. Multifunctional nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC).Mol. Biol. 2014; 48: 189-19610.1134/S0026893314020095Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, NAC depletion in Caenorhabditis elegans was shown to cause mistargeting of translating ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and mistranslocation of mitochondrial proteins into the ER. Loss of NAC activity also reduced the median life span of C. elegans by 10 days by means of inducing ER and mitochondrial stress (25Gamerdinger M. Hanebuth M.A. Frickey T. Deuerling E.

Despite its ubiquity and central importance in protein synthesis and folding, how NAC binds and chaperones its substrate proteins, however, remained unknown. Over the past 20 years, native MS has become a powerful tool for the interrogation of noncovalent protein complexes and their interactions (26Konijnenberg A. Butterer A. Sobott F.

Furthermore, native MS methods enable the structure, stability, and conformation of proteins and their complexes to be investigated directly upon their ionization into the gas phase (34Calabrese A.N.

For example, chemical cross-linking can be used to provide residue-specific information about transiently interacting partners by sequencing of cross-linked products using LC-MS/MS (37Leitner A. Walzthoeni T. Kahraman A. Herzog F. Rinner O. Beck M. Aebersold R. Probing native protein structures by chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics.Mol. Cell.

Here, we use ESI-MS combined with ion-mobility spectrometry–MS (ESI-IMS-MS) to study the conformational properties of wildtype (WT) α/β-NAC (WT-NAC) from C. elegans for the first time. We also use MS-based techniques to provide information about the structure, dynamics, and interactions of WT-NAC with potential substrates in different conformational states. In addition, the conformations of WT-NAC and the heterodimer lacking the UBA domain (ΔUBA-NAC) are compared using ESI-IMS-MS to establish the effect of the UBA domain on conformational properties of NAC. It has been suggested that the UBA domain, which is attached to the α-NAC subunit via a highly flexible 34-residue linker, may regulate the chaperone activity of NAC (20Ott A.-K. Locher L. Koch M. Deuerling E. Functional dissection of the nascent polypeptide–associated complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26618777): e014345710.1371/journal.pone.0143457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In parallel, chemical cross-linking of complexes formed between WT-NAC and α-synuclein (a 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)) (38Woods W.S. Boettcher J.M. Zhou D.H. Kloepper K.D.

Combined with analysis of the NAC–α-synuclein complex using 1H-15N NMR, and assays of the effect of NAC binding on α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and in vivo, the results reveal that NAC binds substrates with very different sequence and structural properties, forming weak interactions in a dynamic complex independent of the presence of the UBA domain or actively translating ribosomes. The native ESI mass spectrum of purified C. elegans NAC obtained in 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.9 is shown in Fig. 2a. The spectrum confirms the presence of a heterodimer of α-NAC and β-NAC with a molecular mass of 39,306 Da (theoretical mass = 39,304 Da). The spectrum shows the presence of at least two distinct protein conformations for the α/β-NAC dimer: the most abundant species has 11+ to 13+ charges and is likely the most native-like conformer, with a second population being more highly charged (14+ to 22+), suggestive of more expanded conformations. NAC dimers (a2β2) and a small amount of the free α-subunit (measured mass = 21,803 Da; theoretical mass = 21,802 Da) and β-subunit (measured mass = 17,504 Da; theoretical mass = 17,502 Da) were also visible in the spectrum. Control experiments using native PAGE showed only a single band (inset of Fig. 2a) suggesting that some dissociation of the heterodimer alongside self-association to larger species occurs in the gas phase but does not occur in solution. Interestingly, native ESI-MS of the NAC construct lacking its UBA domain (ΔUBA-NAC, measured mass = 35,091 Da; theoretical mass = 35,091 Da) showed the same distribution of charge states as WT-NAC, with the 12+ charge state ions being the most abundant species (Fig. 2b), ruling out major conformational changes of the protein upon deletion of this domain. Native ESI-IMS-MS confirmed that species that have a range of compact and extended conformers of both WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC exist in the gas phase (Fig. 2c, Table S1). The measured collision cross-sections (CCS) for the lowest observed (11+) charge states were 2962 ± 88 and 2761 ± 83 Å2 for WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC, respectively (Fig. 2c). The function of the UBA domain within NAC has yet to be ascertained, but we hypothesized that the extended highly charged conformers of WT-NAC observed here using ESI-MS could result from the attachment of the UBA domain to the NAC core via a flexible linker (Fig. 1a). The ESI-IMS-MS results presented here rule out such a hypothesis and show instead that the extended conformation observed for WT-NAC is also observed for the protein lacking the UBA domain. Importantly, the finding that the difference in CCS of WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC is only ∼200 Å2, consistent with the expected CCS of the folded UBA domain, confirms that NAC remains folded in the gas phase despite the lack of bulk solvent water (42Jurneczko E. Barran P.E. How useful is ion mobility mass spectrometry for structural biology?

CD spectroscopy showed that WT-NAC contains 33% disorder, 27% helical, and 17% β-stranded structure (Fig. 2d and Table S1). Deletion of the 35-residue UBA domain resulted in a shift in the major peak from 206 to 204 nm, and the overall α-helical content was reduced to ∼15%. This indicates the UBA domain makes a large contribution to the total α-helical content of NAC, consistent with the known predominantly helical structure of the UBA domain (44Dikic I. Wakatsuki S. Walters K.J. Ubiquitin-binding domains–from structures to functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19773779): 659-67110.1038/nrm2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The proportion of unstructured protein was increased to 36% in this variant compared with WT-NAC (Table S2). To compare the stability of the WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC heterodimers in more detail, the proteins were each examined using CIU. The 12+ charge state ions for WT-NAC (Fig. 3a) and ΔUBA-NAC (Fig. 3b) were each isolated in the first (quadrupole) analyzer of the ESI-MS-MS mass spectrometer, and the collision energy increased stepwise in the trap cell prior to the IMS cell and second (TOF) analyzer. No dissociation of the heterodimers was observed at 10 V with drift times of 8.7 and 7.4 ms, respectively (Fig. 3, lower panels). Clear differences in the unfolding patterns of the two proteins were observed, however, as the collision voltage was increased. For WT-NAC, a single conformation persisted at 25 V, with a second, more unfolded conformer (drift time 10.3 ms) becoming populated at 35 V. By contrast, ΔUBA-NAC showed evidence for substantial unfolding at 25 V, with the appearance of a second population (∼40% of molecules) with an arrival time of 9.1 ms in the IMS drift-time plot. Finally, at 35 V ΔUBA-NAC shows significant conformational rearrangements, with little, if any, residual population of native-like species with a drift time 7.8 ms. Instead, a broad arrival time distribution containing more highly expanded species is observed (Fig. 3, top panel). The results presented here using far-UV CD, ESI-IMS-MS, and CIU together show that deletion of the UBA domain does not perturb the structure of the NAC heterodimer but results in a complex that is more susceptible to unfolding in the dimeric state. This may result in a complex more able to bind its substrates, consistent with in vivo observations of an increased chaperone capacity of NAC upon deletion of the UBA domain (20Ott A.-K. Locher L. Koch M. Deuerling E. Functional dissection of the nascent polypeptide–associated complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26618777): e014345710.1371/journal.pone.0143457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis followed by MS analysis of WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC was next carried out to investigate whether the presence of the UBA domain influences the accessibility of the α- and β-domains to protease (Fig. 4, a and b). After incubation of NAC with trypsin (1:500 (w/w) trypsin/NAC) for 15 min at 20 °C, a cleaved protein with a mass 2462 Da less than the native protein was observed (Fig. 4a, lower panel). The population of this species became more intense relative to uncleaved NAC over time (data not shown). This mass loss from the native protein is consistent with possible loss of MTGSTETRQKEVK (α-NAC residues 1–13), ADEQ (α-NAC residues 158–161), and MDSK (β-NAC residues 1–4) or MTGSTETRQKEVK (α-NAC residues 1–13), and NETKADEQ (β-NAC residues 154–161). Notably, the same mass loss was also detected in the ΔUBA-NAC sample (Fig. 4a, upper panel), indicating that these sequences are similarly accessible to protease in both heterodimers. In the low m/z range of the spectrum (m/z 800–1600), fragments corresponding to peptides from the N-terminal region of α-NAC (e.g. 1–38, 9–38, and 9–57 in WT α-NAC and 1–38, 1–54, and 2–57 of ΔUBA-NAC) and the C-terminal region of β-NAC (130–161 and 123–161 in WT-NAC and ΔUBA-NAC, respectively) were most abundant (Fig. 4b). This indicates that these regions of the protein are most accessible to protease, whereas the core NAC regions, which form the dimer interface, remain uncleaved, as expected from their folded structure. These observations are consistent with the known domain architecture of the NAC complex (Fig. 1a) and show that the UBA domain does not alter the accessibility of the protein complex to trypsin, although deletion of this domain decreases the stability of the complex to collision-induced unfolding.

However, the intracellular mechanisms responsible for cell-autonomous cross-talk between the inflammatory signaling pathways and metabolic flux have remained enigmatic. In this study, we discovered that the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase TIGAR (Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) critically regulates NF-κB activation. We found that TIGAR potently inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene expression by suppressing the upstream activation of IKKβ phosphorylation and kinase activation. This inhibition occurred through a direct binding competition between NEMO and TIGAR for association with the linear ubiquitination assembly complex (LUBAC). This competition prevented linear ubiquitination of NEMO, which is required for activation of IKKβ and other downstream targets. Furthermore, a TIGAR phosphatase activity-deficient mutant was equally effective as WT TIGAR in inhibiting NEMO linear ubiquitination, IKKβ phosphorylation/activation, and NF-κB signaling, indicating that TIGAR's effect on NF-κB signaling is due to its interaction with LUBAC. Physiologically, TIGAR knockout mice displayed enhanced adipose tissue NF-κB signaling, whereas adipocyte-specific overexpression of TIGAR suppressed adipose tissue NF-κB signaling. Together, these results demonstrate that TIGAR has a nonenzymatic molecular function that modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway by directly inhibiting the E3 ligase activity of LUBAC."

https://openalex.org/W2797102546,"Background 
While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.


Methods 
Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).


Results 
Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.


Conclusions 
While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2797501719,"Sensing the environmental signals, the canonical Gα-cAMP/PKA pathway modulates mycelial growth and development, and negatively regulates some secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, e.g. aflatoxin in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we report the characterization of this signaling pathway in Chaetomium globosum, a widely spread fungus known for synthesizing abundant secondary metabolites, e.g. chaetoglobosin A (ChA). RNAi-mediated knockdown of a putative Gα-encoding gene gna-1, led to plural changes in phenotype, e.g. albino mycelium, significant restriction on perithecium development and decreased production of ChA. RNA-seq profiling and qRT-PCR verified significantly fall in expression of corresponding genes, e.g. pks-1 and CgcheA. These defects could be restored by simultaneous knock-down of the pkaR gene encoding a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting that pkaR had a negative effect on the above mentioned traits. Confirmatively, the intracellular level of cAMP in wild-type strain was about 3.4-fold to that in gna-1 silenced mutant pG14, and addition of a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, restored the same defects, e.g., the expression of CgcheA. Furthermore, the intracellular cAMP in gna-1 and pkaR double silenced mutant was approaching the normal level. The following activity inhibition experiment proved that the expression of CgcheA was indeed regulated by PKA. Down-regulation of LaeA/VeA/SptJ expression in gna-1 mutant was also observed, implying that Gα signaling may crosstalk to other regulatory pathways. Taken together, this study proposes that the heterotrimeric Gα protein-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway positively mediates the sexual development, melanin biosynthesis, and secondary metabolism in C. globosum."
https://openalex.org/W2798182357,"Background Kidneys from non-white donors have inferior outcomes, but it is unclear if ethnicity matching between donors and recipients achieves better post kidney transplant outcomes. Methods We undertook a retrospective, population cohort study utilising UK Transplant Registry data. The cohort comprised adult, kidney-alone, transplant recipients receiving their first kidney transplant between 2003–2015, with data censored at 1st October 2016. We included 27,970 recipients stratified into white (n = 23,215), black (n = 1,679) and south Asian (n = 3,076) ethnicity, with median post-transplant follow-up of 1,676 days (IQR 716–2,869 days). Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression survival analyses were performed to investigate ethnicity effect on risk for graft loss and mortality. Results In unadjusted analyses, matched ethnicity between donors-recipients resulted in better outcomes for delayed graft function, one-year creatinine, graft and patient survival but these differed by ethnicity matches. Compared to white-to-white transplants, risk for death-censored graft loss was higher in black-to-black and similar among Asian-to-Asian transplants, but mortality risk was lower for both black-to-black and Asian-to-Asian transplants. In Cox regression models, compared to white donors, we observed higher risk for graft loss with both south Asian (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.12–1.70, p = 0.003) and black (HR 1.66, 95%CI 1.30–2.11, p<0.001) donated kidneys independent of recipient ethnicity. We observed no mortality difference with south Asian donated kidneys but increased mortality with black donated kidneys (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.21–2.35, p = 0.002). Matching ethnicities made no significant difference in any Cox regression model. Similar results were observed after stratifying our analysis by living and deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Conclusions Our data confirm inferior outcomes associated with non-white kidney donors for kidney transplant recipients of any ethnicity in a risk-adjusted model for the United Kingdom population. However, contrary to non-renal transplant literature, we did not identify any survival benefits associated with donor-recipient ethnicity matching."
https://openalex.org/W2804381555,"Single-molecule microscopy has become a widely used technique in (bio)physics and (bio)chemistry. A popular implementation is single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), for which total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is frequently combined with camera-based detection of surface-immobilized molecules. Camera-based smFRET experiments generate large and complex datasets and several methods for video processing and analysis have been reported. As these algorithms often address similar aspects in video analysis, there is a growing need for standardized comparison. Here, we present a Matlab-based software (MASH-FRET) that allows for the simulation of camera-based smFRET videos, yielding standardized data sets suitable for benchmarking video processing algorithms. The software permits to vary parameters that are relevant in cameras-based smFRET, such as video quality, and the properties of the system under study. Experimental noise is modeled taking into account photon statistics and camera noise. Finally, we survey how video test sets should be designed to evaluate currently available data analysis strategies in camera-based sm fluorescence experiments. We complement our study by pre-optimizing and evaluating spot detection algorithms using our simulated video test sets."
https://openalex.org/W2810654472,"There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an E. coli chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlueTM) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlueTM without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields. Moreover, after large-scale expression and protein purification, only the scTCR format was obtained in high yields. Importantly, stability engineering of the scTCR was a prerequisite for obtaining reliable biophysical characterization of the TCR-pMHC interaction. The scTCR format is readily compatible with high-throughput screening approaches that may enable both development of reagents allowing for defined peptide MHC (pMHC) characterization and discovery of potential novel therapeutic leads."
https://openalex.org/W2797342218,"A wide variety of methods have been proposed in protein subnuclear localization to improve the prediction accuracy. However, one important trend of these means is to treat fusion representation by fusing multiple feature representations, of which, the fusion process takes a lot of time. In view of this, this paper novelly proposed a method by combining a new single feature representation and a new algorithm to obtain good recognition rate. Specifically, based on the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), we proposed a new expression, correlation position-specific scoring matrix (CoPSSM) as the protein feature representation. Based on the classic nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm, kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA), we added a new discriminant criterion and proposed a dichotomous greedy genetic algorithm (DGGA) to intelligently select its kernel bandwidth parameter. Two public datasets with Jackknife test and KNN classifier were used for the numerical experiments. The results showed that the overall success rate (OSR) with single representation CoPSSM is larger than that with many relevant representations. The OSR of the proposed method can reach as high as 87.444% and 90.3361% for these two datasets, respectively, outperforming many current methods. To show the generalization of the proposed algorithm, two extra standard datasets of protein subcellular were chosen to conduct the expending experiment, and the prediction accuracy by Jackknife test and Independent test is still considerable."
https://openalex.org/W2798029462,"The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from M. anguillicaudatus and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple M. anguillicaudatus using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system M. anguillicaudatus."

The implantation requires a highly specific and interdisciplinary management approach. Currently, TAVI is performed with the patient under local or general anaesthesia.This study was a retrospective analysis of all TAVI procedures performed at the University Hospital of Regensburg between January 2009 and July 2015. All pre-, intra and postoperative data focusing on perioperative complications were recorded.A total of 853 transfemoral- and transapical-TAVI patients were included in the study. All patients underwent general anaesthesia. The ASA classifications were primarily 3-4. The average logistic EuroScores for the transfemoral- and transapical-TAVI patients were 18 ± 12% and 21 ± 15% (p = 0.002), respectively. The anaesthesia coverage time was 170 ± 49 min., including 37 ± 12 minutes for anaesthetic management. Overall, 458 complications were recorded; with pneumonia, acute renal failure, indication for a permanent pacemaker and non-extubation in the operating theatre the most frequently recorded complications.In the present study, we showed that our patients' outcomes are comparable to those reported in the available literature. Compared to TF, TA patients show an overall worse physical condition as well as a higher perioperative morbidity and mortality. Consequently TA patients need additional care and should only be operated in appropriately experienced medical centres."
https://openalex.org/W2805220210,"The relation of the individual speech-in-noise performance differences in cochlear implant (CI) users to underlying physiological factors is currently poorly understood. This study approached this research question by a step-wise individualization of a computer model of speech intelligibility mimicking the details of CI signal processing and some details of the physiology present in CI users. Two factors, the electrical field spatial spread and internal noise (as a coarse model of the individual cognitive performance) were incorporated. Internal representations of speech-in-noise mixtures calculated by the model were classified using an automatic speech recognizer backend employing Hidden Markov Models with a Gaussian probability distribution. One-dimensional electric field spatial spread functions were inferred from electrical field imaging data of 14 CI users. Simplified assumptions of homogenously distributed auditory nerve fibers along the cochlear array and equal distance between electrode array and nerve tissue were assumed in the model. Internal noise, whose standard deviation was adjusted based on either anamnesis data, or text-reception-threshold data, or a combination thereof, was applied to the internal representations before classification. A systematic model evaluation showed that predicted speech-reception-thresholds (SRTs) in stationary noise improved (decreased) with decreasing internal noise standard deviation and with narrower electric field spatial spreads. The model version that was individualized to actual listeners using internal noise alone (containing average spatial spread) showed significant correlations to measured SRTs, reflecting the high correlation of the text-reception threshold data with SRTs. However, neither individualization to spatial spread functions alone, nor a combined individualization based on spatial spread functions and internal noise standard deviation did produce significant correlations with measured SRTs."

In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological and clinic-pathological features, and outcome of HL patients treated at one hemato-oncology centre in Erbil, northern Iraq. Medical records of 103 HL patients treated over more than six years were reviewed. Treatment outcome was evaluated by measuring the 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates. The median age of patients was 23 years, children up to 17 years constituted 31.1%, and male to female ratio was 1:1.05. The majority (96.1%) of patients presented with lymphadenopathy. Nodular sclerosis subtype was the mostly encountered histologic type (48.5%); about half of the patients (49.5%) had stage II disease. Relapse occurred in 20 patients; the 5-year overall survival for children was better (89%) compared to adult patients (79%). The associated risk features found to have adverse effects on the survival, however, only high LDH level and presence of B-symptoms at presentation showed significant correlation. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HL in our locality followed the pattern in the western world. The 5-year overall and progression-free survivals were far below the international rates, a matter which may necessitate a revision to HL treatment strategy at our centre."
https://openalex.org/W2798123388,"Background The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography. Methods Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE. Results In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p<0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died. Conclusions Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2896840544,"Introduction Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated. Methods In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period. Results The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients. Conclusion Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2950837662,"Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66-0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84-1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I2 = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development."

Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length L. salmonis lipophorin receptor (LsLpR) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of LsLpR transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the LsLpR transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the LsLpR transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of LsLpR in reproduction and lipid metabolism in L. salmonis. In larvae, the transcription of LsLpR was decreased by 44–54% while in an experiment LsLpR knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice."
https://openalex.org/W2796479335,"As an important moral emotion, guilt plays a critical role in social interaction. It has been found that people tended to exhibit prosocial behavior under circumstances of guilt. However, all extant studies have predominantly focused on the influence of guilt on macro-level behavior. So far, no study has investigated whether guilt affects people's micro-level perception. The current study closes this gap by examining whether guilt affects one's inclination to perceive approaching motion. We achieved this aim by probing a facing-the-viewer bias (FTV bias). Specifically, when an ambiguous walking biological motion display is presented to participants via the point-light display technique, participants tend to perceive a walking agent approaching them. We hypothesized that guilt modulated FTV bias. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a two-person situation induction task to induce guilt, whereby participants were induced to feel that because of their poor task performance, their partner did not receive a satisfactory payment. We found that when participants were told that the perceived biological motion was motion-captured from their partner, the FTV bias was significantly increased for guilty participants relative to neutral participants. However, when participants were informed that the perceived biological motion was from a third neutral agent, the FTV bias was not modulated by guilt. These results suggest that guilt influences one's inclination to perceive approaching motion, but this effect is constrained to the person towards whom guilt is directed."

For the study, 6,379 visits for diabetes care were selected while controlling for clustered errors. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine determinants of hospital outpatient services.This study demonstrated that the variables of self-rated health status, comorbidity, unmet need, and alcohol consumption significantly correlated with the choice to use a hospital services. Patients with SPHI were more likely to use medical services at hospitals by 1.71 times (95% CI 1.068-2.740, P = 0.026) compared to patients without SPHI.It was confirmed that diabetic patients insured by SPHI had more use of hospital services than those who were not insured. People insured by SPHI seem to be more likely to use hospital services because SPHI lightens the economic burden of care."
https://openalex.org/W2796769637,"This research is the first nationally representative study to examine the relationship between actual state-level tobacco control spending in each of the 5 CDC's Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Program categories and cigarette sales. We employed several alternative two-way fixed-effects regression techniques to estimate the determinants of cigarette sales in the United States for the years 2008-2012. State spending on tobacco control was found to have a negative and significant impact on cigarette sales in all models that were estimated. Spending in the areas of cessation interventions, health communication interventions, and state and community interventions were found to have a negative impact on cigarette sales in all models that were estimated, whereas spending in the areas of surveillance and evaluation, and administration and management were found to have negative effects on cigarette sales in only some models. Our models predict that states that spend up to seven times their current levels could still see significant reductions in cigarette sales. The findings from this research could help inform further investments in state tobacco control programs."

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the capacity to identify DM2 in subjects that were screened for DM2 simultaneously with all three of the tests recommended-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and a 2-hour post 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).The present analysis of an anonymous database of 1113 adults from a reference clinical laboratory in Bucaramanga, Colombia, was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional secondary source study. 259 individuals met at least one of the criteria for DM2: FPG ≥ 126mg/dL (7.0mmol/L), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48mmol/mol) and OGTT ≥ 200mg/dL (11.1mmol/L). 30 subjects (2.7%) were diabetic according to FPG, 56 subjects (5.0%) by HbA1c and 250 subjects (22.5%) by OGTT. In total 259 subjects (23.3% [IC 95%: 20.7%- 25.8%] were diabetic either by FPG, OGTT or HbA1c.The largest number of patients were identified as diabetic with the OGTT. The combination of two or three tests did not increase the detection of new cases of DM2. Our findings suggest that routinely requesting FPG, OGTT and HbA1c at the same time may be inappropriate in at risk individuals, as this approach does not significantly improve the diagnostic capacity compared to using FPG+OGTT and substantially increases the financial burden on the health system, insurers or individual."
