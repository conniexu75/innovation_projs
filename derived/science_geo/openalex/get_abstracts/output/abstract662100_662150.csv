https://openalex.org/W3096921681,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastasizes to distant organs, which is the primary cause of mortality; however, specific features mediating organ-specific metastasis remain unexplored. Emerging evidence demonstrates that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and cellular metabolism play a pivotal role in metastasis. Here we investigated the role of distinct subtypes of pancreatic CSCs and their metabolomic signatures in organ-specific metastatic colonization. We found that PDAC consists of ALDH+/CD133+ and drug-resistant (MDR1+) subtypes of CSCs with specific metabolic and stemness signatures. Human PDAC tissues with gemcitabine treatment, autochthonous mouse tumors from KrasG12D; Pdx1-Cre (KC) and KrasG12D; Trp53R172H; Pdx-1 Cre (KPC) mice, and KPC- Liver/Lung metastatic cells were used to evaluate the CSC, EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), and metabolic profiles. A strong association was observed between distinct CSC subtypes and organ-specific colonization. The liver metastasis showed drug-resistant CSC- and EMT-like phenotype with aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation-mediated oxidative (glyco-oxidative) metabolism. On the contrary, lung metastasis displayed ALDH+/CD133+ and MET-like phenotype with oxidative metabolism. These results were obtained by evaluating FACS-based side population (SP), autofluorescence (AF+) and Alde-red assays for CSCs, and Seahorse-based oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO)-mediated OCR assays for metabolic features along with specific gene signatures. Further, we developed in vitro human liver and lung PDAC metastasis models by using a combination of liver or lung decellularized scaffolds, a co-culture, and a sphere culture methods. PDAC cells grown in the liver-mimicking model showed the enrichment of MDR1+ and CPT1A+ populations, whereas the PDAC cells grown in the lung-mimicking environment showed the enrichment of ALDH+/CD133+ populations. In addition, we observed significantly elevated expression of ALDH1 in lung metastasis and MDR1/LDH-A expression in liver metastasis compared to human primary PDAC tumors. Our studies elucidate that distinct CSCs adapt unique metabolic signatures for organotropic metastasis, which will pave the way for the development of targeted therapy for PDAC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3097190733,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the deadliest form of breast cancer. Unlike other types of breast cancer that can be effectively treated by targeted therapies, no such targeted therapy exists for all TNBC patients. The ADAR1 enzyme carries out A-to-I editing of RNA to prevent sensing of endogenous double-stranded RNAs. ADAR1 is highly expressed in breast cancer including TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that expression of ADAR1, specifically its p150 isoform, is required for the survival of TNBC cell lines. In TNBC cells, knockdown of ADAR1 attenuates proliferation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, ADAR1 knockdown leads to robust translational repression. ADAR1-dependent TNBC cell lines also exhibit elevated IFN stimulated gene expression. IFNAR1 reduction significantly rescued the proliferative defects of ADAR1 loss. These findings establish ADAR1 as a novel therapeutic target for TNBC tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3095588236,"Understanding the digital jump of bank customers is key to design strategies to bring on board and keep online users, as well as to explain the increasing competition from new providers of financial services (such as BigTech and FinTech). This paper employs a machine learning approach to examine the digitalization process of bank customers using a comprehensive consumer finance survey. By employing a set of algorithms (random forests, conditional inference trees and causal forests) this paper identities the features predicting bank customers’ digitalization process, illustrates the sequence of consumers’ decision-making actions and explores the existence of causal relationships in the digitalization process. Random forests are found to provide the highest performance–they accurately predict 88.41% of bank customers’ online banking adoption and usage decisions. We find that the adoption of digital banking services begins with information-based services (e.g., checking account balance), conditional on the awareness of the range of online services by customers, and then is followed by transactional services (e.g., online/mobile money transfer). The diversification of the use of online channels is explained by the consciousness about the range of services available and the safety perception. A certain degree of complementarity between bank and non-bank digital channels is also found. The treatment effect estimations of the causal forest algorithms confirm causality of the identified explanatory factors. These results suggest that banks should address the digital transformation of their customers by segmenting them according to their revealed preferences and offering them personalized digital services. Additionally, policymakers should promote financial digitalization, designing policies oriented towards making consumers aware of the range of online services available."
https://openalex.org/W3097588864,"Abstract Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the third most common cancer in men and women. Around 20% colon cancer cases are closely linked with colitis. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to colon inflammation and tumor development. However, the genetic factors regulating colitis and colon tumorigenesis remain elusive. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vitally involved in tissue inflammation and tumorigenesis, here we employed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to systemically identify the genetic factors involved in the regulation of oxidative stress. Next generation sequencing (NGS) showed that over 600 gRNAs including the ones targeting LGALS2 were highly enriched in cells survived after sublethal H 2 O 2 challenge. LGALS2 encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin 2 (Gal2), which is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and downregulated in human colon tumors. To examine the role of Gal2 in colitis, we employed the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis model in mice with (WT) or without Lgals2 (Gal2-KO) and showed that Gal2 deficiency ameliorated DSS-induced colitis. We further demonstrated that Gal2-KO mice developed significantly larger tumors than WT mice using Azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal cancer model. We found that STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly increased in Gal2-deficient tumors as compared to those in WT mice. Gal2 overexpression decreased the proliferation of human colon tumor epithelial cells and blunted H 2 O 2 -induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Overall, our results demonstrate that Gal2 plays a suppressive role in colon tumor growth and highlights the therapeutic potential of Gal2 in colon cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3094819604,"Prostate adenocarcinoma undergoes neuroendocrine differentiation to acquire resistance toward antihormonal therapies. The underlying mechanisms have been investigated extensively, among which Sox2 has been shown to play a critical role. However, genetic evidence in mouse models for prostate cancer to support the crucial role of Sox2 is missing. The adult mouse prostate luminal cells contain both castration-resistant Sox2-expressing Sca-1+ cells and castration-responsive Sca-1- cells. We show that both types of the luminal cell are susceptible to oncogenic transformation induced by loss of function of the tumor suppressor Pten. The tumors derived from the Sca-1+ cells are castration resistant and are more inclined to develop castration-induced neuroendocrine differentiation. Genetic ablation of Sox2 suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation but does not impact the castration-resistant property. This study provides direct genetic evidence that Sox2 is necessary for androgen ablation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of Pten null prostate adenocarcinoma, corroborates that the lineage status of the prostate cancer cells is a determinant for its propensity to exhibit lineage plasticity, and supports that the intrinsic features of cell-of-origin for prostate cancers can dictate their clinical behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3095743229,"Emerging evidence suggests that menstruation-related teasing is a common experience among adolescent girls with ramifications on their school participation, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence and determinants of period teasing in schools remain scarce. Menstrual hygiene research and policies almost exclusively focus on girls and women, leading to a dearth of knowledge of male attitudes. We conducted the first quantitative survey of period teasing in schools in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on 432 male and 524 female students in four co-educational secondary schools in northern Tanzania. Period teasing is prevalent; 13% of girls have experienced period teasing, and more than 80% fear being teased, especially by male classmates. Girls’ fears are associated with insufficient menstrual hygiene management resources and practices. Girls cope by reducing school attendance, participation, and concentration in the classroom during periods. Boys engage in period teasing because they perceive periods as embarrassing, especially visible markers of periods (odor or stains). Social norms, such as peer behavior and home restrictions on menstruating women, are associated with more teasing. Boys believe it is strongly inappropriate for girls to reveal period status or to discuss periods with males, including male teachers. In contrast, boys are well informed about basic biological facts of menstruation (scoring 60% on a knowledge quiz, not statistically different from the girls) and have received information from school curricula and health workers. Lack of suitable menstrual hygiene practices and restrictive social norms is correlated with period teasing, which hinders gender equality in educational opportunities. Providing narrowly bio-medical focused education about menstruation may not be enough to reduce period teasing in contexts with period stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3095382332,"Objectives Acquiring central venous pressure (CVP), an important clinical parameter, requires an invasive procedure, which poses risk to patients. The aim of the study was to develop a non-invasive methodology for determining mean-CVP from ultrasound assessment of the jugular venous pulse. Methods In thirty-four adult patients (age = 60 ± 12 years; 10 males), CVP was measured using a central venous catheter, with internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (CSA) variation along the cardiac beat acquired using ultrasound. The resultant CVP and IJV-CSA signals were synchronized with electrocardiogram (ECG) signals acquired from the patients. Autocorrelation signals were derived from the IJV-CSA signals using algorithms in R (open-source statistical software). The correlation r-values for successive lag intervals were extracted and used to build a linear regression model in which mean-CVP was the response variable and the lagging autocorrelation r-values and mean IJV-CSA, were the predictor variables. The optimum model was identified using the minimum AIC value and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results While the CVP and IJV-CSA signals were poorly correlated (mean r = -0.018, SD = 0.357) due to the IJV-CSA signal lagging behind the CVP signal, their autocorrelation counterparts were highly positively correlated (mean r = 0.725, SD = 0.215). Using the lagging autocorrelation r-values as predictors, mean-CVP was predicted with reasonable accuracy (r2 = 0.612), with a mean-absolute-error of 1.455 cmH2O, which rose to 2.436 cmH2O when cross-validation was performed. Conclusions Mean-CVP can be estimated non-invasively by using the lagged autocorrelation r-values of the IJV-CSA signal. This new methodology may have considerable potential as a clinical monitoring and diagnostic tool."
https://openalex.org/W3097076275,"The sense of touch develops early in life and becomes a determinant aspect of our personal narratives, providing crucial information about the world around us and playing a prominent role in affective and social interactions. In this study we aimed to explore whether individual differences in touch experiences across the lifespan are related to adult attachment styles and to perceived touch deprivation. For this we first developed an instrument, namely the Tactile Biography, to quantify individual differences in affective touch experiences throughout life. Secondly, we performed a set of regressions models and a mediation analysis to investigate the role of attachment in relation to both the tactile history and perceived touch deprivation. We found that experiences of affective touch during childhood and adolescence seem to be closely associated with adult attachment styles and adult social touch experiences. Avoidant attachment appears to serve as a mediator in the relationship between earlier (childhood/adolescent) and later (adult) affective touch experiences, as well as between earlier affective touch experiences and perceived touch deprivation. These findings offer further support to existing literature, providing novel insights for the fields of social affective touch and attachment research."
https://openalex.org/W3096480707,"Background Despite the great benefits of mobile health applications (mHAs) in managing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) internationally, studies have documented general challenges to broad adoption of mHAs among older age groups. By focusing on broad adoption, these studies have been limited in their evaluation of adults aged 50 and older who have high risk of NCDs and can benefit the most from the functionalities provided by mHAs. Objective This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, self-confidence, perceived benefits, and barriers of using mHAs depending on experience with mHAs among adults aged 50 and older. Furthermore, we aim to identify the factors associated with the actual use of mHAs. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a single tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea, between May 1 and May 31, 2018. Of the 625 participants who were contacted, 323 participants were granted full inclusion to the study. We compared demographics, knowledge, self-confidence, and perceived benefits and barriers by experience with using mHAs, then performed logistic regression to identify the factors associated with mHA use. Results Among the participants, 64.1% (N = 207) had experience using mHAs. Those in the experienced group were more likely to have more than college education (55.1% vs. 27.5%, P < 0.001) and to report a higher monthly income (≥ $7,000, 22.7% vs. 18.1%, P = 0.05) than their less-experienced counterparts. Although the experienced group was more likely to have higher self-confidence in using mHAs, about half of the study participants, including people with experience using mHAs, did not have appropriate knowledge of mobile technology. With adjusted logistic model, higher educated (adjusted PR (aPR) = 1.53, 95% CI, 1.26–1.80), higher perceived benefits of mHAs (aPR = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.04–1.83), and higher self-confidence using mHAs (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.12–1.70) were significant factors associated with mHA use. Conclusions The use of mHAs among adults aged 50 and older is becoming more common globally; nevertheless, there are still people unable to use mHAs properly because of lack of experience and knowledge. Strategies are needed to encourage the reliable usage of mHAs among those who may need it the most by improving self-confidence and better articulating benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3094735727,"Introduction Pharmacological therapy plays an important role in disease control in the elderly; unfortunately, this comes with a high prevalence in the use of medications classified as potentially inappropriate. Objective To analyze the incidence, risk factors, and survival of elderly people using potentially inappropriate medications (PIM). Method A ten-year follow-up assessment of elderly participants residing in a capital of Central Brazil was conducted. The initial assessment (baseline) included 418 elderly people. Data were collected through home interviews guided by a questionnaire covering socioeconomic, demographic, living conditions, and health variables. The medication information obtained comprised active ingredient, dosage, route, and regimen for the medications. The PIMs were classified according to 2019 Beers Criteria. The analyses were performed using STATA 15.0. For survival analysis, a Cox Regression was performed with the respective Kaplan Meier curve. Results The incidence of PIM was 44.1 cases (95% CI: 35.2–54.7) per 1,000 people a year. The most used PIMs were nifedipine, glibenclamide, and sodium diclofenac. The risk factors were polypharmacy (aRR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.31–6.88) and diabetes mellitus (aRR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.03–2.39). We identified no statistically significant association between survival and the use of PIM. Conclusion The study highlights the high consumption of PIM among the elderly causing polypharmacy risks. Health professionals working in drug treatment need to be alert to polypharmacy risks to ensure the rational use of medications to prevent adverse reactions and other health problems."
https://openalex.org/W3095453894,"The reasons for Thoroughbred (TB) horses not entering training or exiting the racing industry, are of interest to regulators, welfare groups and the broader community. Speculation about the outcomes of these horses threatens the community acceptance, or social license, of the TB breeding and racing industries. A representative survey of the 2010 Victorian born TB foal crop was used to determine the outcomes and reasons for exit for horses that had not entered training, or had exited training and racing by eight years of age. Horses exported for racing or breeding (4%), or that were still actively racing (7%) at the start of the follow up period were excluded from the study. An online questionnaire was sent to breeders or trainers of 3,176 TB horses eligible for enrolment in the study. Of the 2,005 (63%) responses received, the two most frequent outcomes were that the horse had either been retired or rehomed (65%), or deceased (16%). For the 1,637 TB horses that had entered training, the majority of retirements were voluntary (59%), followed by involuntary retirements due to health disorders (28%). For TBs that did not have an industry record of entering training (n = 368), death (34%), or retirement or being rehomed (27%), were the most frequent barriers to entering training. The median age of retirement for TBs that raced was five (Q1 4; Q3 6) years regardless of sex, or whether their first race start was at two, three or four years of age. Relatively large numbers of horses voluntarily retiring at five-years of age suggests that industry-level, rather than individual horse-level factors are the predominant influences on racing career duration."

Maternal malnutrition is frequently reported health problem especially during child bearing age and effects neonatal birth weight. Aim To determine relationship between prepregnancy maternal BMI and neonatal birth weight. Methods and material Prospective, cross sectional study conducted in Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan over a period of 1 year including 2766 mother—neonate pairs. All full term, live born neonates of both gender in early neonatal period (<72 hours) with documented maternal pre-pregnancy and/or first trimester BMI were enrolled. Data analysis using SPSS version 20, was performed. Results Data analysis of 2766 mother–neonates pairs showed that there were 32.9% overweight and 16.5% obese mothers. More than two third of all overweight and obese mothers were of age group between 26–35 years. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, medical illness, uterine malformations and caesarean mode of delivery were more prevalent in obese mothers as 22.8%, 10.1%, 13.2%, 2.6% and 75.4% respectively. Mean birth weight, length and OFC increased with increasing maternal BMI. Comparing for normal weight mothers, underweight mothers were at increased risk of low birth weight (p< 0.01) and low risk of macrosomic neonates (p<0.01). However overweight and obese mothers were comparable to normal weight mothers for delivering macrosomic neonates (p 0.89 and p 0.66 respectively). Conclusions Our study highlights that direct relationship exists between maternal BMI and neonatal birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W3090733477,"Background A core outcome set (COS) is a standardised collection of outcomes to be collected and reported in all trials within a research area. A COS can reduce reporting bias and facilitate evidence synthesis. This is currently unavailable for use in community-based bipolar trials. This research aimed to develop such a COS, with input from a full range of stakeholders. Methods A co-production approach was used throughout. A longlist of outcomes was derived from focus groups with people with a bipolar diagnosis and carers, interviews with healthcare professionals and a rapid review of outcomes listed in bipolar trials on the Cochrane database. An expert panel with personal and/or professional experience of bipolar participated in a modified Delphi process and the COS was finalised at a consensus meeting. Results Fifty participants rated the importance of each outcome. Sixty-six outcomes were included in Round 1 of the questionnaire; 13 outcomes were added by Round 1 participants and were rated in Round 2. Seventy-six percent of participants (n = 38) returned to Round 2 and 60 outcomes, including 4 outcomes added by participants in Round 1, received a rating of 7–9 by >70% and 1–3 by <25% of the sample. Fourteen participants finalised a COS containing 11 outcomes at the consensus meeting: personal recovery; connectedness; clinical recovery of bipolar symptoms; mental health and wellbeing; physical health; self-monitoring and management; medication effects; quality of life; service outcomes; experience of care; and use of coercion. Conclusions This COS is recommended for use in community-based bipolar trials to ensure stakeholder-relevant outcomes, facilitate data synthesis, and transparent reporting. The COS includes guidance notes for each outcome to allow the identification of suitable measurement instruments. Further validation is recommended for use with a wide range of communities and to achieve standardised measurement."
https://openalex.org/W3094777306,"The intestinal bacterial flora of febrile neutropenic patients has been found to be significantly diverse. However, there are few reports of alterations of in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Stool samples of each treatment-naïve AML patient were collected the day before initiation of induction chemotherapy (pretreatment), on the first date of neutropenic fever and first date of bone marrow recovery. Bacterial DNA was extracted from stool samples and bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Relative abundance, overall richness, Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. No antimicrobial prophylaxis was in placed in all participants. Ten cases of AML patients (4 male and 6 female) were included with a median age of 39 years (range: 19-49) and all of patients developed febrile neutropenia. Firmicutes dominated during the period of neutropenic fever, subsequently declining after bone marrow recovery a pattern in contrast to that shown by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Enterococcus was more abundant in the febrile neutropenia period compared to pretreatment (mean difference +20.2; p < 0.0001) while Escherichia notably declined during the same period (mean difference -11.2; p = 0.0064). At the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level, there was a significantly higher level of overall richness in the pretreatment period than in the febrile neutropenic episode (mean OTU of 203.1 vs. 131.7; p = 0.012). Both of the diversity indexes of Shannon and Simpson showed a significant decrease during the febrile neutropenic period. Adult AML patients with a first episode of febrile neutropenia after initial intensive chemotherapy demonstrated a significant decrease in gut microbiota diversity and the level of diversity remained constant despite recovery of bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W3097851183,"APC mutations drive human colorectal cancer (CRC) development. A major contributing factor is colonic stem cell (SC) overpopulation. But, the mechanism has not been fully identified. A possible mechanism is the dysregulation of neuroendocrine cell (NEC) maturation by APC mutations because SCs and NECs both reside together in the colonic crypt SC niche where SCs mature into NECs. So, we hypothesized that sequential inactivation of APC alleles in human colonic crypts leads to progressively delayed maturation of SCs into NECs and overpopulation of SCs. Accordingly, we used quantitative immunohistochemical mapping to measure indices and proportions of SCs and NECs in human colon tissues (normal, adenomatous, malignant), which have different APC-zygosity states. In normal crypts, many cells staining for the colonic SC marker ALDH1 co-stained for chromogranin-A (CGA) and other NEC markers. In contrast, in APC-mutant tissues from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, the proportion of ALDH+ SCs progressively increased while NECs markedly decreased. To explain how these cell populations change in FAP tissues, we used mathematical modelling to identify kinetic mechanisms. Computational analyses indicated that APC mutations lead to: 1) decreased maturation of ALDH+ SCs into progenitor NECs (not progenitor NECs into mature NECs); 2) diminished feedback signaling by mature NECs. Biological experiments using human CRC cell lines to test model predictions showed that mature GLP-2R+ and SSTR1+ NECs produce, via their signaling peptides, opposing effects on rates of NEC maturation via feedback regulation of progenitor NECs. However, decrease in this feedback signaling wouldn’t explain the delayed maturation because both progenitor and mature NECs are depleted in CRCs. So the mechanism for delayed maturation must explain how APC mutation causes the ALDH+ SCs to remain immature. Given that ALDH is a key component of the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway, that other components of the RA pathway are selectively expressed in ALDH+ SCs, and that exogenous RA ligands can induce ALDH+ cancer SCs to mature into NECs, RA signaling must be attenuated in ALDH+ SCs in CRC. Thus, attenuation of RA signaling explains why ALDH+ SCs remain immature in APC mutant tissues. Since APC mutation causes increased WNT signaling in FAP and we found that sequential inactivation of APC in FAP patient tissues leads to progressively delayed maturation of colonic ALDH+ SCs, the hypothesis is developed that human CRC evolves due to an imbalance between WNT and RA signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3095394246,"BACKGROUNDS Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multisystemic, progressive illness that causes chronic suppurative lung disease. A major cause of morbimortality in this condition are pulmonary exacerbations. Although classically attributed to bacterial infections, respiratory virus have been increasingly recognized in its ethiopathogeny. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children < 18 years old with CF in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with pulmonary exacerbation criteria. Samples were submitted to RT-PCR for Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Metapneumovirus and Rhinovirus. Virus positive and virus negative groups were compared in regards to clinical presentation, severity of exacerbation and bacterial colonization. RESULTS Out of 70 samples collected from 48 patients, 35.7% were positive for respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus were the most common (28% of all positive samples), followed by RSV. The virus positive group was associated with change in sinus discharge (p = 0.03). Considering only patients younger than five years old, positive virus detection was also associated with fever (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in clinical severity or in bacterial colonization between virus positive and negative groups. CONCLUSIONS Prospective studies are still needed to assess the long term impact of viral infections in patients with CF, and their interaction with the bacterial microbiome in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3097591654,"Haze pollution in China is very serious and has become the source of mortality, affecting the health and lives of residents. The Chinese government adopts different policy measures to reduce haze pollution. The impact of different types of environmental regulations on haze pollution has become a hot topic for academics and government departments. Based on panel data from 2005–2017, this paper studies the effect of different types of environmental regulations on haze pollution in 30 provinces of China using a panel quantile model. The results show that when haze pollution changes from a low quantile to a high quantile, the marginal impact of command-and-control environmental regulation on haze pollution changes from 0.122 to -0.332. Command-and-control environmental regulation can reduce haze pollution, but its impact is not significant. The main reason for this finding is that environmental law enforcement is not strict. The marginal impact of economically restrained environmental regulation on haze pollution changes from -14.389 to 49.939. Economically restrained environmental regulation can reduce haze pollution in low quantiles, but not in high quantiles. The collection of sewage charges fees is far less than the total profit, which has no deterrent effect on enterprises. The marginal impact of public participation in environmental regulation on haze pollution changes from 0.154 to -0.002. Public participation in environmental regulation cannot reduce haze pollution in low quantiles, but can in high quantiles; however its impact becomes insignificant. This study reveals the quantile-based discrepancy in the effect of environmental regulation on haze pollution, and offers a new perspective for research on the effects of environmental regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3097100652,"Digital Light Processing (DLP) stereolithography (SLA) as a high-resolution 3D printing process offers a low-cost alternative for prototyping of microfluidic geometries, compared to traditional clean-room and workshop-based methods. Here, we investigate DLP-SLA printing performance for the production of micro-chamber chip geometries suitable for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a key process in molecular diagnostics to amplify nucleic acid sequences. A DLP-SLA fabrication protocol for printed micro-chamber devices with monolithic micro-channels is developed and evaluated. Printed devices were post-processed with ultraviolet (UV) light and solvent baths to reduce PCR inhibiting residuals and further treated with silane coupling agents to passivate the surface, thereby limiting biomolecular adsorption occurences during the reaction. The printed devices were evaluated on a purpose-built infrared (IR) mediated PCR thermocycler. Amplification of 75 base pair long target sequences from genomic DNA templates on fluorosilane and glass modified chips produced amplicons consistent with the control reactions, unlike the non-silanized chips that produced faint or no amplicon. The results indicated good functionality of the IR thermocycler and good PCR compatibility of the printed and silanized SLA polymer. Based on the proposed methods, various microfluidic designs and ideas can be validated in-house at negligible costs without the requirement of tool manufacturing and workshop or clean-room access. Additionally, the versatile chemistry of 3D printing resins enables customised surface properties adding significant value to the printed prototypes. Considering the low setup and unit cost, design flexibility and flexible resin chemistries, DLP-SLA is anticipated to play a key role in future prototyping of microfluidics, particularly in the fields of research biology and molecular diagnostics. From a system point-of-view, the proposed method of thermocycling shows promise for portability and modular integration of funcitonalitites for diagnostic or research applications that utilize nucleic acid amplification technology."
https://openalex.org/W3097138105,"We estimated the caloric contribution of minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods and ultra-processed foods in Brazilian farmers' diets and their association with the nutritional profile of the diet. It is an epidemiological study of cross-sectional, analytical and quantitative design with 740 farmers adults of Southeastern Brazil. Food intake data were obtained by applying three 24-hour recalls and were classified according to the degree and purpose of processing. The largest caloric contribution came from the group of minimally processed foods (64.7%), followed by ultra-processed foods (17.7%), processed culinary ingredients (12.4%), and processed foods (5.2%). Individuals in the fourth quartile of caloric contribution from minimally processed foods showed lower energy consumption (β -0.16, P<0.001) and greater consumption of all 15 micronutrients analyzed. In contrast to what was identified for this food group, the higher caloric contribution from ultra-processed foods was associated with a greater caloric content of the diet (β 0.17, P<0.001) and lower consumption of all 23 analyzed nutrients. Therefore, the caloric contribution from the consumption of ultra-processed foods in the rural area is still lower than the national average. However, measures aimed at delaying isocaloric exchanges for the group of ultra-processed foods must be carried out, maintaining the local food culture, since this group had worse nutritional levels. In addition, incentives to the greater consumption of minimally processed foods should be carried out, due to their nutritional quality."

https://openalex.org/W3095995149,"Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are common enteric diseases causing disability and death in China. Incidence data of typhoid and paratyphoid between 2004 and 2016 in China were analyzed descriptively to explore the epidemiological features such as age-specific and geographical distribution. Cumulative incidence of both fevers displayed significant decrease nationally, displaying a drop of 73.9% for typhoid and 86.6% for paratyphoid in 2016 compared to 2004. Cumulative incidence fell in all age subgroups and the 0-4 years-old children were the most susceptible ones in recent years. A cluster of three southwestern provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi) were the top high-incidence regions. Grey model GM (1,1) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model were employed to extract the long-term trends of the diseases. Annual cumulative incidence for typhoid and paratyphoid were formulated by GM (1,1) as [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively. SARIMA (0,1,7) × (1,0,1)12 was selected among a collection of constructed models for high R2 and low errors. The predictive models for both fevers forecasted cumulative incidence to continue the slightly downward trend and maintain the cyclical seasonality in near future years. Such data-driven insights are informative and actionable for the prevention and control of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers as serious infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3096763845,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the importance of active case-finding (ACF) for early detection of tuberculosis (TB), especially in the 30 high-burden countries that account for almost 90% of cases globally. Objective To describe the attitudes of National TB Programme (NTP) managers related to ACF policy development, implementation and scale-up in the 30 high-burden countries, and to review national TB strategic plans. Methods This was a mixed-methods study with an embedded design: A cross-sectional survey with NTP managers yielded quantitative and qualitative data. A review of national TB strategic plans complemented the results. All data were analyzed in parallel and merged in the interpretation of the findings. Results 23 of the 30 NTP managers (77%) participated in the survey and 22 (73%) national TB strategic plans were reviewed. NTP managers considered managers in districts and regions key stakeholders for both ACF policy development and implementation. Different types of evidence were used to inform ACF policy, while there was a particular demand for local evidence. The NSPs reflected the NTP managers’ unanimous agreement on the need for ACF scale-up, but not all included explicit aims and targets related to ACF. The NTP managers recognized that ACF may decrease health systems costs in the long-term, while acknowledging the risk for increased health system costs in the short-term. About 90% of the NTP managers declared that financial and human resources were currently lacking, while they also elaborated on strategies to overcome resource constraints. Conclusion NTP managers stated that ACF should be scaled up but reported resource constraints. Strategies to increase resources exist but may not yet have been fully implemented, e.g. generating local evidence including from operational research for advocacy. Managers in districts and regions were identified as key stakeholders whose involvement could help improve ACF policy development, implementation and scale-up."
https://openalex.org/W3095104034,"Estimating the percentages of undiagnosed and asymptomatic patients is essential for controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and for assessing any strategy for controlling the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis based on the birth-death process with recursive full tracing. We estimated the numbers of undiagnosed symptomatic patients and the lower bound of the number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient before and after the declaration of the state of emergency in Hokkaido, Japan. The median of the estimated number of undiagnosed symptomatic patients per diagnosed patient decreased from 1.7 to 0.77 after the declaration, and the median of the estimated lower bound of the number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient decreased from 4.2 to 2.4. We will discuss the limitations and possible expansions of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3096883451,"Introduction The rapid clearance of factor IX necessitates frequent intravenous administrations to achieve effective prophylaxis for patients with hemophilia B. Subcutaneous administration has historically been limited by low bioavailability and potency. Dalcinonacog alfa was developed using a rational design approach to be a subcutaneously administered, next-generation coagulation prophylactic factor IX therapy. Aim This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile of dalcinonacog alfa administered subcutaneously in hemophilia B dogs. Methods Two hemophilia B dogs received single-dose daily subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa injections for six days. Factor IX antigen and activity, whole blood clotting time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were measured at various time points. Additionally, safety assessments for clinical adverse events and evaluations of laboratory test results were conducted. Results There was an increase in plasma factor IX antigen with daily subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa. Bioavailability of subcutaneous dalcinonacog alfa was 10.3% in hemophilia B dogs. Daily subcutaneous dosing of dalcinonacog alfa demonstrated the effects of bioavailability, time to maximal concentration, and half-life by reaching a steady-state activity sufficient to correct severe hemophilia to normal, after four days. Conclusion The increased potency of dalcinonacog alfa facilitated the initiation and completion of the Phase 1/2 subcutaneous dosing study in individuals with hemophilia B."
https://openalex.org/W3097455428,"Emerging evidence demonstrates that female-authored publications are not well represented in course readings in some fields, resulting in a syllabi gender gap. Lack of representation may decrease student awareness of opportunities in professional fields and disadvantage the career success of female academics. We contribute to the evidence on the syllabi gender gap by: 1) quantifying the extent to which female authors are represented in assigned course readings; 2) examining representation of female authors by gender of instructor and discipline; and 3) comparing female representation in syllabi with the workforce and with representation as authors of peer-reviewed journal articles. From a list of courses offered in 2018–2019 at Washington University in St. Louis, we selected a stratified random sample of course syllabi from four disciplines (humanities; social science; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and other). We coded the gender of course instructors and course reading authors using the genderize application programming interface. We examined representation of female authors at the reading, course, and discipline level using descriptive statistics and data visualization. The final sample included 2435 readings from 129 unique courses. The mean percentage of female authors per reading was 34.1%; 822 (33.8%) of readings were female-led (i.e., a female first or sole author). Female authorship varied by discipline, with the highest percentage of female-led readings in social science (40%). Female instructors assigned a higher percentage of readings with female first authors and readings with higher percentages of females on authorship teams. The representation of female authors on syllabi was lower than representation of females as authors in the peer-reviewed literature or in workforce. Adding to evidence of the syllabi gender gap, we found that female authors were underrepresented as sole and first authors and as members of authorship teams. Since assigned readings promote academic scholarship and influence workforce diversity, we recommend several strategies to diversify the syllabi through increasing awareness of the gap and improving access to female-authored publications."
https://openalex.org/W3096943305,"Most literature exploring the biological effects of ocean acidification (OA) has focused on macroscopic organisms and far less is known about how marine microbial communities will respond. Studies of OA and microbial community composition and diversity have examined communities from a limited number of ocean regions where the ambient pH is near or above the global average. At San Juan Island (Salish Sea), a region that experiences naturally low pH (average = 7.8), the picoplankton (cell diameter is 0.2–2μm) community was predicted to show no response to experimental acidification in a three-week mesocosm experiment. Filtered seawater mesocosms were maintained via semicontinuous culturing. Three control mesocosms were maintained at pH 8.05 and three acidified mesocosms were maintained at pH 7.60. Total bacteria was quantified daily with a flow cytometer. Microbial communities were sampled every two days via filtration followed by DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplification, and MiSeq sequencing. There was no significant difference in total bacteria between pH treatments throughout the experiment. Acidification significantly reduced Shannon’s diversity over time. During the final week of the experiment, acidification resulted in a significant decrease in Shannon’s diversity, Faith’s phylogenetic distance, and Pielous’s Evenness. ANCOM results revealed four bacterial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), in families Flavobaceriaceae and Hyphomonadaceae that significantly decreased in relative frequency under acidification and two bacterial ASVs, in families Flavobacteriaceae and Alteromonadaceae, that significantly increased under acidification. This is the first OA study on the microbial community of the Salish Sea, a nutrient rich, low pH region, and the first of its kind to report a decrease in both picoplankton richness and evenness with acidification. These findings demonstrate that marine microbial communities that naturally experience acidic conditions are still sensitive to acidification."
https://openalex.org/W3097555159,"Objective To relate serum and follicular fluid (FF) kisspeptin and estradiol levels in different stages of stimulation during Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) with oocyte maturity and endometrial thickness among unexplained infertile females. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out at the Australian Concept Infertility Medical Centre from March 2017 till March 2018. Fifty unexplained infertile females, booked for ICSI, were included in the study. Serum kisspeptin and estradiol were estimated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay in all four stages; 1: follicular stimulation, 2: ovulation induction, 3: oocyte pickup, and 4: embryo transfer. FF was aspirated during oocyte retrieval (stage 3) for the analysis of KP and estradiol. Pregnancy outcomes were categorized as non-pregnant, preclinical abortion, and clinical pregnancy. Results The age of the study subjects was 32.04 ± 2.29 (Mean±SD) years, with mean BMI of 28.51 ± 4.15 (Mean±SD) kg/m2. Mean serum kisspeptin and estradiol levels increased in all subjects as the stimulation proceeded stages 1–3; however, the mean dropped after retrieval of the oocytes (stage 4). Out of 27 female subjects who completed the cycle, 17 remained non-pregnant, 4 had preclinical abortion, and 6 acquired clinical pregnancy. The FF kisspeptin concentration was significantly higher than serum concentrations and positively correlated with serum and FF estradiol concentrations. FF-kisspeptin correlated with serum kisspeptin in Stage 3 (r = 0.930, p<0.001), maturity of oocyte (r = 0.511, p = 0.006) and endometrial thickness (r = 0.522, p = 0.005). Kisspeptin in stage 3 was also found to correlate with endometrial thickness (r = 0.527, p = 0.005) and with estradiol (r = 0.624, p = 0.001) independently. Conclusion Increase in serum and FF-kisspeptin and estradiol levels from stages 1 to 3, resulted in an optimum endometrial thickness, probability of fertilization of oocytes and chances of clinical pregnancy in Assisted Reproductive Techniques /ICSI cycles of unexplained infertile females."
https://openalex.org/W3097897516,"Objective The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for surgical site infection from digestive, thoracic and orthopaedic system surgeries using clinical and data-driven cut-off values. A second objective was to compare the identified risk factors in this study to risk factors identified in literature. Summary background data Retrospective data of 3 250 surgical procedures performed in large tertiary care hospital in The Netherlands during January 2013 to June 2014 were used. Methods Potential risk factors were identified using a literature scan and univariate analysis. A multivariate forward-step logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors. Standard medical cut-off values were compared with cut-offs determined from the data. Results For digestive, orthopaedic and thoracic system surgical procedures, the risk factors identified were preoperative temperature of ≥38°C and antibiotics used at the time of surgery. C-reactive protein and the duration of the surgery were identified as a risk factors for digestive surgical procedures. Being an adult (age ≥18) was identified as a protective effect for thoracic surgical procedures. Data-driven cut-off values were identified for temperature, age and CRP which can explain the SSI outcome up to 19.5% better than generic cut-off values. Conclusions This study identified risk factors for digestive, orthopaedic and thoracic system surgical procedures and illustrated how data-driven cut-offs can add value in the process. Future studies should investigate if data-driven cut-offs can add value to explain the outcome being modelled and not solely rely on standard medical cut-off values to identify risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3095534269,"Commercial landings of starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias in northern European seas are increasing, whilst our knowledge of their ecology, behaviour and population structure remains limited. M. asterias is a widely distributed demersal shark, occupying the waters of the southern North Sea and Irish Sea in the north, to at least the southern Bay of Biscay in the south, and is seasonally abundant in UK waters. There are no species-specific management measures for the northeast Atlantic stock, and the complexity of its population structure is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, we deployed both mark-recapture and electronic tags on M. asterias to gain novel insights into its horizontal and vertical movements. Our data suggest that the habitat use of M. asterias changes on a seasonal basis, with associated changes in geographical distribution, depth utilisation and experienced temperature. We report the first direct evidence of philopatry for this species, and also provide initial evidence of sex-biased dispersal and potential metapopulation-like stock structuring either side of the UK continental shelf. Investigations of finer-scale vertical movements revealed clear diel variation in vertical activity. The illustrated patterns of seasonal space-use and behaviour will provide important information to support the stock assessment process and will help inform any future management options."
https://openalex.org/W3097630677,"It has been reported that the cerebellar vermis is equally involved in both motor imagery about axial movement and the actual execution of postural balance in healthy human subjects, but this finding is yet to be explored in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We therefore investigated the neuronal responses during observation of standing posture, imagination of standing and the assumption of an upright posture in ten drug-naïve PD patients using positron emission tomography (PET) with [15O]H2O and evaluated dopamine dysfunction by measuring the level of dopamine transporter binding of [11C]CFT. Within-group statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis showed similar cerebellar activation during imagination of standing and its real execution between the PD and control groups (12 healthy subjects); i.e., increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were observed in the anterior cerebellar vermis during motor imagination and the posterior vermis during standing. A comparison between the groups showed that the motor execution of standing significantly activated the superior part of the posterior vermis (declive VI) and the paracentral sulcus region in the PD patients, while the prefrontal cortices were deactivated during standing (p<0.001 uncorrected). Correlation analysis within the PD group revealed that the postural rCBF increases in the cerebellar vermis (pyramis) were negatively correlated with putaminal [11C]CFT binding (p<0.01, r = 0.94) and that the postural rCBF reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex were positively correlated with caudate [11C]CFT binding (p<0.05, r = 0.70). These results suggest that while the neural circuits for postural imagery and execution are intact in PD, standing performance, which requires more recruitment of dopaminergic control, may result in compensatory overstimulation of the cerebellar vermis and paracentral foot area in PD patients. Hyperactivity in these areas along with mesocortical hypofunction may be pathophysiological aspects of postural control in PD patients. Hence, our findings would help understand the modifications observed within the neural networks in relationship with postural performance, and possible compensatory mechanisms in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3097692740,"Relationship dissolution can cause declines in emotional well-being, particularly if there are children involved. Individuals’ capacity to cope with the pragmatics of the situation, such as agreeing childcare arrangements, can be impaired. Before now, there has been no psychometric test to evaluate individuals’ emotional readiness to cope with these demands. This paper presents a model of emotional adaptation in the context of relationship dissolution and its key assumptions, and validates the Emotional Adaptation to Relationship Dissolution Assessment (EARDA). In Study 1 (Sample 1, n = 573 separated parents, Sample 2, n = 199 mix of parents and non-parents), factor analyses support the EARDA as a unidimensional scale with good reliability. In Study 2 (using Sample 1, and Sample 3, n = 156 separated parents) the convergent, discriminant, concurrent criterion-related, and incremental validity of the EARDA were supported by tests of association with stress, distress, attachment style, and co-parenting communication and conflict. In Study 3, the nomological network of emotional adaptation to relationship dissolution was explored in Sample 2 using cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Emotional adaptation clustered with positive traits and an outward focus, and was negatively associated with negative traits and an inward focus. Emotional adaptation was conceptually located in close proximity to active and adaptive coping, and furthest away from maladaptive coping. In Study 4 (n = 30 separated parents embarking on mediation), high, medium, and low emotional adaptation to relationship dissolution categories correlated highly with mediators’ professional judgement, offering triangulated face validity. Finally, in Study 5, EARDA scores were found to mediate between separation characteristics (time since break up, whether it was a shock, and who initiated the break up) and co-parenting conflict in Sample 1, supporting the proposed model. The theoretical innovation of this work is the introduction of a new construct that bridges the gap between relationship dissolution and co-parenting. Practical implications include the use of the measure proposed to triage levels of support in a family law setting."
https://openalex.org/W3096867562,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between the height and depth of buccal non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) and the relationship between the size of buccal NCCLs and clinical crown-root ratio of both buccal and lingual (palatal) sides using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of the teeth and periodontal tissues from the cadavers. The micro-CT images of 56 teeth and their supporting tissues were obtained from 17 cadavers. From these images, the height and depth of NCCLs and the length of the buccal and lingual (palatal) clinical crowns were measured, and the conventional/modified clinical crown-root ratios were calculated. The height and depth ratio of NCCLs were analyzed statistically with the conventional/modified crown-root ratios by Pearson’s correlation and multiple regression. According to the Pearson’s correlation, the height and depth of buccal NCCLs were positively correlated with the modified buccal clinical crown-root ratio (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively). The regression model composed of variables of crown-root ratios explained the height of buccal NCCLs, and the prominent factor of the model was the modified buccal clinical crown-root ratio (p < 0.001). Moreover, the depth of buccal NCCLs was also explained by the regression model, and its prominent factor was the proportion of modified buccal and lingual (palatal) clinical crowns (p = 0.004). The buccal NCCLs were related to the crown-root ratios; particularly, the level of buccal gingival margin could be associated with the formation of buccal NCCLs."
https://openalex.org/W3097523835,"Previous studies have suggested that there are common mechanisms between perceptual and value-based processes. For instance, both perceptual and value-based choices are highly influenced by the context in which the choices are made. However, the mechanisms which allow context to influence our choice process as well as the extent of the similarity between the perceptual and preferential processes are still unclear. In this study, we examine a within-subject relation between the attraction effect, which is a well-known effect of context on preferential choice, and the Gestalt law of proximity. Then, we aim to use this link to better understand the mechanisms underlying the attraction effect. We conducted one study followed by an additional pre-registered replication study, where subjects performed a Gestalt-psychophysical task and a decoy task. Comparing the behavioral sensitivity of each subject in both tasks, we found that the more susceptible a subject is to the proximity law, the more she displayed the attraction effect. These results demonstrate a within-subject relation between a perceptual phenomenon (proximity law) and a value-based bias (attraction effect) which further strengthens the notion of common rules between perceptual and value-based processing. Moreover, this suggests that the mechanism underlying the attraction effect is related to grouping by proximity with attention as a mediator."
https://openalex.org/W3096388919,"To assess the influence of periodontal disease on cerebral hemorrhage and its clinical course, we examined the association of the serum IgG titer of periodontal pathogens with hemorrhage growth and 3-month outcome. We consecutively enrolled 115 patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage (44 females, aged 71.3 ± 13.1 years) and used ELISA to evaluate the serum IgG titers of 9 periodontal pathogens: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter (A.) actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens. Significant hematoma growth was defined as an increase in the volume of >33% or an absolute increase in the volume of >12.5 mL. A poor outcome was defined as a 3 or higher on the modified Rankin Scale. We observed hemorrhage growth in 13 patients (11.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that increased IgG titers of A. actinomycetemcomitans independently predicted the elevated hemorrhage growth (odds ratio 5.26, 95% confidence interval 1.52–18.25, p = 0.01). Notably, augmented IgG titers of F. nucleatum but not A. actinomycetemcomitans led to a poorer 3-month outcome (odds ratio 7.86, 95% confidence interval 1.08–57.08, p = 0.04). Thus, we demonstrate that elevated serum IgG titers of A. actinomycetemcomitans are an independent factor for predicting cerebral hemorrhage growth and that high serum IgG titers of F. nucleatum may predict a poor outcome in patients with this disease. Together, these novel data reveal how systemic periodontal pathogens may affect stroke patients, and, should, therefore, be taken into consideration in the management and treatment of these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3096529154,"We demonstrate strong self-referential effects in county-level data concerning use of the death penalty. We first show event-dependency using a repeated-event model. Higher numbers of previous events reduce the expected time delay before the next event. Second, we use a cross-sectional time-series approach to model the number of death sentences imposed in a given county in a given year. This model shows that the cumulative number of death sentences previously imposed in the same county is a strong predictor of the number imposed in a given year. Results raise troubling substantive implications: The number of death sentences in a given county in a given year is better predicted by that county’s previous experience in imposing death than by the number of homicides. This explains the previously observed fact that a large share of death sentences come from a small number of counties and documents the self-referential aspects of use the death penalty. A death sentencing system based on racial dynamics and then amplified by self-referential dynamics is inconsistent with equal protection of the law, but this describes the United States system well."
https://openalex.org/W3097466819,"The Tibetan Plateau and Siberia are both crucial regions in which the vegetation dynamics are sensitive to climate change. The variabilities in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the two regions have been explored previously, but there have been few studies on the relationship of the NDVI in the two regions. Using the GIMMS-NDVI, GHCN-CAMS and NCEP reanalysis datasets and statistical and physical diagnostic methods, we show that the summer (June, July and August) NDVI over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and Lake Baikal and its adjacent eastern region of Siberia have an in-phase co-variability, especially on an interannual timescale (with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 during the time period 1982–2014). Further analyses show that precipitation and the related cloud cover and solar radiation are responsible for the variability in the NDVI over the eastern Tibetan Plateau, whereas temperature has the more important role in modulating the variability in the NDVI over the Lake Baikal region. A dipole pattern prevails over the Tibetan Plateau–Lake Baikal region and reflects the anomalies in the intensity and location of the South Asian high and the northeast Asian blocking high. This dipole pattern simultaneously modulates precipitation over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the temperature over the Lake Baikal region and leads to the co-variability of the NDVI between the two regions. A synergistic sea surface temperature index, which reflects sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the northwest Pacific Ocean, the northern Indian Ocean and the subtropical north Atlantic Ocean, appears to adjust this Tibetan Plateau–Lake Baikal dipole pattern and is therefore closely related to the co-variability of the NDVI between the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the Lake Baikal region. Our results suggest that vegetation dynamics may not be only a local phenomenon in some areas, but are also likely to remotely link with variations in vegetation over other regions."

https://openalex.org/W3097194763,"In this study, we clarified the holistic color combination rules of human-preferred Papilionidae butterflies by examining the hue, lightness, and chroma. A set of 118 Papilionidae butterfly images used in our previous study was analyzed. These images were classified via hierarchical density-based spatial clustering based on perceptual similarities of colors that were obtained from a subjective image classification experiment. The color combinations of the clustered images were determined based on representative colors that were analyzed by a Gaussian mixture model with minimum message length and the color combination types defined in our previous study. Consequently, we obtained the following holistic color combination rules for Papilionidae: 1) contrasting lightness, similar chroma, and similar hue, 2) contrasting lightness, contrasting chroma, and similar hue, 3) similar lightness, similar chroma, and complementary hue, and 4) similar lightness, similar chroma, and similar hue. These rules suggest that minority color harmony theories are valid under particular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3097330668,"Despite limited information and knowledge, we personally form beliefs about certain properties of objects encountered in our daily life-popularity of a newly released movie, for example. Since such beliefs are prone to error, we often revise our initial beliefs according to the beliefs of others to improve accuracy. Optimal revision requires modulating the degree of accepting others' beliefs based on various cues for accuracy-number of opinions, for example-such that the more accurate others' beliefs are, the more we accept them. Although previous studies have shown that such accuracy cues can influence the degree of acceptance during social revision, they primarily investigated problems with 'factually correct' answers, and rarely problems with 'socially correct' answers. Here we examined which accuracy cues are objectively useful (utility of cues), and how those cues are used (use of cues), in the social revision of people's beliefs about problems with 'socially correct' answers. We asked people to estimate the 'shared preferences (SPs)' for sociocultural items, the answers to which are determined by socially aggregated beliefs-how popular an abstract painting will be among a large crowd, for example-and then to revise their initial estimates after being exposed to other people's estimates about the same items. We considered 'confidence', 'agreement among estimates', and 'number of estimates' as accuracy cues. We found that, while all three cues validly signaled the accuracy of SP estimates, only the 'number' cue has a significant utility, but the other cues are much less useful for optimal revision. Nevertheless, people used the cues of 'agreement' and their own 'confidence' to the extent comparable to that of the 'number' cue. Our findings suggest that the utility and use of accuracy cues for problems with 'socially correct' answers differ from those with 'factually correct' answers, as follows: (i) confidence does not have a significant utility and (ii) but people use their own confidence while ignoring others' confidence."
