https://openalex.org/W2035486499,"THERE is considerable clinical evidence to show that in persons infected with malaria various stimuli may precipitate an acute attack. These stimuli include surgical operations, the injection of vaccines, exposure to cold, and possibly, for persons who have not become acclimatized, ascent to high altitudes. There is also evidence, both clinical and experimental, to show that injections of cortisone increase the virulence of bacterial and virus infections. Trypanosome infections also, including Chagas's disease, are intensified in animals given cortisone1,2."

https://openalex.org/W3026477962,"IN general, enzymes concerned with the transfer of ‘high-energy’ phosphate depend for their activity on the presence of free thiol groups, and it has been suggested that the enzyme-substrate combinations of the phosphokinases may involve the formation of —SH—Mg— phosphate complexes1. The phosphatases, adenosine-triphosphatase2 and hexose-diphosphatase3, have also been shown to be sulphydryl enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1994622659,"AN examination of serial sections of Fasciola hepatica shows that a narrow duct originates from the anterior end of the vitelline reservoir and runs for a short distance to open into a wide elliptical chamber situated in the central region of the shell gland (see diagram). According to Schubmann1 and Stephenson2, neither an ootype nor a receptaculum seminis is present in Fasciola hepatica, and, so far as I am aware, the presence of such a wide chamber has not previously been reported for this fluke. In order to distinguish the chamber from the ootype of other trematodes, I propose to call it the ‘elliptical chamber’. In this chamber the vitelline granules, the vitelline cells and the oocytes are mixed together, and here the secretion of the shell gland is discharged and the egg-shell is formed."

https://openalex.org/W2067638330,"FERTILIZIN, the sperm-agglutinating substance derived from the jelly-coat of the egg, has been regarded as playing a significant part in the fertilization process in a variety of animals1,2. Studies2–4 of the chemical properties of fertilizin have shown that it belongs to that category of amino-acid- and sugar-containing substances termed glycoproteins or muco-polysaccharides. Many of the constituent amino-acids and sugars have been identified2,5–9 in several species of echinoids. With regard to the carbohydrate components, galactose has been found in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus5,6 and in Echinus esculentus8, fucose in Echinocardium cordatum8, and both these sugars in S. draebachiensis and Paracentrotus lividus8. While not implying that sugar composition is the main basis for the specificity of the fertilizin reaction, we wish to report the presence of fructose as the main monosaccharide derived from the egg-water of the sand-dollar, Echinarachnius parma."

https://openalex.org/W2046302326,"SOME ascidial stalks of Clerodendron infortunatum described earlier1 contain a few vascular bundles which are concentric—some amphivasal and others amphicribral in structure. The amphivasal vascular bundles are seen near the tip of the ascidial stalk. In tracing the origin of this amphivasal vascular bundle from the base to the tip in serial sections, it was observed that the basal collateral vascular bundle becomes gradually a horse-shoe shaped one which ultimately becomes amphivasal in shape (see photomicrograph). At an upper level this concentric vascular bundle reverts successively to the horse-shoe shaped and collateral types. During the transition stage of the vascular bundle from collateral to concentric structure, its upward course is diverted towards the pith. Here the amphivasal vascular bundle is seen embedded within three to six layers of cells of the pith. Next, the concentric bundle turns outward again and takes its place by the side of the neighbouring collateral vascular bundles, by which time it has assumed its collateral form."
