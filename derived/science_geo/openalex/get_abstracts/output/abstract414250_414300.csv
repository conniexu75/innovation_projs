https://openalex.org/W2169200218,"Daptomycin remains one of our last-line anti-staphylococcal agents. This study aims to characterize the genetic evolution to daptomycin resistance in S. aureus.Whole genome sequencing was performed on a unique collection of isogenic, clinical (21 strains) and laboratory (12 strains) derived strains that had been exposed to daptomycin and developed daptomycin-nonsusceptibility. Electron microscopy (EM) and lipid membrane studies were performed on selected isolates.On average, six coding region mutations were observed across the genome in the clinical daptomycin exposed strains, whereas only two mutations on average were seen in the laboratory exposed pairs. All daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains had a mutation in a phospholipid biosynthesis gene. This included mutations in the previously described mprF gene, but also in other phospholipid biosynthesis genes, including cardiolipin synthase (cls2) and CDP-diacylglycerol-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase (pgsA). EM and lipid membrane composition analyses on two clinical pairs showed that the daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains had a thicker cell wall and an increase in membrane lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol.Point mutations in genes coding for membrane phospholipids are associated with the development of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin in S. aureus. Mutations in cls2 and pgsA appear to be new genetic mechanisms affecting daptomycin susceptibility in S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W1855576760,"African Americans are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2DM) yet few studies have examined T2DM using genome-wide association approaches in this ethnicity. The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with T2DM in the African American population. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using the Affymetrix 6.0 array in 965 African-American cases with T2DM and end-stage renal disease (T2DM-ESRD) and 1029 population-based controls. The most significant SNPs (n = 550 independent loci) were genotyped in a replication cohort and 122 SNPs (n = 98 independent loci) were further tested through genotyping three additional validation cohorts followed by meta-analysis in all five cohorts totaling 3,132 cases and 3,317 controls. Twelve SNPs had evidence of association in the GWAS (P<0.0071), were directionally consistent in the Replication cohort and were associated with T2DM in subjects without nephropathy (P<0.05). Meta-analysis in all cases and controls revealed a single SNP reaching genome-wide significance (P<2.5×10−8). SNP rs7560163 (P = 7.0×10−9, OR (95% CI) = 0.75 (0.67–0.84)) is located intergenically between RND3 and RBM43. Four additional loci (rs7542900, rs4659485, rs2722769 and rs7107217) were associated with T2DM (P<0.05) and reached more nominal levels of significance (P<2.5×10−5) in the overall analysis and may represent novel loci that contribute to T2DM. We have identified novel T2DM-susceptibility variants in the African-American population. Notably, T2DM risk was associated with the major allele and implies an interesting genetic architecture in this population. These results suggest that multiple loci underlie T2DM susceptibility in the African-American population and that these loci are distinct from those identified in other ethnic populations."
https://openalex.org/W2156603052,"Background Sex differences in personality are believed to be comparatively small. However, research in this area has suffered from significant methodological limitations. We advance a set of guidelines for overcoming those limitations: (a) measure personality with a higher resolution than that afforded by the Big Five; (b) estimate sex differences on latent factors; and (c) assess global sex differences with multivariate effect sizes. We then apply these guidelines to a large, representative adult sample, and obtain what is presently the best estimate of global sex differences in personality. Methodology/Principal Findings Personality measures were obtained from a large US sample (N = 10,261) with the 16PF Questionnaire. Multigroup latent variable modeling was used to estimate sex differences on individual personality dimensions, which were then aggregated to yield a multivariate effect size (Mahalanobis D). We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES, the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap). These are extremely large differences by psychological standards. Significance The idea that there are only minor differences between the personality profiles of males and females should be rejected as based on inadequate methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2061781448,"We have recently identified conventional B2 cells as atherogenic and B1a cells as atheroprotective in hypercholesterolemic ApoE(-/-) mice. Here, we examined the development of atherosclerosis in BAFF-R deficient ApoE(-/-) mice because B2 cells but not B1a cells are selectively depleted in BAFF-R deficient mice. We fed BAFF-R(-/-) ApoE(-/-) (BaffR.ApoE DKO) and BAFF-R(+/+)ApoE(-/-) (ApoE KO) mice a high fat diet (HFD) for 8-weeks. B2 cells were significantly reduced by 82%, 81%, 94%, 72% in blood, peritoneal fluid, spleen and peripheral lymph nodes respectively; while B1a cells and non-B lymphocytes were unaffected. Aortic atherosclerotic lesions assessed by oil red-O stained-lipid accumulation and CD68+ macrophage accumulation were decreased by 44% and 50% respectively. B cells were absent in atherosclerotic lesions of BaffR.ApoE DKO mice as were IgG1 and IgG2a immunoglobulins produced by B2 cells, despite low but measurable numbers of B2 cells and IgG1 and IgG2a immunoglobulin concentrations in plasma. Plasma IgM and IgM deposits in atherosclerotic lesions were also reduced. BAFF-R deficiency in ApoE(-/-) mice was also associated with a reduced expression of VCAM-1 and fewer macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates and PCNA+ cells in lesions. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL1-β and proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 was also reduced. Body weight and plasma cholesterols were unaffected in BaffR.ApoE DKO mice. Our data indicate that B2 cells are important contributors to the development of atherosclerosis and that targeting the BAFF-R to specifically reduce atherogenic B2 cell numbers while preserving atheroprotective B1a cell numbers may be a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce atherosclerosis by potently reducing arterial inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1972137367,"Social interactions in mice are frequently analysed in genetically modified strains in order to get insight of disorders affecting social interactions such as autism spectrum disorders. Different types of social interactions have been described, mostly between females and pups, and between adult males and females. However, we recently showed that social interactions between adult males could also encompass cognitive and motivational features. During social interactions, rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), but it remains unknown if call types are differently used depending of the context and if they are correlated with motivational state. Here, we recorded the calls of adult C57BL/6J male mice in various behavioral conditions, such as social interaction, novelty exploration and restraint stress. We introduced a modulator for the motivational state by comparing males maintained in isolation and males maintained in groups before the experiments. Male mice uttered USVs in all social and non-social situations, and even in a stressful restraint context. They nevertheless emitted the most important number of calls with the largest diversity of call types in social interactions, particularly when showing a high motivation for social contact. For mice maintained in social isolation, the number of calls recorded was positively correlated with the duration of social contacts, and most calls were uttered during contacts between the two mice. This correlation was not observed in mice maintained in groups. These results open the way for a deeper understanding and characterization of acoustic signals associated with social interactions. They can also help evaluating the role of motivational states in the emission of acoustic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2050463578,"Eukaryotic organisms play essential roles in the biology and fertility of soils. For example the micro and mesofauna contribute to the fragmentation and homogenization of plant organic matter, while its hydrolysis is primarily performed by the fungi. To get a global picture of the activities carried out by soil eukaryotes we sequenced 2×10,000 cDNAs synthesized from polyadenylated mRNA directly extracted from soils sampled in beech (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce (Picea abies) forests. Taxonomic affiliation of both cDNAs and 18S rRNA sequences showed a dominance of sequences from fungi (up to 60%) and metazoans while protists represented less than 12% of the 18S rRNA sequences. Sixty percent of cDNA sequences from beech forest soil and 52% from spruce forest soil had no homologs in the GenBank/EMBL/DDJB protein database. A Gene Ontology term was attributed to 39% and 31.5% of the spruce and beech soil sequences respectively. Altogether 2076 sequences were putative homologs to different enzyme classes participating to 129 KEGG pathways among which several were implicated in the utilisation of soil nutrients such as nitrogen (ammonium, amino acids, oligopeptides), sugars, phosphates and sulfate. Specific annotation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes identified enzymes active on major polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin) and glycoside hydrolases represented 0.5% (beech soil)–0.8% (spruce soil) of the cDNAs. Other sequences coding enzymes active on organic matter (extracellular proteases, lipases, a phytase, P450 monooxygenases) were identified, thus underlining the biotechnological potential of eukaryotic metatranscriptomes. The phylogenetic affiliation of 12 full-length carbohydrate active enzymes showed that most of them were distantly related to sequences from known fungi. For example, a putative GH45 endocellulase was closely associated to molluscan sequences, while a GH7 cellobiohydrolase was closest to crustacean sequences, thus suggesting a potentially significant contribution of non-fungal eukaryotes in the actual hydrolysis of soil organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W2085622189,"Secreted papain-like Cys proteases are important players in plant immunity. We previously reported that the C14 protease of tomato is targeted by cystatin-like EPIC proteins that are secreted by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Pinf) during infection. C14 has been under diversifying selection in wild potato species coevolving with Pinf and reduced C14 levels result in enhanced susceptibility for Pinf. Here, we investigated the role C14-EPIC-like interactions in the natural pathosystem of Arabidopsis with the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). In contrast to the Pinf-solanaceae pathosystem, the C14 orthologous protease of Arabidopsis, RD21, does not evolve under diversifying selection in Arabidopsis, and rd21 null mutants do not show phenotypes upon compatible and incompatible Hpa interactions, despite the evident lack of a major leaf protease. Hpa isolates express highly conserved EPIC-like proteins during infections, but it is unknown if these HpaEPICs can inhibit RD21 and one of these HpaEPICs even lacks the canonical cystatin motifs. The rd21 mutants are unaffected in compatible and incompatible interactions with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, but are significantly more susceptible for the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, demonstrating that RD21 provides immunity to a necrotrophic pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1973730940,"Research on treatments in anorexia nervosa (AN) is scarce. Although most of the therapeutic programs used in 'real world practice' in AN treatment resort to multidisciplinary approaches, they have rarely been evaluated.To compare two multidimensional post-hospitalization outpatients treatment programs for adolescents with severe AN: Treatment as Usual (TAU) versus this treatment plus family therapy (TAU+FT).Sixty female AN adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, were included in a randomized parallel controlled trial conducted from 1999 to 2002 for the recruitment, and until 2004 for the 18 months follow-up. Allocation to one of the two treatment groups (30 in each arm) was randomised. The TAU program included sessions for the patient alone as well as sessions with a psychiatrist for the patient and her parents. The TAU+FT program was identical to the usual one but also included family therapy sessions targeting intra-familial dynamics, but not eating disorder symptoms. The main Outcome Measure was the Morgan and Russell outcome category (Good or Intermediate versus Poor outcome). Secondary outcome indicators included AN symptoms or their consequences (eating symptoms, body mass index, amenorrhea, number of hospitalizations in the course of follow-up, social adjustment). The evaluators, but not participants, were blind to randomization.At 18 months follow-up, we found a significant group effect for the Morgan and Russell outcome category in favor of the program with family therapy (Intention-to-treat: TAU+FT :12/30 (40%); TAU : 5/29 (17.2%) p = 0.05; Per Protocol analysis: respectively 12/26 (46.2%); 4/27 (14.8%), p = 0.01). Similar group effects were observed in terms of achievement of a healthy weight (i.e., BMI≥10(th) percentile) and menstrual status.Adding family therapy sessions, focusing on intra-familial dynamics rather than eating symptomatology, to a multidimensional program improves treatment effectiveness in girls with severe AN.Controlled-trials.com ISRCTN71142875."
https://openalex.org/W2015410192,"Normal aging is associated with impairments in cognition, especially learning and memory. However, major individual differences are known to exist. Using the classical Morris Water Maze (MWM) task, we discriminated a population of 24-months old Long Evans aged rats in two groups--memory-impaired (AI) and memory-unimpaired (AU) in comparison with 6-months old adult animals. AI rats presented deficits in learning, reverse memory and retention. At the molecular level, an increase in metabotropic glutamate receptors 5 (mGluR5) was observed in post-synaptic densities (PSD) in the hippocampus of AU rats after training. Scaffolding Homer 1b/c proteins binding to group 1 mGluR facilitate coupling with its signaling effectors while Homer 1a reduces it. Both Homer 1a and 1b/c levels were up-regulated in the hippocampus PSD of AU animals following MWM task. Using immunohistochemistry we further demonstrated that mGluR5 as well as Homer 1b/c stainings were enhanced in the CA1 hippocampus sub-field of AU animals. In fact mGluR5 and Homer 1 isoforms were more abundant and co-localized in the hippocampal dendrites in AU rats. However, the ratio of Homer 1a/Homer 1b/c bound to mGluR5 in the PSD was four times lower for AU animals compared to AI rats. Consequently, AU animals presented higher PKCγ, ERK, p70S6K, mTOR and CREB activation. Finally the expression of immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1 was shown to be higher in AU rats in accordance with its role in spatial memory consolidation. On the basis of these results, a model of successful cognitive aging with a critical role for mGluR5, Homer 1 proteins and downstream signalling pathways is proposed here."
https://openalex.org/W2166709641,"Background To guide malaria elimination efforts in Swaziland and other countries, accurate assessments of transmission are critical. Pooled-PCR has potential to efficiently improve sensitivity to detect infections; serology may clarify temporal and spatial trends in exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a stratified two-stage cluster, cross-sectional design, subjects were recruited from the malaria endemic region of Swaziland. Blood was collected for rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), pooled PCR, and ELISA detecting antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum surface antigens. Of 4330 participants tested, three were RDT-positive yet false positives by PCR. Pooled PCR led to the identification of one P. falciparum and one P. malariae infection among RDT-negative participants. The P. falciparum-infected participant reported recent travel to Mozambique. Compared to performing individual testing on thousands of samples, PCR pooling reduced labor and consumable costs by 95.5%. Seropositivity was associated with age ≥20 years (11·7% vs 1·9%, P<0.001), recent travel to Mozambique (OR 4.4 [95% CI 1.0–19.0]) and residence in southeast Swaziland (RR 3.78, P<0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of malaria infection and recent exposure in Swaziland are extremely low, suggesting elimination is feasible. Future efforts should address imported malaria and target remaining foci of transmission. Pooled PCR and ELISA are valuable surveillance tools for guiding elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W1994656760,"Influenza virus infection accounts for significant morbidity and mortality world-wide. Interactions of the virus with host cells, particularly those of the macrophage lineage, are thought to contribute to various pathological changes associated with poor patient outcome. Development of new strategies to treat disease therefore requires a detailed understanding of the impact of virus infection upon cellular responses. Here we report that human blood-derived monocytes could be readily infected with the H3N2 influenza virus A/Udorn/72 (Udorn), irrespective of their phenotype (CD14++/CD16−, CD14++/CD16+ or CD14dimCD16++), as determined by multi-colour flow cytometry for viral haemagglutinin (HA) expression and cell surface markers 8–16 hours post infection. Monocytes are relatively resistant to influenza-induced cell death early in infection, as approximately 20% of cells showed influenza-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Infection of monocytes with Udorn also induced the release of IL-6, IL-8, TNFα and IP-10, suggesting that NS1 protein of Udorn does not (effectively) inhibit this host defence response in human monocytes. Comparative analysis of human monocyte-derived macrophages (Mph) demonstrated greater susceptibility to human influenza virus than monocytes, with the majority of both pro-inflammatory Mph1 and anti-inflammatory/regulatory Mph2 cells expressing viral HA after infection with Udorn. Influenza infection of macrophages also induced cytokine and chemokine production. However, both Mph1 and Mph2 phenotypes released comparable amounts of TNFα, IL-12p40 and IP-10 after infection with H3N2, in marked contrast to differential responses to LPS-stimulation. In addition, we found that influenza virus infection augmented the capacity of poorly phagocytic Mph1 cells to phagocytose apoptotic cells by a mechanism that was independent of either IL-10 or the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase/Protein S pathway. In summary, our data reveal that influenza virus infection of human macrophages causes functional alterations that may impact on the process of resolution of inflammation, with implications for viral clearance and lung pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2062106419,"Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS) is due to the clonogenic loss of crypt cells and villi depopulation, resulting in disruption of mucosal barrier, bacterial invasion, inflammation and sepsis. Intestinal macrophages could recognize invading bacterial DNA via TLR9 receptors and transmit regenerative signals to the neighboring crypt. We therefore investigated whether systemic administration of designer TLR9 agonist could ameliorate RIGS by activating TLR9.Male C57Bl6 mice were distributed in four experimental cohorts, whole body irradiation (WBI) (8.4-10.4 Gy), TLR9 agonist (1 mg/kg s.c.), 1 h pre- or post-WBI and TLR9 agonist+WBI+iMyd88 (pretreatment with inhibitory peptide against Myd88). Animals were observed for survival and intestine was harvested for histological analysis. BALB/c mice with CT26 colon tumors in abdominal wall were irradiated with 14 Gy single dose of whole abdominal irradiation (AIR) for tumor growth study.Mice receiving pre-WBI TLR9 agonist demonstrated improvement of survival after 10.4 Gy (p<0.03), 9.4 Gy (p<0.008) and 8.4 Gy (p<0.002) of WBI, compared to untreated or iMyd88-treated controls. Post-WBI TLR9 agonist mitigates up to 8.4 Gy WBI (p<0.01). Histological analysis and xylose absorption test demonstrated significant structural and functional restitution of the intestine in WBI+TLR9 agonist cohorts. Although, AIR reduced tumor growth, all animals died within 12 days from RIGS. TLR9 agonist improved the survival of mice beyond 28 days post-AIR (p<0.008) with significant reduction of tumor growth (p<0.0001).TLR9 agonist treatment could serve both as a prophylactic or mitigating agent against acute radiation syndrome and also as an adjuvant therapy to increase the therapeutic ratio of abdominal Radiation Therapy for Gastro Intestinal malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2067638175,"The classic organization of a gene structure has followed the Jacob and Monod bacterial gene model proposed more than 50 years ago. Since then, empirical determinations of the complexity of the transcriptomes found in yeast to human has blurred the definition and physical boundaries of genes. Using multiple analysis approaches we have characterized individual gene boundaries mapping on human chromosomes 21 and 22. Analyses of the locations of the 5′ and 3′ transcriptional termini of 492 protein coding genes revealed that for 85% of these genes the boundaries extend beyond the current annotated termini, most often connecting with exons of transcripts from other well annotated genes. The biological and evolutionary importance of these chimeric transcripts is underscored by (1) the non-random interconnections of genes involved, (2) the greater phylogenetic depth of the genes involved in many chimeric interactions, (3) the coordination of the expression of connected genes and (4) the close in vivo and three dimensional proximity of the genomic regions being transcribed and contributing to parts of the chimeric RNAs. The non-random nature of the connection of the genes involved suggest that chimeric transcripts should not be studied in isolation, but together, as an RNA network."
https://openalex.org/W2072982271,"The kinase MARK2/Par-1 plays key roles in several cell processes, including neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer disease by phosphorylating tau and detaching it from microtubules. In search of interaction partners of MARK2, we identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), which is important for the survival of neurons and whose mutations are linked to familial Parkinson disease (PD). MARK2 phosphorylated and activated the cleaved form of PINK1 (ΔN-PINK1; amino acids 156-581). Thr-313 was the primary phosphorylation site, a residue mutated to a non-phosphorylatable form (T313M) in a frequent variant of PD. Mutation of Thr-313 to Met or Glu in PINK1 showed toxic effects with abnormal mitochondrial distribution in neurons. MARK2 and PINK1 were found to colocalize with mitochondria and regulate their transport. ΔN-PINK1 promoted anterograde transport and increased the fraction of stationary mitochondria, whereas full-length PINK1 promoted retrograde transport. In both cases, MARK2 enhanced the effects. The results identify MARK2 as an upstream regulator of PINK1 and ΔN-PINK1 and provide insights into the regulation of mitochondrial trafficking in neurons and neurodegeneration in PD."

Autoimmune diseases: MIF as a therapeutic target.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2010; 14: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In summary, MIF has emerged in recent years as an attractive new target for treating diseases with a high unmet need, such as sepsis, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammation. We therefore set out to develop fully human antibodies specific for MIF and to screen for antibodies with high in vivo therapeutic potential. The cDNAs of human MIF (huMIF) and mouse MIF (moMIF) were generated from poly(A) RNA obtained from human (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) or mouse (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) liver by reverse transcription. The MIF-encoding genes were amplified and cloned into the pET16b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using standard techniques. Recombinant huMIF or moMIF was expressed after transformation of the respective vector into Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) as described (4.Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Purification, bioactivity, and secondary structure analysis of mouse and human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Recombinant MIF was purified after lysing the cells and removing cell debris either with a refolding step (4.Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Purification, bioactivity, and secondary structure analysis of mouse and human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) or without a refolding step (38.Sun H.W. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution of human macrophage migration inhibitory factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5191-9196Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as described previously. Both purification methods yielded equivalent products. Biotinylation of recombinant MIF was carried out using an ECL protein biotinylation kit (GE Healthcare). Biotinylated MIF-derived peptides (see Fig. 1) were synthesized by Jerini AG (Berlin, Germany). The Dyax FAB310 library (39.Hoet R.M. Cohen E.H. Kent R.B. Rookey K. Schoonbroodt S. Hogan S. Rem L.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) was used for selection of MIF binders in nine different selection campaigns. In the first campaign, phage were selected on biotinylated huMIF immobilized on streptavidin beads. The second campaign used huMIF coated onto MaxiSorp ELISA plates (NUNC A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). In the third campaign, selection was carried out by alternating biotinylated moMIF and biotinylated huMIF. In six additional campaigns, selection was performed by alternating a biotinylated MIF-derived peptide (see Fig. 1) and biotinylated huMIF. 1000 clones from each campaign were randomly selected after three or four panning rounds of amplification and then tested for binding to huMIF by phage ELISA as described (39.Hoet R.M.

Fully human IgGs were expressed in HEK293T cells (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) after transfection of the cells using GeneJuice reagent (Novagen). Transfected cells were cultivated for 3 weeks in DMEM supplemented with 10% ultra low IgG fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 0.1% gentamycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), during which the medium was renewed twice a week, and the conditioned medium was pooled. Antibodies were purified from the cell culture supernatant by purification over protein A (GE Healthcare) and dialyzed against PBS (Invitrogen). Each of the six MIF-derived peptides (see Fig. 1) was diluted in coupling buffer (NUNC A/S) to give a peptide concentration of typically 5 μg/ml and was added to microplates (NUNC ImmobilizerTM F96 clear amino plates). huMIF and PBS were applied as controls, and the plates were incubated overnight. After the plates had been washed, the anti-MIF antibodies (4 μg/ml in PBS) were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. After further washing, HRP-labeled Fc-specific anti-human IgG (Sigma) was added. The plates were incubated and washed, and bound anti-MIF antibody was detected by adding 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Sigma) and stopping the reaction by adding H2SO4 after 30 min. Plates were measured at 450 nm. The inhibition of the GC-overriding activity of MIF was tested using a modification of the assay described previously (19.Nguyen M.T. Beck J. Lue H. Fünfzig H.

THP-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC TIB-202) and cultivated according to the supplier's recommendations. Exponentially growing THP-1 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium to a cell density of 106 cells/ml. This culture was transferred into the wells of a 96-well microplate, and anti-MIF antibodies were added. The final concentration of the antibody for screening purposes was 75 μg/ml (500 nm), and increasing amounts of antibody were used (typically 0.5–30 nm) to determine a dose-response curve. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, dexamethasone (Sigma) was added to give a final concentration of 2 nm. O111:B4 LPS (Sigma) was added after an additional 1 h to give a final concentration of 3 ng/ml, and after an additional 6 h of incubation, the supernatant was harvested, and the IL-6 concentrations were determined using a human IL-6 CytoSetTM ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the mean was used for further evaluations. This assay was done as described previously (6.Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R.

Briefly, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1658) and cultivated according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells (1000/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate with medium containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria) for 3 days at 37 °C. Cells were then starved overnight at 37 °C by incubation in medium containing 0.5% calf serum. The 0.5% serum-containing medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium containing 10% calf serum, 75 μg/ml antibody, and 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare). After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and a 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution was added. The plates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and washed with PBS, after which 75 μl of a 0.5 m NaOH solution with 0.5% SDS were added per well. These 75-μl samples were added to 5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and measured in a β-counter. Each determination was done in triplicates, and the mean was used for further calculations. The antibodies were tested for inhibition of tautomerase activity using a modification of the assay described by Bendrat et al. (17.Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N.

Briefly, equal volumes of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (0.6 mg/ml) and potassium periodate (1 mg/ml) were mixed to obtain l-dopachrome methyl ester. Recombinant huMIF and the anti-MIF antibody were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and preincubated. 2 μl of the preincubated mixture containing 50 ng of huMIF and 600 ng of anti-MIF antibody were added to the wells of a 96-well plate, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of l-dopachrome methyl ester. The decrease in absorbance was measured at 490 nm for 3 min. A BiacoreTM T200 device and evaluation software (version 1.0), sensor chips, buffer, and reagents were obtained from GE Healthcare. huMIF or moMIF was immobilized onto C1 sensor chips by amine coupling to give a loading density of 1 response unit. Anti-MIF antibodies were injected at a concentration range of typically 0.625–10 nm (diluted in HEPES-buffered saline containing EDTA and 0.5% (v/v) Surfactant P20). After each cycle, the chip was regenerated with 10 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 1.7). Affinity constants were calculated according to the 1:1 Langmuir model. The experiments were performed as described (40.Le Roy D. Di Padova F. Tees R. Lengacher S. Landmann R. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Heumann D.

https://openalex.org/W1986373644,"Despite the importance of trophic interactions between organisms, and the relationship between primary production and benthic diversity, there have been few studies that have quantified the carbon flow from pelagic to benthic environments as a result of the assemblage level activity of suspension-feeding organisms. In this study, we examine the feeding activity of seven common sponge species from the Taputeranga marine reserve on the south coast of Wellington in New Zealand. We analysed the diet composition, feeding efficiency, pumping rates, and the number of food particles (specifically picoplanktonic prokaryotic cells) retained by sponges. We used this information, combined with abundance estimates of the sponges and estimations of the total amount of food available to sponges in a known volume of water (89,821 m3), to estimate: (1) particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes through sponges as a result of their suspension-feeding activities on picoplankton; and (2) the proportion of the available POC from picoplankton that sponges consume. The most POC acquired by the sponges was from non-photosynthetic bacterial cells (ranging from 0.09 to 4.69 g C d−1 with varying sponge percentage cover from 0.5 to 5%), followed by Prochlorococcus (0.07 to 3.47 g C d−1) and then Synechococcus (0.05 to 2.34 g C d−1) cells. Depending on sponge abundance, the amount of POC that sponges consumed as a proportion of the total POC available was 0.2–12.1% for Bac, 0.4–21.3% for Prochlo, and 0.3–15.8% for Synecho. The flux of POC for the whole sponge assemblage, based on the consumption of prokaryotic picoplankton, ranged from 0.07–3.50 g C m2 d−1. This study is the first to estimate the contribution of a sponge assemblage (rather than focusing on individual sponge species) to POC flow from three groups of picoplankton in a temperate rocky reef through the feeding activity of sponges and demonstrates the importance of sponges to energy flow in rocky reef environments."
https://openalex.org/W2037532481,"Background Lipoprotein receptors from the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family are multifunctional membrane proteins which can efficiently mediate endocytosis and thereby facilitate lipoprotein clearance from the plasma. The biggest member of this family, the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), facilitates the hepatic uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) via interaction with apolipoprotein E (apoE). In contrast to the classical LDL degradation pathway, TRL disintegrate in peripheral endosomes, and core lipids and apoB are targeted along the endocytic pathway for lysosomal degradation. Notably, TRL-derived apoE remains within recycling endosomes and is then mobilized by high density lipoproteins (HDL) for re-secretion. The aim of this study is to investigate the involvement of LRP1 in the regulation of apoE recycling. Principal Findings Immunofluorescence studies indicate the LRP1-dependent trapping of apoE in EEA1-positive endosomes in human hepatoma cells. This processing is distinct from other LRP1 ligands such as RAP which is efficiently targeted to lysosomal compartments. Upon stimulation of HDL-induced recycling, apoE is released from LRP1-positive endosomes but is targeted to another, distinct population of early endosomes that contain HDL, but not LRP1. For subsequent analysis of the recycling capacity, we expressed the full-length human LRP1 and used an RNA interference approach to manipulate the expression levels of LRP1. In support of LRP1 determining the intracellular fate of apoE, overexpression of LRP1 significantly stimulated HDL-induced apoE recycling. Vice versa LRP1 knockdown in HEK293 cells and primary hepatocytes strongly reduced the efficiency of HDL to stimulate apoE secretion. Conclusion We conclude that LRP1 enables apoE to accumulate in an early endosomal recycling compartment that serves as a pool for the intracellular formation and subsequent re-secretion of apoE-enriched HDL particles."
https://openalex.org/W2084789425,"In Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) increased activation of the primary motor cortex (M1) before and during movement execution followed by increased inhibition after movement termination was reported. The present study aimed at investigating, whether this activation pattern is due to altered functional interaction between motor cortical areas.10 GTS-patients and 10 control subjects performed a self-paced finger movement task while neuromagnetic brain activity was recorded using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Cerebro-cerebral coherence as a measure of functional interaction was calculated. During movement preparation and execution coherence between contralateral M1 and supplementary motor area (SMA) was significantly increased at beta-frequency in GTS-patients. After movement termination no significant differences between groups were evident.The present data suggest that increased M1 activation in GTS-patients might be due to increased functional interaction between SMA and M1 most likely reflecting a pathophysiological marker of GTS. The data extend previous findings of motor-cortical alterations in GTS by showing that local activation changes are associated with alterations of functional networks between premotor and primary motor areas. Interestingly enough, alterations were evident during preparation and execution of voluntary movements, which implies a general theme of increased motor-cortical interaction in GTS."
https://openalex.org/W2021531572,"Trypanosoma cruzi elicits reactive oxygen species (ROS) of inflammatory and mitochondrial origin in infected hosts. In this study, we examined ROS-induced oxidative modifications in the heart and determined whether the resultant oxidized cardiac proteins are targets of immune response and of pathological significance in Chagas disease. Heart biopsies from chagasic mice, rats and human patients exhibited, when compared to those from normal controls, a substantial increase in protein 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) adducts. To evaluate whether oxidized proteins gain antigenic properties, heart homogenates or isolated cardiomyocytes were oxidized in vitro and one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE)/Western blotting (WB) was performed to investigate the proteomic oxidative changes and recognition of oxidized proteins by sera antibodies in chagasic rodents (mice, rats) and human patients. Human cardiomyocytes exhibited LD50 sensitivity to 30 µM 4-HNE and 100 µM H2O2 at 6 h and 12 h, respectively. In vitro oxidation with 4-HNE or H2O2 resulted in a substantial increase in 4-HNE- and carbonyl-modified proteins that correlated with increased recognition of cardiac (cardiomyocytes) proteins by sera antibodies of chagasic rodents and human patients. 2D-GE/Western blotting followed by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis to identify cardiac proteins that were oxidized and recognized by human chagasic sera yielded 82 unique proteins. We validated the 2D-GE results by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and WB and demonstrated that oxidation of recombinant titin enhanced its immunogenicity and recognition by sera antibodies from chagasic hosts (rats and humans). Treatment of infected rats with phenyl-α-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, antioxidant) resulted in normalized immune detection of cardiac proteins associated with control of cardiac pathology and preservation of heart contractile function in chagasic rats. We conclude that ROS-induced, cardiac-oxidized antigens are targets of immune recognition by antibodies and molecular determinants for pathogenesis during Chagas disease."

For the evaluation of new tools and to further our understanding of host-parasite interactions, knowing the environmental risk of transmission--even at a very local scale--is essential. The aim of this study was to assess how malaria transmission is influenced and can be predicted by local climatic and environmental factors.As the entomological part of a cohort study of 650 newborn babies in nine villages in the Tori Bossito district of Southern Benin between June 2007 and February 2010, human landing catches were performed to assess the density of malaria vectors and transmission intensity. Climatic factors as well as household characteristics were recorded throughout the study. Statistical correlations between Anopheles density and environmental and climatic factors were tested using a three-level Poisson mixed regression model. The results showed both temporal variations in vector density (related to season and rainfall), and spatial variations at the level of both village and house. These spatial variations could be largely explained by factors associated with the house's immediate surroundings, namely soil type, vegetation index and the proximity of a watercourse. Based on these results, a predictive regression model was developed using a leave-one-out method, to predict the spatiotemporal variability of malaria transmission in the nine villages.This study points up the importance of local environmental factors in malaria transmission and describes a model to predict the transmission risk of individual children, based on environmental and behavioral characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2042580454,"Behavioral lateralization has been documented in many vertebrates. The scale-eating cichlid fish Perissodus microlepis is well known for exhibiting lateral dimorphism in its mouth morphology and lateralized behavior in robbing scales from prey fish. A previous field study indicated that this mouth asymmetry closely correlates with the side on which prey is attacked, but details of this species' predation behavior have not been previously analyzed because of the rapidity of the movements. Here, we studied scale-eating behavior in cichlids in a tank through high-speed video monitoring and quantitative assessment of behavioral laterality and kinematics. The fish observed showed a clear bias toward striking on one side, which closely correlated with their asymmetric mouth morphologies. Furthermore, the maximum angular velocity and amplitude of body flexion were significantly larger during attacks on the preferred side compared to those on the nonpreferred side, permitting increased predation success. In contrast, no such lateral difference in movement elements was observed in acoustically evoked flexion during the escape response, which is similar to flexion during scale eating and suggests that they share a common motor control pathway. Thus the neuronal circuits controlling body flexion during scale eating may be functionally lateralized upstream of this common motor pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2057419689,Cell proliferation in primary and metastatic tumors is a fundamental characteristic of advanced breast cancer. Further understanding of the mechanism underlying enhanced cell growth will be important in identifying novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a critical event in growth regulation of breast cancer cells. We found that phosphorylation of PCNA at tyrosine 211 (Y211) enhanced its association with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl. We further demonstrated that c-Abl facilitates chromatin association of PCNA and is required for nuclear foci formation of PCNA in cells stressed by DNA damage as well as in unperturbed cells. Targeting Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA with a cell-permeable peptide inhibited the phosphorylation and reduced the PCNA-Abl interaction. These results show that PCNA signal transduction has an important impact on the growth regulation of breast cancer cells.
https://openalex.org/W2074050833,"Dopamine neurotransmission influences approach toward rewards and reward-related cues. The best cited interpretation of this effect proposes that dopamine mediates the pleasure that commonly accompanies reward. This hypothesis has received support in some animal models and a few studies in humans. However, direct assessments of the effect of transiently increasing dopamine neurotransmission have been largely limited to the use of psychostimulant drugs, which elevate brain levels of multiple neurotransmitters in addition to dopamine. In the present study we tested the effect of more selectively elevating dopamine neurotransmission, as produced by administration of the immediate dopamine precursor, L-DOPA (0, 100/25, 200/50 mg, Sinemet), in healthy human volunteers. Neither dose altered positive mood. The results suggest that dopamine neurotransmission does not directly influence positive mood in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2160448505,"Pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a unique opportunity to collectively evaluate genetic variants with effects that are too small to be detected individually. We applied a pathway analysis to a bladder cancer GWAS containing data from 3,532 cases and 5,120 controls of European background (n = 5 studies). Thirteen hundred and ninety-nine pathways were drawn from five publicly available resources (Biocarta, Kegg, NCI-PID, HumanCyc, and Reactome), and we constructed 22 additional candidate pathways previously hypothesized to be related to bladder cancer. In total, 1421 pathways, 5647 genes and ∼90,000 SNPs were included in our study. Logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, study, DNA source, and smoking status was used to assess the marginal trend effect of SNPs on bladder cancer risk. Two complementary pathway-based methods (gene-set enrichment analysis [GSEA], and adapted rank-truncated product [ARTP]) were used to assess the enrichment of association signals within each pathway. Eighteen pathways were detected by either GSEA or ARTP at P≤0.01. To minimize false positives, we used the I2 statistic to identify SNPs displaying heterogeneous effects across the five studies. After removing these SNPs, seven pathways (‘Aromatic amine metabolism’ [PGSEA = 0.0100, PARTP = 0.0020], ‘NAD biosynthesis’ [PGSEA = 0.0018, PARTP = 0.0086], ‘NAD salvage’ [PARTP = 0.0068], ‘Clathrin derived vesicle budding’ [PARTP = 0.0018], ‘Lysosome vesicle biogenesis’ [PGSEA = 0.0023, PARTP<0.00012], ’Retrograde neurotrophin signaling’ [PGSEA = 0.00840], and ‘Mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition’ [PGSEA = 0.0040]) remained. These pathways seem to belong to three fundamental cellular processes (metabolic detoxification, mitosis, and clathrin-mediated vesicles). Identification of the aromatic amine metabolism pathway provides support for the ability of this approach to identify pathways with established relevance to bladder carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004715375,"B7-H4 is a newly identified B7 homolog that plays an important role in maintaining T-cell homeostasis by inhibiting T-cell proliferation and lymphokine-secretion. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathways inhibited by B7-H4 engagement in mouse T cells. We found that treatment of CD3(+) T cells with a B7-H4.Ig fusion protein inhibits anti-CD3 elicited T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 signaling events, including phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, ERK, p38, and JNK. B7-H4.Ig treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT kinase and impaired its kinase activity as assessed by the phosphorylation of its endogenous substrate GSK-3. Expression of IL-2 is also reduced by B7-H4. In contrast, the phosphorylation state of the TCR proximal tyrosine kinases ZAP70 and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) are not affected by B7-H4 ligation. These results indicate that B7-H4 inhibits T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production through interfering with activation of ERK, JNK, and AKT, but not of ZAP70 or LCK."
https://openalex.org/W1980293493,"Man(α1-6)[GlcNAc(β1-2)Man(α1-3)]ManGlcNAc(2) is a key branch point intermediate in the insect N-glycosylation pathway because it can be either trimmed by a processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (FDL) to produce paucimannosidic N-glycans or elongated by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GNT-II) to produce complex N-glycans. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GNT-I) contributes to branch point intermediate production and can potentially reverse the FDL trimming reaction. However, there has been no concerted effort to evaluate the relationships among these three enzymes in any single insect system. Hence, we extended our previous studies on Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) FDL to include GNT-I and -II. Sf-GNT-I and -II cDNAs were isolated, the predicted protein sequences were analyzed, and both gene products were expressed and their acceptor substrate specificities and intracellular localizations were determined. Sf-GNT-I transferred N-acetylglucosamine to Man(5)GlcNAc(2), Man(3)GlcNAc(2), and GlcNAc(β1-2)Man(α1-6)[Man(α1-3)]ManGlcNAc(2), demonstrating its role in branch point intermediate production and its ability to reverse FDL trimming. Sf-GNT-II only transferred N-acetylglucosamine to Man(α1-6)[GlcNAc(β1-2)Man(α1-3)]ManGlcNAc(2), demonstrating that it initiates complex N-glycan production, but cannot use Man(3)GlcNAc(2) to produce hybrid or complex structures. Fluorescently tagged Sf-GNT-I and -II co-localized with an endogenous Sf Golgi marker and Sf-FDL co-localized with Sf-GNT-I and -II, indicating that all three enzymes are Golgi resident proteins. Unexpectedly, fluorescently tagged Drosophila melanogaster FDL also co-localized with Sf-GNT-I and an endogenous Drosophila Golgi marker, indicating that it is a Golgi resident enzyme in insect cells. Thus, the substrate specificities and physical juxtapositioning of GNT-I, GNT-II, and FDL support the idea that these enzymes function at the N-glycan processing branch point and are major factors determining the net outcome of the insect cell N-glycosylation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2033303989,"Background In the course of evolution butterflies and moths developed two different reproductive behaviors. Whereas butterflies rely on visual stimuli for mate location, moths use the ‘female calling plus male seduction’ system, in which females release long-range sex pheromones to attract conspecific males. There are few exceptions from this pattern but in all cases known female moths possess sex pheromone glands which apparently have been lost in female butterflies. In the day-flying moth family Castniidae (“butterfly-moths”), which includes some important crop pests, no pheromones have been found so far. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a multidisciplinary approach we described the steps involved in the courtship of P. archon, showing that visual cues are the only ones used for mate location; showed that the morphology and fine structure of the antennae of this moth are strikingly similar to those of butterflies, with male sensilla apparently not suited to detect female-released long range pheromones; showed that its females lack pheromone-producing glands, and identified three compounds as putative male sex pheromone (MSP) components of P. archon, released from the proximal halves of male forewings and hindwings. Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence for the first time in Lepidoptera that females of a moth do not produce any pheromone to attract males, and that mate location is achieved only visually by patrolling males, which may release a pheromone at short distance, putatively a mixture of Z,E-farnesal, E,E-farnesal, and (E,Z)-2,13-octadecadienol. The outlined behavior, long thought to be unique to butterflies, is likely to be widespread in Castniidae implying a novel, unparalleled butterfly-like reproductive behavior in moths. This will also have practical implications in applied entomology since it signifies that the monitoring/control of castniid pests should not be based on the use of female-produced pheromones, as it is usually done in many moths."
https://openalex.org/W2055949541,"Substantial increases in height have occurred concurrently with economic development in most populations during the last century. In high-income countries, environmental exposures that can limit genetic growth potential appear to have lessened, and variation in height by socioeconomic position may have diminished. The objective of this study is to investigate inequalities in height in a cohort of children born in the early 1990s in England, and to evaluate which factors might explain any identified inequalities.12,830 children from The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population based cohort from birth to about 11.5 years of age, were used in this analysis. Gender- and age-specific z-scores of height at different ages were used as outcome variables. Multilevel models were used to take into account the repeated measures of height and to analyze gender- and age-specific relative changes in height from birth to 11.5 years. Maternal education was the main exposure variable used to examine socioeconomic inequalities. The roles of parental and family characteristics in explaining any observed differences between maternal education and child height were investigated. Children whose mothers had the highest education compared to those with none or a basic level of education, were 0.39 cm longer at birth (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.48). These differences persisted and at 11.5 years the height difference was 1.4 cm (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.74). Several other factors were related to offspring height, but few changed the relationship with maternal education. The one exception was mid-parental height, which fully accounted for the maternal educational differences in offspring height.In a cohort of children born in the 1990s, mothers with higher education gave birth to taller boys and girls. Although height differences were small they persisted throughout childhood. Maternal and paternal height fully explained these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2018702819,"AOC3 is highly expressed in adipocytes and smooth muscle cells, but its function in these cells is currently unknown. The in vivo substrate(s) of AOC3 is/are also unknown, but could provide an invaluable clue to the enzyme's function. Expression of untagged, soluble human AOC3 in insect cells provides a relatively simple means of obtaining pure enzyme. Characterization of enzyme indicates a 6% titer for the active site 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor and corrected k(cat) values as high as 7 s(-1). Substrate kinetic profiling shows that the enzyme accepts a variety of primary amines with different chemical features, including nonphysiological branched-chain and aliphatic amines, with measured k(cat)/K(m) values between 10(2) and 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). K(m)(O(2)) approximates the partial pressure of oxygen found in the interstitial space. Comparison of the properties of purified murine to human enzyme indicates k(cat)/K(m) values that are within 3 to 4-fold, with the exception of methylamine and aminoacetone that are ca. 10-fold more active with human AOC3. With drug development efforts investigating AOC3 as an anti-inflammatory target, these studies suggest that caution is called for when screening the efficacy of inhibitors designed against human enzymes in non-transgenic mouse models. Differentiated murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes show a uniform distribution of AOC3 on the cell surface and whole cell K(m) values that are reasonably close to values measured using purified enzymes. The latter studies support a relevance of the kinetic parameters measured with isolated AOC3 variants to adipocyte function. From our studies, a number of possible substrates with relatively high k(cat)/K(m) have been discovered, including dopamine and cysteamine, which may implicate a role for adipocyte AOC3 in insulin-signaling and fatty acid metabolism, respectively. Finally, the demonstrated AOC3 turnover of primary amines that are non-native to human tissue suggests possible roles for the adipocyte enzyme in subcutaneous bacterial infiltration and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1966538268,"Ficolins are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system. H-ficolin is found in plasma associated with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs). When H-ficolin binds to microorganisms the MASPs are activated, which in turn activate the complement system. H-ficolin is the most abundant ficolin in humans, yet its ligand binding characteristics and biological role remain obscure. We examined the binding of H-ficolin to Aerococcus viridans as well as to a more defined artificial target, i.e. acetylated bovine serum albumin. A strict dependence for calcium ions and inhibition at high NaCl concentration was found. The binding to acetylated bovine serum albumin was inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid and sodium acetate as well as by N-acetylated glucosamine and galactosamine (GlcNAc and GalNAc) and glycine (GlyNAc). The binding to A. viridans was sensitive to the same compounds, but, importantly, higher concentrations were needed for inhibition. N-Acetylated cysteine was also inhibitory, but this inhibition was parallel with reduction in the oligomerization of H-ficolin and thus represents structural changes of the molecule. Based on our findings, we developed a procedure for the purification of H-ficolin from serum, involving PEG precipitation, affinity chromatography on Sepharose derivatized with acetylated serum albumin, ion exchange chromatography, and gel permeation chromatography. The purified H-ficolin was observed to elute at 700 kDa, similar to what we find for H-ficolin in whole serum. MASP-2 was co-purified with H-ficolin, and the purified H-ficolin·MASP-2 complex could activate complement as measured by cleavage of complement factor C4. This study extends our knowledge of the specificity of this pattern recognition molecule, and the purified product will enable further studies."

The unusual high iron content of MSR-1 makes it a useful model for studying biological mechanisms of iron uptake and homeostasis. The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein plays a key role in maintaining iron homeostasis in many bacteria. We identified and characterized a fur-homologous gene (MGR_1314) in MSR-1. MGR_1314 was able to complement a fur mutant of E. coli in iron-responsive manner in vivo. We constructed a fur mutant strain of MSR-1. In comparison to wild-type MSR-1, the mutant strain had lower magnetosome formation, and was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and streptonigrin, indicating higher intracellular free iron content. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that Fur protein directly regulates expression of several key genes involved in iron transport and oxygen metabolism, in addition it also functions in magnetosome formation in M. gryphiswaldense."

As such, individuals are prepared to deal with fluctuations in the quantity and quality of ice in their breeding areas. It remains unclear, however, how shifts in climate may affect seal populations. The present study assesses the effects of climate change on harp seals through three linked analyses. First, we tested the effects of short-term climate variability on young-of-the year harp seal mortality using a linear regression of sea ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence against stranding rates of dead harp seals in the region during 1992 to 2010. A similar regression of stranding rates and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index values was also conducted. These analyses revealed negative correlations between both ice cover and NAO conditions and seal mortality, indicating that lighter ice cover and lower NAO values result in higher mortality. A retrospective cross-correlation analysis of NAO conditions and sea ice cover from 1978 to 2011 revealed that NAO-related changes in sea ice may have contributed to the depletion of seals on the east coast of Canada during 1950 to 1972, and to their recovery during 1973 to 2000. This historical retrospective also reveals opposite links between neonatal mortality in harp seals in the Northeast Atlantic and NAO phase. Finally, an assessment of the long-term trends in sea ice cover in the breeding regions of harp seals across the entire North Atlantic during 1979 through 2011 using multiple linear regression models and mixed effects linear regression models revealed that sea ice cover in all harp seal breeding regions has been declining by as much as 6 percent per decade over the time series of available satellite data."

We utilize the charge compensatory effect of ionic liquid [bmim]BF4 in conjunction with ethylene glycol for providing electro-steric stabilization to copper nanoparticles prepared from copper sulphate using hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent. The formed copper nanoparticles showed extended stability over a period of one year. Copper nanoparticles thus prepared were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (pXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and quasi elastic light scattering (QELS) techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) analysis revealed relevant Bragg's reflection for crystal structure of copper. Powder X-ray diffraction plots also revealed no oxidized material of copper nanoparticles. TEM showed nearly uniform distribution of the particles in methanol and confirmed by QELS. Typical applications of copper nanoparticles include uses in conductive films, lubrication and nanofluids. Currently efforts are under way in our laboratory for using these nanoparticles as catalysts for a variety of organic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2078154375,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) plays a key role in protein synthesis and in its control. It comprises five different subunits, α-ϵ, of which eIF2Bϵ contains the catalytic domain. Formation of the complete complex is crucial for full activity and proper control of eIF2B. Mutations in the genes for eIF2B cause an often severe neurological disorder, “vanishing white matter.” eIF2Bγ and eIF2Bϵ contain homologous and conserved domains with sequence similarity to nucleotidyl transferases (NTs) and acyl transferases and can form a binary complex. The latter contain a hexad repeat that mainly comprises isoleucyl residues (hence termed the “I-patch” region). These data reveal that certain residues in the NT domains of eIF2Bγ/ϵ, which are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, play key roles in the interactions between subunits in the eIF2B complex. Our data show that the I-patch regions are important in the interactions between the catalytic eIF2Bγϵ complex and the other subunits. We also studied the functional effects of vanishing white matter mutations in the NT and I-patch domains. Lastly, our data show that eIF2Bγ promotes the expression of eIF2Bϵ, providing a mechanism for achieving correct stoichiometry of these eIF2B subunits in the cell."

We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes."

In addition, inherited mutations in eIF2B cause a fatal leukoencephalopathy. Here we describe experiments examining domains of eIF2Bγ and ε that both share sequence and predicted tertiary structure similarity with a family of phospho-hexose sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases. Firstly, using a genetic approach, we find no evidence to support a significant role for a potential nucleotide-binding region within the pyrophosphorylase-like domain (PLD) of eIF2Bε for nucleotide exchange. These findings are at odds with one mechanism for nucleotide exchange proposed previously. By using a series of constructs and a co-expression and precipitation strategy, we find that the eIF2Bε and -γ PLDs and a shared second domain predicted to form a left-handed β helix are all critical for interprotein interactions between eIF2B subunits necessary for eIF2B complex formation. We have identified extensive interactions between the PLDs and left-handed β helix domains that form the eIF2Bγε subcomplex and propose a model for domain interactions between eIF2B subunits."

IELs were studied by multimarker two-colour immunofluorescence in situ staining. Consecutive duodenal biopsies were obtained from advanced infection-prone HIV+ patients (n = 30). The systemic adaptive immune status was monitored by determining T-cell subsets and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood. The γδ IEL ratio (median 14.5%, range 1.5–56.3%) was significantly increased (p<0.02) compared with that in clinically healthy HIV− control subjects (n = 11, median 2.8%; range 0.3–38%), although the number of γδ IELs per mucosal length unit (U) only tended to be increased (4.0/U in HIV+ versus 3.2/U in HIV−subjects). Notably, the total number of CD3+ IELs was significantly reduced in AIDS (p<0.0001, 39.6/U in HIV+ versus 86.4/U in HIV− subjects). Almost 100% of the γδ IELs were CD8− and they often expressed the Vδ1/Jδ1-encoded epitope (median 65.2%). HIV+ patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy only tended to have a lower ratio of γδ IELs (median 12.8%) than those receiving no treatment (median 14.3%) or 1 nucleoside analogue (NA) (median 23.5%) or 2 NAs (median 13.0%). This minimal variation among therapy groups, contrasting the treatment response of systemic and local adaptive immunity, harmonizes with the novel idea derived from animal experiments that γδ T cells are largely innate cells in first-line microbial defence."

IntroductionLeishmania donovani is the etiologic agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a devastating and invariably fatal disease if untreated. L. donovani, like all Leishmania species, is a digenetic parasite that exists as flagellated extracellular promastigotes in the phlebotomine sandfly vector and as immotile intracellular amastigotes within phagolysosomes of macrophages and reticuloendothelial cells of the infected mammalian host (supplemental Fig. 1). There is no effective vaccine against leishmaniasis, and the armamentarium of antileishmanial drugs is far from ideal. These drugs are expensive, toxic, and cumbersome to administer, and the emergence of drug resistance renders these therapeutic protocols too often ineffective (1.Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Leishmaniasis. Current chemotherapy and recent advances in the search for novel drugs.Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2.Croft S.L. Sundar S.

Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, the exigency for new drugs, as well as new drug targets, is acute. The development of rational, selective, and effective anti-parasitic drug therapies depends upon the exploitation of fundamental biochemical and/or metabolic disparities between parasite and host. Possibly the most striking metabolic discrepancy between Leishmania and their mammalian hosts is the pathway for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. Leishmania, like all protozoan parasites studied to date, cannot synthesize the purine ring de novo (4.Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J.

Consequently, each genus of parasite expresses a unique complement of nutritionally indispensable salvage and interconversion enzymes that enable the acquisition of host purines.The purine pathway of Leishmania is particularly convoluted and capable of incorporating virtually any purine nucleobase or nucleoside from the culture medium or host environment into the parasite nucleotide pool (4.Marr J.J.

The parasite accommodates the following four enzymes that can convert preformed host purines to the nucleotide level: 1) hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) 2The abbreviations used are: HGPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferaseXPRTxanthine phosphoribosyltransferaseAPRTadenine phosphoribosyltransferaseAKadenosine kinaseAAHadenine aminohydrolasedCF2′-deoxycoformycinADAadenosine deaminaseDME-LDulbecco's modified Eagle-LeishmaniaBSDblasticidin deaminasePACpuromycin acetyltransferaseHYGhygromycin phosphotransferaseNEOneomycin resistancePHLEOphleomycin resistanceIMPDHinosine monophosphate dehydrogenasePTS1peroxisomal targeting signal 1PTS2peroxisomal targeting signal 2Ni2+-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.; 2) xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT); 3) adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT); and 4) adenosine kinase (AK) (Fig. 1) (4.Marr J.J.

One leishmanial purine interconversion enzyme, however, that lacks a mammalian equivalent is adenine aminohydrolase (AAH) (EC 3.5.4.2) (19.Murray A.W. Elliott D.C. Atkinson M.R. Nucleotide biosynthesis from preformed purines in mammalian cells. Regulatory mechanisms and biological significance.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1970; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes the effectively irreversible deamination of adenine to hypoxanthine (17.Kidder G.W. Nolan L.L. Adenine aminohydrolase. Occurrence and possible significance in trypanosomid flagellates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3670-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The central role of AAH in purine metabolism in L. donovani was underscored by the isolation and characterization of a conditionally lethal mutant deficient in both HGPRT and XPRT (20.Boitz J.M. Ullman B. A conditional mutant deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase validates the purine salvage pathway of Leishmania donovani.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Δhgprt/Δxprt null mutant, unlike wild type parasites, cannot salvage 6-oxypurines and can only survive and grow in vitro when AAH is pharmacologically blocked with 2′-deoxycoformycin (dCF) and either adenine or adenosine is provided as the purine source (20.Boitz J.M. Ullman B. A conditional mutant deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase validates the purine salvage pathway of Leishmania donovani.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, AAH in the promastigote funnels adenine and adenosine into hypoxanthine, a dead-end substrate for purine salvage by the Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out. Moreover, the Δhgprt/Δxprt strain is highly but incompletely compromised in its capacity to sustain a visceral infection in mice (20.Boitz J.M. Ullman B. A conditional mutant deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase validates the purine salvage pathway of Leishmania donovani.J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). AAH measurements in cellular extracts prepared from L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes strongly intimated that AAH was a promastigote-specific activity (6.Looker D.L. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. Purine metabolism in Leishmania donovani amastigotes and promastigotes.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 9: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, later experiments from our laboratory demonstrated robust adenine metabolism in Δaprt L. donovani axenic amastigotes that was strongly inhibited by dCF implying that AAH was active in amastigotes (40.Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Leishmania donovani singly deficient in HGPRT, APRT, or XPRT are viable in vitro and within mammalian macrophages.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To characterize the L. donovani AAH enzyme and evaluate AAH function in intact parasites, we cloned and sequenced L. donovani AAH and generated Δaah knock-outs in both wild type and Δhgprt/Δxprt backgrounds by homologous gene replacement. The Δaah lesion in the Δhgprt/Δxprt genetic background alleviated the requirement for dCF, and the growth and virulence phenotypes of this null mutant indicated a pivotal role for AAH in purine metabolism in both promastigotes and amastigotes. AAH was also determined to be cytosolic, unlike HGPRT and XPRT, and a biochemical analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme revealed AAH to be specific for adenine and a target for dCF inhibition. Furthermore, although the Δaah mutation in the wild type background did not profoundly affect parasitemias in macrophages or mice, introduction of this lesion into the Δhgprt/Δxprt line reduced the parasite level in macrophages to zero, and there were no persistent Δaah/Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites recovered from mice after a 4-week infection underscoring the potential utility of this triple knock-out strain as a live attenuated vaccine candidate.DISCUSSIONThe purine acquisition pathway of Leishmania is indispensable, particularly elaborate, and includes a unique assortment of purine salvage and interconversion enzymes that have been identified through biochemical investigations (4.Marr J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2030126623,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the last enzyme of the respiratory chain of aerobic organisms, catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. It is a redox-linked proton pump, whose mechanism of proton pumping has been controversially discussed, and the coupling of proton and electron transfer is still not understood. Here, we investigated the kinetics of proton transfer reactions following the injection of a single electron into the fully oxidized enzyme and its transfer to the hemes using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and pH indicator dyes. By comparison of proton uptake and release kinetics observed for solubilized COX and COX-containing liposomes, we conclude that the 1-μs electron injection into Cu(A), close to the positive membrane side (P-side) of the enzyme, already results in proton uptake from both the P-side and the N (negative)-side (1.5 H(+)/COX and 1 H(+)/COX, respectively). The subsequent 10-μs transfer of the electron to heme a is accompanied by the release of 1 proton from the P-side to the aqueous bulk phase, leaving ∼0.5 H(+)/COX at this side to electrostatically compensate the charge of the electron. With ∼200 μs, all but 0.4 H(+) at the N-side are released to the bulk phase, and the remaining proton is transferred toward the hemes to a so-called ""pump site."" Thus, this proton may already be taken up by the enzyme as early as during the first electron transfer to Cu(A). These results support the idea of a proton-collecting antenna, switched on by electron injection."

Differences in genetic composition, lifestyles, reproductive factors, or environmental exposures may contribute to the differential presentation of breast cancer among Hispanic women. Materials and Methods A population-based study was conducted in the city of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. A total of 645 women diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer between 1992 and 2005 participated in the study. Data on demographics, breast cancer risk factors, and clinico-pathological characteristics of the tumors were collected. Hormone receptor negative tumors were compared with hormone receptor postive tumors on their clinico-pathological characteristics as well as risk factor profiles. Results Among the 645 breast cancer patients, 78% were estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) or progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), and 22% were ER−&PR−. Women with a family history of breast cancer were more likely to have ER−&PR− tumors than women without a family history (Odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–2.26). This association was limited to cancers diagnosed before age 50 (Odds ratio, 2.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–5.81). Conclusions An increased proportion of ER−&PR− breast cancer was observed among younger Spanish women with a family history of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052644064,"Large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids are crucial for life, yet their primordial origin remains a major puzzle. The production of large molecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good catalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules. Thus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry. Here we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a possible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing the population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible chemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing of smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the `food set', being buffered. Some of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with varying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in such a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size. ACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the system into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a bistability in the population dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules dominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial conditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large catalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst molecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying `nested ACSs', a structure in which a small ACS is connected to a larger one and reinforces it. We show that when the network contains a cascade of nested ACSs with the catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as a power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules can come to dominate the system."
https://openalex.org/W2066344323,"Phagocytotic cells play a fundamental role in the defense against bacterial pathogens. One mechanism whereby bacteria evade phagocytosis is to produce factors that trigger apoptosis. Here we identify for the first time a meningococcal protein capable of inducing macrophage apoptosis. The conserved meningococcal outer membrane protein NhhA (Neisseria hia/hsf homologue A, also known as Hsf) mediates bacterial adhesion and interacts with extracellular matrix components heparan sulphate and laminin. Meningococci lacking NhhA fail to colonise nasal mucosa in a mouse model of meningococcal disease. We found that exposure of macrophages to NhhA resulted in a highly increased rate of apoptosis that proceeded through caspase activation. Exposure of macrophages to NhhA also led to iNOS induction and nitric oxide production. However, neither nitric oxide production nor TNF-α signaling was found to be a prerequisite for NhhA-induced apoptosis. Macrophages exposed to wildtype NhhA-expressing meningococci were also found to undergo apoptosis whereas NhhA-deficient meningococci had a markedly decreased capacity to induce macrophage apoptosis. These data provide new insights on the role of NhhA in meningococcal disease. NhhA-induced macrophage apoptosis could be a mechanism whereby meningococci evade immunoregulatory and phagocytotic actions of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2037386718,"Evidence is growing for a role of Waddlia chondrophila as an agent of adverse pregnancy outcomes in both humans and ruminants. This emerging pathogen, member of the order Chlamydiales, is also implicated in bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract infections. Until now, the serological diagnosis of W. chondrophila infection has mainly relied on manually intensive tests including micro-immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish reliable high throughput serological assays. Using a combined genomic and proteomic approach, we detected 57 immunogenic proteins of W. chondrophila, of which 17 were analysed by mass spectrometry. Two novel hypothetical proteins, Wim3 and Wim4, were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, purified and used as antigens in an ELISA test. Both proteins were recognized by sera of rabbits immunized with W. chondrophila as well as by human W. chondrophila positive sera but not by rabbit pre-immune sera nor human W. chondrophila negative sera. These results demonstrated that the approach chosen is suitable to identify immunogenic proteins that can be used to develop a serological test. This latter will be a valuable tool to further clarify the pathogenic potential of W. chondrophila."
https://openalex.org/W1972421883,"Rhodostomin (Rho) is an RGD protein that specifically inhibits integrins. We found that Rho mutants with the P48A mutation 4.4-11.5 times more actively inhibited integrin α5β1. Structural analysis showed that they have a similar 3D conformation for the RGD loop. Docking analysis also showed no difference between their interactions with integrin α5β1. However, the backbone dynamics of RGD residues were different. The values of the R(2) relaxation parameter for Rho residues R49 and D51 were 39% and 54% higher than those of the P48A mutant, which caused differences in S(2), R(ex), and τ(e). The S(2) values of the P48A mutant residues R49, G50, and D51 were 29%, 14%, and 28% lower than those of Rho. The R(ex) values of Rho residues R49 and D51 were 0.91 s(-1) and 1.42 s(-1); however, no R(ex) was found for those of the P48A mutant. The τ(e) values of Rho residues R49 and D51 were 9.5 and 5.1 times lower than those of P48A mutant. Mutational study showed that integrin α5β1 prefers its ligands to contain (G/A)RGD but not PRGD sequences for binding. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal proline residue adjacent to the RGD motif affect its function and dynamics, which suggests that the dynamic properties of the RGD motif may be important in Rho's interaction with integrin α5β1."
https://openalex.org/W1983537595,"Multidrug resistance protein Pdr5p is a yeast ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in the plasma membrane. It confers multidrug resistance by active efflux of intracellular drugs. However, the highly polymorphic Pdr5p from clinical strain YJM789 loses its ability to expel azole and cyclohexmide. To investigate the role of amino acid changes in this functional change, PDR5 chimeras were constructed by segmental replacement of homologous BY4741 PDR5 fragments. Functions of PDR5 chimeras were evaluated by fluconazole and cycloheximide resistance assays. Their expression, ATPase activity, and efflux efficiency for other substrates were also analyzed. Using multiple lines of evidence, we show that an alanine-to-methionine mutation at position 1352 located in the predicted short intracellular loop 4 significantly contributes to the observed transport deficiency. The degree of impairment is likely correlated to the size of the mutant residue."
https://openalex.org/W2064923576,"The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is an important model organism for the study of social behavior, yet our ability to correlate genes and behavior in this species has been limited due to a lack of genetic and genomic resources. Here we report the BAC-based targeted sequencing of behaviorally-relevant genes and flanking regions in the prairie vole. A total of 6.4 Mb of non-redundant or haplotype-specific sequence assemblies were generated that span the partial or complete sequence of 21 behaviorally-relevant genes as well as an additional 55 flanking genes. Estimates of nucleotide diversity from 13 loci based on alignments of 1.7 Mb of haplotype-specific assemblies revealed an average pair-wise heterozygosity (8.4×10−3). Comparative analyses of the prairie vole proteins encoded by the behaviorally-relevant genes identified >100 substitutions specific to the prairie vole lineage. Finally, our sequencing data indicate that a duplication of the prairie vole AVPR1A locus likely originated from a recent segmental duplication spanning a minimum of 105 kb. In summary, the results of our study provide the genomic resources necessary for the molecular and genetic characterization of a high-priority set of candidate genes for regulating social behavior in the prairie vole."
https://openalex.org/W2004647565,"Background β-Crystallins are structural proteins maintaining eye lens transparency and opacification. Previous work demonstrated that dimerization of both βA3 and βB2 crystallins (βA3 and βB2) involves endothermic enthalpy of association (∼8 kcal/mol) mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings Thermodynamic profiles of the associations of dimeric βA3 and βB1 and tetrameric βB1/βA3 were measured using sedimentation equilibrium. The homo- and heteromolecular associations of βB1 crystallin are dominated by exothermic enthalpy (−13.3 and −24.5 kcal/mol, respectively). Conclusions/Significance Global thermodynamics of βB1 interactions suggest a role in the formation of stable protein complexes in the lens via specific van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges whereas those β-crystallins which associate by predominately hydrophobic forces participate in a weaker protein associations."
https://openalex.org/W2078835816,"Stem cell factor (SCF) mediated KIT receptor activation plays a pivotal role in mast cell growth, maturation and survival. However, the signaling events downstream from KIT are poorly understood. Mast cells express multiple regulatory subunits of class 1(A) PI3Kinase (PI3K) including p85α, p85β, p50α, and p55α. While it is known that PI3K plays an essential role in mast cells; the precise mechanism by which these regulatory subunits impact specific mast cell functions including growth, survival and cycling are not known. We show that loss of p85α impairs the growth, survival and cycling of mast cell progenitors (MCp). To delineate the molecular mechanism (s) by which p85α regulates mast cell growth, survival and cycling, we performed microarray analyses to compare the gene expression profile of MCps derived from WT and p85α-deficient mice in response to SCF stimulation. We identified 151 unique genes exhibiting altered expression in p85α-deficient cells in response to SCF stimulation compared to WT cells. Functional categorization based on DAVID bioinformatics tool and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software relates the altered genes due to lack of p85α to transcription, cell cycle, cell survival, cell adhesion, cell differentiation, and signal transduction. Our results suggest that p85α is involved in mast cell development through regulation of expression of growth, survival and cell cycle related genes."
https://openalex.org/W2029081523,"Influenza A viral polymerase is a heterotrimeric complex that consists of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. We previously reported that a di-codon substitution mutation (G507A-R508A), denoted J10, in the C-terminal half of PA had no apparent effect on viral RNA synthesis but prevented infectious virus production, indicating that PA may have a novel role independent of its polymerase activity. To further examine the roles of PA in the viral life cycle, we have now generated and characterized additional mutations in regions flanking the J10 site from residues 497 to 518. All tested di-codon mutations completely abolished or significantly reduced viral infectivity, but they did so through disparate mechanisms. Several showed effects resembling those of J10, in that the mutant polymerase supported normal levels of viral RNA synthesis but nonetheless failed to generate infectious viral particles. Others eliminated polymerase activity, in most cases by perturbing the normal nuclear localization of PA protein in cells. We also engineered single-codon mutations that were predicted to pack near the J10 site in the crystal structure of PA, and found that altering residues K378 or D478 each produced a J10-like phenotype. In further studies of J10 itself, we found that this mutation does not affect the formation and release of virion-like particles per se, but instead impairs the ability of those particles to incorporate each of the eight essential RNA segments (vRNAs) that make up the viral genome. Taken together, our analysis identifies mutations in the C-terminal region of PA that differentially affect at least three distinct activities: protein nuclear localization, viral RNA synthesis, and a trans-acting function that is required for efficient packaging of all eight vRNAs."
