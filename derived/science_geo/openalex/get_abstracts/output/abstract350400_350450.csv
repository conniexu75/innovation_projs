https://openalex.org/W2010160850,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common systemic autoimmune disease with complex etiology but strong clustering in families (lambda(S) = approximately 30). We performed a genome-wide association scan using 317,501 SNPs in 720 women of European ancestry with SLE and in 2,337 controls, and we genotyped consistently associated SNPs in two additional independent sample sets totaling 1,846 affected women and 1,825 controls. Aside from the expected strong association between SLE and the HLA region on chromosome 6p21 and the previously confirmed non-HLA locus IRF5 on chromosome 7q32, we found evidence of association with replication (1.1 x 10(-7) < P(overall) < 1.6 x 10(-23); odds ratio = 0.82-1.62) in four regions: 16p11.2 (ITGAM), 11p15.5 (KIAA1542), 3p14.3 (PXK) and 1q25.1 (rs10798269). We also found evidence for association (P < 1 x 10(-5)) at FCGR2A, PTPN22 and STAT4, regions previously associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, as well as at > or =9 other loci (P < 2 x 10(-7)). Our results show that numerous genes, some with known immune-related functions, predispose to SLE."

https://openalex.org/W2116787167,"The RAS–ERK pathway is known to play a pivotal role in differentiation, proliferation and tumour progression. Here, we show that Erk downregulates Forkhead box O 3a (FOXO3a) by directly interacting with and phosphorylating FOXO3a at Ser 294, Ser 344 and Ser 425, which consequently promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The ERK-phosphorylated FOXO3a degrades via an MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the non-phosphorylated FOXO3a mutant is resistant to the interaction and degradation by murine double minute 2 (MDM2), thereby resulting in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Taken together, our study elucidates a novel pathway in cell growth and tumorigenesis through negative regulation of FOXO3a by RAS–ERK and MDM2."

https://openalex.org/W2001930072,Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength at Schaffer collateral synapses has largely been attributed to changes in the number and biophysical properties of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SK2 channels) are functionally coupled with NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in CA1 spines such that their activity modulates the shape of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and increases the threshold for induction of LTP. Here we show that LTP induction in mouse hippocampus abolishes SK2 channel activity in the potentiated synapses. This effect is due to SK2 channel internalization from the postsynaptic density (PSD) into the spine. Blocking PKA or cell dialysis with a peptide representing the C-terminal domain of SK2 that contains three known PKA phosphorylation sites blocks the internalization of SK2 channels after LTP induction. Thus the increase in AMPARs and the decrease in SK2 channels combine to produce the increased EPSP underlying LTP.
https://openalex.org/W2053007262,"Two regulatory pathways, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) and the transcription factor RUNX2, are required for bone formation in vivo. Here we show the interdependent requirement of these pathways to induce an osteogenic program. A panel of Runx2 deletion and point mutants was used to examine RUNX2-SMAD protein-protein interaction and the biological consequences on BMP2-induced osteogenic signaling determined in Runx2 null cells. These cells do not respond to BMP2 signal in the absence of Runx2. We established that a triple mutation in the C-terminal domain of RUNX2, HTY (426-428), disrupts the RUNX2-SMAD interaction, is deficient in its ability to integrate the BMP2/TGFbeta signal on promoter reporter assays, and is only marginally functional in promoting early stages of osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the HTY mutation overlaps the unique nuclear matrix targeting signal of Runx factors and exhibits reduced subnuclear targeting. Thus, formation of a RUNX2-SMAD osteogenic complex and subnuclear targeting are structurally and functionally inseparable. Our results establish the critical residues of RUNX2 for execution and completion of BMP2 signaling for osteoblastogenesis through a mechanism that requires RUNX2-SMAD transcriptional activity."

Here, we report that the defective gene underlying lethal motoneuron syndrome LCCS1 is the mRNA export mediator GLE1. Our finding of mutated GLE1 exposes a common pathway connecting the genes implicated in LCCS1, LCCS2 and LCCS3 and elucidates mRNA processing as a critical molecular mechanism in motoneuron development and maturation."

WRN is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family with functions in maintaining genome stability. Sir2, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, has been proven to extend life span in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) has also been found to regulate premature cellular senescence induced by the tumor suppressors PML and p53.

WS patients also exhibit an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and are highly disposed to cancers (1Martin G.M. Austad S.N. Johnson T.E. Nat.

Consistent with other RecQ helicases, WRN protein possesses 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity; however, it is the only human RecQ member to also have a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. Although its physiological substrate is not yet clear, WRN appears to preferentially act on replication and recombination structures. Cells from WS patients show premature replicative senescence compared with cells derived from normal individuals (5Martin G.M. Sprague C.A. Epstein C.J. Lab.

WRN protein shows dynamic relocalization within the nucleus under different conditions of growth. The WRN protein localizes to the nucleoli in a variety of cell types (12Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6686-6892Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and this localization is modulated by DNA damage and cell cycle. Upon serum starvation or treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, 4NQO, etoposide, or camptothecin, WRN migrates from nucleoli to discrete nuclear foci (13Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fact that DNA damage also induces the formation of RPA and RAD51 foci, and these co-localize with WRN almost fully (RPA), or partially (RAD51) (17Sakamoto S. Nishikawa K. Heo S.J. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), supports a potential role of the WRN protein in DNA replication and/or DNA recombination. Recent work by Blander et al. (18Blander G. Zalle N. Daniely Y. Taplick J. Gray M.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50934-50940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) indicated that WRN is acetylated in vivo. Translocation of WRN into nucleoplasmic foci is significantly enhanced by the protein deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). Moreover, TSA delays the re-localization of WRN back to the nucleolus at late times after DNA damage. WRN acetylation is markedly stimulated by the acetyltransferase p300 in vivo. Importantly, p300 augments the translocation of WRN into nucleoplasmic foci. These findings support the notion that WRN plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage and suggest that the activity of WRN is modulated by DNA damage-induced acetylation. Acetylation might either decrease the interaction of WRN with protein(s) that retain it in the nucleolus in the absence of genotoxic stress or enhance its interaction with proteins that anchor it to the nucleoplasmic foci (18Blander G. Zalle N. Daniely Y. Taplick J. Gray M.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50934-50940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Studies on WRN translocation after different DNA-damaging treatments found that acetylation of endogenous WRN is involved in its reversible translocation from nucleoli to nucleoplasm (19Karmakar P. Bohr V.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1146-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The yeast silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) protein belongs to a novel family of histone deacetylases, and is involved in gene silencing, telomere position effects, and cellular aging (reviewed in Ref. 20Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar). The Sir2 ortholog in mammals (SIRT1) has also been found to contain NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity (21Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that SIRT1 can both deacetylate p53 and attenuate its transcriptional activity (22Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar, 23Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E.N. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). SIRT1 also regulates premature cellular senescence induced by the tumor suppressors PML and p53 (24Langley E. Pearson M. Faretta M. Bauer U.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ouzarides T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA repair factor Ku70, causing it to sequester Bax away from mitochondria and inhibiting stress-induced apoptotic cell death (25Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). SIRT1 knock-out mice have a severe phenotype, most dying within the first month after birth (26McBurney M.W. Yang X. Jardine K. Hixon M. Boekelheide K. Webb J.R. Lansdorp P.M. Lemieux M. Mol. Cell.

Consistent with regulation of p53 by SIRT1 in vivo, these knock-out mice have hyperacetylated p53 and exhibit increased apoptosis, at least in thymocytes (27Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 38-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that SIRT1 can interact with WRN both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction is enhanced after DNA damage. WRN can be acetylated by acetyltransferase CBP/p300, while SIRT1 can deacetylate WRN. WRN acetylation inhibits its helicase and exonuclease activities while deacetylation by SIRT1 reverses this inhibition. WRN acetylation regulates its nuclear distribution. Importantly, down-regulation of SIRT1 reduces WRN translocation from nucleoplasm to nucleoli after DNA damage. These results suggest that WRN-mediated cellular responses to DNA damage are regulated by SIRT1 deacetylation. Culture Medium and Reagents—HEK293 and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TSA, nicotinamide, and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-WRN antibodies (H300) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-SIRT1 was made by Covance Inc. (22Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). Anti-acetylated-lysine antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-acetylated WRN specific antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic acetylated peptide (KLH-coupled) corresponding to residues surrounding Lys-1413 of human WRN and affinity-purified with acetylated peptide after depletion of antibodies to unacetylated WRN by passing through the same peptide without acetylation of the lysine. Transfection of the SIRT1 siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) was performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions with a final oligonucleotide concentration of 20 μm. GST Pulldown Assay—Full-length SIRT1 protein was in vitro expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine by the TnT lysate in vitro translation system (Promega). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from BL21 bacterial cells and bound to a GST-agarose column. 35S-radiolabeled SIRT1 and GST fusion WRN proteins were incubated for 2 h in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Beads were washed five times with the incubation buffer and boiled in the presence of 1× SDS sample buffer before SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—For anti-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and were lysed in BC100 buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After the beads were washed five times with BC100 buffer, bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 2 h. Western blots of immunoprecipitated proteins and whole cell extracts were performed with rabbit anti-WRN polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-SIRT1 polyclonal antibody, mouse anti-acetylated lysine monoclonal antibody. For endogenous protein immunoprecipitation, cells were treated for 6 h with either 20 μm etoposide (Sigma) or 500 μm hydrogen peroxide (SM Biotech, Inc.) before harvest, then lysed with BC100 buffer for 1 h, and cell extracts were incubated for 2 h with either goat anti-WRN polyclonal antibody (C19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation, protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the extracts and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed five times with BC100 buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads with 1× SDS sample buffer. In Vitro Deacetylation Assay—Acetylated WRN protein was purified by co-transfecting FLAG-WRN and CBP plasmids into HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with TSA and nicotinamide 6 h before harvest. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads and eluted with FLAG peptide. Purified acetylated WRN protein was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with purified SIRT1 protein as indicated. SIRT1 was FLAG-tagged and purified from a stable cell line by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads and eluted with FLAG peptide. The incubation buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9), 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol. When indicated, NAD+ co-factor (Sigma) was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 50 μm. Reaction mixtures were resolved in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Detecting WRN Acetylation in Cells—In a transiently transfected WRN acetylation assay, HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with FLAG-WRN, CMV-p300, or CMV-CBP plasmid DNA (10 μg each). At 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing fresh protease inhibitors, 10 μm TSA, and 5 mm nicotinamide. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 beads (Sigma). After elution with the FLAG peptide, proteins were resolved by either 8 or 4-20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine or anti-WRN antibodies. For endogenous WRN acetylation assay, U2OS cells were treated with 20 μm etoposide alone or treated with 1 μm TSA and 5 mm nicotinamide for 6 h before harvest. Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.025% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with mild sonication. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-WRN antibody and protein A/G-beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer five times, and proteins were eluted using SDS sample buffer. The samples were further analyzed by Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine or anti-WRN antibodies. Helicase and Exonuclease Assay—Using the acetylation assay described in Fig. 2a, we made WRN and acetylated WRN proteins from HEK293 cells. To maximally acetylate WRN protein, we treated the cells with TSA and nicotinamide to inhibit cellular deacetylase activity before harvest. Using these proteins, helicase assays were performed on a 3′ overhang partial duplex (21 bp) DNA structure. This substrate was generated by radiolabeling a 21-mer with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase followed by annealing with unlabeled complementary 70-mer. Non-acetylated, acetylated, and deacetylated FLAG-WRN proteins were incubated with substrate for 5 min at 37 °C in WRN reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were stopped by addition of one-sixth volume of loading dyes (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.9% SDS). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% neutral gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA at 100 V for 3 h at room temperature. The gel was vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 1 h, and radioactive DNA was visualized by phosphorimaging. For the exonuclease assay, a partial duplex (35 bp) with a recessed 3′-end was constructed by annealing labeled 35-mer to a 2-fold excess of unlabeled 70-mer, separated by native PAGE (12%), excised, and extracted before use. Exonuclease reactions (10 μl) containing 3′-recessed end substrate (0.1 nm) and FLAG-WRN proteins at the indicated concentrations in WRN reaction buffer minus ATP were preincubated on ice for 5 min, and then transferred to 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). DNA products were heated at 95 °C and separated by denaturing (14%) PAGE. Digestion of the labeled strand by the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of WRN proteins was visualized by phosphorimaging. Immunofluorescence and Recovery Assays—U2OS cells were seeded onto duplicated sterile coverslips in a 6-well tissue culture plate at 20-30% confluence. Cells were treated with 40 μm etoposide for 2 h and then washed and supplied with fresh medium for an additional 24 h. Nicotinamide (5 mm) was used as indicated in specific wells. For the SIRT1 down-regulation experiment, cells were transfected with siRNA for SIRT1 (or in control experiments, siRNA for GFP) by Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions with a final concentration of the siRNA oligonucleotides of 20 μm. The siRNA sequences for SIRT1: AACTTGTACGACGAAGACGAC. The cells were treated with etoposide as above. At each time point, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with PBS containing 1% of BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Primary mouse anti-WRN monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) was added in 1% BSA/PBS for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with 1% BSA/PBS, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were counterstained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. Coverslips were mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences), and the slides were examined under an Olympus IX71 microscope. SIRT1 Interacts with WRN Both in Vitro and in Vivo—The interaction of SIRT1 and WRN was first tested by a transient transfection assay. We either transfected FLAG-tagged SIRT1 with WRN or FLAG-tagged WRN with SIRT1 into HEK293 cells. After anti-FLAG M2 beads immunoprecipitation, the IP products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and a Western blot with anti-WRN and anti-SIRT1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1a, SIRT1 protein was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-WRN (lane 1, upper panel), and WRN protein was also clearly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-SIRT1 (lane 3, upper panel). We further tested whether endogenous WRN can interact with endogenous SIRT1. HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-WRN polyclonal antibody or control IgG. Endogenous SIRT1 can clearly be co-immunoprecipitated with WRN (Fig. 1c, lane 5 versus lane 8). Interestingly, this interaction was increased in the cells after a 6-h treatment with etoposide or H2O2 (Fig. 1c, lanes 5-7), suggesting that the possible regulation of WRN by SIRT1 is enhanced after DNA damage. Furthermore, we tested whether SIRT1 directly interacted with WRN and the specific region of WRN mediating this interaction. GST fusion proteins were generated for the N-terminal (GST-WRNNT), central (GST-WRNM), and C-terminal (GST-WRNCT) regions of WRN and immobilized on GST-agarose. As shown in Fig. 1b, 35S-labeled in vitro translated SIRT1 strongly bound to immobilized GST-WRNCT but not to immobilized GST alone (lane 3 versus lane 4). Moreover, SIRT1 only bound to the C-terminal domain of WRN (GST-WRNCT), as no binding to the N-terminal domain (GST-WRNNT) and central helicase domain (GST-WRNM) was detected (lanes 1-3). Thus, these findings demonstrate that SIRT1 interacts with WRN both in vitro and in vivo, apparently through binding to the C-terminal region of WRN. SIRT1 Deacetylates WRN Both in Vitro and in Vivo—Blander et al. (18Blander G. Zalle N. Daniely Y. Taplick J. Gray M.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50934-50940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have reported that WRN is acetylated in cells by transfecting WRN expression plasmid alone or with p300 expression plasmid into HEK293 cells. After in vivo labeling with radioactive acetate, they detected WRN acetylation, which can be augmented by cotransfecting p300. Using a different approach, we also detected WRN acetylation (Fig. 2a). In our approach, FLAG-tagged WRN expression plasmid was transfected alone or together with p300 or CBP expression vectors. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads, we detected WRN acetylation by Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2a, we can clearly detect WRN acetylation when WRN was cotransfected with CBP or p300 (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, acetylation of endogenous WRN was clearly detectable after cells were treated with 20 μm etoposide (Fig. 2b, lane 2 versus lane 1). Moreover, treating cells with etoposide in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and nicotinamide further increased WRN acetylation (lane 3 versus lane 2). These experiments clearly demonstrate that WRN can be acetylated in vivo in response to DNA damage. We further investigated the consequences of the interaction of WRN and SIRT1 proteins by testing whether SIRT1 can deacetylate WRN protein. Acetylated FLAG-WRN was purified from HEK293 cells, and SIRT1 was stably transfected into a cell line and subsequently purified. This in vitro deacetylation assay was performed by incubating SIRT1 with purified acetylated FLAG-WRN at 30 °C for 1 h followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2c, WRN can be deacetylated by SIRT1 (lane 4). The deacetylation is NAD-dependent (lane 4 versus lane 2) as expected for SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. However, the deacetylation activity was completely inhibited in the presence of nicotinamide (lane 5 versus lane 4). We also examined whether SIRT1 could mediate WRN deacetylation in cells. A high level of acetylated WRN was found in HEK293 cells cotransfected with CBP and WRN (Fig. 2d, lane 1); however, WRN acetylation levels were progressively decreased by increasing expression of SIRT1 (Fig. 2d, lanes 2-4). In contrast, this level of WRN acetylation was not reduced by transfection of a deacetylase-deficient SIRT1-363Y point mutant (Fig. 2d, lane 5). These results indicate that WRN is a specific target for SIRT1 deacetylase activity. We also examined the endogenous WRN acetylation status after siRNA-mediated reduction of SIRT1 protein levels in HEK293 cells. After immunoprecipitation with antibody specific for acetylated WRN, we clearly detected a significantly increased level of acetylated WRN when SIRT1 was down-regulated (Fig. 2e, lane 2 versus lane 1) indicating that SIRT1 is the specific deacetylase for the WRN protein. SIRT1 Regulates Both WRN Helicase and Exonuclease Activities—To further address the functional consequences of WRN-SIRT1 interactions, we tested whether the WRN helicase and exonuclease activities were altered by these modifications. We first tested the effect of acetylation on WRN helicase and exonuclease activities. Using the acetylation assay described in Fig. 2a, we expressed and purified the FLAG-WRN and acetylated FLAG-WRN proteins from HEK293 cells. Using these proteins (Fig. 3d, lanes 1 and 2), the helicase assay was performed on a 21-bp partial duplex with a 49-nt 3′ overhang structure. As shown in Fig. 3, a and b, unacetylated WRN was consistently more efficient at unwinding this substrate than acetylated WRN over a range of concentrations (lanes 2-4 versus lanes 5-7). An exonuclease assay was also performed using the same proteins but a different partial duplex substrate with a recessed 3′-end structure. As shown in Fig. 3c, acetylated WRN showed markedly less exonuclease activity than unacetylated WRN (lanes 5-7 versus lanes 2-4), indicating WRN acetylation reduced both helicase activity and exonuclease activity. Furthermore, we tested whether deacetylation of WRN by SIRT1 could reverse the reduction of WRN helicase and exonuclease by acetylation. For this experiment, FLAG-WRN isolated from HEK293 cells cotransfected with FLAG-WRN, CBP, and SIRT1 was compared with unacetylated and acetylated FLAG-WRN. Using these proteins (Fig. 3d, lane 3), we performed the helicase and exonuclease assays on the same 3′ overhang and 3′ recessed end substrates, respectively. Importantly, introduction of SIRT1 deacetylase (that markedly reduces the level of WRN acetylation) restores these helicase and exonuclease activities (Fig. 3a, lanes 8-10 versus lanes 5-7 and Fig. 3b; Fig. 3c, lanes 8-10 versus lanes 5-7), similar to the levels attained with non-acetylated WRN. These data demonstrate that the acetylation state of WRN significantly affects its helicase and exonuclease activities, and suggest that the SIRT1 deacetylation of WRN may play an important role in the regulation of its enzymatic function. SIRT1 Mediates the Reentry of WRN to the Nucleolus after DNA Damage—DNA damage induces WRN translocation from nucleolus to nucleoplasm and acetylation is thought to regulate this translocation (18Blander G.

Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1146-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test the effect of SIRT1 on WRN nuclear translocation, we first tested whether the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide can delay the reentry of WRN into the nucleoli after DNA damage. U2OS cells were first treated with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. After removing etoposide, cells were treated with nicotinamide, then fixed and immunostained for WRN localization. WRN underwent translocation from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after the etoposide treatment (95.8 versus 12.5%, Fig. 4b). The nicotinamide treatment reduced the number of cells that were able to relocate WRN back to the nucleolus after 24 h compared with cells without nicotinamide (85.0 versus 51.5%, Fig. 4b). Representative cells with WRN nuclear and nucleolar localization are shown in Fig. 4a. We further tested whether SIRT1 was involved in regulating WRN translocation after DNA damage. SIRT1 protein was specifically down-regulated by siRNA to SIRT1 in U2OS cells throughout the interval in which WRN localization was measured (Fig. 4e, lanes 2, 4, 6 versus lanes 1, 3, 5). After etoposide treatment, both SIRT1 down-regulated and control cells showed similar WRN translocat"

We investigated the enzymatic kinetics of AtMTP1 by a heterologous expression system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacked genes for vacuolar membrane zinc transporters ZRC1 and COT1. The yeast mutant expressing AtMTP1 heterologously was tolerant to 10 mm ZnCl2. Active transport of zinc into vacuoles of living yeast cells expressing AtMTP1 was confirmed by the fluorescent zinc indicator FuraZin-1. Zinc transport was quantitatively analyzed by using vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from AtMTP1-expressing yeast cells and radioisotope 65Zn2+. Active zinc uptake depended on a pH gradient generated by endogenous vacuolar H+-ATPase. The activity was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the H+-ATPase. The Km for Zn2+ and Vmax of AtMTP1 were determined to be 0.30 μm and 1.22 nmol/min/mg, respectively. We prepared a mutant AtMTP1 that lacked the major part (32 residues from 185 to 216) of a long histidine-rich hydrophilic loop in the central part of AtMTP1. Yeast cells expressing the mutant became hyperresistant to high concentrations of Zn2+ and resistant to Co2+. The Km and Vmax values were increased 2–11-fold. These results indicate that AtMTP1 functions as a Zn2+/H+ antiporter in vacuoles and that a histidine-rich region is not essential for zinc transport. We propose that a histidine-rich loop functions as a buffering pocket of Zn2+ and a sensor of the zinc level at the cytoplasmic surface.

These proteins and enzymes include zinc-finger proteins, RNA polymerases, superoxide dismutase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, zinc deficiency causes severe symptoms in all organisms including plants. However, when present in excess, zinc can become extremely toxic, causing symptoms such as chlorosis in plants. The essential but potentially toxic nature of zinc necessitates precise homeostatic control mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of cellular activity and to protect cells from toxic effects.Plants have many kinds of zinc transporters and zinc channels (4Guerinot M.L.

The MTP family in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of 12 members, and 4 members, MTP1-MTP4, form a subfamily. Both A. thaliana AtMTP1 (10Kobae Y. Uemura T. Sato M.H. Ohnishi M. Mimura T. Maeshima M.

A similar transporter in the zinc-hyperaccumulating plant species Arabidopsis halleri, AhMTP1–3, has also been investigated (13Dräger D.B. Desbrosses-Fonrouge A.G. Krach C. Chardonnens A.N. Meyer R.C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Krämer U. Plant J. 2004; 39: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Zinc tolerance of A. halleri has been suggested to be due to an increased copy number of the MTP1 gene and enhanced level of transcription (13Dräger D.B. Desbrosses-Fonrouge A.G. Krach C.

AtMTP1, AhMTP1–3, and AtMTP3 belong to a ubiquitous family of transition metal transport proteins called the cation diffusion facilitator protein family, which have been identified in bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes and have been demonstrated to transport zinc, cobalt, and cadmium (15Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).AtMTP1 has been demonstrated to transport zinc from the cytosol into the vacuole in A. thaliana (10Kobae Y.

AtMTP1 has been predicted from the hydropathy to have six transmembrane domains, long N- and C-terminal tails, and a long histidine-rich (His-rich) hydrophilic region between the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains (10Kobae Y.

Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). A multiple histidine domain is also present in mammalian orthologues such as mouse ZnT-3 (17Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The His-rich domain in these members has been estimated to serve as a zinc binding region (16Williams L.E. Pitman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). However, the transport mechanism and structure-function relationship of these zinc transporters have not been clarified, although zinc transport activity of MTP1 was detected by using reconstituted proteoliposomes of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli (18Bloβ T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and by a yeast complementation assay with a zinc-hypersensitive double mutant of ZRC1 and COT1 (zrc1 cot1) (13Dräger D.B.

The importance of its physiological function was revealed by the gene disruption mutant of AtMTP1 (10Kobae Y. Uemura T. Sato M.H. Ohnishi M. Mimura T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The His-rich loop consists of 81 residues including 25 histidine residues. Several cation diffusion facilitator family members such as ShMTP1 of hyperaccumulator plant Stylosanthes hamata lack a His-rich region and have different ion selectivity (20Delhaize E. Kataoka T. Hebb D.M. White R.G. Ryan P.R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the present study we expressed AtMTP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the kinetic properties; namely, affinity for zinc, ion selectivity, and dependence of the transport activity on a pH gradient. A zinc fluorescent probe enabled us to monitor zinc accumulation into vacuoles in living yeast cells. We also carried out quantitative analysis of zinc transport using radioactive 65Zn2+ and a vacuolar-membrane-enriched fraction from AtMTP1-expressing yeast. Furthermore, expression of a mutant AtMTP1, which lacked a large part of the His-rich loop, revealed the critical role of this motif. We report the experimental results and discuss the biochemical meaning of the His-rich loop of AtMTP1, especially the ion selectivity, affinity to Zn2+, and transport efficiency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—The zinc-sensitive mutant zrc1 cot1 (zrc1::LEU2 cot1::TRP1) of yeast (S. cerevisiae) was generated from BJ5458 (ABC710) (MATα, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, lys2-801, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prb1Δ1.6R, can1, trp1, GAL) (21Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) by the PCR-mediated gene disruption method (22Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The ZRC1 locus was replaced with LEU2 gene, and the COT1 locus was replaced with the TRP1 gene. The oligonucleotides used were (5′ ZRC1) 5′-ATGATCACCGGTAAAGAATTGAGAATCATCTCTCTTTTGACAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and (3′-ZRC1) 5′-TTACAGGCAATTGGAAGTATTGCAGTTTACAGCGTCATCTGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATC-3′ and (5′ COT1) 5′-ATGAAACTCGGAAGCAAACAGGTCAAAATTATATCCTTGTCGCGCGTTTCGGTGATGAC-3′ and (3′ COT1) 5′-TTAATGATCCTCTAAGCAATCAGCTGTGTTGCAGTTGGCAGGTTGGAATTGTCGACCTCG-3′. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic defined medium with 2% (w/v) glucose. For the metal tolerance assay yeast was grown in liquid HC-U medium that contained 2% glucose, 0.145% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.002% adenine, 0.002% arginine, 0.01% aspartic acid, 0.01% glutamic acid, 0.002% histidine, 0.008% isoleucine, 0.012% lysine, 0.05% leucine, 0.002% methionine, 0.005% phenylalanine, 0.04% serine, 0.02% threonine, 0.006% tyrosine, 0.02% tryptophan, and 0.015% valine. Metal tolerance was determined by the drop assay on HC-U plates containing ZnCl2, NiCl2, CoCl2, or CdCl2 at various concentrations.Heterologous Expression of AtMTP1 in Yeast—Genomic DNA was extracted from 3-week-old A. thaliana plants by using DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA). The AtMTP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers 5′-AAGGAATTCATGGAGTCTTCAAGTCCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGTCGACGCGCTCGATTTGTATCGTG-3′ (reverse). The DNA fragment was then inserted into the EcoRI-SalI site of URA3-marked, high copy yeast expression vector pKT10 (23Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The obtained plasmid was introduced into a zrc1 cot1 strain, which lacks endogenous zinc uptake transporters, by the lithium acetate/single-strand DNA/polyethylene glycol transformation method. Positive Ura+ colonies were selected, and the expression of AtMTP1 was confirmed by immunoblotting with the anti-AtMTP1 antibodies prepared previously (10Kobae Y. Uemura T. Sato M.H. Ohnishi M. Mimura T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Construction of DNA for AtMTP1 Mutant—The DNA of AtMTP1 mutant that lacks the major part (Gly-185 to His-216) of histidine-rich loop (His-rich loop) (shown in Fig. 6A) was constructed by a PCR and type IIS restriction enzyme-based method (24Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A type IIS EsP3I restriction site (underlined) was present in each primer. We used the primer pair 5′-TAGATGCGTCTCTTCATGAACATGGCCATAGTCATGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGAACCGTCTCGATGATCATGCCCTAGCAGAAC-3′ (reverse). The obtained clone was used as a Δ185–216 mutant AtMTP1. The mutant AtMTP1 DNA was introduced into a zrc1 cot1 strain of yeast by the same method for the wild-type AtMTP1 described above.Vacuolar Membrane Vesicle Preparation from Yeast—Yeast cells were grown to the exponential phase in SC-U medium that contained 2% glucose, 0.145% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and ammonium sulfate 0.002% adenine, 0.008% inositol, 0.008% p-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.008% amino acids, except for 0.04% leucine and no cysteine. Cells were harvested and treated with zymolyase, and spheroplasts were obtained. The spheroplast suspension was homogenized using a Teflon homogenizer. Vacuolar membranes were isolated from the spheroplast homogenate by a sucrose discontinuous gradient (15 and 35% (w/w) sucrose) centrifugation (25Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The obtained membranes were suspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 300 mm sorbitol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm p-(amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and stored at -80 °C until used.Measurements of Zinc Content in Vacuoles with FuraZin-1—Zinc content in yeast vacuoles was measured with a zinc fluorescent probe (26MacDiarmid C.W.

Yeast cultures (5 ml) were grown to the log phase in Chelex-treated synthetic defined medium supplemented with 10 μm ZnCl2. Chelex-treated synthetic defined medium was prepared by treating the medium, which contained 2% glucose, 0.56% yeast nitrogen base without divalent cations or potassium phosphate (Bio101 Systems, Vista, CA) and 0.002% adenine, 0.008% inositol, 0.008% p-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.008% amino acids except for 0.04% leucine and no cysteine medium (1 liter), with 25 g of Chelex 100 resin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h at 4 °C. The resin was removed, and the medium was supplemented with 7.3 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm FeCl3, 2 μm CuSO4, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The solution was adjusted to pH 4.2 with HCl and then filter-sterilized into polycarbonate flasks. Cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in the same saline to make a final density of 3 × 108 cells ml-1. A zinc fluorescent probe, FuraZin-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 50 μg) was dissolved in 16.6 μl of 20% pluronic solution (Molecular Probes), and the solution was diluted 4-fold with Me2SO to give a stock solution of 1.25 mm fluorophore and 5% pluronic solution. Fluorophore was added to a 250-μl aliquot of the cell suspension to give a final concentration of 25 μm. The cell suspensions were incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 1 h with agitation. The cells recovered by centrifugation were washed 3 times with 1 ml of chilled solution of 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2% glucose (for use as zinc uptake buffer), and 1 mm EDTA and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The cells were then chilled and washed twice with the uptake buffer. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of uptake buffer and maintained on ice before zinc uptake assays. Fluorometric assay of fluorophore speciation was performed using a RF5300PC fluorospectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The assay was started by adding an aliquot of yeast cells (10 μl) to 2 ml of MES-Tris uptake buffer containing 100 μm ZnCl2. With the instrument set at maximum scan speed, the excitation wavelength was scanned from 250 to 450 nm, and the intensity of emission at the fixed wavelength of 500 nm was recorded. The corrected traces were scanned to obtain emission intensities at the excitation wavelengths of 325 and 380 nm. The zinc content is referred to as the ratio of excitation fluorescence at 325 nm to that at 380 nm (F325/F380 ratio).Zn2+ Transport Assay—Zn2+ uptake into vacuolar membrane vesicles was measured using the filtration method (27Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Cunningham K.W. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3090-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 25 °C in aliquots of medium containing of 300 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm NaN3, 100 μm vanadate, 3 mm ATP-Tris, and 5 μm 65ZnCl2. Radioisotope 65ZnCl2 was purchased from Japan Radioisotope Association (Tokyo, Japan) and RIKEN (Wako, Japan). The specific radioactivity of 65ZnCl2 used for experiments was at a range of 0.3 to 925 TBq/mol. For the assay of the Zn2+/H+ antiporter, membrane vesicles were preincubated with 3 mm ATP-Tris for 5 or 10 min, and then Zn2+ transport was started by adding 65ZnCl2. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered through a presoaked 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (13 mm in diameter, Advantech, Tokyo, Japan). The filter was washed twice with 750 μl of cold wash buffer (300 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, and 100 μm ZnCl2). The radioactivity associated with the filters was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Background values resulting from incubation with 0.2 μm bafilomycin A1 (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), a potent inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), were subtracted from corresponding values in the absence of bafilomycin A1 and calculated as V-ATPase-dependent Zn2+/H+ exchanger activity. The proton pumping activity of endogenous V-ATPase in yeast vacuolar membranes was measured as the initial rate of fluorescence quenching of quinacrine at 25 °C with a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) RF5300PC fluorescence spectrophotometer set at 425 nm for excitation and 498 nm for emission as described previously (28Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After blocking with de-fatted milk, the membrane filter was incubated with the primary antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (1:2000 dilution) (GE Healthcare). Chemiluminescent reagents of ECL (GE Healthcare) were used for detection of antigens. A specific antibody to the N-terminal region of AtMTP1 (At2g46800, positions 37–50, Cys-GFSDSKNASGDAHE) was prepared by injecting a synthetic peptide into rabbits and used as anti-At-MTP1 antibody (1:2000 dilution) (10Kobae Y. Uemura T. Sato M.H. Ohnishi M. Mimura T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An antibody to the subunit A of V-ATPase was prepared previously (29Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and used as anti-VHA-A antibody (1:2000 dilution).RESULTSFunctional Expression of AtMTP1 in Yeast—To determine the functionality of AtMTP1, we expressed AtMTP1 in S. cerevisiae that contained neither Zrc1 nor Cot1 (zrc1 cot1). AtMTP1 protein was detected at 43 kDa in an immunoblot of the vacuolar membrane fraction from yeast cells expressing AtMTP1 (Fig. 1A). Zinc transport activity was tested by a zinc tolerance assay on an agar plate supplemented with ZnCl2. In this assay, a yeast zrc1 cot1 strain expressing AtMTP1 grew normally and generated colonies, indicating the tolerance to ZnCl2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the control yeast strain was transformed with an empty vector. The AtMTP1-expressing yeast strain restored the growth rate in the presence of ZnCl2 up to 10 mm, and it was distinguishable from that of a strain with the empty vector (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 1Functional complementation of AtMTP1 in a zrc1 cot1 mutant strain of yeast. A, AtMTP1 and vector were transformed and expressed in yeast strain that lacked both Zrc1 and Cot1 genes (zrc1 cot1 mutant). Vacuolar membrane fraction (5 μg of protein) was prepared from yeast cells transformed with AtMTP1 and was immunoblotted with the anti-AtMTP1 antibody. The arrow indicates the position of AtMTP1 (43 kDa). B, zinc tolerance assay of original yeast strain cells (BJ5458) expressing empty vector and mutant zrc1 cot1 yeast cells expressing empty vector (zrc1 cot1) or AtMTP1 (AtMTP1). Yeast cultures were adjusted to 1.0 optical density at 600 nm (A600) and 5-μl aliquots were applied to HC-U plates supplemented with the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2. Colony growth was recorded 2 days after incubation at 30 °C. C, zinc tolerance of yeast cells in liquid culture. Yeast strains transformed with AtMTP1 (open circles) or empty vector (closed squares) were incubated in liquid HC-U medium supplemented with indicated concentration of ZnCl2, and A600 of culture was recorded 21 h after incubation at 30 °C. The initial density of cell cultures was 0.01 A600.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To monitor the active incorporation of zinc into vacuoles in living yeast cells, we used a ratiometric fluorescent zinc indicator FuraZin-1 according to the method reported previously (26MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15065-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester of FuraZin-1, washed with EDTA, and then treated with glucose to start the zinc uptake. The fluorophore was accumulated predominantly in vacuoles of AtMTP1-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). In assay medium containing 100 μm ZnCl2, vacuoles of AtMTP1-expressing yeast cells showed a rapid increase in the F325/F380 ratio in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These observations indicate a marked accumulation of Zn2+ into vacuoles of living yeast cells with AtMTP1. Thus, we concluded that the yeast cells are useful for kinetic analysis of AtMTP1.FIGURE 2Measurement of zinc accumulation in living yeast vacuoles. Zinc accumulation in yeast (zrc1 cot1 mutant) cells transformed with AtMTP1 or empty vector was monitored by using the cell-permeable fluorescent probe FuraZin-1 AM. Transformed yeast cells were loaded with FuraZin-1 and photographed. A, yeast cells containing FuraZin-1 probe were incubated with 100 μm ZnCl2 for 10 min and then photographed under a fluorescent microscope. B, cells transformed with AtMTP1 (open circles) or empty vector (closed squares) were added to the zinc uptake buffer containing 100 μm ZnCl2, and then fluorophore speciation in vivo was determined as the change in vacuolar fluorophore signal during the indicated period. DIC, differential interference contrast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Zn2+/H+ Antiport Activity of AtMTP1—Vacuolar membranes from yeast with AtMTP1, but not from yeast with an empty vector, showed high activity of zinc uptake in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The membrane vesicles were acidified by V-ATPase and then the ΔpH-dependent Zn2+ uptake activity was determined. Preincubation of membrane vesicles with 3 mm ATP for 5 min resulted in maximal activity of the Zn2+/H+ antiport (data not shown). Zinc accumulation into vesicles was inhibited to the control level by 0.2 μm bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase (30Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Next, the Zn2+ accumulation was measured in the presence of a protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Fig. 3B). Zn2+ accumulation was inhibited by 10 μm CCCP to less than 30%, indicating that the zinc accumulation is tightly associated with a proton gradient generated by V-ATPase.FIGURE 3Zinc uptake by yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles containing AtMTP1. A, vacuolar membranes were prepared from zrc1 cot1 yeast expressing vector alone or AtMTP1. Membrane vesicles (40 μg of protein) were preincubated in uptake medium (200 μl) with (gray boxes) or without (black boxes) 3 mm ATP for 5 min at 25 °C. In some experiments (open boxes) both ATP and bafilomycin A1 (0.2 μm) were added to inhibit V-ATPase. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μm 65ZnCl2. After 10 min, the membrane vesicles were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm) and washed with 1.5 ml of cold wash buffer. Filter membranes were dried in air, and then radioactivity was measured. Mean values and S.D. were obtained from three replications. B, vacuolar membrane vesicles (20 μg) isolated from yeast strain AtMTP1/zrc1cot1 were assayed for Zn2+ uptake activity in the presence or absence of 10 μm CCCP. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μm 65ZnCl2. After reaction at 25 °C for 10 min, radioactivity of 65Zn2+ incorporated into membrane vesicles was determined. V-ATPase-dependent zinc uptake was normalized to that without the ionophore (control (Cont)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The V-ATPase-dependent (bafilomycin-sensitive) Zn2+ accumulation was measured with the passage of time (Fig. 4A). The amount of Zn2+ in membrane vesicles increased linearly up to 20 min and quickly decreased after the addition of the zinc ionophore pyrithione. Membrane vesicles of the vector control did not accumulate Zn2+. These results indicate that AtMTP1 functions as an active transporter of Zn2+ using a pH gradient. The dependence of the activity on the substrate concentration was determined (Fig. 4B). The zinc uptake activity of AtMTP1 was saturated above 2 μm Zn2+. The curve fitted the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km value was obtained at a Zn2+ concentration of 0.30 μm, and the Vmax value was 1.22 nmol/min/mg of membrane protein by the Hanes plot analysis (see Fig. 7C).FIGURE 4Zinc uptake kinetics of membrane vesicles containing AtMTP1. A, zinc uptake activity of vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from yeast zrc1 cot1 mutant transformed with AtMTP1 (open circles) or vector alone (closed squares) with the passage of time. The membrane vesicles (10 μg) were preincubated in uptake medium (1.0 ml) containing 3 mm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. The same reaction media supplemented with 0.2 μm bafilomycin A1 were also prepared and assayed. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μm 65ZnCl2 at time 0 and continued for the indicated period. Aliquots (100 μl) of the reaction suspensions were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane and washed with 1.5 ml of cold wash buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2030036012,"The effects of myostatin on adipogenic differentiation are poorly understood, and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We determined the effects of human recombinant myostatin protein on adipogenesis of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived preadipocytes. For both progenitor cell types, differentiation in the presence of myostatin caused a dose-dependent reduction of lipid accumulation and diminished incorporation of exogenous fatty acid into cellular lipids. Myostatin significantly down-regulated the expression of adipocyte markers PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, leptin, and aP2, but not C/EBPbeta. Overexpression of PPARgamma, but not C/EBPbeta, blocked the inhibitory effects of myostatin on adipogenesis. Myostatin induced phosphorylation of Smad3 in hMSCs; knockdown of Smad3 by RNAi or inhibition of its upstream kinase by an Alk5 inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of myostatin on adipogenesis in hMSCs, implying an important role of Smad3 activation in this event. Furthermore, myostatin enhanced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and formation of the Smad3-beta-catenin-TCF4 complex, together with the altered expression of a number of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway genes in hMSCs. The inhibitory effects of myostatin on adipogenesis were blocked by RNAi silencing of beta-catenin and diminished by overexpression of dominant-negative TCF4. The conclusion is that myostatin inhibited adipogenesis in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes. These effects were mediated, in part, by activation of Smad3 and cross-communication of the TGFbeta/Smad signal to Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF4 pathway, leading to down-regulation of PPARgamma."
https://openalex.org/W2067236368,"The nitrite anion (NO(-)(2)) has recently received much attention as an endogenous nitric oxide source that has the potential to be supplemented for therapeutic benefit. One major mechanism of nitrite reduction is the direct reaction between this anion and the ferrous heme group of deoxygenated hemoglobin. However, the reaction of nitrite with oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) is well established and generates nitrate and methemoglobin (metHb). Several mechanisms have been proposed that involve the intermediacy of protein-free radicals, ferryl heme, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in an autocatalytic free radical chain reaction, which could potentially limit the usefulness of nitrite therapy. In this study we show that none of the previously published mechanisms is sufficient to fully explain the kinetics of the reaction of nitrite with oxyHb. Based on experimental data and kinetic simulation, we have modified previous models for this reaction mechanism and show that the new model proposed here is consistent with experimental data. The important feature of this model is that, whereas previously both H(2)O(2) and NO(2) were thought to be integral to both the initiation and propagation steps, H(2)O(2) now only plays a role as an initiator species, and NO(2) only plays a role as an autocatalytic propagatory species. The consequences of uncoupling the roles of H(2)O(2) and NO(2) in the reaction mechanism for the in vivo reactivity of nitrite are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007169599,"Post-translational modification of proteins regulates many cellular processes. Some modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, serve multiple functions. For example, the attachment of N-linked glycans to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum facilitates proper folding, whereas retention of high mannose glycans on misfolded glycoproteins serves as a signal for retrotranslocation and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Here we examine the substrate specificity of the only family of ubiquitin ligase subunits thought to target glycoproteins through their attached glycans. The five proteins comprising this FBA family (FBXO2, FBXO6, FBXO17, FBXO27, and FBXO44) contain a conserved G domain that mediates substrate binding. Using a variety of complementary approaches, including glycan arrays, we show that each family member has differing specificity for glycosylated substrates. Collectively, the F-box proteins in the FBA family bind high mannose and sulfated glycoproteins, with one FBA protein, FBX044, failing to bind any glycans on the tested arrays. Site-directed mutagenesis of two aromatic amino acids in the G domain demonstrated that the hydrophobic pocket created by these amino acids is necessary for high affinity glycan binding. All FBA proteins co-precipitated components of the canonical SCF complex (Skp1, Cullin1, and Rbx1), yet FBXO2 bound very little Cullin1, suggesting that FBXO2 may exist primarily as a heterodimer with Skp1. Using subunit-specific antibodies, we further demonstrate marked divergence in tissue distribution and developmental expression. These differences in substrate recognition, SCF complex formation, and tissue distribution suggest that FBA proteins play diverse roles in glycoprotein quality control.

Careful maintenance of properly folded glycoproteins is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Under physiological conditions, however, some glycoproteins fail to fold or assemble correctl and must be degraded (1Turner G.C. Varshavsky A.

ER resident lectins such as calnexin and calreticulin act as chaperones to ensure that nascent glycoproteins fold properly. Here we examine a novel group of lectin-like subunits of ubiquitin ligase complexes, the FBA family of F-box proteins, which have been proposed to target misfolded glycoproteins for degradation by the proteasome (3Yoshida Y.

This process is known as glycoprotein ER-associated degradation or GERAD (9Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

The five F-box proteins comprising the FBA family are predicted to bind glycoprotein substrates through their conserved C-terminal domain, known as the FBA or G domain (21Ilyin G.P. Serandour A.L.

Whether the other members of the family share this lectin-like ubiquitin ligase activity is unknown. The discovery that FBXO2 and FBXO6 recognize high mannose glycoproteins was an important advance in understanding the ubiquitin-proteasome components that mediate GERAD. But it is unknown whether the entire FBA family of F-box proteins participates in GERAD, or whether they all function as ubiquitin ligases. To answer these questions we examined the substrate binding, the ability to form SCF complexes, and the tissue distribution of all five FBA proteins.

FBXO6, FBXO44, and FBXO17 were cloned from heart and brain cDNA libraries, a kind gift from Dr. Bento Soares (Northwestern University). All FBA clones were sequenced; any PCR mutations were corrected with QuikChange mutagenesis (Invitrogen) and the resultant cDNAs ligated into pFLAG-CMV-6b (Sigma). Mouse FBAs—mFbxo2 was cloned from IMAGE clone 6487759; mFbxo44 was cloned from IMAGE clone 4165174, and mFbxo27 was cloned from IMAGE clone 6468333. MFbxo6 and mFbxo17 in pCMV-FLAG were a kind gift from Dr. Yukiko Yoshida (Tokyo Institute of Medical Science). GST Fusions—Using primers in Table 1, human FLAG-FBA proteins were amplified and then subcloned into the polylinker of pET41C (Novagen, Madison, WI). FBXO2 was also cloned into pGEX-6P1 as described previously (27Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Miller V.M. Wen H. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20242-20251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to generate a cleavable GST fusion protein. All FBA clones were sequenced. Null Mutants—Using primers listed in Table 1, GST-FBA fusions were constructed to replace two critical amino acids in the G domain hydrophobic pocket with alanines (Fig. 1, A and B). QuikChange mutagenesis was used with complementary primers spanning the insertion substitution sites. COS-7 cells (American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cell lines were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transient transfections, 80% confluent COS-7 cells were transfected with 6 μg of DNA/10-cm plate with Lipofectamine-Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for COS-7 cells. Co-transfections were performed as above with equimolar concentrations of DNA, and the total DNA did not exceed 6 μg of DNA/10-cm plate. For SCF complex isolation, equimolar amounts of FBXO and Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 were transfected as described previously (30Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Zhang Y. Wen H. Knutson T. Gouvion C.M. Robinson B.K. Zhou Z. Yang B. Smith R.J.H. Paulson H.L. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5163-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Cell lysates were then heated to 95 °C for 5 min, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min to pellet debris. Nondenatured lysates were prepared by rinsing cells with PBS, incubating on ice with FLAG Lysis Buffer (FLB: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) for 10 min, then scraping cells off the plate, and incubating cells on ice for a further 30 min, vortexing each 5 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. BL21(DE3)RP cells (Stratagene, La Jolla Ca) were transformed with the indicated GST fusion plasmids. Single colonies were grown overnight in LB broth with kanamycin (10 mg/liter) at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 1:50 in Terrific Broth-Kan, grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm = 0.6, and then induced for 2.5 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were pelleted and lysed for 30 min in 30 ml of BugBuster (Novagen)/500 ml of cell culture with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. PBS-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (1.0 ml slurry/500 ml cell culture) (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the lysates were rocked for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min and washed with 10 bed volumes of PBS. Purified GST fusion protein was eluted with 700 μl of reduced glutathione (10 mm) for 10 min at room temperature. Size filtration was used to concentrate the GST fusion proteins using a Microcon YM-100 filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and resuspended in TSM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20). Protein concentration was determined at an A280 nm, using absorbance of 1 = 0.5 mg/ml. Aliquots containing 25–100 mg of proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with 0.8 mg/ml Direct Blue 71 (Sigma) in 40% EtOH, 10% acetic acid as described by Hong et al. (31Hong H.Y. Yoo G.S. Choi J.K. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 600 μg of purified GST-FBA protein was shipped on dry ice for analysis by the glycan array. Although multiple bands were observed on Direct Blue staining (supplemental Fig. 2A), the absence of any significant glycan binding to either GST alone or GST fusion null mutations demonstrates that the presence of truncated fusion proteins does not confound interpretation of the glycan array or pulldown results. Because of variation in protein expression, we needed 1.0 liter of cell culture for FBXO2, 10 liters for FBXO6, FBXO27, and FBXO44, and 15 liters for FBXO17 for analysis by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics sponsored glycan array (32Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.-H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Details of glycan array procedures and full data sets for all glycan array studies are available at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics web site. Purified proteins were added to the arrays at 30 μg/ml in TSM buffer. FBXO2 cleaved from GST (27Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Miller V.M. Wen H. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20242-20251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was applied to printed array version 1 (PA _v1). Rabbit anti-FBXO2 was used at 100 μg/ml followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 antibody at 25 μg/ml. GST-FBXO2, GST, and all other GST fusion proteins used goat anti-GST fluorescein isothiocyanate at 20 μg/ml. GST alone was analyzed on plate array version 3.5. GST-FBXO2 was analyzed with PA_v1. FBXO6 and FBXO17 were analyzed with PA_v2.1. FBXO27 was analyzed with PA_v2. Finally, FBXO44 was analyzed in both PA_v1 and PA_v2.1. Image intensities were detected with a ScanArray confocal scanner. After consulting with the consortium, and viewing previously generated data (available on the consortium web site), we set cutoff values to establish significance of binding. These values were set at 1,700 relative fluorescent units (RFUs) for the array used with FBXO2, and 15,000 RFUs for the later generation arrays used to assess FBXO6, FBXO44, FBXO17, and FBXO27 binding. RNase B (R7884), AGP (G9885), lactoferrin (L9507), heparin sulfate (H4784), and chondroitin sulfate B (C3788) were purchased from Sigma. 10 mg of each glycoprotein was conjugated to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Denatured glycoprotein-conjugated beads were prepared by the addition of a 1:1 ratio of 6 m guanidine HCl and were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were subsequently washed five times with 10 bed volumes of TBS + 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 10 μg of recombinant GST fusion protein was applied to 30 μl of the different glycoprotein-conjugated beads. Samples were rotated at room temperature for 30 min, and beads were then transferred to a Handee Micro-Spin column (Pierce) and washed by spin filtration twice with 200 μl of TBS + 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Unless otherwise specified, adult tissues were obtained from male and female mice at least 8 weeks old. Embryonic tissues at day 7 and 15 were processed from eight embryos. The animals were anesthetized with Xylocaine/procaine and perfused with cold PBS plus protease inhibitors. The organs were quickly removed, placed on ice, dissociated with a Dounce homogenizer on ice in 2 μl of RIPA buffer/mg of dry weight with protease inhibitors. Denaturation of lysates was achieved by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, heating the samples to 95 °C for 5 min, and pelleting debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min. Mouse tissue preparations from a commercial supplier (BioChain, Hayward, CA) produced similar results. Nondenatured lysates from 10-cm plates were incubated with 50 μl of equilibrated FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 s at 8,200 × g and washed four times with FLB. After the final wash, bound proteins were eluted from beads with Laemmli buffer without dithiothreitol. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant containing the eluted proteins was resolved in 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). For GST fusion IPs, recombinant GST-FBXO fusion proteins were purified from OverExpress C41 cells (Lucigen, Middleton, WI), an Escherichia coli strain selected for tolerance to toxic proteins, grown in MagicMedia (Invitrogen), and harvested as described above. Nondenatured lysates prepared from COS-7 cells were incubated with 50 μg of purified GST fusion proteins and 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then transferred to Handee Micro-Spin columns, washed four times with 200 μl of FLAG lysis buffer, and eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli buffer at room temperature for 15 min. FBA-specific antibodies were generated (Sigma Genosys) by inoculating New Zealand White rabbits with the following keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides. An underlined C indicates cysteine added for conjugation. Numbers in parentheses indicate amino acid position of the peptide in the mouse sequence. While this work was in progress a rabbit polyclonal antibody to FBXO2 was generated (29Yoshida Y. Adachi E. Fukiya K. Iwai K. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using a sequence similar to that described below. The following peptides were used: Fbxo2 (1–19), MDGDGDPESVSHPEEASPEC; Fbxo6 (103–119), CKVETLPGSCGTSFPDNK; Fbxo44 (185–202), CHAPLGTFQPDPVMIQQKS; Fbxo17 (88–106) DADADGNRHDEFPFCALAR; and Fbxo27 (8–25), TRVPTPEPDPQEVLDLSR. For affinity purification, immune serum was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate peptide conjugated to agarose beads. Beads were then pelleted and washed with TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, 14 mm NaCl) until the A280 nm returned to base line. The purified antibody was eluted with four successive bead volumes of glycine, pH 2, and aliquots containing antibody were pooled. FBXO2 (1:5,000), FBXO6 (1:200), FBXO44 (1:500), FBXO17 (1:100), and FBXO27 (1:100) antibodies, pre-immune and pre-adsorbed serum (both used at 1:1,000) were diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk, and antibody specificity was confirmed with Western analysis (supplemental Fig. 3). FLAG M5 (1:1,000), mouse α-tubulin (1:2,000), antibodies, and peroxidase-conjugated ConA (6 μg/30 ml) were purchased from Sigma. Skp1 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog number 610530) was used at 1:5000. Rbx1 used at 1:100 (NeoMarkers, catalog number RB-9287), and Cullin1 was used at 1:250 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., catalog number 71-8700). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Samples were blocked 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk, and primary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed four times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse, catalog number 1:15,000, both from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by four more washes as above. Divergent Binding of High Mannose Glycans—Previous studies have shown that FBXO2 and FBXO6 bind glycoproteins containing N-linked high mannose glycans (3Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H.

Commun. 2007; 362: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This raises the following important question. Do all five FBA family members bind similar substrate proteins and thus, like FBXO2 and FBXO6, have the capacity to participate in GERAD? To begin addressing this question, we first tested the ability of all five full-length FBA proteins to co-immunoprecipitate high mannose containing glycoproteins. As anticipated, proteins co-precipitating with FBXO2 stained robustly with ConA, a lectin that specifically recognizes high mannose glycans (Fig. 1A). Thus, many if not all proteins bound by FBXO2 are high mannose glycoproteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, FBXO2 is also expressed at higher levels than other FBA proteins, consistent with our previous report (27Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Miller V.M. Wen H. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20242-20251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both FBXO6 and FBXO27 displayed much more modest co-precipitation of ConA-staining proteins. In contrast, FBXO44 and FBXO17 displayed little if any binding to high mannose glycoproteins, validating earlier work performed with full-length FBXO44 and a truncated form of FBXO17 (19Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of either the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin or benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of the cytosolic glycosidase PNGase F (data not shown) (35Misaghi S. Pacold M.E. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. Korbel G.A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1677-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of robust high mannose glycoprotein binding by some FBA family members is not because of rapid proteasomal degradation of substrates or the removal of ConA-binding sites by PNGase F. To further characterize the binding of FBXO2, FBXO6, and FBXO27 to high mannose-containing glycoproteins, we created GST fusion proteins of these three FBA family members.

The Pcdh-α genomic structure contains variable first exons, each regulated by its own promoter. Here, we investigated the effect of DNA methylation on gene regulation in the Pcdh-α gene cluster. We studied two mouse cell lines, C1300 and M3, that expressed different combinations of Pcdh-α isoforms and found that 1) the transcription of specific Pcdh-α isoforms correlated significantly with the methylation state of the promoter and the 5′ (but not the 3′) region of the first exon and 2) mosaic or mixed methylation states of the promoters were associated with both active and inactive transcription. Demethylation of C1300 cells up-regulated all of the Pcdh-α isoforms, and, in a promoter assay, hypermethylation of the promoters repressed their transcriptional activity. Cell lines subcloned from the demethylated C1300 cells transcribed different combinations of Pcdh-α isoforms than the parental, nondemethylated cells, and the promoters showed differential mosaic or mixed methylation patterns. In vivo, the promoter and 5′-regions of the Pcdh-αC1 and αC2 exons, which are transcribed in all neurons, were extensively hypomethylated. In contrast, the promoters of the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 isoforms, which are transcribed differentially by individual Purkinje cells, exhibited mosaic methylation patterns. Overall, our results demonstrated that mosaic or mixed DNA methylation states in the promoter and 5′-region of the first exon may help regulate differential Pcdh-α transcription and that hypermethylation is sufficient to repress transcription.

The brain is a highly organized multicellular system possessing a huge number of diverse neurons that generate a complicated and sophisticated neural network. Individual neurons have distinct identities through their differential expression of several neuronal genes. For example, in the olfactory sensory system, the odorant epithelial cells express thousands of different odorant receptors (ORs) 2The abbreviations used are: OR, odorant receptor; Pcdh-α, protocadherin-α; CP, cytoplasmic; CR, constant region; CSE, conserved sequence element; EC, extracellular; FBS, fetal bovine serum; gDNA, genomic DNA; 5aC, 5-azacytidine; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Members of the gene-clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) family, a group of diverse cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, are candidates for the individualization of neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system. The Pcdh gene family includes three gene clusters, Pcdh-α, -β, and -γ. Each cluster contains a large region of tandemly arranged, variable exons, each encoding six extracellular (EC) cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a partial cytoplasmic (CP) domain. In the Pcdh-α and -γ clusters, the rest of the CP domain is encoded by three or four constant region (CR) exons located at the 3′-end of each cluster. Only one of the variable first exons is spliced onto these CR exons (9Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T.

Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR analysis of individual Purkinje cells has shown that Purkinje cells differentially express Pcdh-α isoforms by combinatorial transcription, selecting one or two variable first exons for individual cis-splicing from each Pcdh-α allele (11Esumi S.

The Pcdh-γA and -γB genes are regulated similarly (12Kaneko R. Kato H. Kawamura Y. Esumi S. Hirayama T. Hirabayashi T. Yagi T. J. Biol.

In contrast, Pcdh-αC1, -αC2, -γC3, -γC4, and -γC5, located near the CR exons of Pcdh-α and -γ, are transcribed biallelically in Purkinje cells (12Kaneko R. Kato H. Kawamura Y. Esumi S. Hirayama T.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms for establishing the identity of each neuron and its specific connections, we need to understand the regulation of gene families, like the Pcdh family, that encode multiple, differentially expressed isoforms. Each Pcdh variable exon has an exon-specific promoter, located upstream of the exon, that contains a conserved sequence element (CSE) (13Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J.

Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) examined the methylation states of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the promoter and 5′-region of the Pcdh-α6 exon in two human cell lines that differentially transcribe the isoform and found a correlation between DNA methylation of the promoter and the isoform transcribed. However, the correlation between the DNA methylation state and isoform transcription for the other variable-exon promoters of the Pcdh-α gene cluster and whether such a correlation has a role in vivo have not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the promoter and 5′-region of the first exon of actively transcribed Pcdh-α isoforms were hypomethylated, but all the 3′-regions of the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 variable exons were hypermethylated. We also show that DNA hypermethylation of Pcdh-α variable-exon promoters was sufficient for transcriptional repression. In subclones derived from demethylated C1300 cells, we found various CpG methylation states in the Pcdh-α promoters, including methylated, unmethylated, mosaic (i.e. methylated and unmethylated CpGs on an individual DNA strand), and mixed methylated and unmethylated DNA strands. The mosaic and mixed methylation states were found in the promoters of both transcribed and untranscribed Pcdh-α isoforms. Finally, in neurons from brain tissue, the differential Pcdh-α transcription patterns in individual neurons correlated with the occurrence of differential mosaic DNA methylation in the Pcdh-α variable-exon promoters, but hypomethylation of the promoters was characteristic of the biallelically expressed Pcdh-αC1 and αC2 mRNA. Cell Lines—A mouse neuroblastoma cell line, C1300, was obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, Clare Hall, UK. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). Another mouse neuroblastoma cell line, M3, was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. These cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were passaged into 100-mm culture dishes when confluent and used for genomic DNA (gDNA) or mRNA preparation. 5-Azacytidine Treatment of C1300 Cells—C1300 cells were demethylated by incubation in medium containing 1, 5, or 10 μm 5-azacytidine (5aC, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 10–14 days. During this time, we passaged the 5aC-treated C1300 cells once and exchanged the medium for fresh medium containing the same concentration of 5aC. Subcloning of 5aC-treated C1300 Cells—Following treatment with 5 μm 5aC, the C1300 cells were cultured at a low cell density in normal medium. Each single cell divided individually and formed a colony. For subcloning, we isolated the colonies and cultured them individually. To promote cell survival after subcloning, we cultured each subline with medium containing half Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% FBS and half conditioned medium from normal C1300 cells. First, each subline was cultured in a 96-well plate. When confluent, the cells were transferred to a 24-well plate. Each subline was eventually transferred to a 60-mm dish and finally to a 100-mm dish. gDNA Preparation and Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—gDNA was isolated from cultured cells and from C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Japan) by standard techniques. All experimental procedures that involved mice were performed in accordance with the 1996 National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Animal Committee of Osaka University. gDNA was modified by sodium bisulfite, as described in Paulin et al. (15Paulin R. Grigg G.W. Davey M.W. Piper A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5009-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The bisulfite-modified DNA was purified by the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI) and desulfonated. Following ethanol precipitation, we used 20 ng of the treated DNA for PCR reactions with Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). The primers used for DNA amplification are listed in supplemental Table S1. The first PCR program consisted of 95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 54–58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 3 min. The second PCR was carried out using the same program as the first, except for the annealing temperature, which depended on the primer set. The PCR products were sequenced by standard procedures. The identical procedure was repeated for two independent batches of gDNA and at least two independent PCR reactions for each sample, to minimize PCR artifacts. To analyze the 3′-region of the Pcdh-α variable exons, we synthesized a set of universal primers for a highly conserved sequence within the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 variable exons (91.8–99.1% identity at the amino acid level). The primers (Table S1) were designed to maximize the highly conserved sequences and amplify all Pcdh-α variable exons simultaneously, except for Pcdh-αC1 and -αC2. The universal primer sequences were 83.3–100% identical to the individual Pcdh-α genes at the nucleotide level (data not shown). The PCR products were sequenced by standard procedures and assigned to each Pcdh-α gene based on sequence comparison. Methylation-sensitive Restriction Enzyme Cleavage and Southern Blots—gDNA was digested by general restriction enzymes (BglII for α10, KpnI for α1, or HindIII for αC2) and subsequently by MspI or the CpG methylation-sensitive isoschizomer HpaII. The probes for Southern blots to recognize the Pcdh-α10 upstream, Pcdh-α1 upstream and downstream, or Pcdh-αC2 upstream regions were amplified by KOD-plus (Toyobo, Japan) PCR with the primers listed in supplemental Table S2. The PCR template was the Mus musculus genomic BAC clone RP23–303I8 or RP24–318M13. The PCR products were ligated into pCR-Blunt vectors (Invitrogen) and subcloned. The vectors were amplified, and then the probe fragments were cut out of the vectors. For random primer labeling, a fluorescein-conjugated nucleotide mix (GE Healthcare UK, Ltd.), NEB Klenow (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and a random 9-mer mix (Hokkaido System Science, Japan) were used. The probe fragments were recognized by an anti-fluorescein alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., diluted 5000 times) and detected by using CDP-Star detection reagents (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.). RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT)20 primer. Each Pcdh-α isoform amplification was performed with LA Taq (Takara) for 30 cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. One specific primer and one universal primer (Table supplemental S3) were used to amplify each Pcdh-α cDNA. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—The quantification of Pcdh-α mRNAs and the control, murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, was carried out by a real-time fluorescence detection method. The RNA samples (5 μg in an 80-μl reaction volume or 2.5 μg in a 40-μl reaction volume), which had been treated with DNase I (Takara), were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III RT and random hexamers. PCR amplifications were carried out with the genespecific primers summarized in supplemental Table S4 using the 7900HT Sequence Detection System and SYBR®-Green according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The Pcdh-α mRNA levels were normalized for each well to the GAPDH mRNA level or to the entire amount of Pcdh-α CR. At least four independent analyses were performed for each gene. Statistical significance was calculated using StatViews, and analysis of variance was performed with Student's t test as a multiple comparison test. Plasmid Construction and DNA Methylation for Luciferase Assay—Upstream fragments of Pcdh-α9 and -α10 were isolated by PCR using the set of primers shown in supplemental Table S5. The template for PCR was the M. musculus genomic BAC clone RP23–303I8. Each blunt-ended PCR product was cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), a promoterless luciferase vector. To make methylated or unmethylated vectors for the luciferase assay, Pcdh-α9 and -α10 vectors were methylated by SssI CpG methyltransferase (M. SssI, New England Biolabs) in the presence (methylated) or absence (mock-methylated) of 160 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The completion of the methylation reaction was confirmed by digestion with HpaII, HhaI, ClaI, NaeI, or AccII. The vectors were then treated with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. Both the methylated and unmethylated Pcdh-α9 and -α10 vectors were diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer and quantified by their absorbance at 260 nm. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—C1300 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well 1 day prior to transfection. All luciferase vectors (100 ng) were introduced into C1300 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with pRL-TK (2 ng). Luciferase activities were determined 40 h after the transfection, using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The promoter activity was normalized via the Renilla luciferase activity. Assays were performed three times, each time in triplicate. DNA Methylation Analysis of Pcdh-α in Purkinje Cell Populations—Purkinje cells were isolated as described by Esumi et al. (16Esumi S. Kaneko R. Kawamura Y. Yagi T. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2143-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cerebellum of C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 21 was dissociated by a brief treatment with papain. The debris was removed by filtration and FBS-density slope centrifugation. Following resuspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the Purkinje cells were collected using a glass capillary under an optical microscope. All the Purkinje cells obtained from a single cerebellum were gathered in a tube containing 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/10 mm EDTA. gDNA was extracted from 500 Purkinje cells with the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite treatment was performed on the gDNA with the Epitect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The treated gDNA was eluted twice with a 10-μl volume of elution buffer and divided into two 10-μl aliquots for use as individual PCR samples. PCR conditions were the same as for the bisulfite genomic sequencing described above. Comparison of the Pcdh-α Isoform mRNA Levels and Genomic Methylation in C1300 and M3 Cell Lines—To explore the Pcdh-α gene regulation mechanism, we searched cultured cell lines for those that consistently expressed a given combination of Pcdh-α isoforms. Using RT-PCR to detect each Pcdh-α isoform, we found that neuroblastoma C1300 cells and melanoma M3 cells showed different Pcdh-α transcription patterns: C1300 transcribed the α1, α8, α9, αC1, and αC2 isoforms, and M3 transcribed the α8, α9, α10, and αC2 isoforms (Fig. 1B). To determine the methylation states of individual CpGs in the Pcdh-α isoforms, we carried out bisulfite genomic sequencing of the Pcdh-α10 and -αC1 promoter regions and of the 5′-region of the Pcdh-αC2 exon in both cell lines. The Pcdh-α isoforms showing the highest mRNA levels (αC1 and αC2 in C1300, and α10 and αC2 in M3) were hypomethylated at the promoter and the 5′-regions of the first exon, whereas the promoter regions of the Pcdh-α isoforms with low mRNA levels (α10 in C1300 and αC1 in M3) were hypermethylated at the CpGs (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, a methylation-sensitive Southern blot for the Pcdh-α10 locus (supplemental Fig. S1A) showed that the CCGG located at the Pcdh-α10 promoter was highly methylated in C1300 cells but showed virtually no methylation in M3 cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data are consistent with a report on human cell lines (14Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the bisulfite sequencing did not show hypermethylation of the promoter region of the silent Pcdh-α1 in M3 cells, unlike the other silent promoter regions. Instead, we found a mosaic pattern of methylated and unmethylated CpGs (Fig. 2A). In addition, the promoter region of Pcdh-α9, which is transcribed in M3 cells, also showed varying methylation patterns, including unmethylated, hypermethylated, and mosaic methylated DNA strands, but not hypomethylation, unlike the other active Pcdh-α promoter regions (Fig. 2A). DNA Methylation Patterns of the Promoter and Exon 5′ Region but Not 3′ Region Correlate with the Selective Transcription of Pcdh-α Isoforms—To determine if CpG methylation patterns in other regions of the exons might also affect selective isoform transcription in the Pcdh-α cluster, we examined the DNA methylation in the CpG-rich 5′ and 3′ domains (Fig. 3A) as well as the promoter, for each variable exon in the Pcdh-α cluster of C1300 cells. We found that the Pcdh-α4 and -α10 isoforms, which were transcribed at low levels, were hypermethylated in the promoter and 5′-regions of the exons. In contrast, the Pcdh-α1, -α8, and -α9 isoforms, which were transcribed at higher levels, were hypomethylated in these regions (Fig. 3B). These data corresponded with those of Tasic et al. (14Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the 3′-regions of the variable exons were heavily methylated in all the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 isoforms, including Pcdh-α1, -α8, and -α9 (Fig. 3B). A methylation-sensitive Southern blot for the downstream region of the Pcdh-α1 variable exon (Fig. 4A) revealed highly methylated CCGG sites in the 3′-region in the gDNA of both C1300 and M3 cells (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, a Southern blot for the 5′-region of the Pcdh-α1 exon (supplemental Fig. S1C) showed that the C1300 gDNA was unmethylated, but that of the M3 cells was methylated (supplemental Fig. S1D). These data showed differential states of DNA methylation in the promoter and the 5′, but not the 3′-region of each Pcdh-α variable exon. Therefore, methylation of the promoter and/or the 5′-region might control the selective transcriptional activation of each Pcdh-α isoform. Alteration of the Pcdh-α Isoform Transcription Patterns in C1300 Cells by Treatment with the Demethylating Reagent 5aC—To examine directly the effects of CpG methylation on the transcription levels of Pcdh-α mRNAs, we blocked the activity of DNA methyltransferase I (Dnmt1) with the demethylating reagent 5aC to obtain unmethylated CpGs. We treated C1300 cells with different concentrations of 5aC and extracted both the total RNA and the gDNA and compared the total Pcdh-α mRNA levels (Pcdh-α CR) in normal and 5aC-treated C1300 cells by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The overall transcription levels of the Pcdh-α isoforms began to rise even at the lowest dosage (1 μm) of 5aC and increased dose dependently, saturating at 5 μm 5aC (Fig. 5A), when all of the isoforms were expressed. In contrast, and as expected, the untreated C1300 cells transcribed only the α1, α8, and α9 isoforms (Fig. 5B). We next focused on the effects of 5aC on the mRNA levels of the Pcdh-α4, -α9, and -α10 isoforms in a detailed analysis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level of Pcdh-α10 (which is untranscribed in untreated C1300 cells) was detectable in C1300 cells treated with 5 or 10 μm 5aC, but not 1 μm (Fig. 6A). Treatment with 5 μm 5aC induced the transcription of Pcdh-α10 mRNA to 8.2 times its level in the untreated cells (Fig. 6A). The DNA methylation patterns of the Pcdh-α10 promoter region in the 5aC-treated C1300 cells showed heterogeneous demethylation (Fig. 6B), compared with untreated C1300 cells (Fig. 3B). Treatment with 1 μm 5aC did not lead to significant CpG demethylation (Fig. 6B), and the level of the Pcdh-α10 mRNA did not change (Fig. 6A). Treatment with 5 and 10 μm 5aC increased the frequency of demethylated CpGs (Fig. 6B), and the level of Pcdh-α10 mRNA increased significantly in parallel (Fig. 6A). Thus, demethylation of the Pcdh-α10 promoter region may be sufficient to upregulate its transcription. A parallel increase in mRNA level with DNA demethylation was also seen for the Pcdh-α4 isoform following treatment with 5 and 10 μm 5aC, although the increase in mRNA was smaller than for Pcdh-α10 (Fig. 6, C and D). On the other hand, Pcdh-α9, which was already transcribed at a high level and extensively hypomethylated in the untreated C1300 cells, was transcribed at even higher levels with 1 μm 5aC treatment, although the methylation pattern was unchanged (Fig. 6, E and F). Differential Transcription Patterns and DNA Methylation of the Promoter Regions of Pcdh-α Isoforms in Cell Lines Subcloned from 5aC-treated C1300 Cells—To examine the relationship between differential transcription patterns and the methylation states of the Pcdh-α genes, we isolated nine independent sublines from the 5aC-treated C1300 cells. Each subline showed increases in the total Pcdh-α mRNA levels compared with the untreated C1300 cells (Fig. 7A). RT-PCR for the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 isoforms showed similar transcription patterns to the untreated C1300 cells in five of the sublines. The other four (Clones 1, 2, 5, and 7) showed different transcription patterns (Fig. 7B). These sublines maintained high levels of Pcdh-α1, -α8, and -α9 mRNA and additionally transcribed Pcdh-α10 and -α12 (Clone 1), -α5, -α6, and -α7 (Clone 2), -α2, -α4, -α5, -α7, -α10, -α11, and -α12 (Clone 5), or Pcdh-α2, -α5, -α7, -α10, -α11, and -α12 (Clone 7). Thus, subcloning from the demethylated C1300 cells yielded novel cell lines that transcribed different combinations of Pcdh-α isoforms as well as lines exhibiting the original C1300 transcription pattern. To compare the DNA methylation patterns with the transcription levels of Pcdh-α isoforms in each subline, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis for the Pcdh-α4 and -α10 isoforms. In untreated C1300 cells, the Pcdh-α4 and -α10 isoforms were not transcribed or were transcribed at undetectable levels (Fig. 5B). However, Clones 1, 5, and 7 accumulated high levels of Pcdh-α10 mRNA (Fig. 8A). Clone 5 also transcribed high levels of Pcdh-α4 mRNA (Fig. 8C). In the Pcdh-α10 promoter, Clones 5 and 7 contained both unmethylated and hypermethylated DNA strands. In contrast, the Pcdh-α10 promoter of Clone 1 showed demethylation at only one CpG among the eight in the promoter region (Fig. 8B). A similar pattern was observed in the Pcdh-α4 promoter of Clone 5 (Fig. 8D). In contrast, several sublines that showed mosaic demethylation or a mixture of unmethylated and hypermethylated DNA strands in Pcdh-α promoters also showed low transcription levels of these isoforms (Pcdh-α10, Clones 9 and 10; Pcdh-α4 Clones 2 and 7; Fig. 8). These data showed that a mosaic of methylated and demethylated CpGs or a mixture pattern in the promoter regions of Pcdh-α genes could either activate or inactivate transcription. The CSE core sequence in each Pcdh promoter contains a CpG (14Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of the methylation of this CpG, we investigated the relationship between its methylation and the corresponding transcription level. The promoters containing a methylated CpG in the CSE core sequence (Pcdh-α10 of Clone 1 and Pcdh-α4 of Clone 5) showed high transcription levels (Fig. 8). In contrast, the promoters with a demethylated CpG in the CSE core sequence (Pcdh-α10 of Clone 10 and Pcdh-α4 of Clones 2 and 7) showed low transcription levels (Fig. 8). These data suggested that the methylation state of the CpG in the CSE core sequence would not affect the transcription levels of Pcdh-α isoforms. DNA Hypermethylation Represses the Activity of the Pcdh-α Promoters—Because mosaic methylation patterns in the Pcdh-α promoters were associated with both active and inactive transcriptional states, and because the hypermethylated Pcdh-α promoters seemed not to drive transcription, we investigated the effect of promoter demethylation or hypermethylation using a promoter assay. To do this, we constructed several Pcdh-α promoter-luciferase vectors with or without CpG methylation in the promoter region. We used a fragment of ∼500 bp upstream from the ATG of the Pcdh-α9 or -α10 variable exons, including the CSE core sequence, to drive the luciferase vector, and performed reporter assays in C1300 cells. The unmethylated Pcdh-α9 and -α10 promoter-luciferase vectors showed high levels of transcription (Fig. 9A), even thou"
https://openalex.org/W2101139446,"Many bacterial species have a nonhomologous end joining system of DNA repair driven by dedicated DNA ligases (LigD and LigC). LigD is a multifunctional enzyme composed of a ligase domain fused to two other catalytic modules: a polymerase that preferentially adds ribonucleotides to double-strand break ends and a phosphoesterase that trims 3'-oligoribonucleotide tracts until only a single 3'-ribonucleotide remains. LigD and LigC have a feeble capacity to seal 3'-OH/5'-PO(4) DNA nicks. Here, we report that nick sealing by LigD and LigC enzymes is stimulated by the presence of a single ribonucleotide at the broken 3'-OH end. The ribonucleotide effect on LigD and LigC is specific for the 3'-terminal nucleotide and is either diminished or abolished when additional vicinal ribonucleotides are present. No such 3'-ribonucleotide effect is observed for bacterial LigA or Chlorella virus ligase. We found that in vitro repair of a double-strand break by Pseudomonas LigD requires the polymerase module and results in incorporation of an alkali-labile ribonucleotide at the repair junction. These results illuminate an underlying logic for the domain organization of LigD, whereby the polymerase and phosphoesterase domains can heal the broken 3'-end to generate the monoribonucleotide terminus favored by the nonhomologous end joining ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2161320063,"Tissue-engineered blood vessels have largely relied on inelastic scaffolds or biological solutions with uncertain long-term in vivo durability. In this report we present for the first time a hybrid tissue-engineered bypass graft consisting of an elastic scaffold of compliant poly(carbonate-urea)urethane (CPU), incorporated with human smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) from the same human source. Human vascular SMCs and ECs were extracted from umbilical cord vessels. The effect of shear stress preconditioning on cell retention on the hybrid bypass graft was investigated under pulsatile arterial flow conditions. Retention of ECs seeded onto CPU precoated with SMCs was significantly improved by a period of shear stress preconditioning, especially when the stress incrementally increased. This is probably because the mechanical stimuli orient cells and increase the release of matrix proteins and attachment factors. The stage is now set for developing a hybrid graft for in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W2069214890,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase catalyzes acetyl-CoA synthesis from CO, CoA, and a methylated corrinoid iron-sulfur protein, which acts as a methyl donor. This reaction is the last step in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic carbon fixation. The binding sequence for the three substrates has been debated for over a decade. Different binding orders imply different mechanisms (i.e. paramagnetic versus diamagnetic mechanisms). Ambiguity arises because CO and CoA can each undergo isotopic exchange with acetyl-CoA, suggesting that either of these two substrates could be the last to bind to the acetyl-CoA synthase active site. Furthermore, carbonylation, CoA binding, and methyl transfer can all occur in the absence of the other two substrates. Here, we report pulse-chase studies, which unambiguously establish the order in which the three substrates bind. Although a CoA pulse is substantially diluted by excess CoA in the chase, isotope recovery of a pulse of labeled CO or methyl group is unaffected by the presence of excess unlabeled CO or methyl group in the chase. These results demonstrate that CoA is the last substrate to bind and that CO and the methyl group bind randomly as the first substrate in acetyl-CoA synthesis. Up to 100% of the methyl groups and CoA and up to 60-70% of the CO employed in the pulse phase can be trapped in the product acetyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W2014626615,"Lucina pectinata ctenidia harbor three heme proteins: sulfide-reactive hemoglobin I (HbI(Lp)) and the oxygen transporting hemoglobins II and III (HbII(Lp) and HbIII(Lp)) that remain unaffected by the presence of H(2)S. The mechanisms used by these three proteins for their function, including ligand control, remain unknown. The crystal structure of oxygen-bound HbII(Lp) shows a dimeric oxyHbII(Lp) where oxygen is tightly anchored to the heme through hydrogen bonds with Tyr(30)(B10) and Gln(65)(E7). The heme group is buried farther within HbII(Lp) than in HbI(Lp). The proximal His(97)(F8) is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule, which interacts electrostatically with a propionate group, resulting in a Fe-His vibration at 211 cm(-1). The combined effects of the HbII(Lp) small heme pocket, the hydrogen bonding network, the His(97) trans-effect, and the orientation of the oxygen molecule confer stability to the oxy-HbII(Lp) complex. Oxidation of HbI(Lp) Phe(B10) --> Tyr and HbII(Lp) only occurs when the pH is decreased from pH 7.5 to 5.0. Structural and resonance Raman spectroscopy studies suggest that HbII(Lp) oxygen binding and transport to the host bacteria may be regulated by the dynamic displacements of the Gln(65)(E7) and Tyr(30)(B10) pair toward the heme to protect it from changes in the heme oxidation state from Fe(II) to Fe(III)."

https://openalex.org/W2054047789,"Intracellular signal transduction proteins typically utilize multiple interaction domains for proper targeting, and thus a broad diversity of distinct signaling complexes may be assembled. Considering the coordination of only two such domains, as in tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domain constructs, gives rise to a kinetic scheme that is not adequately described by simple models used routinely to interpret in vitro binding measurements. To analyze the interactions between tandem SH2 domains and bisphosphorylated peptides, we formulated detailed kinetic models and applied them to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit/platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor system. Data for this system from different in vitro assay platforms, including surface plasmon resonance, competition binding, and isothermal titration calorimetry, were reconciled to estimate the magnitude of the cooperativity characterizing the sequential binding of the high and low affinity SH2 domains (C-SH2 and N-SH2, respectively). Compared with values based on an effective volume approximation, the estimated cooperativity is 3 orders of magnitude lower, indicative of significant structural constraints. Homodimerization of full-length p85 was found to be an alternative mechanism for high avidity binding to phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptors, which would render the N-SH2 domain dispensable for receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2042281223,"In response to a variety of extracellular ligands, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling regulates inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It is likely that cells are not continuously exposed to stimulating ligands in vivo but rather experience transient pulses. To study the temporal regulation of NF-κB and its major regulator, inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα), in real time, we utilized a novel transcriptionally coupled IκBα-firefly luciferase fusion reporter and characterized the dynamics and responsiveness of IκBα processing upon a short 30-s pulse of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or a continuous challenge of TNFα following a 30-s preconditioning pulse. Strikingly, a 30-s pulse of TNFα robustly activated inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK), leading to IκBα degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and strong transcriptional up-regulation of IκBα. Furthermore, we identified a transient refractory period (lasting up to 120 min) following preconditioning, during which the cells were not able to fully degrade IκBα upon a second TNFα challenge. Kinase assays of IKK activity revealed that regulation of IKK activity correlated in part with this transient refractory period. In contrast, experiments involving sequential exposure to TNFα and interleukin-1β indicated that receptor dynamics could not explain this phenomenon. Utilizing a well accepted computational model of NF-κB dynamics, we further identified an additional layer of regulation, downstream of IKK, that may govern the temporal capacity of cells to respond to a second proinflammatory insult. Overall, the data suggested that nuclear export of NF-κB·IκBα complexes represented another rate-limiting step that may impact this refractory period, thereby providing an additional regulatory mechanism. In response to a variety of extracellular ligands, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling regulates inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It is likely that cells are not continuously exposed to stimulating ligands in vivo but rather experience transient pulses. To study the temporal regulation of NF-κB and its major regulator, inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα), in real time, we utilized a novel transcriptionally coupled IκBα-firefly luciferase fusion reporter and characterized the dynamics and responsiveness of IκBα processing upon a short 30-s pulse of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or a continuous challenge of TNFα following a 30-s preconditioning pulse.

Adequate resolution of an inflammatory reaction is as equally important as initiation. Persistent or fulminant responses can cause detrimental consequences both locally and systemically (1Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and resolution of inflammation is important for both termination of an acute response as well as for prevention of destructive chronic responses. It is therefore not surprising that mechanisms aimed at rapid and specific initiation of proinflammatory reactions have co-evolved with mechanisms that provide timely termination of such processes. From a systems biology perspective, such “switchability” can be achieved by intracellular feedback loops that permit ligand-induced desensitization and resensitization of proinflammatory signaling cascades (2Winsauer G. de Martin R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 97: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In this regard, recent studies have shown that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 4The abbreviations used are:NF-κBnuclear factor-κBIκBinhibitor of NF-κBIKKIκB kinaseIL-1interleukin-1TNFαtumor necrosis factor αFLucfirefly luciferaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco/Vogt modified Eagle's minimal essential mediumIKK-KAIKK kinase assayCcontinuousPpulseP + Cpulse followed by continuousEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. 4The abbreviations used are:NF-κBnuclear factor-κBIκBinhibitor of NF-κBIKKIκB kinaseIL-1interleukin-1TNFαtumor necrosis factor αFLucfirefly luciferaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco/Vogt modified Eagle's minimal essential mediumIKK-KAIKK kinase assayCcontinuousPpulseP + Cpulse followed by continuousEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. signaling plays a critical role in both initiation and resolution of inflammation (2Winsauer G. de Martin R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 97: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. Immunol. Rev. 2006; 210: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-κB is a key regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses as well as a mediator of cell survival and proliferation (4Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). Improper regulation of NF-κB contributes to induction and progression of a wide range of human disorders, including a variety of pathological inflammatory conditions, neurodegenerative diseases as well as many types of cancer (5Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). In resting cells, inactive NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to members of the inhibitor of NF-κB(IκB) family. Canonical activation of NF-κB depends on IκB kinase (IKK)-regulated proteasomal degradation of IκBα, an event that frees NF-κB for nuclear translocation within minutes (4Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 7Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Upon nuclear transport, NF-κB regulates the transcription of a few hundred genes (8Bunting K. Rao S. Hardy K. Woltring D. Denyer G.S. Wang J. Gerondakis S. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7097-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Naamane N. van Helden J. Eizirik D.L. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Kim H.J. Hawke N. Baldwin A.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) that can be divided into four major families (10Kim H.J. Hawke N. Baldwin A.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar): 1) proinflammatory genes (e.g. cyclooxygenase 2, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), inducible nitricoxide synthase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, etc.), 2) proproliferative genes (e.g. cyclin D, and cellular myelocytomatosis), 3) antiapoptotic genes (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma extra long, X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis protein, and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis protein), and 4) autoinhibitory genes (e.g. A20, cylindro-matosis, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, and IκBα).With respect to the last, other transcriptionally independent processes, aimed at autoinhibition of NF-κB activity, do exist. Such mechanisms down-regulate NF-κB signaling on a much shorter time frame (seconds to minutes). These include homologous receptor desensitization (12Karmann K. Min W. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. 3rd Ed. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 771-785Google Scholar), asymmetric heterologous receptor desensitization (13Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. 3rd Ed. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 771-785Google Scholar, 14Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1161-1167PubMed Google Scholar), autocatalytic C-terminal IKK hyperphosphorylation (15Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and protein phosphatase 2C-dependent dephosphorylation of IKK (16Prajapati S. Verma U. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1739-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Considering the complex nature of the inflammatory milieu, one would expect that stationary tissue-residing cells are exposed to a myriad of temporally distinct NF-κB-stimulating cues. For instance, cells can be directly stimulated by pathogen-derived products (e.g. lipopolysaccharide through TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) receptors (17Trinchieri G. Sher A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar)), exposed to numerous soluble proinflammatory stimuli produced by circulating effector cells (e.g. cytokines, chemokines, etc.), and/or experience inflammation-induced oxidative stress (18Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). These signals can occur simultaneously or sequentially to one another. For example, systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to mice was shown to induce transient production of TNFα (serum levels peaking at ∼1.5 h and quickly returning to base line), but IL-1β production was delayed and prolonged (first detected at 2 h, but lasting >5-6 h) (19Blanque R. Meakin C. Millet S. Gardner C.R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, cells co-expressing TLR4, IL-1, and TNFα receptors would sequentially interrogate signals arising from lipopolysaccharide, TNFα, and IL-1β, each of which could independently activate NF-κB.Central to any signaling desensitization mechanism is a refractory period during which cells cannot fully respond to a second insult (autologous or heterologous desensitization). Therefore, consideration of the dynamic pattern of stimulus exposure described above begs the immediate question of whether cells can instantly initiate an NF-κB response to a second activating stimulus, and if not, when will such cells be able to remount a full response again? Specifically, are ligand-preconditioned cells capable of eliciting NF-κB activation to the same extent as naive cells?Little is known about the capacity of cells to activate NF-κB in response to a second activating challenge, since the highly dynamic nature of this process presents many technical difficulties. These include low temporal resolution of conventional transcriptionally dependent NF-κB reporter gene assays, low throughput, inability to acquire longitudinal data, and the semiquantitative nature of traditional biochemical assays (e.g. electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunoblotting, etc.). Such limitations render these assays incapable of accurate analysis of the early, ligand-induced dynamic changes in the capacity of cells to elicit a response to a second challenge.To efficiently address this question, we generated an improved, transcriptionally coupled version of a previously published genetically encoded IκBα-firefly luciferase (IκBα-FLuc) fusion reporter (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in conjunction with dynamic, live cell bioluminescence imaging of cultured cells. We chose to focus on HepG2 human hepatoma cells as a model system, because 1) NF-κB signaling has been extensively studied in these cells, 2) HepG2 cells have been shown to activate NF-κB in response to a variety of proinflammatory ligands (21Nejjari M. Hafdi Z. Dumortier J. Bringuier A.F. Feldmann G. Scoazec J.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 3) these cells can be easily transfected with readily available reagents, and, most importantly, 4) the pivotal role that NF-κB signaling plays in hepatocytes to regulate inflammation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis (22Wullaert A. van Loo G. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Using bioluminescence imaging of live cells in conjunction with a variety of biochemical assays, we demonstrate herein that a 30-s preconditioning exposure to TNFα is sufficient to robustly activate IKK, culminating in IκBα degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and strong transcriptional up-regulation of IκBα. Furthermore, the capacity of preconditioned cells to degrade IκBα in response to a second TNFα challenge is transiently refractory, regaining full responsiveness ∼120 min later. Finally, both IKK regulation and possibly NF-κB nuclear export, but not receptor dynamics, govern this transient refractory period. This study highlights the interlocking layers of NF-κB regulation, ensuring efficient and timely propagation as well as termination of proinflammatory signals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—d-Luciferin (potassium salt) was from Biosynth (Naperville, IL). Human TNFα and IL-1β were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science (Basel, Switzerland). [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Carbenicillin, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, ampicillin, kanamycin, glutathione S-transferase (GST), β-glycerolphosphate, NaCl, NaF, Na3VO4, KOH, MgCl2, EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Nonidet P-40, Tween 20, Triton X-100, ATP, dithiothreitol, paraformaldehyde, cycloheximide, and HEPES were from Sigma.Plasmids—pκB5→FLuc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) contains five repeats of a κB motif upstream of a minimal TATA box controlling expression of firefly luciferase. pκB5→IκBα-FLuc was produced by cloning an EcoRI/HpaI (blunt) fragment from pCMV→IκBα-FLuc (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and EcoRV (blunt) sites of pκB5→FLuc. pκB5→FLuc, pCMV→IκBα-FLuc, and pκB5→IκBα-FLuc were propagated in TOP10 electrocompetent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and purified using Qiagen HiSpeed Maxi Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). pGST-IκBαN (encoding for GST fused to the N-terminal fragment of human IκBα-(1-54)) was a kind gift from Prof. Alexander Hoffmann (University of California San Diego). pGST-IκBαN was propagated in BL21 codon+ E. coli cells (Stratagene).Cells and Transfections—HepG2 human hepatoma cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%) and l-glutamine (2 mm). Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HepG2 cells (105) were transiently transfected (Fugene 6; Roche Applied Science) with pκB5→IκBα-FLuc (200 ng/well) and plated in black-coated 24-well plates (In Vitro Systems GmbH, Gottingen, Germany). Cells were then allowed to recover for 48 h prior to imaging.Dynamic Bioluminescence Live Cell Imaging—Prior to imaging, cells were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and placed into 900 μl of colorless HEPES-buffered DMEM, supplemented as above and with d-luciferin (150 μg/ml). Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h (37 °C) before proceeding with ligand stimulation and imaging. Four different stimulation regimens were included in this study. 1) For continuous TNFα (C), TNFα (final concentration 20 ng/ml) or vehicle (colorless DMEM) was added (100 μl) to d-luciferin-containing DMEM, and imaging was performed before and at the indicated time points after the addition of TNFα.2) For TNFα pulse (30 s, P), cells were pulsed for 30 s with TNFα (20 ng/ml) or vehicle, washed with PBS, returned to d-luciferin-containing DMEM, and imaged before and at the indicated time points after the pulse of TNFα. 3) For TNFα preconditioning (30-s pulse) followed by continuous TNFα challenge (P + C), at t0 cells were pulsed for 30 s with TNFα (20 ng/ml) or vehicle, washed with PBS, returned to d-luciferin-containing DMEM (900 μl), and imaged before and at the indicated time points after the pulse of TNFα. At tx, TNFα (final concentration 20 ng/ml) or vehicle (colorless DMEM) were again added (100 μl), and imaging was performed before and at the indicated time points after the addition of TNFα.4) TNFα preconditioning (30-s pulse) followed by continuous IL-1β challenge (P + C) was as in method 3, but continuous challenge was performed with IL-1β (10 ng/ml).TNFα or IL-1β challenge was performed at the following time points: tx = 0 (no preconditioning) and 30, 60, 120, and 240 min postpreconditioning. Assay plates were imaged using an IVIS100 imaging system (Xenogen Caliper, Alameda, CA). Acquisition parameters were as follows: acquisition time, 60 s; binning, 4; field of view, 10 cm; f/stop, 1; filter, open; image-image interval, 5 min; number of acquisitions, 73 (360 min).To analyze ligand-induced regulation of de novo reporter resynthesis, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 1 h before continuous stimulation with TNFα and bioluminescence imaging (as above).IκBα Responsiveness Assays—HepG2 cells, transfected with pκB5→IκBα-FLuc (as above) or HeLa cells, stably expressing pCMV→IκBα-FLuc (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), were plated in 4 wells of a 6-well plate (one plate per time point) and grown for 48 h. At t0, all wells were washed with prewarmed PBS, pulsed for 30 s with TNFα (20 ng/ml, 1 ml) or vehicle (PBS), washed again with PBS, returned to regular medium (1 ml), and placed in a 37 °C incubator. This procedure was defined as TNFα preconditioning (P). At tx, two wells were treated (continuously) with TNFα (20 ng/ml), and two wells were treated with vehicle only (PBS). This procedure was defined as TNFα challenge (C). Following this TNFα challenge, cells were returned to the incubator. At tx + 25 min (time of maximal IκBα degradation (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); see Fig. 2A for schematic timeline), cells were harvested (by scraping) in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysates were normalized for protein content by a BCA protein assay (Promega), aliquoted, and frozen (-80 °C) for in vitro bioluminescence and Western blot analyses (see below). For in vitro bioluminescence assays, lysates (10 μl, in triplicate) were mixed with luciferase assay buffer (190 μl; 25 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm MgSO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 150 μg/ml d-luciferin, pH 8.0) in a 96-well plate immediately prior to imaging. Assay plates were imaged using the IVIS 100 bioluminescence imager (acquisition time, 10 s; binning, 4; field of view, 10 cm; f/stop, 1; filter, open).Western Blot Analyses—Whole cell lysates were resolved by 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed for the indicated proteins using standard immunoblotting techniques. Primary antibodies against total human IκBα, β-actin, and IKKα were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/36) was from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from GE Healthcare Biosciences.IKK Kinase Assay (IKK-KA)—IKK-KA reactions were carried out as per Werner et al. (23Werner S.L. Barken D. Hoffmann A. Science. 2005; 309: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and quantified in a medium throughput manner as per Hastie et al. (24Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H.J. Cohen P. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes to confluence. Cells were then washed in PBS (once) and treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα using three different treatment regimens: P, C or P + C (see above). To capture the full IKK activity profiles of cells treated with continuous (C) or pulse (P) regimens, cytosolic extracts were prepared at t = 0 (before) or 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, or 240 min post-TNFα treatment. To capture maximal IKK activity of P + C-treated cells, cytosolic extracts were prepared 10 min post-TNFα challenge (given at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min post-preconditioning). Cells were harvested by removing media, washing in ice-cold PBS + EDTA (1 mm), scraping, and pelleting at 2000 × g. To prepare cytosolic extracts, cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of cytosolic extract buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture), incubated on ice (2 min), vortexed (1 min), and pelleted at 2000 × g. Supernatants were collected, normalized for protein content by a Bradford assay (Pierce), and stored at -80 °C. To immunoprecipitate IKK complexes, cytoplasmic extracts (100 μl) were incubated with anti-IKKγ antibody (15 μl, overnight, 4 °C with rotation) and then with Protein G 4FF bead slurry (20 μl, 50% (v/v)). Beads were pelleted at 4600 rpm and washed twice with cytosolic extract buffer (500 μl) and once with Kinase Buffer (500 μl; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture). For the IKK kinase reaction, beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in Kinase Buffer (20 μl) containing 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of GST-IκBα-(1-54). Beads were removed by centrifugation (4600 rpm), and 15 μl of each reaction supernatant was spotted onto a 1-cm2 square of P81 phosphocellulose paper (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and immediately immersed in phosphoric acid (75 mm) for 5 min. Phosphoric acid washes were performed two more times, and papers were rinsed in acetone and then allowed to dry. Each paper was transferred to a scintillation vial, and radioactivity was determined on a β counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Blank and no-lysate controls were subtracted from the experimental samples. Data were represented as fold-initial (untreated controls).Calculating Ligand-dependent IKK Responsiveness—IKK responsiveness profiles (i.e. the net kinase capacity of IKK in response to a second challenge of TNFα, as a function of time after initial 30-s preconditioning) were calculated numerically from IKK-KA data using the following formula, IKKresponsiveness=PCx+10-Px+10PC0C10C0 where PCx + 10 is IKK activity of preconditioned plus challenged cells, as recorded 10 min postchallenge. Px + 10 is the residual IKK activity of preconditioned but unchallenged cells at this exact time point. C0 and PC0 are initial IKK activities of challenged but unpreconditioned and fully preconditioned and challenged cells, respectively. C10 is the maximal IKK activity of challenged but unpreconditioned cells (recorded 10 min postchallenge). Note that although all parameter units in the nominator and denominator are in counts/min, IKK responsiveness is dimensionless, similar to IκBα responsiveness.Computational Simulations—To simulate the dynamics of major regulators on the IKK-NF-κB axis, we used a well established computational model generated by Hoffmann et al. (25Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar) and refined by Werner et al. (23Werner S.L. Barken D. Hoffmann A. Science. 2005; 309: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Briefly, an experimentally or hypothetically derived IKK activity profile was fed into the program as an input. Embedded in the model were 24 components, 70 reactions, and 70 parameters or rate constants for these reactions. Differential equations were solved numerically using Matlab 7.0 (Mathworks, Natick, MA) with subroutine Ode15. Interpolated and extrapolated (0-360 min at 5-min intervals) IKK activity profiles were calculated (Origin version 7.5, OriginLab, Northampton, MA) from experimental IKK-KA data (see above). To fit the model, initial steady-state IKK activity (i.e. intracellular concentration of active IKK) was set to be 1 nm. To computationally simulate IκBα dynamics of cells challenged at different times after initial preconditioning, when assuming no upstream IKK or receptor regulation, we used hypothetical IKK activity profiles as inputs, derived from superimposing experimentally acquired IKK activity profiles of 30-s pulsed and continuously treated cells at increasing intervals (30, 60, 120, and 240 min; see Fig. 4, black lines).FIGURE 4Computational simulation of IκBα responsiveness in the absence of upstream receptor or IKK regulation. A, interpolated and extrapolated (0-360 min, at 5-min intervals) IKK activity profiles (right) of cells treated continuously (C, green curve) or by a 30-s pulse (P, blue curve) of TNFα (20 ng/ml) were used as inputs to computationally simulate total IκBα dynamics (right). B-E, left panels, hypothetical IKK activity profiles of preconditioned cells, challenged at the indicated times (denoted by black arrowheads) with a second, continuous dose of TNFα were generated by superimposing the continuous TNFα-induced IKK profiles at increasing intervals after the 30-s pulse TNFα-induced IKK profile. For generating these hypothetical profiles, we assume no preconditioning-induced receptor or IKK regulation. Right panels, the hypothetical IKK profiles were used as inputs into the model to predict IκBα dynamics. Note that challenge-induced IκBα degradation (initiated at the red arrowhead) is recovered in a time-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HepG2 cells were seeded into 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and grown to ∼40% confluence. Cells were pulsed for 30 s with TNFα as above and fixed at the indicated time points (by washing once with PBS, followed by fixation (4% paraformaldehyde for at least 15 min) and permeabilization (ice-cold methanol, 10 min at -20 °C)). Cells were washed in PBS, blocked in 5% normal goat serum in 0.3% Triton X-100, PBS (1 h), and then incubated with anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200 in 0.3% Triton X-100, PBS at 4 °C, overnight with rocking). Cells were next incubated with Alexa-Fluor 635-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen; 1:200 in 0.3% Triton X-100, PBS, 90 min, at room temperature with rocking). Cells were washed three times with PBS before being mounted with VECTASHIELD Mounting medium (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA). Confocal images were captured using the ×40 objective (water immersion) on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) laser-scanning microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM Image Browser and Adobe Photoshop CS2.RESULTSReal Time Bioluminescence Imaging of pκB5→IκBα-FLuc-expressing Cells Recapitulated IKK-induced Dynamics of Endogenous IκBα—To monitor ligand-induced IκBα rapid dynamics as well as physiologic transcriptionally coupled behavior, we modified our previous IκBα-FLuc fusion reporter (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to be driven by a synthetic promoter composed of five tandem κB response elements (TGGGGACTTTCCGC) followed by a minimal TATA-box. We hypothesized that this reporter would allow quantitative measurements of IKK-induced degradation as well as NF-κB-induced resynthesis and post-translational stabilization of IκBα from intact living cells (Fig. 1A). To validate use of this reporter, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding the reporter and allowed to recover for 2 days before stimulation with a continuous or 30-s pulse of TNFα (20 ng/ml) to induce IKK activation. Upon the addition of TNFα, a rapid and dramatic decrease in bioluminescence was observed when readouts were normalized to untreated controls (20Gross S. Piwnica-Worms D. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) under both continuous (C) and 30-s pulse (P) regimens (Fig. 1, B and C). This decrease in normalized bioluminescence, reflecting IKK-induced reporter degradation was followed by a sharp increase in bioluminescence, reflecting NF-κB-dependent reporter resynthesis, reaching maximum values at ∼120 min and then gradually declining toward base line. Note that the rate at which IκBα levels return to base line is steeper under continuous TNFα treatment compared with the 30-s pulse, providing evidence for reactivation of ligand-induced IκBα degradation during continuous stimulation (23Werner S.L. Barken D. Hoffmann A. Science. 2005; 309: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the initial de"
