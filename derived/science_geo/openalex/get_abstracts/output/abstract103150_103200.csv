https://openalex.org/W1982812308,"This study evaluated a rapid biomineralization phenomenon exhibited by an osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01 BSP, when treated with either organic phosphates [β-glycerophosphate (β-GP), Ser-P, or Thr-P], inorganic phosphate (Pi), or calcium. In a dose-dependent manner, these agents (2-10 m M) stimulated confluent cultures to deposit mineral in the cell layer (ED50of ∼ 4.6 m M for β-GP (30 ± 2 nmol Ca2+/μg DNA) and ∼3.8 m M (29 ± 2 nmol Ca2+/μg DNA) for Pi) with a plateau in mineral formation by 20 h (ET50≈ 12-15 h). β-GP or Pitreatment yielded mineral crystals having an x-ray diffraction pattern similar to normal human bone. Alizarin red-S histology demonstrated calcium mineral deposition in the extracellular matrix and what appeared to be intracellular paranuclear staining. Electron microscopy revealed small, needle-like crystals associated with fibrillar, extracellular matrix deposits and intracellular spherical structures. Mineral formation was inhibited by levamisole (ED50≈ 250 μM), pyrophosphate (ED50≈ 1-10 μM), actinomycin C1(500 ng/ml), cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), or brefeldin A (1 μg/ml). These results indicate that UMR 106-01 BSP cells form a bio-apatitic mineralized matrix upon addition of supplemental phosphate. This process involves alkaline phosphatase activity, on-going RNA and protein synthesis, as well as Golgi-mediated processing and secretion.

This process involves alkaline phosphatase activity, on-going RNA and protein synthesis, as well as Golgi-mediated processing and secretion. The ability to form an extracellular matrix that can undergo regulated mineralization is the ultimate phenotypic expression of an osteogenic tissue. Two patterns of mineral deposition on an extracellular matrix have been described: (i) matrix vesicle-mediated mineral initiation (1Sela J. Schwartz Z. Swain L.D. Boyan B.D. Bonucci E.

Recently, attention has been focused on a bone-specific glycoprotein known as bone sialoprotein (BSP)1 1The abbreviations used are: BSPbone sialoproteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineSEMscanning electron microscopyTEMtransmission electron microscopyβ-GPβ-glycerophosphateXRDx-ray diffractionAR-Salizarin red-SCPCcetylpyridinium chlorideEMEMEagle's minimal essential mediumDMEMDulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium. which nucleates hydroxyapatite formation in vitro (14Hunter G.K.

Understanding the various stages of mineral formation and subsequent propagation of the mineral phase is hindered by the inability to describe the initial events of the organic-inorganic interactions. An osteogenic cell culture model that initiates biomineralization in a rapid and reproducible manner would greatly facilitate exploring the variables that regulate the initiation of mineralization. In this report, we present data demonstrating such a model system. The rat osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01 BSP,2 2UMR 106-01 BSP designates that this cell line has been verified to synthesize large amounts of BSP as defined by McQuillian et al. (26, 27) and does not necessarily imply a distinction from the parent stock of UMR 106-01. was isolated from an induced transplantable osteosarcoma and shares a number of phenotypic properties with mature osteoblasts. These similarities include morphological appearance (17Underwood J.C.E. Melick R.A. Loomes R.S. Dangerfield V.M. Crawford A. Coulton L. Ingleton P.M. Martin T.J. Eur. J.

Additionally, UMR cells synthesize several matrix proteins expressed by normal osteoblasts including type I collagen (25Partridge N.C. Dickson C.A. Kopp K. Teitelbaum S.L. Crouch E.C. Kahn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 232-239Google Scholar), proteoglycans (26McQuillian D.J. Findlay D.M. Hocking A.M. Yanagishita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Biochem.

Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Google Scholar). UMR cells are distinguished from primary osteoblasts by their relatively high expression level of the oncogene H- ras, which is thought to induce the transformed state of these cells (29Scott D.K. Weaver W.R. Clohisy J.C. Brakenoff K.D. Kahn A.J. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1425-1432Google Scholar). When transplanted into a host animal, UMR cells can form bone mineral trabeculae in ectopic sites (18Martin T.J. Ingleton P.M. Coulton L.A. Melick R.A. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1979; 140: 247-254Google Scholar) demonstrating an osteogenic property. The current study demonstrates that cultured UMR cells rapidly form an apatitic-like, calcium-phosphate mineral associated with both the cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix. Data are presented that identify some of the biological requirements for this mineralization process. Potential mechanisms which may account for this cell line's ability to form apatitic mineral in vitro are discussed. Materials and reagents utilized in this study were of the highest grade commercially available. Tissue culture media were obtained from either Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone Laboratories; type I collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, 100 × nonessential amino acid solution, 1 M HEPES, pH 7, β-glycerophosphate, O-phospho- L-serine, O-phospho- L-threonine, levamisole, alizarin red-S, cetylpyridinium chloride, ascorbate (sodium salt), and tetrasodium pyrophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Cycloheximide, actinomycin C1, and brefeldin A were from Calbiochem. BSP was prepared from UMR 106-01 BSP cultures as described (28Midura R.J. McQuillian D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Google Scholar). All cultureware was from either Falcon/Becton Dickinson or Costar. Millicell-HA culture inserts (420 mm2; 0.45 μm porosity) were from Millipore. Paraffin (Ameraffin) was from Baxter Diagnostics. EM supplies were from Ted Pella. UMR 106-01 BSP cells were routinely passaged in T-75 culture flasks and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) plus nonessential amino acids, 20 m M HEPES, pH 7.2, and 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium) as described previously (28Midura R.J. McQuillian D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Google Scholar). The normal calcium and Piconcentrations for EMEM are 1.8 m M and 1 m M, respectively. Cultures were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere with routine passage every 3 days. Experimental cultures were created by briefly washing the confluent cell layer with Hank's balanced saline solution without Ca2+or Mg2+followed by trypsinization of the cells (10 ml of 0.05% trypsin + 0.53 m M EDTA in Hank's at 37°C for 10 min). Following formation of a dispersed cell suspension, cells were counted on a hemacytometer, and plated at 2000 cells/mm2into 35-mm tissue culture dishes (960 mm2) or 12-well cluster plates (380 mm2). Data in Fig. 9 were generated using microdot cultures (30Ahrens P.B.A. Solursh M. Reiter R.S. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Google Scholar) : UMR cells were plated at 5000 cells/mm2in 10-μl droplet cultures; four microdot cultures were plated per 35-mm dish followed by adding 2 ml of growth medium/plate 1 h later. Unless otherwise stated, cultures were routinely incubated for 48 h in growth medium followed by an incubation in fresh medium (with or without a phosphate supplement) for an additional 24 h. Sources of organophosphates (β-glycerophosphate (β-GP), phosphoserine (Ser-P), or phosphothreonine (Thr-P)) or inorganic phosphate (Pi) were prepared as sterile, 0.5 M solutions in water at neutral pH; pyrophosphate (PPi) was prepared as a 0.1 M solution in water at neutral pH. Aliquots of these phosphate agents were added directly to medium solutions just prior to their addition to the cultures. A series of control experiments were performed to determine whether a spontaneous crystallization occurs in culture medium containing Pior organophosphate supplements at 4 or 10 m M. Culture dishes were precoated (37°C for 1 h) with PBS alone or 5 μg/ml solutions of the following proteins in PBS: type I collagen, gelatin, or fibronectin. Growth medium (with or without phosphate supplements) was added to these culture dishes in the absence of cells and stored for 24 h at 37°C in the CO2incubator. Following incubation, the media were centrifuged (1500 × g for 10 min) while the dishes were processed for alizarin red-S staining to quantify calcium mineral content as described below. Alizarin red staining of the culture dishes (precoated or not) was not detected, and crystalline pellets were not observed in the various media following centrifugation. All drugs were prepared as sterile working solutions in growth medium on the day of the experiment. Ascorbate was prepared at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in growth medium and was added from freshly prepared stocks at each medium change. Levamisole was prepared as a 1 m M stock solution in growth medium, serially diluted in growth medium, and added to cultures simultaneously with the phosphate supplements. Cycloheximide was prepared as a 50 μg/ml stock solution in growth medium and added to cultures 1 h prior to adding the phosphate supplement. Preliminary experiments indicated that this dose of cycloheximide-inhibited protein synthesis to <5% of normal levels within 10 min of exposure. Actinomycin C1was stored foil-wrapped at −70°C as a 1 mg/ml solution in absolute ethanol. This actinomycin stock was diluted in growth medium to a working concentration of 500 ng/ml and added to cultures 1 h prior to adding the phosphate supplement. Preliminary experiments indicated that this dose of actinomycin inhibited RNA synthesis to <10% of normal levels within 20 min of exposure. Brefeldin A was resuspended in absolute ethanol at 1 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. This stock was diluted in growth medium to a working concentration of 1 μg/ml and added to cultures 1 h prior to the phosphate supplement. Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) without CaCl2(Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for the experiments analyzing the role of Ca2+by supplementing with CaCl2to 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 m M Ca2+levels. Unless otherwise indicated, experimental data are reported as mean ± S.D.; n = 3/trial; data representative of at least two trials. UMR cells were inoculated into Millicell HA culture inserts at 2000 cells/mm2and cultured for 48 h in growth medium. At this time, fresh growth medium in the presence or absence of an additional 5 or 10 m M Pi(or β-GP) was added to the cultures which were incubated for a further 24 h. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed and the culture inserts were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by fixation in ice-cold 70% ethanol (minimum fixation time of 1 h). After fixation, the ethanol was removed, and the fixed cell layers (attached to the filter membranes) were rinsed with Nanopure water (Bioresearch Nanopure System, Barnstead/Thermolyne) then stained with 40 m M alizarin red-S (AR-S), pH 4.2, for 10 min at room temperature. Stained cell layers were further processed by five rinses with Nanopure water followed by a 15-min wash with PBS (which removes most of the nonspecific stain not associated with calcium mineral deposits). Stained cell layers were then dehydrated with a series of ethanol solutions followed by xylene. Dehydrated cell layers on the filter membranes were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (7 μm) and mounted on glass slides for brightfield microscopy. Cultures were fixed (3% (v/v) glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, 10 min) followed by dehydration with graded acetone and critical point drying using a CO2gas/liquid technique (Balzer CPD 030). Samples were then sputter-coated with 25-nm Au/Pd (Balzer SCD 040) prior to viewing in an Amray 1820D SEM. Cultures were fixed (3% (v/v) glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer) for 1 h. Following rinsing in buffer and dehydration in a graded ethanol solution series, cultures were removed from the surface of the plastic dish with propylene oxide and embedded in Spurr's plastic. Following trimming, sections were placed on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate, and examined in a Zeiss EM 10 TEM. Cultures were established in 150-mm culture plates (2000 cells/mm2), grown for 48 h in growth medium, and then switched to growth medium supplemented with either 8 m M Pior 8 m Mβ-GP. Cultures were incubated for a further 72 h with fresh media changes every 24 h. After aspirating the medium and washing with PBS, the cell layers were scraped, washed in ice-cold ammoniated Nanopure water, and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min). The pellets were washed three times with 70% ethanol and lyophilized prior to analysis (each sample had a dry weight of ∼30 mg). X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a Rigaku x-ray Diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator calibrated to CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). A scintillation counter detector coupled to a linear ratemeter was used for data collection. Recordings were made in a continuous scan mode between 23 and 37° 2θ (where 2θ = the scattering angle) at an angular velocity of 0.25° 2θ/min. The modulated (10 s time constant) analog output signal from the ratemeter was converted at 0.01° intervals for plotting. The 002 apatite peak (between 24.7 and 27° 2θ) was recorded a minimum of four times at an angular velocity of 0.125° 2θ for x-ray line broadening analysis (31Klug H.P. Alexander L.E. X-ray Diffraction Procedures. John Wiley and Sons, New York1974Google Scholar). The size of the apatite crystals along the 002 diffraction vector was calculated from the width of the 002 peak at half-maximal height using the Scherrer equation (31Klug H.P. Alexander L.E. X-ray Diffraction Procedures. John Wiley and Sons, New York1974Google Scholar) : D = Kλ(57.3)/βcosθ = 8.15/β, where D is the crystal size, K is a geometric shape factor with a value of 0.9 for half-maximum line breadths, λ is the x-ray wavelength (0.154 nm), 57.3 is the radian-degree conversion factor, θ is half the diffraction angle for the 002 peak (12.94°), and β is the line width corrected for instrumental effects using Warren's relation (31Klug H.P. Alexander L.E. X-ray Diffraction Procedures. John Wiley and Sons, New York1974Google Scholar) : β = (B2- b2)1/2. In the latter equation, B is the measured width and b is the instrumental width as measured from the 002 peak of a well-crystallized hydroxyapatite having no intrinsic broadening. After x-ray diffraction analysis, the pellets were analyzed for Ca2+by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (see description below) and Piby the UV spectrophotometric method of Murphy and Riley (32Murphy J. Riley J.P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1962; 47: 31-36Google Scholar). Alizarin red-S (AR-S) is a dye which binds selectively to calcium salts and is widely used for calcium mineral histochemistry (33McGee-Russel S.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1958; 6: 22-42Google Scholar). AR-S binds ∼ 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of dye in solution (34Puchtler H. Meloan S.N. Terry M.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1969; 17: 110-124Google Scholar). At the end of each experiment, cultures were briefly rinsed with PBS followed by fixation (ice-cold 70% ethanol, 1 h). Cultures were rinsed with Nanopure water and stained for 10 min with 40 m M AR-S, pH 4.2, at room temperature with rotation (1 ml/35-mm dish). Cultures were then rinsed five times with water followed by a 15-min wash with PBS (with rotation) to reduce nonspecific AR-S stain. Stained cultures were photographed followed by a quantitative destaining procedure using 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in 10 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 15 min at room temperature. Aliquots of these AR-S extracts were diluted 10-fold in the 10% CPC solution, and the AR-S concentration determined by absorbance measurement at 562 nm on a multiplate reader (Vmax; Molecular Devices) using an AR-S standard curve in the same solution. Values were normalized to total DNA as described below. Following exposure to the respective reagents, cultures were washed twice with Saline G (with Ca2+and Mg2+), followed by extraction of cell layer mineral with a 24-h exposure to 0.6 N HCl in 0.02 M PBS (Ca2+and Mg2+free) at room temperature. PBS was used as the diluent for the HCl because it provided an iso-osmolar solution to prevent cellular lysis; the final pH of this solution was ∼2.0, and it quantitatively removed extracellular calcium from the cultures as assayed by AR-S histochemistry. Aliquots were then added to a solution of 2.5% (w/v) lanthanum oxide in 25% (v/v) HCl followed by atomic absorption analysis of calcium content using a Perkin Elmer model 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer optimized to 422.7 nm, slit width = 0.7 nm. The AA Lamp (0.125 nmol/ml detection limit) was optimized with a calcium standard curve (2.5-1200 nmol/ml) using a serial dilution of a calcium atomic absorption standard (Sigma, C-5649). Values were normalized to total DNA as described below. DNA was assayed in cultures separate from those processed for Ca2+mineral determination. Ethanol-fixed cultures were rinsed with Nanopure water and then solubilized with a solution of 10 M formamide, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 m M sodium acetate, pH 6.0 (60°C, 1.5 h). After cooling, lysates were sonicated briefly on ice (150 watts, 20 s) to reduce the viscosity of the samples. This solubilization procedure did not affect the double-stranded nature of the DNA necessary for fluorometric detection. DNA content was determined from replicate cultures using the high salt (2 M NaCl) Tris-NaCl-EDTA fluorometric approach with the Hoechst 33258 dye binding assay in a TKO 100 minifluorometer (Hoefer Scientific). UMR 106-01 BSP cells were plated at low density (∼ 420 cells/mm2) and allowed to proliferate up to 5 days with media changes every 48 h. These cultures exhibited a confluent state by 96 h as demonstrated by phase contrast microscopy (data not shown) and a near-plateau in DNA content (Fig. 1 b). Selected cultures on each day were provided with an additional 24-h exposure to medium with or without a phosphate supplement (10 m Mβ-GP or Pi) and were assayed for calcium mineral content using a quantitative AR-S staining procedure. A positive staining for calcium mineral was observed in cultures exposed to β-GP or Piand increased in a linear fashion through the entire culture period (Fig. 1 a). Mineral formation was not dependent on the presence of ascorbate addition to the medium (data not shown). When normalized to DNA content, a plateau in the amount of calcium mineral associated with the cell layer was obtained by 96 h of incubation (Fig. 1 c). Thus, mineral formation was maximal when cultures reached a confluent state. For all subsequent experiments, cells were plated at subconfluent density, allowed to grow to confluence, and then assessed for mineral formation within a subsequent 24-h period. Given this time frame, this model emphasizes the initiation of mineral formation rather than mineral propagation and maturation. Histological analysis of cross-sections from cultures stained with AR-S demonstrated a fairly uniform positive staining across the culture upon exposure to Pior β-GP. Cultures (∼2000 cells/mm2) were grown for 2 days in standard EMEM growth medium, then changed to growth medium containing either no phosphate supplement, 5 m M Pi, or 5 m Mβ-GP for an additional 24 h prior to fixation. Only cultures exposed to the supplemental phosphate demonstrated a positive AR-S stain for calcium mineral (Fig. 2). Cultures exposed to 10 m M supplemental phosphate were more difficult to section than those treated with the 5 m M concentration because of the higher amount of mineral content (data not shown). In addition to staining the extracellular matrix, AR-S staining was demonstrated within the cytoplasm and pericellular matrix (Fig. 2 c). Occasional regions of local nodular multicellularity were observed in both control and phosphate-supplemented cultures which were not the result of phosphate treatment. AR-S-positive accretions were observed to be deposited on the basal side of the cells within the supporting culture membrane. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated mineral-like structures in the pericellular environment associated with UMR 106-01 BSP cells upon addition of 5 m Mβ-GP for the terminal 24 h of a 72 h culture period (Fig. 3 a). Mineral deposition was observed to be localized to specific basal areas of the cultured cells with multiple cell processes making intimate contact with the superior surface of the mineral structures. Mineral deposits appeared to have a fibrillar component suggesting the association of organic matrix molecules in the calcium accretions. Transmission electron microscopy indicated the confluent cultures of UMR 106-01 BSP cells exhibit morphological features similar to normal osteoblastic cells: numerous cellular contacts involving multiple junctional complexes, large euchromatic nuclei, extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum, a well-developed Golgi apparatus, and multiple mitochondrial figures (Fig. 3 b). Extracellular mineral deposits of varying size were observed beneath and between cells (Fig. 3 , b and d). Many of these mineral deposits had small, needle-like crystals (Fig. 3 d), and some were located near, but rarely on, collagen fibrils (Fig. 3 c).Figure 3:Ultrastructural morphology of mineralizing cultures. UMR cultures were grown for 2 days in growth medium followed by a 24-h exposure to 5 m Mβ-GP. SEM ultrastructure (panel a) demonstrated a fibrillar appearance of mineral deposits (white arrow). TEM sections (panel b) demonstrated mineral deposits on the bottom of the culture dish (black arrow), collagenous extra-cellular matrix (panel c; asterisk denotes a small mineral deposit), and localized areas of needle-like spicule clusters (panel d). SEM: panel a, 2,000 × (final), bar = 10 μm; TEM: panel b, 10,000 × (final), bar = 1 μm; panel c, 59,000 × (final), bar = 0.5 μm; and panel d, 118,000 × (final), bar = 0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In phosphate-supplemented cultures, small electron-dense foci were observed inside several cells (Fig. 4). In general, they appeared spherical in shape with an electron-dense core and a less dense periphery. They numbered from a few to many within a cell and typically ranged in size from 0.2-0.5 μm in diameter (Fig. 4 a). Irregular-shaped, intracellular structures of 1-2 μm in size were occasionally observed and small, needle-like crystals detected within these structures (Fig. 4 b). Often, these electron-dense foci were observed near the cell surface and just outside the cell membrane suggestive of a secretory process (Fig. 4 a). The appearance and intracellular location of these structures are not consistent with the characteristics of matrix vesicles. Biological mineralization is a complex process resulting in the deposition of poorly crystalline solids of calcium and phosphate, principally bioapatites, on an extracellular matrix (11Eanes E.D. Bonucci E. Calcification in Biological Systems. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-18Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the mineral phase from UMR 106-01 BSP cultures was performed in order to assess the nature and crystalline quality of the solids formed in vitro. In order to accumulate enough material for XRD analysis, cultures were treated with 8 m Mβ-GP or 8 m M Pifor a period of 72 h with daily medium changes. The XRD patterns of the mineral phase showed two distinct peaks at 26 and 32° 2θ with a less distinct series of peaks at 28−29° 2θ (Fig. 5, c and d). Comparison to a reference standard of well -crystallized hydroxyapatite (Fig. 5 a) and a sample of human bone obtained from a 5-year-old patient (Fig. 5 b; courtesy Dr. U. Vetter) indicates the mineral phase from UMR 106-01 BSP is a poorly crystalline apatite with no evidence of additional crystalline phases. Scherrer's analysis (31Klug H.P. Alexander L.E. X-ray Diffraction Procedures. John Wiley and Sons, New York1974Google Scholar) of the width at half-maximal height of the 002 diffraction peak at 26° 2θ indicated that the mean size along the c axis or length direction of the crystal was 15.7 ± 0.6 and 14.8 ± 0.2 nm for the β-GP- and Pi-treated UMR cultures, respectively, and 19.4 ± 0.9 nm for the human bone sample. The molar Ca2+to Piratio of the mineral phase from the UMR cultures ranged from 1.53 to 1.74. Calcium mineralization within the cell layer increased as a function of increasing β-GP or Pisupplementation in confluent cultures of UMR 106-01 BSP cells exposed to a supplemental phosphate source for 24 h (Fig. 6).

CopB ATPase exhibited an apparent Kmfor Cu+and Ag+of 1 μM and for ATP of 10 μM. Transport was maximal at pH 6 and had an apparent Vmax of 0.07 nmol⋅min−1⋅mg−1for both copper and silver transport. Vanadate displayed a biphasic effect on transport: maximal inhibition was observed at 40 μM vanadate for copper transport and 60 μM for silver transport, respectively. At higher vanadate concentrations, these inhibitions were reversed. The CopB ATPase of E. hirae is thus a pump for the extrusion of monovalent copper and silver ions, with copper probably being the natural substrate.

The CopB ATPase of E. hirae is thus a pump for the extrusion of monovalent copper and silver ions, with copper probably being the natural substrate. Copper is an essential heavy metal ion by its function as a cofactor of many enzymes. Since copper can be very toxic to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, homeostatic mechanisms have evolved to balance the intracellular copper concentration. We have recently described one such mechanism in Enterococcus hirae that is dependent on the activity of two ATPases, CopA and CopB, that are regulated in their expression by the copper concentration (1Solioz M. Odermatt A. Krapf R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with whole cells had suggested that CopA serves in the uptake and CopB in the extrusion of copper (3Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on their primary structure, CopA and CopB were considered to be novel members of the family of P-type ATPases. Typical features of P-type ATPases, for which Ca2+-ATPases are paradigms, are a protein subunit of around 100 kDa, sensitivity to vanadate, and the formation of an acylphosphate intermediate in the transport reaction. The relatedness of P-type ATPases is also apparent by sequence features that are conserved in these enzymes form bacteria to man, such as the “phosphatase” domain, TGES, or the “phosphorylation” domain, DKTGT (4Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the presence of such conserved sequence elements in the CopB-ATPase, this protein also exhibits two features that are known from other heavy metal-binding proteins. These are (i) cysteine flanking the intramembranous conserved proline that forms the ion channel in P-type ATPases, and (ii) the N-terminal motif M XH XXMSGM XHS that is also found in a copper-binding protein of Pseudomonas syringae (5Cha J.S. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we had suggested that CopB is a copper ATPase (6Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Several putative copper ATPases similar to CopA and CopB of E. hirae have since been described from other organisms. Most notably, in humans, two ATPases with over 30% amino acid sequence identity to CopB were identified in connection with the copper metabolic diseases Menkes (7Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S.

Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Phung L.T. Ajlani G. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9651-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, hpCopA of Helicobacter pylori (15Ge Z. Hiratsuka K. Taylor D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and ccc2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank accession number L36317) were postulated to be copper-pumping ATPases. Similar genes that have as yet not been associated with any function are fixI of Rhizobium meliloti (16Kahn D. David M. Domergue O. Daveran M.L. Ghai J. Hirsch P.R. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), open reading frame YBR295w of S. cerevisiae, and open reading frame o732 of Escherichia coli (GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank accession numbers Z36164, L33259, and U00039, respectively). Of particular interest in this context are the cadmium resistance ATPases that have been cloned from three different microorganisms (17Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Shen Z.H. Kudyan N. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lebrun M. Audurier A. Cossart P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These proteins have metal binding motifs similar to those of the putative copper ATPases and thus appear to form, together with these, a family of heavy metal ATPases. The cadmium ATPases are the only members of this family for which heavy metal ion transport has actually been demonstrated. Native inside-out membrane vesicles of Bacillus subtilis harboring the Staphylococcus aureus cadA ATPase gene were shown to catalyze ATP-driven 109Cd2+accumulation (20Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the evidence that any of the postulated copper ATPases is indeed a copper pump has so far been indirect and rested on the behavior of whole cells in response to copper and on the special structural features of these pumps (1Solioz M. Odermatt A. Krapf R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Silver S. Nucifora G. Phung L.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we show ATP-driven 64Cu+and 110mAg+accumulation by the CopB ATPase in native membrane vesicles, thus providing direct evidence that CopB of E. hirae is a heavy metal ATPase. E. hirae wild-type (ATCC 9790, formerly called Streptococcus faecalis or faecium) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The generation of the gene-disrupted strains copA, copB, copAB, and copY have been described previously (2Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells were grown semi-anaerobically (the cultures were sealed but not made anaerobic) in 1% Na2HPO4⋅2H2O, 1% trypticase peptone (BBL), 0.5% yeast extract (BBL), 1% glucose. Growth was monitored by measuring the absorption of a 1:10 dilution in water at 546 nm. 5-Liter cultures were inoculated from frozen stocks of logarithmically growing cells and grown in a fermentor at 37°C. The cultures were induced with 500 μM CuSO4, added at an OD of 1.5-2, and grown for an additional 30 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 × g and washed once with 1.5 liters and once with 0.5 liter of 2 m M MgSO4. Protoplasts were obtained by suspending 10 g of cells in 60 ml of 250 m M K2SO4, 50 m M glycylglycine, 2 m M MgSO4, pH 7.2, and treating with 40 mg of lysozyme (Sigma) in the presence of 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 h at 37°C in an orbital shaking water bath. The protoplasts were centrifuged for 25 min at 23,000 × g and the pellet suspended in 20 ml of CT buffer (100 m M Tris-Cl, 150 m M KCl, 50 m M NaCl, 5 m M MgSO4, pH 6.5) for copper transport experiments or ST buffer (100 m M Tris-SO4, 25 m M K2SO4, 25 m M Na2SO4, 5 m M MgSO4, pH 7) for silver transport experiments. The protoplasts were supplemented with 1 mg of DNase I (Sigma) and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem-type homogenizer before passing them through a French press at 70 Megapascal. Unlysed cells were collected by centrifugation for 12 min at 23,000 × g and the membrane fraction collected by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 90,000 × g. The membrane pellets were washed by resuspension in the same buffer and centrifuging as before. The final pellet was suspended in 2.5 ml of the same buffer and frozen in aliquots at −70°C. The protein concentration of these preparations was 3-4 mg/ml as determined with the Bradford protein assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208216) Google Scholar). For all experiments, frozen membranes were thawed just before use. No loss in activity of frozen membranes was observed over 2 months. 0.1 mg of membrane protein was suspended in 1 ml of CT buffer, supplemented with 5 m M dithiothreitol, 0.5-5 μCi of 64Cu+(University of Missouri Research Reactor, Columbia, MO; specific activity: 1-300 Ci/mg, depending on the time of use) and 0.05-10 μM cold copper, added as CuSO4, as specified under “Results.” After 30 min preincubation at 37°C with rotary shaking, transport was initiated by adding 0.5 m M Na-ATP, pH 6.5. 100-μl samples were taken at intervals and filtered through 25-mm filter disks of 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) that had been stored for at least 1 h in CS buffer containing 1 m M CuSO4. The vesicle deposits on the filters were immediately washed twice with 1 ml of CT buffer containing 1 m M CuSO4, the moist filters dissolved in scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity determined in a β-counter. For the measurements of the pH dependence of transport, CT buffer was adjusted to the corresponding pH values with Tris base. Incubations at low pH were performed in phosphate buffer of the following composition: 50 m M NaPi, 50 m M Tris-Cl, 75 m M KCl, 25 m M NaCl, 5 m M MgSO4, adjusted to the desired pH with NaOH. The wash steps were performed with CT buffer of the corresponding pH and containing 1 m M CuSO4. For the measurement of vanadate inhibition, VO43− was added to the vesicles at the onset of the preincubation. Silver transport experiments were conducted in the absence of dithiothreitol. 0.1 mg of membrane protein was preincubated for 10 min at 37°C with 1 μM tetrachlorosalicylanilide and 0.5 μM valinomycin in ST buffer. 0.2 μCi of 110mAg+(Amersham Corp., 2 mCi/mg) and 0.2-10 μM AgNO3, as required by the experiment, were added and preincubation continued for 10 min. Other details of the procedure were as described for copper transport, except that the filters were preincubated and washed with ST buffer containing 1 m M AgNO3. To demonstrate copper transport by the CopB ATPase of E. hirae, native membrane vesicles proved to be a suitable preparation. Such vesicles are a mixed population of inside-out and right-side-out vesicles. However, since the bacterial membrane is impermeable to ATP, only vesicles with the ATP binding site of the ATPase facing outside (inside-out vesicles) will respond to added ATP. Fig. 1 shows ATP-stimulated copper accumulation into vesicles. The most rapid copper accumulation was observed in the complete reaction, which contained 5 m M dithiothreitol. Since dithiothreitol reduces the added copper(II) to copper(I), the transported species under these conditions is copper(I). Very little copper was taken up without ATP. If dithiothreitol was omitted from the reaction, a basal level of copper uptake and high background binding were observed. 40 μM vanadate, a specific inhibitor of P-type ATPases, inhibited the dithiothreitol-stimulated copper uptake (see also below). E. hirae membrane vesicles thus display ATP-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive accumulation of Cu+. Approximately the same basal level of transport under nonreducing conditions or in the presence of 40 μM vanadate was observed in all experiments. It was not sensitive to uncouplers, and its origin is not clear. Conceivably, it is due to nonspecific secondary transport or binding. For calculation, we subtracted the basal dithiothreitol-independent rate of transport. The experiments of Fig. 1 were conducted with a strain that overexpresses both the CopA and the CopB ATPase due to disruption of the regulatory gene copY (22Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To ascertain weather CopA or CopB was responsible for the observed copper accumulation, we employed strains that were null mutants in either CopA (ΔcopA), CopB (ΔcopB), or both (ΔcopAB). Fig. 2 shows that wild-type and a strain only possessing CopB exhibited high copper transport activity, whereas strains deficient in either CopB, or both CopA and CopB, only displayed the basal, dithiothreitol-independent level of transport activity. We thus conclude that copper(I) is accumulated in vesicles by the action of the CopB ATPase. This is in line with the proposed in vivo function of CopB in copper resistance by exporting copper from the cytoplasm. Further investigation of CopB was conducted in the ΔcopA strain only expressing CopB. We had previously shown that whole cells can extrude silver and suggested that the enzyme involved in the process is the CopB ATPase (3Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To corroborate these in vivo observations, we investigated silver transport by native membrane vesicles. Fig. 3 shows that vesicles containing only the CopB ATPase showed ATP-stimulated accumulation of 110mAg+. In the absence of ATP or in membranes devoid of CopB, there were basal levels of silver accumulation similar to those observed in copper transport experiments. These basal rates were somewhat, but not completely, suppressed by the K+and H+ionophores valinomycin and tetrachlorosalicylanilide. Dithiothreitol, which proved essential to measure Cu+transport, was not required for silver transport; in fact, it interfered with the Ag+measurements, probably by interacting with Ag+. These results show that silver(I) is a substrate for the CopB ATPase and that dithiothreitol employed in the copper transport experiments is not required by the vesicles, but strictly serves to reduce copper(II) to copper(I). That Ag+can replace Cu+had also been observed in other instances, such as for the copper-dependent yeast transcription factor ACE1 (24Furst P. Hamer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5267-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the analysis of kinetic parameters of copper transport by CopB. The reaction had an apparent Vmax of 0.07 nmol⋅min−1⋅mg−1and a Kmfor Cu+of 1 μM. However, these values must be interpreted cautiously; the reaction contains the copper binding entities Tris, dithiothreitol, and the membrane vesicles. We thus cannot know the exact concentration of free Cu+ions, and the value we derived for the Kmis most likely an overestimate. Nevertheless, the enumeration of kinetic parameters is useful in connection with the analysis of mutant forms of CopB. The Kmfor ATP was 10 μM, and the kinetic parameters for silver transport by CopB were essentially the same as those for copper, although the same uncertainty regarding the free silver concentration applies (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows the pH dependence of the transport by the CopB ATPase. Maximal activity was observed at pH 6. At more acidic pH values, the ATPase activity dropped rapidly, whereas at increasing pH, only a gradual decline in activity was observed. We previously showed that the Na+-ATPase that is present in E. hirae is also active up to pH 9. At high pH, E. hirae can have a very small or no proton motive force and can no longer rely on symporters and antiporters for the ionic control of the cytoplasm and becomes dependent on the operation of primary transport systems (25Solioz M. Davies K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9453-9459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the regulation of cytoplasmic copper is vital at high pH, the cell needs a copper pump that can operate under these conditions. Vanadate is a specific inhibitor of P-type ATPases and therefore is a diagnostic tool for these enzymes (26Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 186-189Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The vanadate inhibition of copper and silver transport was analyzed in more detail in Fig. 6. An unusual, biphasic inhibition curve was observed. Copper transport was progressively inhibited by up to 40 μM VO43− and silver transport by up to 60 μM VO43−. A maximal level of 85% inhibition was observed for copper and 76% for silver transport. These inhibitions were reversed at higher vanadate concentrations. We have no obvious explanation for this behavior. The different minima in the inhibition curves for copper and silver transport may be due to the presence of dithiothreitol in only the copper experiments. Vanadium has a complex chemistry with many different oxidation states and polymeric forms (27Pope M.T. Dale B.W. Rev. Chem. Soc. 1968; 22: 527-545Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Conceivably, under the reducing conditions of the copper transport reaction, species of vanadium other than VO43− act on CopB. Indeed, it has been observed that the combination VO43−/glutathione leads to the formation of a vanadium species that activates adiposite cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (28Souness J.E. Thompson W.J. Strada S.J. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1985; 10: 383-396PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, both silver and copper transport show the same unusual, biphasic vanadate inhibition curve. The meaning of this inhibition/activation pattern remains to be elucidated. We here show that CopB of E. hirae is an ATP-driven pump that can expel Cu+and Ag+from the cytoplasm. It is the first example of a P-type ATPase for which copper (and silver) transport has been shown. Wild-type E. hirae can tolerate up to 8 m M copper in the media, and we have shown by genetic analysis that CopB is required for this resistance (2Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of the CopB ATPase is thus the control of cytoplasmic copper by extruding it from the cell. The growth requirement of microorganisms for copper is satisfied by 1-10 μM copper (29Cervantes C. Gutierrez-Corona F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); these concentrations are not toxic to E. hirae and do not induce the cop-operon. Cytoplasmic copper concentrations may therefore be in this micromolar range and a Kmof 1 μM for copper transport by CopB appears reasonable. Silver, in contrast to copper, is not essential for cell growth and is extremely toxic to E. hirae: 5 μM Ag+inhibits cell growth. Silver transport catalyzed by CopB is probably fortuitous and does not serve a physiological role. That copper(I) and not copper(II) is the substrate of CopB suggests that in the cytoplasm, copper not sequestered by copper enzymes occurs in the copper(I) form, either due to the reducing environment of the cytoplasm or through the action of reductases. The Vmax of 0.07 nmol⋅min−1⋅mg−1for copper transport by vesicles is very low. The only comparable system, the CadA ATPase of S. aureus, displayed transport rates for 109Cd2+that were roughly 100-fold higher (20Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, CadA of S. aureus is a plasmid-encoded resistance mechanism only present in some strains, whereas the CopB ATPase of E. hirae is a chromosomally coded function of copper homeostasis. The observed transport rates may be sufficient to deal with excess cytoplasmic copper, although we cannot entirely rule out that our experimental conditions do not result in full activity. P-type ATPases, which evidently have evolved from a common precursor, have developed into a versatile group of ion pumps capable of transporting H+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+and, as shown here, Cu+and Ag+. Of this collection of ions, Cd2+, Cu+, and Ag+are distinct in that they are heavy metal ions and thus have special properties. In particular, they strongly interact with the side chains of cysteine and histidine residues. This must be reflected by the primary structures of heavy metal ion ATPases. When inspecting the amino acid sequences of the S. aureus Cd2+-ATPase and the E. hirae Cu+(Ag+)-ATPase, the only two heavy metal ATPases of known ion specificity, two features are particularly apparent: one or two cysteines flanking the proline residue that is believed to be part of the ion channel through the membrane, and the presence of heavy metal binding motifs in the N terminus. The proline residue of the purported ion channel is located in a putative transmembranous helix and is invariant in all known P-type ATPases. Site-directed mutagenesis of this amino acid in the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum showed that this proline is essential for transport (30Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is embedded in the sequence IPE-309 in the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. Although no cysteines are found adjacent to this proline in any of the non-heavy metal ATPases, it is flanked by two cysteines in the Cd2+-ATPase (CPC-373) and a cysteine and a histidine (CPH-398) in the CopB ATPase. All the postulated copper ATPases display the motif CPC in corresponding positions (CPSC in the putative H. pylori ATPase). This clearly suggests that the presence of the CPC motif is indicative of heavy metal ion transport. The other structural element that is being considered typical for heavy metal ATPases is the heavy metal ion binding domain in the polar N-terminal region of these enzymes. The consensus sequence G XXC XXC, present in the N terminus of CadA, occurs in all conjectured copper ATPases, but is absent from CopB of E. hirae. In the proposed copper ATPases encoded by the human Wilson and Menkes disease genes, the motif G XXC XXC is even repeated five and six times, respectively, and forms part of a reiterated building block of 60-70 amino acids (31Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The notion that this motif forms a general heavy metal ion binding site originates from the observation that the same structural element also occurs in mercury reductases and periplasmic mercury binding proteins (32Silver S. Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 76-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rather than the consensus sequence G XXC XXC, the N terminus of CopB features three repeats of the type M XH XXMSGM XHS. Similar motifs are also found in a periplasmic copper binding protein of P. syringae and has been postulated to form copper binding domains (5Cha J.S. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Also, CopB is the only ATPase known to date that possesses the sequence CPH at the site of the proposed ion channel. Why CopB differs from the other heavy metal ATPases in these regards is at present not clear. A possibility that should not be discarded at this point is that the substrates for at least some of the putative “copper” ATPases is in fact not copper, but another heavy metal ion. Since radioactive copper is not readily available in Europe, M. S. performed the copper transport experiments at the Howard Hughes Medical Center of the University of California, San Francisco. We are grateful to Jane Gitschier and Seymour Packman for their very generous hospitality that made this work possible. Thanks are also due to Christopher Vulpe for his help and very stimulating discussions and to Susan Whitney and Thomas Weber for excellent technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2073790149,"Previous observations have shown that binding of growth hormone to its receptor leads to activation of transcription factors via a mechanism involving phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. In order to establish whether the prolactin-activated transcription factor Stat 5 (mammary gland factor) is also activated by growth hormone, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently expressing transfected Stat 5 and growth hormone receptor cDNA. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift analyses revealed the growth hormone-dependent presence of specific DNA-binding proteins in these extracts. The complexes formed could be supershifted by polyclonal anti-Stat 5 antiserum. In other experiments nuclear extracts from growth hormone-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing transfected growth hormone receptor cDNA and liver from growth hormone-treated hypophysectomized rats were used for gel electrophoresis mobility shift analyses. These also revealed the presence of specific DNA-binding proteins sharing antigenic determinants with Stat 5. Stat 5 cDNA was shown to be capable of complementing the growth hormone-dependent activation of transcription of a reporter gene in the otherwise unresponsive COS-7 cell line. This complementation was dependent on the presence of Stat 5 tyrosine 694, suggesting a role for phosphorylation of this residue in growth hormone-dependent activation of DNA-binding and transcription. Previous observations have shown that binding of growth hormone to its receptor leads to activation of transcription factors via a mechanism involving phosphorylation on tyrosine residues.

Depletion of cellular ATP inhibited 25Ca uptake by 40% or more and reduced the half-maximal Na+ concentration for inhibition of 25Ca uptake from 90 to 55 m M. ATP depletion also reduced the rate of rise in [Ca2+]i when [Na+]o was reduced and inhibited the decline in [Ca2+]i when high [Na+]o was restored. The effects of ATP depletion were either absent or reduced in cells expressing a mutant exchanger missing most of the cytosolic hydrophilic domain. We were unable to detect a phosphorylated form of the exchanger in immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled cells. ATP depletion caused a breakdown in the actin cytoskeleton of the cells. Treatment of the cells with cytochalasin D mimicked the effects of ATP depletion on the [Na+] inhibition profile for 25Ca uptake. Thus, ATP depletion inhibits both the Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ efflux modes of Na/Ca exchange, and may alter the competitive interactions of extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ with the transporter. The latter effect appears to be related to changes in the actin cytoskeleton.

Interest in trace gas emissions has increased over the last two decades following the realization of their impact on atmospheric chemistry (1Brasseur G.P. Chatfield R.B. Sharkey T.D. Holland E.A. Mooney H.A. in Trace Gas Emissions by Plants. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 1-29Google Scholar). Halogen- and sulfur-containing organic gases have attracted particular attention because of their respective effects on the integrity of stratospheric ozone (2Prather M.J. Watson R.T. Nature. 1990; 344: 729-734Google Scholar) and the formation of acid rain (3Nriagu J.O. Holdway D.A. Coker R.D. Science. 1987; 237: 1189-1192Google Scholar). Biological activity in the oceans is commonly viewed as a major source of organohalogen (4Lovelock J.E. Nature. 1975; 256: 193-194Google Scholar, 5Manley S.L. Dastoor M.N. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1987; 23: 709-715Google Scholar) and organosulfur emissions (6Lovelock J.E. Maggs R.J. Rasmussen R.A. Nature. 1972; 237: 452-453Google Scholar, 7Aneja V.P. Cooper W.J. ACS Symp. Ser. 1989; 393: 2-13Google Scholar). Terrestrial microorganisms, fungi, and a few higher plants also emit these gases (8Harper D.B. Sigel H. Sigel A. in Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 345-388Google Scholar, 9Rennenberg H. Sharkey T.D. Holland E.A. Mooney H.A. in Trace Gas Emissions by Plants. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 217-260Google Scholar). The biochemical bases for these emissions, however, remain poorly understood. Possible mechanisms involve spontaneous (10Zafiriou O.C. J. Mar. Res. 1975; 33: 75-81Google Scholar) or enzymatic (11Neideleman S.L. Geigert J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1983; 48: 39-52Google Scholar, 12Ohigashi K. Tsunetoshi A. Ichihara K. Med. J. Osaka Univ. 1951; 2: 111-117Google Scholar) reactions. A haloperoxidase-mediated incorporation of halides into a carbon skeleton was suggested as the main route for halomethane biosynthesis (11Neideleman S.L. Geigert J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1983; 48: 39-52Google Scholar) but has never been actually shown to produce monohalomethanes. Subsequently, an enzymic mechanism involving a single-step conversion of halides into a monohalocarbon was proposed (13Harper D.B. Kennedy J.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 1231-1246Google Scholar); this was supported by evidence for incorporation of the methionine methyl group into a monohalomethane (14White R.H. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 100-102Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported (15Wuosmaa A.M. Hager L.P. Science. 1990; 249: 160-162Google Scholar) that a methyl chloride transferase from the marine red alga Endocladia muricata could carry out the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl- L-methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosyl-L-methionineX-halide ionAdoHcyS-adenosyl-L-homocysteineTEMEDN,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBisTris2-[bis(2hydroxyethyl) aminoJ-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-l,3-diol. to a halide (X−) as follows.

Preliminary evidence was also presented for a similar activity in a wood-rotting fungus, Phellinus pomaceus, and a halophytic higher plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. Methanethiol was originally thought to come from methionine via a methioninase (L-methionine methanethiol-lyase) reaction (12Ohigashi K. Tsunetoshi A. Ichihara K. Med. J. Osaka Univ. 1951; 2: 111-117Google Scholar). However, the observation that several bacterial isolates from soil and agricultural crops as well as cultures of marine algae evolved CH3SH in the presence of bisulfide (HS−) suggested that this gas may also be produced via a different mechanism (16Drotar A.M. Burton Jr., G.A. Tavernier J.E. Fall R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 1626-1631Google Scholar). Thiol methyltransferases, capable of catalyzing the following reaction, were later found in a variety of organisms including bacteria (16Drotar A.M. Burton Jr., G.A. Tavernier J.E. Fall R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 1626-1631Google Scholar), algae (17Drotar A.M. Fall R. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 847-854Google Scholar), and mammals (18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar, 19Weisiger R.A. Pinkus L.M. Jakoby W.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2885-2887Google Scholar). HS-+AdoMet→CH3SH+AdoHcyReaction 2 A survey of higher plants done in our laboratory (20Saini H.S. Attieh J.M. Hanson A.D. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) showed that many diverse species produce CH3I when supplied with I−, and CH3SH when supplied with HS−, in a manner similar to Reactions 1 and 2. The levels of the two activities were highly correlated among species. Plants from the family Brassicaceae exhibited some of the highest rates of CH3I and CH3SH production. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these environmentally important gas emissions, we developed an easy and reliable assay for their quantitation and proceeded to purify and characterize the halide- and bisulfide-methylating activities. Plant MaterialPlants of Brassica oleracea cv. April Red were grown in a greenhouse under a photoperiod of at least 12 h and were watered and fertilized as necessary. The two most expanded basal leaves of 3-month-old plants were used for enzyme extraction. Chemicals S-Adenosyl- L-methionine was from Boehringer Mannheim. The inorganic phosphorus test kit, S-adenosyl- L-homocysteine, 5′-ADP-agarose, KI, KBr, and KCl were purchased from Sigma. Ammonium sulfide and authentic CH3SH, CH3Br, and CH3I were obtained from Aldrich. Authentic CH3Cl was purchased from Liquid Carbonic (Scarborough, Ontario, Canada). Sephadex G-100, Sephadex G-25, gel filtration calibration kit, and Polybuffer 74 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The protein dye reagent, TEMED, ammonium persulfate, and bisacrylamide were all from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. BuffersThe buffers used were as follows: 100 m M Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol (v/v) and 14 m M 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A); 25 m M Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and 14 m M 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B); 25 m M Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 14 m M 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer C); buffer C with 100 m M NaCl (buffer D); 25 m M BisTris/iminodiacetic acid, pH 7.0 (buffer E); and Polybuffer 74/ iminodiacetic acid (1:10, v/v), pH 4.0 (buffer F). All buffers were filtered before use through a 0.22-μm membrane. Measurement of Halide/Bisulfide Methyltransferase Activity Since I−was the preferred substrate among halides, it was used as the halide substrate throughout the purification procedure. The enzyme activity was assayed in a 1-ml mixture containing 0.5 m M AdoMet, 50 m M KI (halide methylation), or 20 m M (NH4)2S (bisulfide methylation) all prepared in buffer A. Enzyme preparations containing up to 200 μg of protein were used to start the reaction. The mixture was incubated in a 5-ml glass vial sealed with a screw cap fitted with a Teflon-lined septum (Supelco, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and maintained on an orbital shaker (150 rpm) at room temperature. The reaction rate was linear for at least 45 min at all enzyme and substrate concentrations. A standard incubation time of 30 min was adopted. The products formed were analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. One-ml headspace samples were injected in a 210 × 0.3-cm stainless steel column packed with 80/100-mesh Porapak Q (Supelco) in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph. Column temperatures were 160°C for CH3I and CH3Br, 145°C for CH3SH, and 130°C for CH3Cl. The carrier gas (helium, ultrapure) flow rate was 40 ml/min. The column was purged by heating to 200°C between injections. Products were quantified by peak area and identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic methyl halides or CH3SH, which were used to calibrate the instrument. Recoveries of 75 nl of CH3I and 28 nl of CH3SH injected to vials containing the assay mixture were 69 and 87%, respectively, after 30 min. The data presented here were not corrected for recoveries. The identity of CH3I and CH3SH in the headspace of enzyme assays was confirmed by mass spectrometry using a KRATOS MS 50 mass spectrometer operated in the electron impact mode. Protein EstimationTotal soluble proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein reagent, following the microassay procedure, and using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation of Adenosine-Agarose Affinity Gel5′-ADP-agarose (4 ml) was washed under vacuum according to the manufacturer' instructions and incubated with 800 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and 5 ml of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase buffer (1 ×), pH 7.5, in a total volume of 9 ml. The gel was dephosphorylated overnight at 37°C in a continuously rotating reaction vial, transferred to a column, washed with 10 ml of buffer C containing 2 M NaCl, and washed again with 20 ml of buffer C alone. The washing was done in fractions of ∼10 ml, which were subsequently assayed for phosphate content. The dephosphorylation reaction was repeated until no more phosphate was detected. The gel was washed with an excess of deionized water before each reaction. Free phosphate was determined colorimetrically with the method of Fiske and Subbarow (22Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. BioI. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Purification of Halide/Bisulfide Methyltransferase All manipulations were carried out at 4°C unless stated otherwise. Halide- and HS−-methylating activities were monitored simultaneously throughout the purification procedure. Generally, 1 kg of freshly harvested leaves were cut into small squares, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then homogenized with buffer A (1:3, w/v) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (10%, w/w) for 5 min in a blender at full speed. The homogenate was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant (crude extract) was recovered, and enzyme activity and protein concentration were assayed in an aliquot desalted by passage through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia). The crude extract was fractionated with solid (NH4)2SO4, and the proteins that precipitated between 60 and 85% saturation, containing halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities, were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet from the 60-85% (NH4)2SO4fraction was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (2.6 × 90 cm) that had been previously equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with buffer B at 25 ml/h, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The active fractions from this step were pooled and concentrated by diafiltration in a stirred Amicon cell fitted with a YM-30 membrane (Amicon, Danvers, MA). The concentrated sample was applied to an adenosine-agarose column (1.5 × 3 cm) that had been previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed at a constant flow rate of 10 ml/h with 15 ml of buffer B, followed by 8 ml of the same buffer containing 300 m M (NH4)2SO4. The salt was then removed by washing the column with buffer B. The halide- and bisulfide-methylating activities were recovered by elution with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0-4 m M AdoMet in buffer B. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for activity and protein content. The halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities eluted between 2 and 3 m M AdoMet. The remaining bound proteins were washed off the column with 2 M NaCl in buffer B; no methyltransferase activity was detected in this fraction. Active eluate from the affinity step was submitted to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Millipore, Milford, MA) on a 1 × 10-cm Protein Pak Q anion exchange column (Millipore) equilibrated with buffer C. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the column was washed with the same buffer until no further UV-absorbing material was eluted. Enzyme activity was then eluted with NaCl in buffer C in a two-step linear gradient of 0-200 m M in 80 min and 200-500 m M in 20 min, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The fraction containing the first peak of halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activity from the previous step was loaded on an HPLC Superdex 75 gel filtration column (1 × 30 cm) (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer D. Proteins were eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. At this level of purification the halide and bisulfide methyltransferase preparation was apparently free from contaminating proteins. ChromatofocusingAn enzyme preparation from the Sephadex G-100 gel filtration step was subjected to HPLC chromatofocusing on a Mono P HR (5/20) column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer E. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the column with the same buffer. Enzyme activity was then eluted with a pH gradient of 7.0-4.0 generated with 45 ml of buffer F at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected in 0.2 ml of 500 m M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.7, containing 50% glycerol. Molecular Weight DeterminationMolecular weight of the native halide/bisulfide methyltransferase was determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 × 44 cm) calibrated with the following markers: ribonuclease A (Mr13,700), chymotrypsinogen A (Mr25,000), ovalbumin (Mr43,000), and albumin (Mr67,000). The column void volume was determined with blue dextran 2000. Buffer B was used for column equilibration and elution. One-ml samples were applied to the column, which was operated at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. In order to achieve better resolution, column calibration was done in two steps, the first involving ribonuclease A and ovalbumin and the second involving albumin and chymotrypsinogen A. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Proteins from different purification steps were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Blue. The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was determined from a plot of log molecular mass against the migration distance of standard proteins. Determination of Kinetic PropertiesThe kinetic properties of the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase were determined using a preparation purified through a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration step. Alternative substrate competition experiments were performed by varying the concentration of one substrate at each of a series of concentrations of the other. The concentration of AdoMet was kept constant at 0.5 m M. Data were presented as double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity (v) versus varying substrate (S) concentrations. Substrate interaction studies were done by fixing the concentration of one substrate while changing that of the other. Linear regressions were fitted to the data in double-reciprocal plots. Replots of the data were used to determine the kinetic parameters. B. oleracea leaf extracts catalyzed the AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer to X−or HS−. The enzyme responsible for both of the reactions was purified to homogeneity, and its dual function was demonstrated. The enzyme was extracted from B. oleracea by subjecting leaf tissue to a freeze-thaw cycle prior to homogenization and was purified using (NH4)2SO4precipitation followed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-100, affinity chromatography on adenosine-agarose, and HPLC on Protein Pak Q anion exchange and Superdex 75 gel filtration columns. The specific activity of the enzyme was enriched more than 1000-fold over the crude preparation with a recovery of 0.35%. summarizes the purification procedure, and Fig. 1shows a typical pattern of proteins from various purification steps separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue. Affinity chromatography on adenosine-agarose was efficient in removing most of the contaminating proteins (Fig. 2). Further purification was achieved by anion exchange HPLC, which resolved four peaks of halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity (Fig. 3). The first and largest peak of activity eluting from this column contained only two proteins as seen on the SDS gel (Fig. 1). Further purification of this peak by HPLC on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column resolved two protein peaks, only one of which contained halide/bisulfide-methylating activity. This peak appeared free of contaminants when visualized on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The Superdex-purified halide/bisulfide methyltransferase migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 28,000 daltons. Since this is close to the value of 29,500 determined for the native protein on a G-100 gel filtration column, the active enzyme probably exists as a monomer.Figure 3:Elution of halide/bisulfide methyltransferase from a Protein Pak Q column upon anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Bound proteins were eluted in a 0-200 m M and 200-500 m M two-step linear gradient of NaCl in buffer C. Halide- (□) and bisulfide-methylating (•) activities were assayed in each fraction. Proteins were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (solid line). nkat, nanokatals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities co-purified to homogeneity in the same ratio (1.26 ± 0.14) during a five-step procedure (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, double-reciprocal plots of the data from competition kinetics between the halide and bisulfide substrates gave regression lines that intersected at the 1/ v axis (Fig. 4, A and B). These results established that the halide and bisulfide methylations are catalyzed by the same protein, halide/bisulfide methyltransferase.Table I:Purification of halideIbisulfide methyltransferase Open table in a new tab The halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity was assayed over a wide range of pH, using buffers with overlapping ranges. The pH optimum for I−methylation was fairly broad, between 5.5 and 7.0 (Fig. 5 A), whereas that for HS−methylation was sharper and more alkaline, between 7.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 5 B). In addition, halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity eluted at pH 4.8 upon chromatofocusing on a Mono P column, suggesting that the enzyme has a pI value of 4.8 ± 0.2. After Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, the enzyme was stable for over 2 months at −80°C in buffer B. After affinity chromatography, the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase became extremely labile, losing all activity after overnight storage at −80°C. Addition of 20% glycerol to the preparation and storage at −20°C conserved 12% of the activity after 48 h. In contrast, after the Protein Pak Q anion exchange step, the enzyme retained more than 70% of its activity after 24 h and 55% after 48 h at 4°C in buffer C containing 175 m M NaCl. Kinetic Analysis Double-reciprocal plots with I−as the variable substrate at several fixed concentrations of AdoMet gave converging lines (Fig. 6 A). The same pattern was observed when HS−was the variable substrate at different fixed concentrations of AdoMet (Fig. 6 B). The order of substrate binding and product release was determined from product inhibition studies. S-Adenosyl- L-homocysteine was a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet (Fig. 7 A) and noncompetitive with respect to iodide (Fig. 7 B) or bisulfide (Fig. 7 C). The kinetics of product inhibition for the gaseous CH3I or CH3SH could not be determined under the present assay conditions. As calculated from replots of the data, the Vmax for the formation of CH3I was 1140 nanokatals/mg of protein; that for CH3SH was 804 nanokatals/mg of protein. The respective Kmvalues for I−and HS−were 1.3 and 4.7 m M. There were two different Kmvalues for AdoMet depending on the second substrate used, 0.03 m M with I−and 0.226 m M with HS−. Table II summarizes the kinetic parameters of the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase for its different substrates.Table II:Kinetic parameters of halide/bisulfide methyltransferase from B. oleracea Open table in a new tab The halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities from B. oleracea were purified to apparent homogeneity. The two activities co-purified at a constant ratio (1.26 ± 0.14) throughout the procedure (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). The kinetics of mutual inhibition between the substrates I−and HS−were characteristic of competitive inhibition (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these results establish that both halide- and bisulfide-methylating activities reside on the same active site of a single protein, the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase. The homogeneous protein was obtained through a five-step procedure that resulted in an overall purification of approximately 1000-fold with a recovery of 0.35% (Table I). Affinity chromatography on an adenosine-agarose column was the key step, in which the enzyme specifically bound to the matrix while most of the contaminating proteins were washed through during sample loading (Fig. 2). The enzyme was selectively eluted with the co-substrate AdoMet in a linear gradient resulting in a 1300-fold increase in the specific activity over the crude preparation. Adenosine, linked via its adenine-C8to agarose (ag-adenosine, Pharmacia), has been successfully used to purify other plant methyltransferases (24De Carolis E. Ibrahim R. K Biochem. Cell BioI. 1989; 67: 763-769Google Scholar, 25Dumas B. Legrand M. Geoffroy P. Fritig B. Planta. 1988; 176: 36-41Google Scholar). Our adenosine-agarose matrix was highly stable and was repeatedly used without any loss of its binding or eluting efficiencies. Other affinity matrices prepared with either AdoMet or AdoHcy linked via their free amino or carboxyl groups to Affi-Prep 10 (Bio-Rad) or EAH-Sepharose (Pharmacia) failed to bind the enzyme. High performance liquid chromatography on Protein Pak Q anion exchange column resolved multiple peaks of halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity (Fig. 3). An enzyme preparation processed through a procedure in which salt precipitation was replaced with polyethylene glycol precipitation also gave multiple peaks in this anion exchange step (not shown). These observations suggest that the enzyme may exist in multiple charge isoforms, although this possibility remains to be confirmed through further experiments. Interestingly, rat liver thiol methyltransferase, with which the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase shares many properties, was reported in five different cellular compartments (26Borchardt R.T. Cheng C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 522: 340-353Google Scholar). The harsh freeze-thaw treatment needed to maximize the extraction of halide/bisulfide methyltransferase was also similar to the procedure used to extract the compartmented rat liver enzyme (18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar). The protein from a fraction containing peak halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity from the Superdex 75 step migrated as a single band of 28,000 Da on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Moreover, when consecutive fractions across the first peak of activity after anion exchange HPLC were applied to SDS-PAGE, the Coomassie Blue staining intensity of the 28,000-Da protein band peaked in the fraction containing peak enzyme activity (not shown). These observations confirmed that the molecular mass of the denatured halide/bisulfide methyltransferase was 28,000 Da. Since the molecular weight of the enzyme, calculated from gel filtration chromatography, was 29,500, the native protein probably functions as a monomer. The molecular weight of this enzyme was similar to the algal methyl chloride transferase (15Wuosmaa A.M. Hager L.P. Science. 1990; 249: 160-162Google Scholar) and mammalian thiol methyltransferase (18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar, 18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar). The halide/bisulfide methyltransferase exhibited different pH optimum values for its alternative halide (Fig. 5 A) and bisulfide (Fig. 5 B) substrates. A likely reason for this difference is the pH dependence of the HS−ion concentration. Since H2S has a p Ka1 of 7.02 (27Crampton M.R. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Thiol Group, part 1. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1974: 379-415Google Scholar), [HS−] would be expected to fall sharply as the pH drops below 7. The halide- and bisulfide-methylating activities had the same pI value at pH 4.8, which was consistent with the observation that both activities existed on a single protein. The pattern of substrate interaction kinetics involving AdoMet with either 1- or HS- (Fig. 6, A and B) was symptomatic of a sequential substrate binding mechanism (28Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 47-206Google Scholar). Product inhibition kinetics were used to determine the reaction mechanism of the halidelbisulfide methyltransferase. The last product to be released would act as a competitive inhibitor to the first substrate to bind and as a noncompetitive inhibitor to the second substrate. Since the inhibition by AdoHcy was competitive with respect to AdoMet (Fig. 7A) and noncompetitive with respect to the halide (Fig. 7B) or bisulfide (Fig. 7C) ion (29Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 332-467Google Scholar), AdoMet appears to be the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. The methylated product would be the first to be released and AdoHcy the last. This pattern is indicative of an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism whereby the product of the last substrate to bind to the enzyme is the first to be released (30Morrison J.F. Ebner KE. J. Biol. Chern. 1971; 246: 3977-3984Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first time that either a halide or a bisulfide methyltransferase enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from a plant. A functionally similar rat liver S-thiol methyltransferase was purified to homogeneity (18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar). However, we found no reports on any halide methyltransferase from animals. A methyl chloride transferase from E. muricata (15Wuosmaa A.M. Hager L.P. Science. 1990; 249: 160-162Google Scholar) and a thiol methyltransferase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (19Weisiger R.A. Pinkus L.M. Jakoby W.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2885-2887Google Scholar) have been partially purified. Perhaps more importantly, this is the first report, for any organism, of a single enzyme with both halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities. Our previous work (20Saini H.S. Attieh J.M. Hanson A.D. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) indicates that this dual function enzyme is common among higher plants and that it may also be present in a marine red alga E. muricata. This may be of environmental importance; on a fresh weight basis, the rate of halomethane production from B. oleracea extracts was at least 6-fold higher than that from extracts of E. muricata (15Wuosmaa A.M. Hager L.P. Science. 1990; 249: 160-162Google Scholar). The production of CHaSH was of equal abundance to that of CHaI in most cases tested. Most studies on the production of halomethanes and CHaSH have focused on their environmental or ecological significance. For instance, volatile halogenated organic compounds produced by algae have been considered as deterrents to herbivore feeding (31Gschwend P.M. MacFarlane J.K. Newman K.A. Science. 1985; 227: 1033-1035Google Scholar). However, such compounds may also have metabolic roles. Thus, CHaCl was found to be a methyl donor in the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol, a secondary metabolite involved in the induction of the lignolytic system in many lignindegrading fungi including P. pomaceus (32Harper D.B. Buswell J.A. Kennedy J.T. Hamilton J.T.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3450-3457Google Scholar). Harper et al. (33Harper D.B. Hamilton J.T.G. Kennedy J.T. McNally K.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 1981-1989Google Scholar) suggested that these compounds could play a similar role in other organisms, including higher plants. Our finding of the halide methyltransferase activity in a higher plant supports this suggestion. Methanethiol is a product of sulfate reduction by microorganisms and plants (34Fraudsto de Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991: 453-462Google Scholar). Many functions of sulfur emissions by plants have been suggested including antimicrobial effects, release of toxic compounds produced in cellular metabolism, and allelopathic effects in plant communities (9Rennenberg H. Sharkey T.D. Holland E.A. Mooney H.A. in Trace Gas Emissions by Plants. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 217-260Google Scholar). Detoxification of sulfur compounds has been shown in mammals (18Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 631-637Google Scholar, 19Weisiger R.A. Pinkus L.M. Jakoby W.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2885-2887Google Scholar) and bacteria (35Drotar A.M. Fall L.R. Mishalanie E.A. Tavernier J.E. Fall R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2111-2118Google Scholar), and H2S (HS- anion) was the simplest substrate of an S-methylating activity that produced CHaSH (36Weisiger R.A. Jakoby W.B. Jakoby W.B. in Enzymatic Basis for Detoxification. II. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 131-139Google Scholar). Recently, dimethyl sulfide was also reported as a product of sulfate reduction in some phototrophic bacteria (37McCarty S. Chasteen T. Marshall M. Fall R. Bachofen R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 93-98Google Scholar). The mammalian and bacterial thiol methyltransferases have been reported to methylate organic thiols in addition to HSions. To determine whether such compounds can also serve as substrates for the cabbage enzyme, we tested the ability of 2-mercaptoethanol, 6-mercaptopurine, and thiobenzoic acid to inhibit the iodide-methylating activity in an assay containing 10 mMKI. CHaI production was not inhibited by these thiols at concentrations up to 100 mM. The above thiol methyltransferases methylated CHaSH to dimethyl sulfide. However, we did not detect any dimethyl sulfide using CHaSH (15 mM) as the substrate in our assays. These preliminary results suggest that the cabbage enzyme may have a metabolic role different from those reported for the mammalian and bacterial enzymes. Further work to test the activity of this enzyme toward nonvolatile substrates in an appropriate phytochemical context is needed to confirm this possibility. It is too early to attribute any specific role to the halide/ bisulfide methyltransferase in B. oleracea, especially given its potential involvement in two different areas of metabolism. However, given the low rates of methylation and the high Km value of the methyltransferase for the only physiologically important halide Cl“, we suggest that this enzyme is more likely to function in sulfur metabolism than in that of halideions. This role in sulfur metabolism is also favored because the Brassicaceae family is characterized by several sulfur-containing secondary metabolites, including non-protein sulfur-containing amino acids (38Bell E.A. Bell E.A. Charlwood B.V. Encyclopaedia of Plant Physiology. 8. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1980: 403-432Google Scholar) and sulfur-containing glucosinolates (39Heaney R.K. Spinks E.A. Fenwick G.R. Z. Pfluruenziicht. 1983; 91: 219-226Google Scholar, 40Takasugi M. Monde K. Katsui N. Shirata A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988; 61: 285-289Google Scholar). Hydrolysis products of these latter compounds react with CHaSH to produce a variety of phytoalexins (40Takasugi M. Monde K. Katsui N. Shirata A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988; 61: 285-289Google Scholar) that are involved in defense responses of this family. We thank Dr. Ragai K. Ibrahim for providing an ag-adenosine sample and Dr. Vincenzo De Luca and Dr. Emidio De Carolis for helpful discussions."

Cellular receptors for the Fc domain of immunoglobulins (FcRs) 1The abbreviations used are: FcRreceptors for the Fc domain of immunoglobulinsFcγRreceptors for IgEFcγreceptors for IgGGSTglutathione S-transferaseSHSrc homology regionsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePYphosphotyrosine. are widely expressed on the surface of immune cells. FcRs belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and include high affinity receptors for IgE (FcεRI), IgG (FcγRI), and IgA as well as low affinity IgG receptors (FcγRII and RIII) (1Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 553-560Google Scholar). In the presence of antigen-antibody complexes, these receptors initiate a variety of immune responses such as exocytosis of inflammatory mediators and phagocytosis (2Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Google Scholar). Recent studies of a murine strain deficient in FcγRs have shown a markedly attenuated inflammatory response to immune complexes, directly demonstrating a requirement for Fcγ receptors in this process (3Sylvestre D.L.

Science. 1994; 265: 1095-1098Google Scholar). receptors for the Fc domain of immunoglobulins receptors for IgE receptors for IgG glutathione S-transferase Src homology regions polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride phosphotyrosine. Previous studies have shown that biological responses mediated by FcRs require tyrosine phosphorylation (4Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Google Scholar). Because FcRs lack intrinsic kinase activity, substrate phosphorylation must result from activation of coupled kinases. Two members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, p56 and p62, have been implicated in FcR signal transduction by their physical association with receptors in rat and mouse cell lines (5Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 344: 78-80Google Scholar). p56 has been found in association with the β subunit of FcεRI and p72, also a protein-tyrosine kinase, with its phosphorylated γ subunit (6Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Vallé A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Google Scholar, 7Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown the physical association of p72 with activated FcγRII in platelets (8Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Google Scholar). According to a current model for signaling through FcεRI, p56 associates with the β subunit of the receptor and becomes active when the receptor is engaged. Activated p56 kinase then phosphorylates the γ subunit of the receptor, which in turn serves as a docking motif for the SH2 domains of p72 (6Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Vallé A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Google Scholar). This model has also been suggested for the FcγR in modulating B-cell activation triggered by the surface immunoglobulin complex (9Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Google Scholar). The contribution of p72 kinase to FcγR signaling is not well understood, but it has been shown to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated FcγRIIA acting as a catalyst in early events of platelet activation (8Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Google Scholar). Furthermore, p72 coprecipitates with a 120-kDa protein which has been suggested to be a possible substrate in myelomonocytic cells (10Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Google Scholar). The cbl gene was initially discovered as the transforming component of Cas NS-1, a tumorigenic murine retrovirus (11Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse III, H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Google Scholar). The cbl proto-oncogene is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (11Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W.

Virol. 1989; 63: 5420-5424Google Scholar), and its protein product, p120c-cbl, has been recently isolated from murine macrophages by virtue of its ability to bind SH3 elements (13Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Google Scholar). Other recent studies have shown that conversion of c- cbl to a transforming gene involves tyrosine phosphorylation of its protein product (14Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar). These and other observations prompted us to examine p120c-cbl as a potential player in the Fc receptor signaling pathway. The human promyelomonocytic cell line HL60 (15Collins S.J. Gallo R.C. Gallaher R.E. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Google Scholar) was maintained as described previously (10Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, human IgG, and goat anti-human IgG F(ab)′2antibodies were obtained from Cappel Organon Teknika Corp. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) coupled to agarose beads and polyclonal anti-p56 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal anti-p120c-cbl (C15) and polyclonal anti-p72 (SC 573) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from ICN. Anti-p72 serum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a peptide representing residues 622-635 of p72. A fragment containing the SH3 domain of lyn (amino acids 60-104) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a full-length human lyn cDNA (16Yi T. Bolen J.B. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2391-2398Google Scholar), kindly provided by Joseph Bolen, and ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The MscI- NcoI (Klenow end-filled) fragment of lyn containing its SH2 domain (amino acids 105-226) was subcloned into SmaI-cut pGEX-4T-3. Purification of GST fusion proteins has been described previously (17Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Robbins K.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 183-186Google Scholar). Receptors were engaged as described (10Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 107/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 m M sodium vanadate. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml human IgG on ice for 10 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium prewarmed to 37°C and incubated with 20 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG F(ab)′2for periods indicated. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed at 4°C for 15 min in a buffer containing 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 m M EDTA, 150 m M NaCl, 1% Nonident P-40, 1 m M sodium vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors which included 2 m M diisopropylfluorophosphate, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 m M 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 m M EDTA. Lysates were clarified at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and their protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Supernatants were processed for either sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting or for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation cell lysates were incubated 1 h on ice with indicated antibodies and for an additional 30 min with 10 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed twice with cold lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer containing 1 M NaCl (high salt buffer). Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Filters were blocked for 1 h at 37°C in 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 m M (TNB), containing 4% bovine serum albumin and blotted for 1 h at room temperature with TNB containing the antibodies indicated. After exposure to secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, proteins were visualized with the aid of an enhanced chemilumiscence kit (Amersham Corp.). 5 μg of each GST fusion protein bound to GSH-agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated for 60 min at 4°C with 5 mg of cell lysates. After two washes with cold lysis buffer and one with lysis buffer containing 1 M NaCl (high salt buffer), proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE as described above. Several lines of evidence have raised the possibility that p120c-cbl might be involved in Fcγ receptor signaling. To test this hypothesis, lysates from cells treated sequentially with human IgG and goat anti-human IgG F(ab)′2to cross-link IgG-bound Fcγ receptors were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (anti-PY). As expected (10Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Google Scholar), proteins of 120, 72, and 55-60 kDa were tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated but not untreated HL60 cells, demonstrating successful stimulation of the FcγR signaling pathway (Fig. 1 A). When the same lysates were first immunoprecipitated with a previously characterized antibody capable of recognizing p120c-cbl (13Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Google Scholar), the protein was detected as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated species in lysates from activated but not control cells. Analysis of these same immunoprecipitates and cell lysates with anti-p120c-cbl antibody demonstrated that similar amounts of p120c-cbl were present in activated and resting cells (Fig. 1 B). Specific and independent stimulation of FcγRI and II (undifferentiated HL60 cells do not express FcγRIII) resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120c-cbl, demonstrating that both receptors participate in the event after stimulation of the cells with IgG (data not shown). Thus, p120c-cbl is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to FcγR stimulation. To determine what portion of the 120-kDa band detected by anti-PY was represented by p120c-cbl, this latter molecule was first depleted from lysates of stimulated cells by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2, anti-p120c-cbl antibodies did not detect the protein after three rounds of depletion by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). When blots containing lysates devoid of p120c-cbl were incubated with anti-PY, the intensity of the p120 band was notably decreased (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Depleted lysates were also examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-PY. Under these conditions the intensity of p120 was decreased whereas the intensity of p72 was not appreciably affected (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 4 and 5). Thus, depletion of p120c-cbl was selective. We conclude from these results that p120c-cbl represents a major portion of the 120-kDa proteins tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγR engagement. To determine whether p56 or p72, two protein tyrosine kinases involved in the FcγR signaling pathway, might be responsible for phosphorylation of p120c-cbl, lysates from resting or activated cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p56 or anti-p72 and examined for the presence of p120c-cbl. As shown in Fig. 3, p120c-cbl was detected clearly associated with p56 (lanes 5 and 6) and in less amount with p72 (lanes 7 and 8). The formation of this complex was not dependent upon FcγR cross-linking, suggesting that the associations between p56, p72, and p120c-cbl are not mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation. When the same blots were stripped and reblotted with anti-p72 antibodies, very little p72 was detected in anti-p120c-cbl immunoprecipitates, and no p72 was present in anti-p56 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). In reciprocal experiments, p56 was detected in anti-p120c-cbl immunoprecipitates. When the kinetics of p56-p120c-cbl association was analyzed, a slight increase in the intensity of p56 was observed 10 min after FcγR activation. By 60 min, p56 was less apparent (Fig. 4). We conclude that a portion of p56 is physically associated with p120c-cbl in resting cells and that by 60 min after activation, the number of p56 molecules complexed with p120c-cbl was reduced. To study the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120c-cbl complexed with p56 and p72, immunoprecipitates from lysates of resting and activated HL60 cells were examined by anti-PY immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, tyrosine phosphorylated p120c-cbl was detected in either anti-Lyn or anti-Syk immunoprecipitates, as well as in lysates, from activated cells. These findings demonstrated that the population of p120c-cbl who was associated with p56 or p72 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγR engagement. To determine whether p56 or p72 kinases might phosphorylate p120c-cbl in vitro, lysates from resting or activated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p56, anti-p72, or anti-p120c-cbl antibodies and assayed in vitro for kinase activity, but no phosphorylation in vitro was detected (data not shown). These results provided no direct evidence that p120c-cbl was a substrate for either p56 or p72 kinases. To further examine the nature of the interaction between p56 and p120c-cbl, we tested the ability of the SH2 and SH3 domains of p56 to bind p120c-cbl in vitro. GST fusion proteins containing these domains were attached to glutathione agarose beads and incubated in the presence of lysates from resting or activated HL60 cells. The associated proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-p120c-cbl antibody. p120c-cbl specifically associated with the SH3 domain of p56 (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6), but not with GST (lanes 1 and 2) or the SH2 domain of p56 (lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the amount of p120c-cbl that bound to Lyn-SH3 did not vary after 10 min of FcγR cross-linking (lane 6), consistent with the level of association observed in assays in vivo (Figs. 3 and 4). To gain information regarding the sequence of association and tyrosine phosphorylation events among p120c-cbl, p72, and p56, we performed a series of time course experiments. Each of these molecules was immunoprecipitated and examined by Western blotting using anti-PY as a probe. As shown in Fig. 7B, tyrosine phosphorylation of p56 varied by 2-3-fold during the time course, reaching a maximum at 5-10 min. Associated proteins of 72 and 120 kDa were also observed, their intensities peaking at 5-10 min after activation (Fig. 7 B). A molecule of 120 kDa (likely p120c-cbl ), also associated with p72, is seen peaking in its detectability at 20 min (Fig. 7 C). Phosphorylation of p120c-cbl (Fig. 7 D) was also maximal at 20 min and closely followed the pattern observed for p120 in total cell lysates (Fig. 7 A). These experiments demonstrate transient tyrosine phosphorylation of p56, p72, and p120c-cbl upon FcγR activation. The data also confirm the formation of a complex consisting of p56, p72, and p120c-cbl . A number of substrates have been identified for protein-tyrosine kinases involved in the pathways initiated by FcR engagement. These include individual components of the multimeric Fc receptors (18Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar, 19Li W. Deanin G.G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Oliver J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3176-3182Google Scholar) as well as the kinases p56, p62 (5Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 344: 78-80Google Scholar), and p72 (8Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Google Scholar, 10Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have shown that p120c-cbl is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to FcγR engagement and is the most prominent of all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in this pathway. The lack of obvious p120 tyrosine phosphorylation upon FcεRI activation in rat basophilic leukemia cells (4Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Google Scholar) 2A. Marcilla, unpublished observations. suggests that phosphorylation of p120c-cbl might distinguish Fcε from Fcγ receptor signaling pathways. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown tyrosine phosphorylation of p120c-cbl in response to T cell-receptor activation as well (21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar). Thus, p120c-cbl emerges as an important player in immune recognition receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells. The involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in recruiting molecules containing SH2 domains to signaling complexes has been well documented (22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor activation motifs of Fcε (6Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Vallé A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Google Scholar, 7Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar) and probably Fcγ receptors (8Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Google Scholar) serves as the mechanism by which p72 binds activated receptor components. However, the involvement of SH3 domains in the formation of FcR signaling complexes has not been previously described. In this study we show that p120c-cbl associates with the SH3 domain of p56, as it has been observed for other tyrosine kinases (13Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Google Scholar, 21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar), and this association is not affected after FcγR cross-linking. Furthermore, the p120c-cbl -p56 complex is constitutive in vivo and is present in both resting and activated cells. The amount of p120c-cbl coprecipitated with anti-p56 did not vary upon FcγR cross-linking suggesting that Lyn-SH2 domain does not contribute to the stability of the complex. Consistent with this finding, Lyn-SH2 domain was unable to bind p120c-cbl in vitro, even after activation of the cells. This result differs from the observed in T cells, in which the association of p59 and a phosphorylated p120, probably p120c-cbl, requires both the SH3 and SH2 elements (23Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Google Scholar). The small amount of p120c-cbl associated with p72 in vivo would suggest a nondirect interaction between these two molecules. The steady state association of p120c-cbl with p56 and p72, in combination with its tyrosine phosphorylation, might suggest that these kinases directly phosphorylate p120c-cbl, but in vitro kinase assays failed to confirm this point. It is possible that the binding of p120c-cbl to p56, a known membrane-attached protein, might carry this molecule to the proximity of an active tyrosine kinase located in the plasma membrane, where p120c-cbl would became phosphorylated. Further studies will be required to identify the kinase responsible for p120c-cbl phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that p120c-cbl physically binds to p47 in vitro and in vivo (13Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Google Scholar). Thus, p47 may also contribute fundamentally to the ability of p120c-cbl to associate with the activated signaling complex. The role of p120c-cbl in the FcγR signaling complex is not clear. Its known associations with p47 and p56 are consistent with the idea that p120c-cbl serves as a bridge together with p47 to position p56 for activation after FcR engagement. Alternatively, p120c-cbl may be responsible for initiating biologic responses when phosphorylated. The ability of oncogenic forms of p120c-cbl to subvert growth regulatory pathways in fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells (14Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar, 21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar) attests to its biological potential, an area that warrants further investigation. We thank Jeanne H. Sameshima for her help in preparing the manuscript and Dr. Silvio Gutkind for helpful discussions."

Thus, both of these lesions have the prospect of causing high rates of mutation during mtDNA replication. Individual cells in higher eukaryotes contain several thousand copies of the mtDNA genome (1Bogenhagen D. Clayton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7991-7995Google Scholar). This genetic redundancy, coupled with the rapid rate of mtDNA evolution (2Brown W. George M. Wilson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Google Scholar) and the persistence of bulky damage in mtDNA (3Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1982; 215: 73-75Google Scholar), has led to the suggestion that damage to mtDNA is not commonly repaired. However, some types of damage, such as spontaneous base loss (6Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Google Scholar) and oxidative damage (7Richter C. Park J.-W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Google Scholar), are expected to be so frequent that mitochondria must possess mechanisms for either repairing the damage or permitting translesional synthesis during replication. As expected, repair of some classes of damage to mtDNA has been documented (8LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Google Scholar, 9Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Google Scholar). Some mitochondrial enzymes involved in recognition of DNA damage and its repair have been identified, such as uracil DNA glycosylase (10Slupphaug G. Markussen F.H. Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Aarsaether N. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2579-2584Google Scholar) and AP1endonuclease (11Tomkinson A.E. Bonk R.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12532-12537Google Scholar). However, understanding of the enzymology of mtDNA repair has lagged far behind studies of nuclear DNA repair. One key enzyme in the response to damage to mtDNA is the mitochondrial DNA pol 1The abbreviations used are: APapurinic/apyrimidinicpolpolymerase8-oxo-dG7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosineDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. γ. This enzyme has only recently been purified from higher eukaryotes (12Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Google Scholar, 13Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol.

The intact enzyme appears to contain a single catalytic subunit varying in size from 125 to 145 kDa in different organisms. A similar variability in predicted size has been observed for cloned DNA pol γ from yeasts (15Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Google Scholar). 2F. Ye and D. F.

In this paper, we investigate the action of DNA pol γ at sites of base loss and of oxidative damage using site-specifically modified oligonucleotides with tetrahydrofuran or 8-oxo-dG in the template strand. The effects of these lesions have been studied for other DNA polymerases (see Refs. 20 and 21, and references therein). In general, abasic sites provide an effective kinetic block to elongation by DNA polymerases, although translesional synthesis can occur, most frequently with incorporation of a dA residue opposite the abasic site. In this study, we employ a synthetic tetrahydrofuran residue as an analogue of a natural abasic site (22Takeshita M. Chang C. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Google Scholar). This analogue has been used widely in previous studies of the action of other DNA polymerases at abasic sites. As a model for oxidative damage in DNA, we have used 8-oxo-dG. The incidence of 8-oxo-dG in DNA and its mutagenic consequences have been reviewed (23Grollman A. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Google Scholar). DNA polymerases from a variety of sources read through 8-oxo-dG residues efficiently but show variable frequencies of misincorporation of dA opposite the adduct (20Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Google Scholar). Oxidative damage producing 8-oxo-dG has been reported to occur in mtDNA at a frequency approximately 10 times greater than in nuclear DNA (7Richter C. Park J.-W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Google Scholar), possibly as a consequence of the high rates of oxidative metabolism in mitochondria. Hayakawa et al. (24Hayakawa M. Ogawa T. Sugiyama S. Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 87-93Google Scholar) have reported a dramatic increase in the occurrence of 8-oxo-dG in mtDNA in mouse liver following treatment with azidothymidine. Thus, it is particularly important to determine the effect of this lesion on replication by DNA pol γ. Mature Xenopus laevis females were obtained from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI).

Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Google Scholar) and by Bodepudi et al. (25Bodepudi V. Iden C.R. Johnson F. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1991; 10: 755-761Google Scholar), respectively. All oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by HPLC chromatography. DNA pol γ was purified from Triton X-100 lysates of X. laevis ovary mitochondria by a modification of the procedure of Insdorf and Bogenhagen (13Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21491-21497Google Scholar). Following the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step in the published procedure, the enzyme was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column in buffer containing 5% glycerol, 300 m M NaCl, 20 m M Tris (pH 8), 2 m M DTT, 1 m M MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 m M benzamidine HCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM E-64, and 100 μg/ml gelatin. DNA polymerase activity was detected in assays using poly(rA)⋅oligo(dT) template as described (13Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21491-21497Google Scholar). Fractions containing the peak of activity were applied to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose (HiTrap; Pharmacia) column in buffer containing 5% glycerol, 100 m M NaCl, 20 m M Tris (pH 8), 2 m M DTT, 1 m M EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 m M benzamidine HCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM E-64, and 100 μg/ml gelatin. DNA pol γ was eluted with a gradient of increasing KCl. DNA pol γ purified by this procedure had a specific activity comparable to that reported for a more lengthy purification scheme (13Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21491-21497Google Scholar) but was found to contain a higher proportion of intact 140-kDa enzyme by SDS-PAGE analysis. The DNA pol γ activity on activated DNA and poly(dA)⋅oligo(dT) substrates retained 95 and 88% of activity in the presence of 1 μM ddTTP and 20 μg/ml aphidicolin, respectively. Oligonucleotide substrates were prepared as follows; 10-20 pmol quantities of 11-mer or 13-mer primers (sequences shown in Fig. 1) were 5′ labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Oligonucleotides were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 10 μg of glycogen carrier and purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea and recovered by crush elution and chromatography on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. Labeled oligonucleotides were annealed with a 1.5- or 2-fold excess of 31-mer oligonucleotide containing either dG, tetrahydrofuran, or 8-oxo-dG (sequences shown in Fig. 1) in 10 m M Tris, pH 8.4, 50 m M NaCl, 2 m M MgCl2. Polymerase reactions contained 3.5 pmol of oligonucleotide, 200 μM of each dNTP, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 500 μM DTT, 10 m M MgCl2, 40 m M KCl, 20 m M Tris, pH 8.4, and 300 units of DNA pol γ in a volume of 50 μl. Extension reactions were continued for 20 min at 25°C and terminated by incubation at 65°C for 5 min. Reactions containing fully extended products were digested with HaeIII restriction endonuclease for 90 min at 37°C. All reaction mixtures were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 10 μg of glycogen carrier, analyzed by electrophoresis on gels containing 20% polyacrylamide with 8 M urea, and detected with autoradiography. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, the HaeIII digestions products were repurified by chromatography on a Gen-Pak FAX anion exchange column and analyzed by electrophoresis using the two-phased (15 × 72 × 0.04 cm) gel system of Shibutani (26Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar) containing 7 M urea only in the top 10 cm of the gel. For the exonuclease assays, dNTPs, bovine serum albumin, and DTT were omitted, and 40 units of DNA pol γ were assayed. Reactions were terminated by placing 3-μl aliquots removed at various times from the 20-μl reaction mixtures into formamide DNA loading solution (90% formamide, 20 m M Tris (pH 8), 25 m M EDTA, 50 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 50 μg/ml xylene cyanol). All aliquots were electrophoresed on 20% polyacryamide gels containing 8 M urea and the radioactivities of substrates and products on the gel were quantified using a Betascope 603 isotope detector (BetaGen Corp., Framingham, MA).Figure 3:dNMP incorporation opposite abasic sites and 8-oxo-dG residues. The HaeIII-cut products shown in Fig. 2 (lanes A3, B3, and C3) were HPLC-purified and subjected to electrophoresis in lanes 1-3, respectively, on a two-phased polyacrylamide gel as described by Shibutani (26Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar). Markers (lanes M) consisted of a mixture of 18-mers containing A, C, G, or T at the position opposite the lesion (X) in the sequence shown in Fig. 1 and 17-mer and 16-mer oligonucleotides containing 1- or 2-nucleotide deletions at this site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1 shows the design of an experiment intended to determine the action of DNA pol γ at abasic sites or 8-oxo-dG residues in oligodeoxynucleotide templates. This assay is essentially as described (26Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar) with the addition of a step to recut the products with HaeIII endonuclease to eliminate 3′ terminal heterogeneity expected due to the exonuclease associated with DNA pol γ. The results of this polymerase assay are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen in lanes A2 and B2, a significant fraction of the primer was extended under our polymerase reaction conditions when the template contained a dG residue (control) or 8-oxo-dG. In contrast, only a low level of translesional synthesis was observed on a template containing the tetrahydrofuran residue (lane C2). A 10-fold longer autoradiographic exposure was required to detect bypass replication (lane set C′). We conclude that an abasic site is an effective barrier to elongation by DNA pol γ. We considered the possibility that action of an AP endonuclease to cleave the template at the tetrahydrofuran residue might contribute to premature termination at the abasic site. However, control experiments showed that the template strand was not incised during the course of our reactions. 3K. Pinz, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig. 1, the 3′ end of the primer is located one nucleotide away from the abasic site in the template strand. Most extension products obtained with the tetrahydrofuran template showed addition of only a single residue, although further extension to incorporate a residue opposite the abasic site was readily detected as a 15-mer in lanes C2 and C3. This suggests that both incorporation opposite the tetrahydrofuran residue and extension of a primer with a 3′ terminus “paired” with the abasic site are unfavorable reactions. To determine the dNMP inserted by DNA pol γ opposite an 8-oxo-dG or tetrahydrofuran residue, the fully extended products were digested with HaeIII endonuclease as shown in lanes 3 of Fig. 2. The resulting 18-mers were recovered by HPLC and subjected to electrophoresis using a two-phased gel system (26Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar). The autoradiogram in Fig. 3 showed that dC, the correct base, was incorporated in 73% of fully extended products, while dA was misincorporated opposite 8-oxo-dG in approximately 27% of the products. Fig. 3 also shows the products of replication past the abasic site analogue. The large majority of these bypass replication products contained dA residues opposite the abasic site, as reported for other DNA polymerases (21Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). Thus, abasic sites in mtDNA can have two sorts of serious consequences. First, as shown in Fig. 2, these lesions can serve as blocks to replication. Second, the low frequency of successful bypass replication through abasic sites by DNA pol γ is expected to be highly mutagenic. The misincorporation of dA residues opposite 8-oxo-dG or an abasic site is the net result of the action of two enzymatic centers in the DNA polymerase, the polymerase domain and the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease. Foury and Vanderstraeten (27Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Google Scholar) have shown recently that the exonuclease domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA pol γ plays an important role in increasing the fidelity of replication. In this study, we used a variety of oligodeoxynucleotide substrates to investigate the action of the proofreading exonuclease on templates containing damaged residues. The basic approach is diagrammed in Fig. 1. We used a set of four 13-mer primers with identical sequences, except for the 3′ terminal residue. The primers anneal to the template with their 3′ ends positioned opposite a dG residue (undamaged control), an abasic site or 8-oxo-dG. We have previously shown that the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease of X. laevis DNA pol γ excises a 3′ terminal mismatch more rapidly than a 3′ base paired residue, as expected for a proofreading activity (16Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21498-21503Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A extends this analysis to examine the activity of the exonuclease on each of the four potential 3′ terminal nucleotides opposite a dG residue. In this control series, the G:C pair shows the greatest stability to exonuclease, although even the paired 3′ terminus is subject to exonucleolytic attack. G:G and G:A mismatches are excised much more rapidly, while the G:T mismatch is excised at an intermediate rate. Similar results have been observed by Longley and Mosbaugh (19Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24702-24711Google Scholar) for the porcine DNA pol γ. In both instances, the specificity of the exonuclease for a mismatched 3′ terminus is not absolute. Substituting a tetrahydrofuran for the dG residue in the template is expected to mimic the structure of a primer opposite an apurinic site in DNA. The effects of the abasic site on action of the pol γ exonuclease are shown in Fig. 4B. All four primers with 3′ ends positioned opposite the abasic site were actively attacked by the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease. The dA 3′ terminus is not particularly stable to the action of the exonuclease in comparison with other 3′ residues. The influence of 8-oxo-dG on the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease of pol γ are shown in Fig. 4 C. All four primer 3′ ends are recognized as inappropriate by the enzyme in this context and are actively attacked. A 3′ terminal dC residue opposite 8-oxo-dG is removed at the lowest rate, although this pair is not as stable to exonucleolytic attack as the dC:dG pair (Fig. 4, compare A and C). This is consistent with the observation that dC is incorporated in most extension events (Fig. 3). Interestingly, an 8-oxodG:dA 3′ terminus is not particularly stabilized against exonucleolytic attack. DNA pol γ is the polymerase responsible for replication and, most likely, repair of mtDNA. This polymerase is known to be highly processive (28Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Google Scholar) and to replicate DNA with high fidelity (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Google Scholar). Single point mutations have been implicated in the etiology of a number of genetic diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA (reviewed in Ref. 29Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been accumulating to support the view that damage to mtDNA may contribute to aging and to other degenerative diseases that may have a multifactorial etiology (reviewed in Ref. 30Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Google Scholar). Given the growing literature on mtDNA mutations and disease, we set out to study the effects of two common sorts of DNA template damage on the action of the mitochondrial DNA pol γ. We found that abasic sites and 8-oxo-dG residues have disparate effects on the action of the polymerase, although both lesions have a potential to be highly mutagenic in vivo. The abasic site analogue, tetrahydrofuran, was used in these experiments for two reasons. First, it differs from an authentic abasic site only by the replacement of an hydroxyl group on the 1′ carbon of deoxyribose with a hydrogen, so that it is a structurally accurate analogue of an abasic site. Second, this residue can be incorporated at precise positions during automated synthesis of oligonucleotides. Although the greater chemical stability of the tetrahydrofuran residue suppresses action of AP lyases and can influence the detailed pathway of abasic site repair (31Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Google Scholar), these features are not relevant to the present study. The tetrahydrofuran residue has two major effects on DNA replication by DNA pol γ. First, it greatly inhibits the frequency of translesional synthesis. In a series of experiments conducted under a variety of solution conditions we observed an average of 80% blockage of replication at the abasic site.3Second, when the polymerase is able to bypass the lesion, it virtually always incorporates dA opposite the abasic site. If an abasic site in vivo is generated by loss of a base other than thymine the incorporation of a dA residue will be mutagenic. These results are similar to those observed for other DNA polymerases (21Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). In particular, it is interesting to note that the presence of a proofreading exonuclease in T4 phage DNA polymerase has been observed to decrease the ability of the enzyme to bypass an abasic site (21Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). The exo+polymerase may engage in multiple rounds of dAMP incorporation and excision opposite the abasic site in a dAMP turnover reaction that produces a kinetic block to further elongation. Thus, mutagenesis of the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease site or selective inhibition of the exonuclease activity of DNA pol γ might increase the frequency of elongation past abasic sites. It is also possible that mitochondria may contain associated replication factors that might influence the efficiency of bypass synthesis through abasic sites. The search for such an activity is encouraged by the observation that proliferating cell nuclear antigen can increase translesional synthesis by DNA pol δ on a template containing a DNA photoadduct (32O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Google Scholar). Shibutani et al. (20Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Google Scholar) have shown that DNA polymerases from different sources vary considerably in their frequency of misincorporation of dA opposite 8-oxo-dG in DNA. For example, DNA polymerases α and δ exhibited a high frequency of incorporation of dA opposite 8-oxo-dG, while DNA pol β showed minimal misincorporation in the same context. Misincorporation of dA is thought to reflect the propensity of 8-oxo-dG to adopt a syn conformation about the glycosidic bond to allow base pairing with dA (23Grollman A. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Google Scholar, 33Kouchakdjian M. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Eisenberg M. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1403-1412Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that 8-oxo-dG induces a moderately high rate of incorporation of dA opposite the G adduct during replication by DNA pol γ. It would appear that a primer-template with 3′-dA in the primer positioned opposite 8-oxo-dG provides the polymerase with a suitable substrate for elongation. The results shown in Fig. 4 C indicate that a dA:8-oxo-dG 3′ pair is not as resistant to attack by the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease center of the polymerase as a Watson-Crick dC:dG base pair. Thus, preferential misincorporation of dA opposite 8-oxo-dG principally reflects the specificity of the polymerase domain of the enzyme. It would be interesting to determine the rate of dA misincorporation by DNA polymerase γ in the absence of an active 3′→ 5′ exonuclease domain. Our results confirm that 8-oxo-dG has the potential to create frequent G → T transversion mutations in mtDNA. The biological importance of this lesion then depends on the actual incidence of 8-oxo-dG in mtDNA and the rate of its repair. It has been suggested that 8-oxo-dG could be generated at an increased rate in mtDNA by superoxide radicals produced as a byproduct of oxidative metabolism (34Richter C. Mutat. Res. 1992; 275: 249-255Google Scholar). However, the reported frequency of 8-oxo-dG in mtDNA varies widely in different studies. Richter et al. (7Richter C. Park J.-W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Google Scholar) originally reported a high steady state abundance of 1 8-oxo-dG residue/8000 bases in mtDNA. In contrast, a recent investigation of the incidence of 8-oxo-dG in mtDNA in which the oxidized sites were probed as FAPY (formaminopyrimidine)-glycosylase sensitive sites observed less than 1 lesion/5 × 105base pairs (35Hegler J. Bittner D. Boiteux S. Epe B. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2309-2312Google Scholar). The extent to which differences in methodology, tissue sources, or the rate of repair of oxidative damage (9Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Google Scholar) contribute to this discrepancy remains to be established. One report of a massive conversion of dG to 8-oxo-dG in mtDNA following administration of azidothymidine (24Hayakawa M. Ogawa T. Sugiyama S. Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 87-93Google Scholar) has not, to our knowledge, been reproduced in other studies. While our experiments have confirmed that 8-oxo-dG induces frequent misincorporation by DNA pol γ, the biological significance of this lesion in mtDNA is not yet completely understood.

M., Myer, A., Kosz, L., Engelstein, M., and Maier, C. (1990) Neuron 5, 411-419). Solid phase immunochemical assays measuring intersegmental muscle pools of free and conjugated ubiquitin reveal that the induction of polyubiquitin mRNA is accompanied by a proportional increase in total ubiquitin polypeptide. Ubiquitin conjugate pools increase 10-fold at eclosion, during which loss of muscle protein mass is maximum. A smaller but measurable increase in ubiquitin conjugates is observed earlier in pupal development coincident with a modest enhanced degradation of myofibrillar proteins. Accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates is accompanied by induction in the pathway for polypeptide ligation, including the activating enzyme (E1), several carrier protein (E2) isoforms, and ubiquitin:protein isopeptide ligase (E3). Both accumulation of ubiquitin polypeptide and the enzymes of the conjugation pathway are subject to regulation by declining titers of the insect molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, which signals onset of programmed cell death in the intersegmental muscles. Thus, programmed cell death within the intersegmental muscles is accomplished in part by stimulation of the ubiquitin-mediated degradative pathway through a coordinated induction of ubiquitin and the enzymes responsible for its conjugation to yield proteolytic intermediates. This suggests enzymes required for ubiquitin conjugation may represent additional genes recruited for developmentally programmed death.

https://openalex.org/W1976132402,"Hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) are structurally related lipolytic enzymes that have distinct functions in lipoprotein catabolism. In addition to its lipolytic activity, LpL binds to very low density lipoproteins and promotes their interaction with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Chappell, D. A., Fry, G. L., Waknitz, M. A., Muhonen, L. E., Pladet M. W., Iverius, P. H., and Strickland, D. K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14168-14175). In vitro binding assays revealed that HL also binds to purified LRP with a KDof 52 n M. Its binding to LRP is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), a known LRP antagonist, and by heparin. 125I-Labeled HL is rapidly internalized and degraded by HepG2 cell lines, and approximately 70% of the cellular internalization and degradation is blocked by either exogenously added RAP or anti-LRP IgG. Mouse fibroblasts that lack LRP display a greatly diminished capacity to internalize and degrade HL when compared to control fibroblasts. These data indicate that LRP-mediated cellular uptake of HL accounts for a substantial portion of the internalization of this molecule. Proteoglycans have been shown to participate in the clearance of LpL, and consequently a role for proteoglycans in HL clearance pathway was also investigated. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that are deficient in proteoglycan biosynthesis were unable to internalize or degrade 125I-HL despite the fact that these cells express LRP. Thus, the initial binding of HL to cell surface proteoglycans is an obligatory step for the delivery of the enzyme to LRP for endocytosis. A small, but significant, amount of 125I-HL was internalized in LRP deficient cells indicating that an LRP-independent pathway for HL internalization does exist.

The overall folding patterns of HL and LpL are thought to be similar to that of pancreatic lipase (Derewenda and Cambillau, 1991Derewenda Z.S. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23112-23119Google Scholar). hepatic lipase lipoprotein lipase high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein intermediate density lipoprotein very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein E low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein Chinese hamster ovary mouse embryo fibroblast. HL is secreted by hepatocytes and becomes bound to both hepatocytes (Marteau et al., 1988Marteau C. Quibel J.R. Le Petit-Thevenin J. Boyer J. Gerolami A.

Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 245-246Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence has implicated HL in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and chylomicron remnants (Shirai et al., 1991; Laboda et al., 1986Laboda H.M.

Zhang S. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maida N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar) or human patients (Hegele et al., 1993Hegele R.A. Little J.A. Vezina C. Maguire G.F. Tu L. Wolever T.S.

Thromb. 1993; 13: 1282-1290Google Scholar) result in increased plasma levels of HDL. Some patients lacking HL accumulate cholesterol-rich, β very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) which are abnormal lipoproteins that are enriched in apolipoprotein E (apoE). On the other hand, overexpression of HL in transgenic rabbits results in a lowering of plasma HDL and IDL levels (Fan et al., 1994Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Google Scholar). It has been speculated that HL may serve to promote hepatic clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins by either hydrolyzing/remodeling them to a form that exposes an apoE receptor binding site or by binding to lipoproteins and serving as a recognition site for hepatic receptors (Ji et al., 1994bJi Z.-S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Google Scholar). This latter model is similar to a putative role played by LpL, which binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and promotes the interaction of lipoproteins with this receptor (Beisiegel et al., 1991Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8342-8346Google Scholar; Chappell et al. 1992, 1993; Nykjaer et al., 1993Nykjaer A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Google Scholar). The ability of LpL to promote the LRP-mediated cellular internalization and degradation of lipoproteins may not require the catalytic site of LpL, since the carboxyl-terminal domain of LpL, which lacks this site, binds to LRP and promotes the LRP-mediated catabolism of lipoproteins (Williams et al., 1994Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P. Laloule J. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8653-8658Google Scholar). LRP binds diverse ligands and belongs to a family of endocytic receptors structurally related to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (for reviews, see Krieger and Herz, 1994Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar, Moestrup, 1994Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Google Scholar, and Strickland et al., 1994Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Williams S.E. Argraves W.S. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 204-215Google Scholar). Other mammalian members of the LDL receptor family include the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, and glycoprotein 330 (gp330). LRP mediates the cellular internalization of proteinases, such as plasminogen activators, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, and apoE- and lipoprotein lipase-enriched lipoproteins. Ligand binding by LRP is blocked by a 39-kDa protein, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP) (Herz et al., 1991Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar; Williams et al., 1992Williams S. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). While the complete physiological role of LRP is not fully appreciated at this time, it is clear that one important function of LRP is to mediate the hepatic removal of ligands from the circulation, and LRP is thought to play an important role, along with the LDL receptor, in the hepatic removal of chylomicron remnants from the circulation (Willnow et al., 1994Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Google Scholar). Recently, Ji et al. (1994b) transfected a rat hepatoma cell line with the HL cDNA and demonstrated that the transfected cells had an increased capacity to internalize chylomicron remnants. Since the receptor responsible for this process has not yet been identified, we initiated studies to determine if LRP will bind and mediate the cellular internalization of HL and to examine the role of proteoglycans in this process. The results of our studies indicate LRP binds to HL in vitro and mediates the cellular internalization of HL leading to its degradation in lysosomes. We also demonstrate that proteoglycans appear essential for the LRP-mediated catabolism of HL. LRP was isolated from human placenta as described by Ashcom et al., 1990Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Google Scholar. Human RAP, expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, was prepared and purified as described previously (Williams et al., 1992Williams S. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). HL was labeled with [125I]iodine to a specific activity ranging from 2 to 10 μCi/μg of protein using Iodogen (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Bovine serum albumin, fraction V, and ovalbumin were purchased from Sigma. Roller cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells stably transformed with HL (Komaromy and Reed, 1991Komaromy M.C. Reed M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 963-974Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium supplemented with 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Manneheim) until subconfluent. The medium was replaced with 30 ml of induction medium (Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium containing Nutridoma, 30 μM ZnSO4, and 10 units/ml heparin) for 14 days, harvesting, and replacing the medium every 24 h. Harvested medium was spun at 1200 × g for 20 min and stored at −80°C until utilized. Rat HL was purified by a four-step procedure utilizing octyl-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and dextran sulfate-Sepharose columns. Elution and loading steps were linked to maximize enzyme recovery and prevent loss of activity. Briefly, rapidly thawed CHO medium (1 liter) was loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column (80-ml bed volume) which had been previously equilibrated with 5 m M barbital, 0.35 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). Following a wash step to remove unbound proteins, the column was eluted with 200 ml of 1.2% Triton N-101 in Buffer A. This material was applied immediately to a column of heparin-Sepharose (50-ml bed volume), washed, and eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl step gradient. Fractions containing HL were then applied to a 2-ml hydroxylapatite column, washed with 0.1 M NaPO4, pH 7.4, and eluted with 0.3 M NaPO4. The eluate was applied directly to a dextran sulfate-Sepharose column (6 ml), washed with Buffer A, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.35-1.5 M). This procedure resulted in isolation of a homogeneous band as determined by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (data not shown). The specific activity was indistinguishable from HL purified from rat liver perfusates (Ben-Zeev et al., 1987Ben-Zeev O. Ben-Avrum C.M. Wong H. Nikazy J. Shively J.E. Schotz M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 13-20Google Scholar). Typically, 1 mg of recombinant HL was obtained from 2 liters of CHO cell medium. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 515-kDa heavy chain of LRP (R777) and to a synthetic peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the 85-kDa light chain of LRP (R704) have been described elsewhere (Kounnas et al., 1992bKounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. Fitzgerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar). R777 antibodies were affinity selected on a column of LRP-Sepharose. R704 antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Both of the rabbit antibody preparations were dialyzed against isotonic PBS prior to use in cell assays. Homologous and heterologous ligand displacement assays were performed as described by Williams et al. (1992). Microtiter wells were coated with LRP or ovalbumin (5 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 5 m M CaCl2, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 0.5% ovalbumin, Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 5 m M CaCl2. Coated wells were incubated with radiolabeled ligand (2 n M) in 0.5% ovalbumin, Tris-buffered saline, 5 m M CaCl2, 0.05% Tween-20 in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor for 18 h at 4°C. Binding data were analyzed by using the computer program LIGAND (Munson and Robard, 1980Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2, ATCC HB 8065) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were grown in Eagle' minimal essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1%L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three types of CHO cells were used in these studies. CHO 745 provided by Dr. J. Esko (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) are deficient in all types of proteoglycans (Esko et al., 1986Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Google Scholar), CHO C16 (ATCC CCL 61) are a wild type cell line, and CHO 13-5-1 are LRP-deficient cells prepared by toxin-mediated selection of mutagenized CHO C16 cells. 2Fitzgerald, D. J., Fryling, C., Zdanovsky, A., Saelinger, C., Kounnas, M., Winkles, J., Strickland, D., and Leppla, S. (1995) J. Cell Biol., in press. CHO cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence in Ham' F-12 medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum-optimized for CHO cells (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1%L-glutamine. A normal mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) line and a derivative of this cell line (Willnow and Herz, 1994Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Google Scholar) that is deficient in LRP biosynthesis (PEA13) were obtained from Dr. J. Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and maintained as described by Willnow and Herz, 1994Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Google Scholar. Cells were transferred to 12-well dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) at 2-3 × 105cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Prior to performing assays, cultured cells were washed with medium and incubated in medium containing 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Manneheim), 20 m M Hepes, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin (assay medium). For assays with HepG2 cells, radiolabeled HL (4 n M) in assay medium was incubated with cells for 6 h at 37°C, 5% CO2in the presence of increasing concentrations of RAP (0.2-1350 n M) or heparin (Sigma, 0.1-300 mg/ml). For assays using antibodies, cultured cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2with assay medium containing various concentrations of antibodies. Fresh medium containing the 125I-labeled ligand and antibodies was then added and incubated with the cells for 6 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. For CHO cell assays, 125I-HL (4 n M) was incubated with cells in the presence of unlabeled heparin (100 μg/ml) or LRP antibodies (100 μg/ml) for the indicated time intervals. In assays utilizing cultured fibroblasts, 125I-HL (4 n M) was added in assay medium either alone or in the presence of RAP (450 n M), heparin (100 μg/ml), or chloroquine (0.1 m M, Sigma). Radioactivity appearing in the cell culture medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was taken to represent degraded ligand. Total ligand degradation was corrected for the amount of degradation that occurred in control wells lacking cells. The amount of radioligand that was bound to the cell surface or that was internalized by cells was determined as described previously (Chappell et al., 1992Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25764-25767Google Scholar). Briefly, following incubation with the radioligand, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with a trypsin-EDTA, proteinase K solution. Surface-bound material was defined as the amount of radioactive ligand released by this treatment, and the amount of internalized ligand was defined as the amount of radioactivity which remained associated with the cell pellet following the treatment. To determine if HL can bind to LRP in vitro, homologous ligand displacement binding assays were conducted. The results of these experiments, shown in Fig. 1 (Panel A), demonstrate that 125I-HL bound to purified LRP immobilized on microtiter plastic wells, but not to ovalbumin-coated microtiter wells. Its binding was prevented by excess cold HL, which is consistent with specific binding. Quantitative information from these data was derived using the program LIGAND, and the binding was adequately described by a model containing a single class of sites with a KDof 52 n M. This value is slightly weaker than the KDof 20 n M measured for the interaction of LpL with LRP (Chappell et al., 1993Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Google Scholar) using a similar assay. RAP, a known antagonist of ligand binding to LRP, inhibited the binding of HL to LRP (Fig. 1, Panel B). HL is known to bind heparin, and consequently the effect of heparin on its interaction with LRP was also measured. The results (Fig. 1, Panel B) revealed that heparin almost completely blocked the binding of 125I-HL to LRP. To investigate whether or not LRP is able to mediate the cellular internalization of HL, we utilized a MEF cell line, and a derivative of this cell line that is LRP-deficient (PEA13) (Willnow and Herz, 1994Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, LRP-expressing MEF cells efficiently internalized and degraded 125I-HL. Approximately 80% of the degradation of 125I-HL was inhibited by RAP, while heparin completely blocked the degradation of this ligand. Chloroquine, a drug which effectively prevents lysosomal degradation by altering the pH of lysosomes, also blocked the degradation of 125I-HL in these cells, confirming that the degradation of this ligand requires lysosomal enzymes. In contrast, 125I-HL was degraded relatively poorly in LRP-deficient mouse fibroblasts (PEA13 cells) to a level of 20% of that found in MEF cells (Fig. 2, right four bars). 125I-HL degradation in PEA13 cells was largely insensitive to RAP, but was inhibited by heparin and chloroquine. The data indicate that LRP is the predominant mediator of HL degradation in fibroblasts. Since a small amount of degradation was observed in PEA13 cells, it does appear that an LRP-independent pathway for HL clearance exists in these cells. To characterize the cellular catabolism of HL further, we next investigated this process in HepG2 cells. These cells were observed to rapidly internalize and degrade 125I-HL. To identify the receptor(s) that are responsible for this process in these cells, the effect of RAP and heparin on 125I-HL catabolism were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 A, heparin inhibited the surface binding of 125I-HL to HepG2 cells, while RAP slightly increased HL binding to HepG2 cell surfaces. However, concentrations of RAP sufficient to prevent binding of 125I-HL to LRP (Fig. 1, Panel B) blocked approximately 55% of the internalization and 60% of the degradation of 125I-HL in these cells (Fig. 3, Panels B and C). Exogenously added heparin completely blocked both processes. Experiments using both RAP and heparin together as competitors of HL binding, uptake, and degradation showed results similar to those obtained with heparin alone (data not shown). Because RAP prevented HL binding to cells without preventing its surface binding, while heparin completely blocked both processes, the data suggest that HL binding to cells is largely independent of LRP and is perhaps mediated by cell surface proteoglycans. Since RAP can also block LDL receptor-mediated catabolism (Medh et al., 1995Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Google Scholar), additional experiments were performed using antibodies that specifically inhibit LRP function. Surface binding of 125I-HL to HepG2 cells was not inhibited by LRP antibodies or control antibodies (Fig. 4, Panel A). LRP-antibodies did, however, effectively block 80% of 125I-HL internalization (Fig. 4, Panel B) and 60% of its degradation (Fig. 4, Panel C). Control antibodies had little or no effect on 125I-HL binding, internalization, or degradation by HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). When assays were performed which included both heparin and LRP antibodies as competitors of 125I-HL binding, uptake, and degradation, the results paralleled those observed using heparin alone. These data are consistent with the observation that heparin competes for HL binding to LRP in vitro (Fig. 1, Panel B) as well as for HL binding to cell surface proteoglycans, a likely primary binding site for HL on the cell surface, and support the hypothesis that HL binds initially to cell surface proteoglycans and that its subsequent internalization and degradation are substantially mediated by LRP. To further study the individual roles of LRP and proteoglycans in the catabolism of HL, cellular assays with 125I-HL were performed with normal CHO cells (C16), LRP-deficient CHO cells (13-5-1), or proteoglycan-deficient CHO cells (745). The degradation of 125I-HL by normal CHO cells (Fig. 5, Panel A), was inhibited by LRP antibodies (65%) and heparin (100%), while control antibodies had no effect. In the LRP-deficient cells (Fig. 5, Panel B), 125I-HL degradation is not inhibited by LRP antibodies but was blocked by heparin. In the proteoglycan-deficient cells (Fig. 5, Panel C) only a small amount of degradation of 125I-HL was observed. These data indicate that proteoglycans are required for HL catabolism. In addition, it is apparent that, like LRP-deficient mouse fibroblasts, the LRP-deficient CHO cells possess an alternative pathway for HL clearance, albeit somewhat less than that mediated by LRP. It is interesting to note that the alternative pathway seems to play a greater role in the CHO cells when compared to either HepG2 or fibroblasts. This is evidenced by comparing the percent of total HL internalized and degraded in the presence and absence of LRP antagonists in the individual cell lines. Likely this reflects that fact that CHO cells contain far fewer LRP molecules than HepG2 cells or fibroblasts. In the present study we demonstrate that HL binds to purified LRP with a KDof 52 n M. Like all known LRP ligands, the interaction of HL with LRP is inhibited by RAP. Heparin, which is known to bind to HL, also prevents its association with LRP. An interaction of LRP with HL immobilized on nitrocellulose has been recently reported (Nykjaer et al., 1994Nykjaer A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer N. Roigaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Google Scholar) and is supported by findings in the present investigation. Cellular uptake experiments show that 125I-HL is rapidly internalized and degraded in mouse fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Our studies identified LRP as a major receptor responsible for mediating the cellular internalization and degradation of 125I-HL. The role of LRP in HL catabolism is supported by the fact that, at concentrations known to completely block binding of HL and other ligands to LRP, RAP reduced the cellular catabolism of 125I-HL by 80 and 60%, in mouse fibroblasts and HepG2 cells, respectively. Further, anti-LRP IgG reduced the extent of cellular mediated degradation of 125I-HL by 60 and 65%, in HepG2 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, respectively. Finally, two mutant cell lines that do not express LRP show a greatly diminished capacity to internalize and degrade 125I-HL when compared to the control cell lines from which they were derived that do express LRP. Since HL catabolism was completely blocked by heparin, we also investigated the role of cell surface proteoglycans in this process. For this purpose, cell lines deficient in proteoglycan biosynthesis were utilized (Esko et al., 1986Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Google Scholar). The results from these experiments reveal that cell surface proteoglycans appear essential for the LRP-mediated uptake of HL and that glycosaminoglycans are important for serving as the primary cell surface binding site for HL. One possible explanation of these data is that after binding to cell surface proteoglycans, HL is then transferred to LRP for subsequent internalization and degradation. Cell surface proteoglycans are also known to facilitate the LRP-mediated catabolism of LpL (Chappell et al., 1993Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Google Scholar). It seems likely that proteoglycans serve to concentrate HL or LpL on the cell surface, thereby enhancing their interaction with LRP. Whether or not the proteoglycans are internalized along with LRP remains to be determined. The LRP-mediated catabolism of several other molecules, such as tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (Warshawsky et al., 1994Warshawsky I. Broze G.J.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Google Scholar), and thrombospondin (Mikhailenko et al., 1995Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Google Scholar) have recently been demonstrated to also be facilitated by cell surface proteoglycans. Experiments in the present study also confirm that HL is catabolized by a second pathway that does not involve LRP. This conclusion is supported by the fact that RAP or LRP antibodies are unable to completely block 125I-HL uptake and degradation in all cell lines examined and by the observation that 125I-HL is degraded in a heparin-dependent but RAP-independent manner in cell lines which lack LRP. While the receptor responsible for this second pathway has not been identified, it is not likely to be gp330 or the VLDL receptor, since RAP is an effective antagonist of ligand binding by these two receptors (Kounnas et al., 1992aKounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Google Scholar; Battey et al., 1994Battey F. Gafvels M.E. Fitzgerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Google Scholar). Further, gp330 is not expressed in any of the cell lines used in the current investigation. On the other hand, the LDL receptor has weak affinity for RAP (KD= 300 n M) and thus could be responsible for the low levels of uptake seen in these cells. The LDL receptor is present on HepG2 cells, fibroblasts, and CHO cells and is known to participate in the uptake of lipoprotein lipase. 3J. Medh, S. Bower, G. Fry, M. Pladet, M. Andracki, I. Inoue, J-M. Lalouel, D. Strickland, and D. Chappell, manuscript in preparation. Alternately, another unidentified receptor may be responsible for the catabolism of HL in these cell types. This receptor, like LRP, is likely to be dependent on proteoglycans for serving as the initial binding site for HL, since no specific uptake and degradation was observed in cells deficient in proteoglycan biosynthesis. The significance of the interaction of HL with LRP likely centers around the important role HL plays in lipoprotein catabolism. HL is a lipolytic enzyme that has both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activities and participates in the metabolism of remnants, IDL, and HDL particles. Remnant lipoprotein particles are generated from chylomicrons and VLDL during lipolysis of their triglycerides by LpL. The smaller, cholesterol-rich remnant particles are then removed from the circulation by liver parenchymal cells. This process is thought to occur by an initial interaction of the lipoproteins with cell surface proteoglycans, followed by internalization via a receptor-mediated process (Ji et al. 1994a). Efficient catabolism of lipoproteins requires apoE to be present on the particle surface and can be mediated by the LDL receptor. However, since these lipoproteins are efficiently catabolized in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have severe deficiencies of LDL receptor activity (Goldstein and Brown, 1989Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1215-1250Google Scholar), another receptor must assume this function in these patients. Recent studies in mice in which the LDL receptor expression was prevented by gene targeting suggest that LRP is a candidate for this receptor (Willnow et al., 1994Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Google Scholar). It is important to point out that LRP may not directly bind these remnant particles; in vitro experiments document that both remnant-like particles, and native VLDL require “activation” in order to bind to LRP. This can occur either by the addition of exogenous apoE (Kowal et al., 1989Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Google Scholar; Beisiegel et al., 1989Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Google Scholar) or LpL (Chappell et al., 1993Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Google Scholar). A secretion-recapture model for remnant uptake in the liver has been proposed (Brown et al., 1991Brown M.S. Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1991; 2: 65-72Google Scholar; Ji et al., 1994aJi Z.S. Fazio S. Lee Y.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Google Scholar) in which remnants entering the sinusoidal space of the liver are exposed to high concentrations of proteoglycan-bound apoE that has been secreted by hepatocytes. After enrichment of the remnants with apoE, they are active ligands for LRP, which can then mediate their internalization and subsequent degradation. HL and to a lesser extent LpL are also present in the hepatic sinusoids, and thus these molecules may also play an important role in remnant catabolism. The potential role of LpL in lipoprotein catabolism was first suggested by Felts et al., 1975Felts J.M. Itakura H. Crane T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 1467-1475Google Scholar who proposed that LpL promotes lipoprotein catabolism by providing a binding site for an endocytic receptor to internalize LpL-lipoprotein complexes. Using cross-linking experiments, Beisiegel et al. (1991) demonstrated that LpL could be cross-linked to a large cell surface receptor thought to be LRP. LpL was subsequently shown to bind to LRP and promote the LRP-mediated internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled VLDL (Chappell et al. 1992, 1993; Nykjaer et al., 1993Nykjaer A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its capacity to hydrolyze triglycerides on the surface of lipoproteins, LpL serves as a proteoglycan-anchored ligand for remnant binding and promotes the interaction of the lipoprotein with the endocytic receptor, LRP. It is possible that HL also promotes the LRP-mediated cellular internalization of lipoproteins by a similar mechanism. HL is abundant on the luminal surface of endothelial cells and hepatocytes within hepatic sinusoids and can be released from proteoglycan attachment sites by intravenous heparin. Injection of HL antibodies into animals resulted in an increase in remnant particles (Kuusi et al., 1979bKuusi T. Kinnunen P.K.J. Nikkila E.A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 384-388Google Scholar; Goldberg et al., 1982Goldberg I.J. Le N.-A. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Ginsberg H.N. Lindgren F.T. Brown W.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1184-1192Google Scholar; Daggy and Bensadoun, 1986Daggy B.P. Bensadoun A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 252-261Google Scholar; Shafi et al., 1994Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Google Scholar), suggesting a role for HL in remnant clearance. Infusion of HL into rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet reduced the levels of β-VLDL which had accumulated in their plasma (Chang and Borensztajn, 1993Chang S. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 745-750Google Scholar). In addition, studies have shown that cells transfected with HL cDNA bind 3-fold more β-VLDL than nontransfected cells (Ji et al., 1994bJi Z.-S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Google Scholar). Further, Ji et al. (1994b) demonstrated that transfected cells displayed an increased capacity to internalize β-VLDL, presumably via a receptor-mediated process. While the receptor responsible for this process has not been identified, LRP is a likely candidate since our studies have confirmed that HL interacts with LRP. In summary, we have identified LRP as a primary endocytic receptor for HL in HepG2 cells, fibroblasts, and CHO cells. Our studies indicate that proteoglycans are critical for initial binding of HL to the cell surface. Studies are underway to determine if HL bound chylomicron remnants are also endocytosed in association with HL via LRP."

The inclusion of a specific inhibitor (SDZ 223-941) of the converting enzyme in the refolding mixture prevented proteolytic processing to the 10-/20-kDa form. Similarly, refolding under nonreducing conditions also prevented processing. Time course experiments showed that the 10-kDa subunit was released from the 45-kDa precursor before the 20-kDa subunit, implying that the N-terminal portion of the precursor is released last and may play a regulatory role.

This P1 specificity is shared with only two other enzymes from mammalian sources, granzyme B (16Caputo A. James M.N.G. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleakley R.C. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Google Scholar), a serine protease from cytolytic lymphocytes, and prICE (17Lazebnik Y.E. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar), an enzyme that cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This very rare specificity suggests that a mechanism of autocatalytic processing is responsible for the generation of mature p10/p20 ICE. This theory is supported by several pieces of experimental evidence. The addition of purified ICE to the intact p45 precursor results in the generation of p10/p20 ICE (9Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G.

Here we show conclusively that following expression, purification, and refolding, the p45 precursor autocatalytically converts to the mature p10/p20 form of ICE. Strains and Plasmid Construction The complete precursor ICE (p45) cDNA was cloned, via polymerase chain reaction amplification, from a commercially available human peripheral blood monocyte cDNA library (Clonetech 1050a), into vector pGI-λ-PBR#13, under the control of the λ PL promoter and transfected into the E. coli strain SG936pCI857. The p45 cDNA clone was sequenced, and the DNA sequence was shown to agree with that reported by Thornberry et al. (9Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

Fermentation of the Expression Strain The SG936pCI857 expression strain was grown in 1 liter of L-broth (NaCl, 10 g/liter; Difco Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter; BBL Bacto yeast extract, 5 g/liter), supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 g/liter), and kanamycin (0.04 g/liter) for 6 h at 30°C. This preculture was used to inoculate 19 liters of fermentation medium (L-broth with ampicillin, 0.1 g/liter) in a 30-liter steel fermenter. The bacteria were grown at 30°C at an agitation speed of 200 rpm and an aeration rate of 1 (v/v/min). The expression of p45 ICE was induced by a temperature shift to 42°C when an A550value of 0.5-0.7 had been reached. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction; at which time, no further increase in A550above a value of 3-4 was observed. The culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the cell paste was frozen until required. Inclusion Body Isolation and Purification Frozen E. coli wet cell pellets were suspended to 12.5% (w/v) in cell lysis buffer (50 m M Tris, pH 8.0; containing 2 m M DTT, 5 m M benzamidine-HCl, and 2 m M EDTA) and mixed by stirring for 1 h on ice. The cell suspension was lysed by passage through a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer (2 passes at 1200 bar) and then centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The resultant pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and recentrifuged a further 3 times. Semipurified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 25 m M DTT and purified by sequential preparative reversed phase HPLC on two Orpegen HD gel RP-7 s C8 (22 × 250 mm) columns using a water/acetonitrile buffer system. p45 containing fractions from the second Orpegen column were pooled and, following removal of organic solvent, lyophilized and stored at −20°C. Refolding of p45 Lyophilized inclusion bodies were solubilized (1 mg/ml) in 50 m M Tris, pH 8.0 (containing 8 M urea, 50 m M DTT), for 1 h at room temperature. Following dilution with 3 volumes of 50 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 10 m M DTT, the refolding mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 2 × 80 volumes of 50 m M Tris, pH 8.0, containing 10 m M GSH. Refolding and p45 purification were monitored by analytical reversed phase HPLC using a 4.6 × 150-mm Polymer Laboratories PLRP-S 1000-Å column. Refolding in the Presence of a Specific ICE Inhibitor Refolding in the presence of SDZ 223-941, a P-site substrate based irreversible inhibitor, was carried out as described above except that at the dilution and dialysis steps inhibitor (SDZ 223-941 10 mg/ml stock in Me2SO) was added to a 1.5 molar excess. Samples were removed at each step for SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses. Gel Filtration Chromatography 4 ml of concentrated ICE was loaded onto a 1.6 × 60-cm column of Superdex 75 equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 m M DTT. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and those found to contain p10/p20 ICE were pooled and tested. IL-1β Convertase Activity Determinations ICE activity was detected by monitoring cleavage of recombinant IL-1β precursor to mature IL-1β using analytic HPLC. ICE samples were added (1:100 enzyme/substrate ratio) to 1 ml of recombinant hu-IL-1β precursor solution (330 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The incubation mixtures were then diluted 3-fold and analyzed on reversed phase HPLC (80 μl injection volume). Untreated precursor and recombinant hu-IL-1β were used as standards. SDS-PAGE was carried out under reducing conditions on 4-20% Novex gradient gels run according to the manufacturer's instructions. N-terminal amino acid sequence determination by Edman degradation was performed on an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer fitted with an HPLC on-line system 120A. Protein mixtures were run on 4-20% gradient gels (Novex) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (19Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). Following identification of the protein bands, the blots were completely destained with 100% methanol, and the protein bands were cut out (1 × 10-mm pieces). These were then loaded into a continuous flow reactor (20Shively J.E. Miller P. Ronk M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 517-529Google Scholar) and microsequenced. From 100 liters of fermentation broth, a 155-g wet cell pellet was obtained from which 22 g of inclusion bodies were isolated. At this stage, the purity of the p45 was no more than 25% (Fig. 2 a). Following solubilization and reversed-phase HPLC, the purity was increased to more than 80%, with p45 being observed essentially as a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 a), which remained present following dilution to 2 M urea and the first dialysis. But during the second dialysis, this band gradually disappeared, being replaced by a large number of bands ranging in molecular mass from 36 to 8 kDa that had not been present in the starting material. Two of the most intense bands corresponded in molecular mass to the p10 and p20 subunits of ICE (Fig. 2 a). The gel was blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride, and the most intense bands were sequenced. A total of seven bands with molecular masses of 45, 36, 27, 25, 23, 14, and 12 kDa, respectively, were cut and sequenced from the polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The results (Figs. 3, a and b) show that all of the bands contained either the p45 N-terminal sequence or sequences generated following cleavage of an Asp- X bond. The bands at 25, 23, and 12 kDa were identified as p24, p20, and p10, respectively. The bands at 45 and 36 kDa contained only the p45 N-terminal sequence; the band at 36 kDa must, therefore, have been generated by cleavage at the C-terminal end of the protein. The band at 14 kDa consisted primarily (66%) of an elongated form of p10 containing the Ser298-Asp316linker (see Figs. 1 and 3 b). The band at 27 kDa contained 5 sequences; one identified as the p45 N-terminal (11%) and the remainder as fragments generated by cleavage after Asp92(49%), Asp210(15%), Asp80(13%), and Asp119(12%). When samples of the refolding mixture were removed at different times during the refolding and analyzed using SDS-PAGE, it was observed (Fig. 2 b) that the 36 and 14 kDa bands were generated first, followed by the bands at 27, 25, 23, and 12 kDa. Fig. 3Figure 3:The proteolytic fragments generated are all products of Asp-X cleavage. a, N-terminal sequence analysis of p45-derived polypeptides separated on a 4-20% reducing SOS-PAGE gel (Novex) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane.

Similarly such refolding mixtures were shown by analytical HPLC to be inactive using recombinant IL-1β precursor as substrate (Fig. 4 d). When the dialysis step of refolding was carried out under nonreducing conditions by omission of the thiol reagents, p45 remained similarly undegraded. Subsequent addition of GSH to 10 m M resulted in rapid breakdown of p45 (Fig. 2 c). When GSH in the dialysis buffer was replaced by either β-mercaptoethanol or DTT at the same concentration, a similar generation of lower molecular weight fragments was observed (Fig. 2 c). However, dialysis with DTT led to a further degradation of p10 not seen with either GSH or β-mercaptoethanol. Incubation of recombinant hu-IL-1β precursor with p45 solution after dialysis was shown by HPLC (Fig. 4 c) to result in an almost complete breakdown of IL-1β precursor yielding mature IL-1β and three precursor fragments. Determination of the ICE activity of this preparation using a synthetic peptide substrate revealed a specific activity of 0.369 μmol/mg/min (not shown). When a concentrated solution of p45 dialyzed under reducing conditions was run on Superdex 75, a peak was eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 34,500 daltons that was shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 a) to contain virtually pure p10/p20. When tested against recombinant IL-1β precursor, this material was shown to possess ICE activity (Fig. 4 e). We have demonstrated that, following refolding by dilution and subsequent dialysis, purified recombinant p45 ICE is converted to p10/p20 ICE. Conversion occurs in a time-dependent manner through a series of intermediates. Identification of these through sequence analysis has given us an insight into the mechanism of conversion. The process begins slowly during the second dialysis step as the chaotroph concentration is reduced and three prominent products are seen. These are a 36-kDa C-terminally truncated p45, p10, and p10 carrying the Ser298-Asp316linker. At this stage, little or no p20 or p24 are observed. This suggests that the first step in the conversion is the removal of p10 plus linker by cleavage at Asp297followed rapidly or simultaneously by the removal of the linker by cleavage at Asp316. The p36 band, which contains only the p45 N-terminal sequence, must therefore represent p45 minus Ser298-His404and is itself further processed down to p20 (presumably via p24, as the intensities of the p24 and p20 bands do not increase significantly until p14 and p10 have already been formed and p36 starts to decrease in intensity; Fig. 2 b). Therefore, the p10/p20 form is clearly formed via processing through several intermediates, each itself being formed by cleavage at Asp- X (Fig. 5). Conversion to p10/p20 was abolished by the inclusion of SDZ 223-941, a P-site substrate-based irreversible inhibitor of ICE. The end product of the conversion was an ICE preparation of far greater stability and higher specific activity than ICE produced by the co-refolding of separately expressed p10/p20 subunits.2 2P. Ramage and A. Mackenzie, unpublished results. Gel-filtration chromatography resulted in preparations containing virtually pure active ICE with an apparent molecular mass of 34,500 Da, similar to the previously reported figure of 29,000 Da (13Walker N.P.C.

The expression of p45 in the cytosolic fraction of SF9 cells and the subsequent detection of a number of lower molecular weight components including p10/p20 ICE (18Wang X.-M. Helaszek C.T.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 273-277Google Scholar), could conceivably have been due to the proteolytic “activation” of p45 by SF9 proteases. Earlier work (9Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar) had shown that p45 produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system remained in the precursor form until mature ICE had been added, leading the authors to believe that another protease may have been required to activate p45. The expression of a truncated form (minus amino acids 1-119) of murine p45 in E. coli resulted in the production of p10/p20 (10Molineaux S.M. Casano F.J. Rolando A.M. Peterson E.P. Limjuco G. Chin J.

A. 1993; 90: 1809-1813Google Scholar), suggesting that the N-terminal 119 amino acids of p45 may play a regulatory role in autocatalytic conversion. The reaction that we have observed has been carried out in vitro using p45 expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli. These inclusion bodies were purified under strongly denaturing conditions prior to refolding and would therefore be unlikely to have contained active proteases of bacterial origin. In a control experiment (not shown) an inclusion body fraction from the same host cell line, but expressing an unrelated protein was enriched using HPLC and a fraction corresponding to the position of elution of p45ICE collected and refolded using identical conditions to those used for p45 ICE. No protease activity was detected using the IL-1β precursor and synthetic peptides as substrates (data not shown). The cleavage products that we observed were those produced by cleavage at the known cleavage sites in p45 (8Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F. Gaffney E.P.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar). Only the faint band at 27 kDa contained sequences that were produced by cleavage at other Asp- X sites. It has been reported that although the protein prICE recognizes the same tetrapeptide cleavage site as ICE, prICE does not cleave the IL-1β precursor, nor does ICE have any activity against the prICE substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (17Lazebnik Y.E. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar). It is extremely unlikely that a contaminating protease with Asp- X specificity could have been responsible for the specific cleavage observed and that this cleavage was therefore autocatalytic. Following dilution under reducing conditions, dialysis carried out in the absence of GSH, DTT, or β-mercaptoethanol prevented autocatalytic processing. The subsequent addition of GSH resulted in rapid autocatalysis, showing clearly that reducing agents play a key role in triggering the autocatalytic conversion of p45 to ICE. When p45 was observed to be expressed in an intact form in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (9Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K.

Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar), this stability may have been due to the relatively low thiol content of the translation mixture. How ICE autocatalysis is controlled in vivo remains to be seen. However, the fact that an N-terminally truncated form (minus amino acids 1-119) of the mouse enzyme expressed in E. coli was produced as a p10/p20 heterodimer indicates a role for amino acids 1-119 in the regulation of autocatalysis. We have shown that removal of amino acids 1-119 is not necessary for autocatalysis to occur and that the regulatory mechanism can, in-vitro, be bypassed by high concentrations of low molecular weight thiols. The strong effects exerted by thiols suggest that the three closely located cysteines at positions Cys69, Cys72, and Cys77could play a role in the regulation of enzyme activity. On the other hand, the dependence of ICE autocatalysis on low molecular weight thiols might merely be a reflection of the fact that mature p10/p20 ICE requires DTT concentrations in the order of 10 m M for reactivation (21Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Google Scholar).2 We have shown that the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme is produced by an autocatalytic conversion of the 45-kDa precursor in vitro. The mechanism controlling autocatalytic conversion remains unclear, but our results show that low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione play a key role in triggering autocatalytic conversion in vitro."

Considerable research has focused on determining the role of cAMP in signal transduction since it was discovered as an intracellular second messenger of hormone action (1Sutherland E.W. Science. 1972; 171: 401-408Google Scholar, 2Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 43: 923-959Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP is released from distinct locations at the cell membrane by hormonal activation of adenylate cyclase and diffuses or is transported to its site of action. The predominant effect of cAMP is to activate a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseAKAPA-kinase anchor proteinbpbase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four molecules of cAMP bind each dormant PKA holoenzyme, activating the kinase by releasing the catalytic (C) subunits from the regulatory (R) subunit-cAMP complex (2Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 43: 923-959Google Scholar). Active PKA potentiates the hormonal response by phosphorylating key enzymes and structural proteins, thus modifying their function. Although the mechanics of PKA activation are well understood, it is still unclear how individual hormones that utilize this ubiquitous cAMP signaling pathway are able to exert localized and specific effects (3Harper J.F. Haddox M.K. Johansen R. Hanley R.M. Steiner A.L. Vitam. Horm. 1985; 42: 197-252Google Scholar, 4Scott J.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 123-145Google Scholar, 5Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Google Scholar). To accommodate these pleotrophic properties, PKA must be localized in a microenvironment with the adenylate cyclase complex or in a cellular microcompartment that preferentially concentrates cAMP. Therefore, selective activation of compartmentalized PKA is a plausible mechanism to ensure the selectivity of a hormonal response, and, accordingly, the cellular location of the kinase must be highly regulated (3Harper J.F.

Two classes of R subunit exist, RI and RII, which form the type I and type II PKA holoenzymes, respectively (8Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Google Scholar). In contrast, a significant proportion of the RII isoforms (RIIα and RIIβ) are particulate, and up to 75% of the cellular RII pool associates with the plasma membrane, cytoskeletal components, endoplasmic reticulum, secretory granules, or nuclei (9Corbin J.D.

Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 5-11Google Scholar), each AKAP must contain additional binding sites responsible for targeting to cellular structures and/or interaction with other proteins. In an effort to identify AKAP binding proteins, complementary DNAs that encode proteins that associate with AKAP79, a neuronal anchor protein (24Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar), were isolated using the yeast two-hybrid system (27Chein C.T. Bartlet P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Google Scholar, 28Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Langeberg L.K. Howard M. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Google Scholar). A cDNA for the phosphatase 2B, calcineurin, was isolated and is consistent with earlier observations that PKA and calcineurin copurify through a number of chromatography steps (29Hathaway D.R. Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8183-8189Google Scholar). Biochemical and immunological studies have confirmed that both PKA and calcineurin are targeted to subcellular sites by association with AKAP79, possibly to regulate the phosphorylation state of key neuronal substrates (28Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Langeberg L.K. Howard M. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel AKAP, AKAP100, which is selectively expressed in the brain, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. Biochemical and immunochemical analyses suggest that AKAP100 and RII associate in vivo at the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Human cDNA expression libraries were screened by direct overlay with 32P-labeled RIIα as a probe with modifications to the method of Lohmann et al. (17Lohmann S.M. DeCamilli P. Einig I. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4887-4891Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 18. Plaques were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RIIα by the C subunit of PKA was performed with [γ-32P]ATP as described (31Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4379-4383Google Scholar). All sequencing reactions were performed by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Filters containing immobilized samples of mRNAs of selected human tissues (Clontech) and of human brain regions (provided by Dr. Jeff Arriza, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) were probed with a 32P-radiolabeled 1400-base pair fragment encompassing the 3′-coding region of the AKAP100 cDNA. Radiolabeling of the AKAP100 cDNA probe was achieved by the random priming method described in Ref. 33Feinberg A.P. Voglestein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Google Scholar using [α-32P]dCTP. Nitrocellulose filters were prehybridized in 400 m M sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 1 m M EDTA, 5% SDS, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50% formamide for 2 h at 42°C. The radiolabeled cDNA probe was denatured by heating at 100°C for 10 min and then added directly to the nitrocellulose filters. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer at 42°C overnight with gentle agitation. Non-hybridized probe was removed by washing (three times) in excess 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 1 m M EDTA at 53°C for a total of 2 h. 32P-Radiolabeled β-actin cDNA was used to probe both of these blots under similar conditions. Hybridizing mRNA species were detected by autoradiography. Construction of the AKAP100 expression vector pET11d AKAP100kfc was performed by simultaneous ligation of two DNA fragments into the bacterial expression vector pET11dkfc (34). Initially, a 1398-bp EcoRI- BamHI fragment was excised from the original cDNA clone. Second, an 821-base pair fragment encompassing the 5′-end of the AKAP100 coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Primers were designed to create an NcoI site at the 5′-end (5′-TCCCAAACCATGGCCTTTACTGGCAG-3′) and the T3 site at the 3′-end (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′). Digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product with NcoI and EcoRI removed a 597-bp fragment. The expression plasmid pET11d AKAP100kfc was constructed by ligating the 1398-bp EcoRI- BamHI and 597-bp NcoI- EcoRI fragments into an NcoI- BamHI cut vector. The fidelity of the AKAP100 coding region was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Expression of AKAP100kfc protein was achieved in Escherichia coli pLysS cells as described (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). Soluble Kfc protein was purified by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-agarose as described (34Stofko-Hahn R.E. Carr D.W. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 274-278Google Scholar). Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon). Overlay assays were performed by the method of Lohmann et al. (18Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar), and quantitative overlays were performed as described (22Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Schafer-Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Google Scholar). Binding was detected by autoradiography and was measured by densitometry after scanning into a computer and analyzed by the National Institutes of Health Image 1.55 program. In control experiments, 32P-labeled RII probe was pre-incubated with Ht31-(493-515) anchoring inhibitor peptide (0.5 m M) as described (36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AKAP100 (produced by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX) were affinity purified using AKAP100 protein coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) and used at 1:250 dilution. Anti-RII antibodies, raised in rabbits (36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar), were affinity purified and used at 1:5000 dilution. Rat cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle cell lines H9c2 and L6P were grown in 75-cm2tissue culture flasks (NUNC) in Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium containing 10% fetal calf serum until confluent. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and scraped from the tissue culture flasks. The cell pellet was concentrated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, resuspended in buffer A (50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100 0.05 m M dithiothreitol, 0.5 m M MgCl2, 0.125 m M EDTA, 0.1 μM leupeptin, 0.1 μM pepstatin, 0.1 m M benzamidine, 0.1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated for 30 s (three bursts of 10 s) on ice. After sonication, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A. Protein concentrations of the supernatant and pellet fractions were measured by Bradford assay (Pierce). Equal concentrations of protein (100 μg), unless otherwise stated, were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for subsequent analyses. Immunofluorescence studies were performed on rat cardiac muscle H9c2 cells grown in Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium containing 10% fetal calf serum on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture (NUNC) plates for 72 h at 37°C. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formalin in PBS, pH 7.4, extracted in absolute acetone at −20°C, and rehydrated in PBS + 0.1% BSA before incubation with affinity-purified primary antibodies (1:100 dilution anti-goat RII and 1:250 dilution AKAP100) for 1 h at room temperature. Control experiments with antibody to signal sequence receptor (1:50 dilution, kindly provided by Dr. T. A. Rapoport, Max-Delbruck center for Molecular Medicine, Germany) and preimmune sera were performed under identical conditions. Cells were washed with excess PBS + 0.1% BSA (3 times) before incubation with secondary antibodies (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. RII was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, and AKAP100 was detected with Texas Red donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Unbound secondary antibodies were removed by washing with excess PBS + 0.1% BSA (three times). Coverslips were mounted with VectashieldTMmounting medium. Staining patterns were observed on a Leitz Fluovert FU confocal photomicroscope under oil immersion using a 63/1.4 OEL PL APO lens. RII-AKAP complexes were isolated from rat skeletal muscle cell extracts as previously described (36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar). Unbound protein was removed from the cAMP-agarose by washing with hypotonic buffer plus 1 M NaCl and four additional washes with hypotonic buffer. Finally, specifically bound proteins were eluted from the affinity resin by incubation at room temperature with hypotonic buffer containing 75 m M cAMP. Antibodies against AKAP100 peptide and recombinant AKAP100 were produced by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX). Oligonucleotide sequencing primers were purchased from the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology, Oregon Science University (Corvallis, OR). Clones encoding AKAPs were isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA expression library by the RII overlay method using RIIα as a probe. One positive clone was isolated from ∼250,000 recombinants. This clone was called hhBD-1 (1888 bp) and contained a partial open reading frame of 599 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). When Northern blots were screened with a hhBD-1 probe, the only mRNA species detected in human tissues was 8 kilobases, confirming that hhBD-1 was a partial fragment of the full-length cDNA. The human hippocampal cDNA library was rescreened with a 1400-bp HindIII- BamHI fragment excised from the 5′-end of hhBD-1, but this did not yield clones with any additional information. However, a random and oligo(dT)-primed human fetal brain cDNA library (provided by Dr. W. Michael Gallatin, ICOS Corp., Seattle, WA) was screened with the same probe, and 12 positive clones were identified from ∼500,000 recombinants. DNA from seven of the positive clones was sequenced and indicated that one clone, called hFB 7-1 (1314 bp), overlapped with hhBD-1 and yielded 822 bp of additional 5′-sequence. A composite sequence of 2595 is presented in Fig. 1A and contains an open reading frame encoding a 655-amino acid protein with a predicted Mr78,172. However, the protein migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa (see below); thus, in accordance with the nomenclature proposed for RII anchoring proteins by Hirsch and colleagues (39Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar), we have named the protein AKAP100. Comparison of the AKAP100 sequence to the DNA and protein data base did not identify any overall similarity to other known proteins. Computer-aided analysis of the AKAP100 sequence identified a putative amphipathic α-helix located between residues 392 and 408 (Fig. 1 B). This region is compared with the RII-binding regions of other AKAPs (Fig. 1 C). Both of these findings are consistent with the notion that residues 392-408 of AKAP100 form the RII-binding domain. To establish the tissue expression pattern of AKAP100, filters of immobilized poly(A)+RNA from several human tissues were screened with a radiolabeled 1400-bp HindIII- BamHI fragment excised from hhBD-1. A single mRNA species of 8 kilobases was detected in certain human tissues and a variety of brain regions (Fig. 2, A and C). The AKAP100 mRNA was most highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 A). When the filters were probed with a β-actin probe, equal levels of message were detected in each lane (Fig. 2, B and D). To confirm that AKAP100 was an RII binding protein, the full-length cDNA was expressed in E. coli using the kfc fusion system (34Stofko-Hahn R.E. Carr D.W. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 274-278Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 115-kDa protein was detected by SDS-PAGE in bacterial extracts of induced cells and was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 3 A). The expression of the recombinant fusion protein was monitored by Western blot (Fig. 3 A) using anti-peptide antisera raised against residues 188-203 of AKAP100 (Val-Lys-Arg-Val-Ser-Glu-Asn-Asn-Gly-Asn-Gly-Lys-Asn-Ser-Ser-His). The recombinant protein bound 32P-RII as assessed by a direct overlay (Fig. 3 C). Solid-phase RII binding was blocked when overlay blots were incubated with the anchoring inhibitor Ht31-(493-515) peptide (Fig. 3 D). This peptide has been previously shown to block RII-AKAP interaction (24Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar, 36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding to a band of 80 kDa was detected upon prolonged exposure of the control blot (Fig. 3 D). The binding affinity of AKAP100 was assessed by quantitative overlays using RIIα protein at a specific activity of 2.1-1.5 × 105cpm/pmol. The binding to immobilized AKAP100 and Ht31 over a range of 0.01-10 nmol/100 μl was detected by autoradiography and was measured by densitometry. Both proteins bound RII with high affinity, with half-maximal binding values calculated at 10 μM for AKAP100 and 2.5 μM for Ht31 (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data are consistent with the notion that the AKAP100 cDNA encodes a high affinity RII binding protein. The tissue distribution of AKAP100 mRNA suggested that the protein may be predominately expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. To test this hypothesis, affinity-purified polyclonal AKAP100 antisera, raised against purified recombinant AKAP100, was used to probe protein extracts from a variety of muscle cell lines including the rat cardiac muscle (H9c2) and rat skeletal muscle (L6P) cell lines. A single immunoreactive protein of 100 kDa was detected by Western blot for both H9c2 (Fig. 5, lane 2) and L6P (see below) cells. There was no immunoreactivity when identical blots were probed with preimmune serum (Fig. 5, lane 3). Numerous RII binding proteins ranging in size from 250 to 40 kDa were detected in both cell lines by direct overlay (data not shown). The subcellular location of AKAP100 was examined using indirect immunofluorescence techniques (Fig. 6). In quiescent H9c2 cells (Fig. 6 A), AKAP100 staining was restricted to the perinuclear regions (Fig. 6 C) and exhibited a similar staining pattern to the sarcoplasmic reticulum marker protein, signal sequence receptor (Fig. 6 B). Conversely, the staining pattern of the Golgi marker protein, mannosidase II, was distinct from AKAP100 (data not shown). Double immunofluorescence staining for AKAP100 (Fig. 6 C) and RII (Fig. 6 D) suggested that both proteins had overlapping cellular distributions and were concentrated in the same cellular compartment. This observation was confirmed by confocal microscopy showing that AKAP100 and RII have overlapping staining patterns in 0.1-micron-thick focal sections of H9c2 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Control experiments confirmed that no staining was observed with preimmune serum (Fig. 6, E and F) or secondary antibody alone (data not shown). These experiments are consistent with the localization of AKAP100 and a significant proportion of RII to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of H9c2 cells. An indistinguishable staining pattern for AKAP100, RII, and marker proteins was obtained when these experiments were repeated in L6P cells (data not shown). To examine whether AKAP100 was associated with RII in cell lysates, we attempted to purify the RII-AKAP100 complex using affinity chromatography on cAMP-agarose. L6P cells were used for these experiments because they grow more rapidly and, thereby, provide more starting material. Western blot analysis of solubilized L6P cell lysates indicated that the lysates contained RII that was purified by affinity chromatography on cAMP-agarose (Fig. 7 A). Identical blots probed with anti-AKAP100 antibodies indicated that a proportion of the AKAP100 present in the lysate copurified with RII (Fig. 7 B). These results provide evidence that RII-AKAP100 complexes exist and can be purified from cell lysates. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel A-kinase anchor protein, AKAP100, which is specifically localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. AKAP100 is selectively expressed in certain tissues, and high levels of the 8-kilobase message are detected in various brain regions and cardiac and skeletal muscle. This finding is supported by cloning studies that isolated the original cDNA fragment from a human hippocampal library. The calculated molecular weight of AKAP100 is 78,172, although the protein migrates with a mobility of Mr100,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Apparently, anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE gels is a characteristic of several AKAPs. For example, the bovine neural-specific anchoring protein, AKAP75, has a calculated molecular weight of 47,085 but migrates with an apparent mobility of 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels (24Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar). This has led Hircsh and colleagues (39Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar) to suggest that the abundance of acidic residues in the amino-terminal portion of the protein alters its migration pattern. Consistent with this hypothesis, AKAP100 also contains stretches of acidic side chains between residues 80 and 110 of the protein. A growing body of evidence suggests that AKAPs contain a conserved RII-binding site responsible for interaction with PKA. Recently, we have shown that RII binding proceeds through sites in the extreme amino terminus of RII, and isoleucines 3 and 5 on each RII protomer are required for interaction with an amphipathic helix on the surface of the AKAP (22Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Schafer-Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that an intact α-helical structure is required for RII-AKAP interaction (23Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar), and synthetic peptides encompassing the amphipathic helix regions of three AKAPs (Ht31, AKAP79, and AKAP95) block RII-AKAP interaction in vitro (19Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar, 24Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar, 36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it seems likely that residues 392-408 may form the RII-binding site on AKAP100. This region exhibits a high probability of amphipathic α-helix formation and shares 30-40% sequence identity with the RII-binding regions of other AKAPs (Fig. 1 B); deletion constructs lacking residues 392-410 are unable to bind RII by the overlay assay. 2B. M. Little and J. D. Scott, unpublished observation. Moreover, the anchoring inhibitor peptide, Ht31-(393-415), effectively competes with AKAP100 for RII binding in direct overlays. It would also appear that AKAP100 binds RIIα with high affinity, as half-maximal binding to the immobilized anchoring protein was measured in the micromolar range. Although it is technically infeasible to measure precise binding constants due to aggregation of AKAP100, it would appear that the intracellular levels of AKAP100 and RII (assessed by Western blotting) are within a concentration range sufficient to permit complex formation in vivo. This notion is supported by our evidence that AKAP100 is copurified with RII from L6P cell lysates by affinity chromatography on cAMP-agarose. Since recombinant AKAP100 does not display any intrinsic cAMP binding affinity, it is therefore likely that the anchoring protein was purified as complex with RII. In addition, both RII and AKAP100 were detected in the flow-through from the cAMP-agarose (Fig. 7). There are two potential explanations for this observation: the amount of RII in the cell lysate was in excess of the capacity of the cAMP-agarose preventing retention of all RII complexed with AKAP and an undetermined proportion of AKAP100 was not associated with RII. This observation is consistent with similar findings for AKAP79 and AKAP95 (24Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar, 36Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Google Scholar), which indicate that a proportion of the RII-binding sites on anchoring proteins are unoccupied. Furthermore, our findings show that only a fraction of RII purified is associated with AKAP100 (Fig. 7 B, lane 4). This is because the cAMP-agarose purification protocol isolates the total R subunit pool, which includes soluble RI, soluble RII, and RII associated with other AKAPs present in the L6P cell extract. Previous studies have proposed that the type II PKA is associated with native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (40Kawano S. Nakumura F. Tanaka T. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 585-589Google Scholar). This finding is supported by our immunocytochemical data showing that AKAP100 and a significant proportion of the cellular RII pool appear to be localized at the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In light of both observations, we suggest that AKAP100 functions to adapt PKA for a role in the phosphorylation of proteins in or surrounding the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although the precise identity of these target substrates remains to be determined, anchoring of kinases close to ion channels is an attractive hypothesis. Levitan and others (13Salavatori S. Damiani E. Barhanin J. Furlan S. Giovanni S. Margreth A. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 679-687Google Scholar, 40Kawano S. Nakumura F. Tanaka T. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 585-589Google Scholar, 41Chung S. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Google Scholar, 42Cai Y-C. Douglass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23720-23727Google Scholar, 43Chen Y. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7839-7842Google Scholar, 44Walsh K.B. Long K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 847-865Google Scholar) have proposed that targeting of kinases and phosphatases could permit the precise regulation of ion channel phosphorylation status. This view is supported by evidence suggesting that anchoring of PKA by AKAPs is required for modulation of glutamate receptor ion channels. Intracellular perfusion of cultured hippocampal neurons with anchoring inhibitor peptides derived from the conserved kinase-binding domain of AKAP79 or Ht31 prevented PKA-mediated regulation of the AMPA-kainate currents (25Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Google Scholar). Therefore, the AKAP100-PKA complex might interact directly with ion channels or may be targeted to structural proteins within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. For example, the ryanodine receptor, which forms the intracellular Ca2+release channel of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum, is activated by PKA (45Takasago T. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 872-877Google Scholar), influencing Ca2+mobilization within the cell (46Lory P. Nargeot J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1059-1065Google Scholar, 47Haase H. Karczewski P. Beckert R. Krause E.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 217-222Google Scholar). Other reports have suggested PKA activity is closely associated with a reconstituted calcium-activated potassium channel (41Chung S. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Google Scholar) and a sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated chloride channel (40Kawano S. Nakumura F. Tanaka T. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 585-589Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies suggest that voltage-dependent potentiation of the L-type Ca2+-gated channels in skeletal muscle requires anchored PKA. Catterall and colleagues (48Johnson B.D. Scheurer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Google Scholar) have shown that perfusion of the Ht31 anchoring inhibitor peptide prevents cAMP-responsive potentiation of the channel. In addition, AKAP100 may function to target other enzymes involved in signal transduction to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as we have recently demonstrated that AKAP79 forms a ternary complex with PKA and the phosphatase 2B, calcineurin (28Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Langeberg L.K. Howard M. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Google Scholar). These results suggest that both kinase and phosphatase are targeted to subcellular sites by association with a common anchor protein to regulate the phosphorylation state of key substrates. In conclusion, these studies suggest that AKAP100 is a novel protein that binds RIIα with high affinity. The anchoring protein is selectively expressed in certain human tissues and has been localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in rat cardiac H9c2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1581317354,"Human interleukin 5 (hIL5) and soluble forms of its receptor α subunit were expressed in Drosophila cells and purified to homogeneity, allowing a detailed structural and functional analysis. B cell proliferation confirmed that the hIL5 was biologically active. Deglycosylated hIL5 remained active, while similarly deglycosylated receptor α subunit lost activity. The crystal structure of the deglycosylated hIL5 was determined to 2.6-Å resolution and found to be similar to that of the protein produced in Escherichia coli. Human IL5 was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to form a 1:1 complex with the soluble domain of the hIL5 receptor α subunit (shIL5Rα). Additionally, the relative abundance of ligand and receptor in the hIL5·shIL5Rα complex was determined to be 1:1 by both titration calorimetry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of dissolved cocrystals of the complex. Titration microcalorimetry yielded equilibrium dissociation constants of 3.1 and 2.0 n M, respectively, for the binding of hIL5 to shIL5Rα and to a chimeric form of the receptor containing shIL5Rα fused to the immunoglobulin Fc domain (shIL5Rα-Fc). Analysis of the binding thermodynamics of IL5 and its soluble receptor indicates that conformational changes are coupled to the binding reaction. Kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance yielded data consistent with the Kdvalues from calorimetry and also with the possibility of conformational isomerization in the interaction of hIL5 with the receptor α subunit. Using a radioligand binding assay, the affinity of hIL5 with full-length hIL5Rα in Drosophila membranes was found to be 6 n M, in accord with the affinities measured for the soluble receptor forms. Hence, most of the binding energy of the α receptor is supplied by the soluble domain. Taken with other aspects of hIL5 structure and biological activity, the data obtained allow a prediction for how 1:1 stoichiometry and conformational change can lead to the formation of hIL5·receptor αβ complex and signal transduction.

IL5's central role in the control of eosinophilia has suggested that it is a major cause of tissue damage in asthma and other eosinophil-related disorders (Hamid et al., 1991Hamid Q. Azzawi M.

Cell Immunol. 1991; 133: 484-497Google Scholar). The human IL5 receptor is composed of two types of subunits, denoted α and β (Tavernier et al.,1991). The cloned cDNA for the α subunit (Murata et al., 1992Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominagam A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Google Scholar) encodes a glycoprotein of 420 amino acids with an amino-terminal hydrophobic region (signal sequence, 20 amino acid residues), a glycosylated extracellular domain (324 residues), a transmembrane domain (21 residues), and a cytoplasmic domain (55 residues). The α subunit expressed in a soluble form (the extracellular domain) can bind to IL5 without the β chain and is IL5-specific (Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar; Murata et al., 1992Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominagam A. Takatsu K. J. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6581-6587Google Scholar). In contrast, the β chain is identical to the β chains of GM-CSF and IL3 receptors (Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar; Lopez et al., 1990Lopez A.F. Eglinton J.M. Lyons A.B. Tapley P.M. To L.B. Clark S.G. Vadas M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 69-77Google Scholar) and appears to be needed for signal transduction.The ligand binding of human IL5 receptor α chain (hIL5Rα) is of high affinity, with a Kdof 0.6-1 n M reported for the α subunit expressed in various heterologous cells (Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar, Tavernier et al., 1992Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar; Takaki et al., 1993Takaki S. Murata Y. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1523-1529Google Scholar). The above studies showed that the affinity for α subunit alone was lower by a factor of 2-4-fold than that for cells transfected with both α and β subunits. Direct interaction of the β subunit with IL5 has been suggested by cross-linking (Devos et al., 1991Devos R. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Cornelis S. Vanderkerckhove J. Fiers W. Tavernier J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2133-2137Google Scholar; Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G.

Med. 1993; 177: 1523-1529Google Scholar) and as such could contribute energetically to the IL5 receptor affinity.The stoichiometry of IL5 binding to α subunit has been suggested to be 1:1 (one α subunit/IL5 dimer). This was based on both cross-linking data as well as from quantitating the abundance of each component in a complex isolated by immunoaffinity capture followed by gel filtration chromatography (Devos et al., 1993Devos R. Guisez Y. Cornelius S. Verhee A. Van der Heyden J. Manneberg M. Lahm H.W. Fiers W. Tavernier J. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6581-6587Google Scholar). A 1:1-sized cross-linked IL5-receptor α chain complex also has been observed indirectly (Mita et al., 1988Mita S. Harada N. Naomi S. Hitoshi Y. Sakamoto K. Akagi M. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 863-878Google Scholar; Migita et al., 1991Migita M. Yamaguchi N. Mita S. Higuchi S. Hitoshi Y. Yoshida Y. Tomonaga M. Matsuda I. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Cell Immunol. 1991; 133: 484-497Google Scholar; Devos et al., 1991Devos R. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Cornelis S. Vanderkerckhove J. Fiers W. Tavernier J.

The above 1:1 stoichiometry is unexpected, since the IL5 dimer has two 4-helix bundle domains. Each of these domains resembles the 4-helix bundle domain of monomeric growth factor proteins such as growth hormone (Abdel-Meguid et al., 1987Abdel-Meguid S.S. Shieh H-S. Smith W.W. Dayringer H.E. Violand B.N. Bentle L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6434-6437Google Scholar; de Vos et al., 1992de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar) and IL4 (Redfield et al., 1991Redfield C. Smith L.T. Boyd J. Lawrence G.M.P. Edwards R.G. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11029-11035Google Scholar), and each of the latter can bind at least one molecule of receptor/molecule ligand. Each IL5 monomeric domain might therefore be expected to bind at least one receptor molecule. Interestingly, the molecular weight of the cross-linked product of IL5 with β chain also suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry (Devos et al., 1991Devos R. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Cornelis S. Vanderkerckhove J. Fiers W. Tavernier J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2133-2137Google Scholar; Tavernier et al., 1992Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar). The structural basis for the 1:1 stoichiometry of IL5 and its α and β receptor subunits is as yet undetermined. The above methods used to define 1:1 stoichiometry, namely cross-linking and chromatographic isolation of complexes, likely would not detect weakly associating multimeric complexes. Nonetheless, if correct, 1:1 stoichiometry must be accounted for in explaining signal transduction.We have initiated an investigation of the quantitative and structural properties of the interaction of hIL5 with its receptor. In this report, we describe the expression and production of Drosophila-expressed hIL5 and both soluble and membrane-associated forms of its receptor α chain. We report the three-dimensional structure of deglycosylated Drosophila-expressed hIL5 and show that it is nearly identical to the protein produced in Escherichia coli (Milburn et al., 1993Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Wells T.N.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Google Scholar). We further report the interaction properties of these functionally active proteins. The equilibrium binding parameters of soluble and full-length IL5Rα chain show that the soluble domain of the receptor accounts for most, if not all, of the binding energy of cell-bound receptor α subunit recognition. We provide rigorous confirmatory evidence for a stoichiometry of 1:1 for the hIL5·receptor α chain complex. Finally, we report new data on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the IL5·receptor interaction which argue that conformational change occurs in this process. Together, the data suggest a model for the interaction of hIL5 with its receptor α and β subunits leading to signal transduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials For protein purification, Q-Sepharose fast flow, phenyl-Sepharose fast flow high substitution, Superose 12 and 6, and Superdex 75 were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. Hydroxylapatite high resolution medium was from Calbiochem. ABX-plus ion exchange resin was from J. T. Baker Chemical Co. Lentil lectin-agarose and methyl D-mannosylpyranoside were from E-Y Lab (San Mateo, CA). For BIAcore kinetics measurements, the sensor chips CM5, surfactant P20, and the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-ethyl- N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), and ethanolamine hydrochloride all were from Pharmacia Biosensor. Murine IL3 was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), and purified murine IL5 (specific activity 4.9 × 107units/mg) was prepared in a baculovirus expression system using Spodoptera frugiperda 21 cells (Mitchell et al., 1993Mitchell D.L. Young M.A. Entwistle C. Davies A.N. Cook R.M. Dodd I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 332SGoogle Scholar). The murine pre-B cell line, denoted B13, was obtained courtesy of R. Palacios, Basel Institute of Immunology, Switzerland. Expression of Recombinant IL5, shIL5Rα, and shIL5Rα-Fc Human IL5 and various forms of shIL5Rα were expressed in a Drosophila cell culture system (van der Straten et al., 1989van der Straten A. Johansen H. Rosenberg M. Sweet R.W. Curr. Methods Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 1-8Google Scholar; Angelichio et al., 1991Angelichio M.L. Beck J.A. Johansen H. Ivey-Hoyle M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5037-5043Google Scholar). Each gene to be expressed was cloned between a copper sulfate-inducible metallothionein promoter and an SV40 late polyadenylation site and introduced into Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells by cotransfection with a vector carrying a hygromycin B resistance gene. Hygromycin B-resistant cells were selected as a stable polyclonal population, induced with copper sulfate, and examined for expression by Western blot analysis. Antisera used for Western blots were raised by immunization of rabbits with denatured fusion proteins (expressed in E. coli and gel-purified) carrying hIL5 or hIL5Rα sequences.hIL5 ExpressionHuman IL5 expression was achieved with a vector encoding a fusion of a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) secretion signal sequence to amino acids 4-115 of mature hIL5. Cleavage of the signal sequence during secretion leaves four amino acids from tPA fused to the NH2terminus of hIL5, as reported for other such fusions (Culp et al., 1991Culp J.S. Johansen H. Hellmig B. Beck J. Matthews T.J. Delers A. Rosenberg M. BioTechnology. 1991; 9: 174-178Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of medium from induced cultures revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa under reducing conditions and 30 kDa under nonreducing conditions, as expected for the disulfide-linked homodimer. The cell line was expanded to 30 liters to produce hIL5.shIL5Rα ExpressionTo express shIL5Rα in Drosophila, a cDNA fragment encoding the shIL5α protein precursor (signal sequence followed by mature shIL5Rα) was cloned from human eosinophil RNA by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into an expression vector (pMTAL) to yield pMTAL-shIL5Rα, a vector that does not contain the tPA sequence. DNA sequence analysis showed the shIL5Rα sequence to be identical to that reported by others (Tavernier et al., 1992Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of induced culture carrying this construct revealed a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 40-43 kDa under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. The cell line was expanded to 4 liters in spinner flasks for production of shIL5Rα.shIL5Rα-Fc Chimera ExpressionA fusion of shIL5Rα to the CH2-CH3 region of human IgG1 was constructed and then expressed in Drosophila cells as described above for shIL5Rα. In this construct, the COOH terminus of shIL5Rα (Arg315of mature shIL5Rα) was linked to the NH2terminus of the IgG1 hinge region (Glu226, Kabat numbering) by the short sequence Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, a Factor Xa cleavage site, allowing recovery of shIL5Rα by proteolytic cleavage of the purified chimera. The Fc region also had a mutation of Cys230to Ala. Western analysis using anti-shIL5Rα antiserum showed that this protein (70 kDa under reducing conditions, 140 kDa and hence dimeric under nonreducing conditions) was produced in Drosophila cell cultures at levels comparable to shIL5Rα lacking the Fc region. The cell line was expanded to 4 liters for production of the Fc receptor chimera. In the present study, we evaluated the binding properties of the uncleaved and unreduced chimera (molecular mass 140 kDa), which retains both sIL5Rα fragments/molecule. Expression of Full-length hIL5Rα in Drosophila Cells The transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of hIL5Rα was cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a butyrate-induced eosinophilic subline of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells and the intended DNA sequence confirmed. This fragment was cloned into pMTAL-shIL5Rα to create a new vector, pMTAL-hIL5Rα, containing the full-length receptor (20 amino acid signal sequence followed by 400 amino acid mature protein). Western blot analysis of induced cells carrying this construct revealed a band with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. Protein Purification Expression levels of hIL5, shIL5Rα, and shIL5Rα-Fc in Drosophila media used for large scale purification were estimated to be 22, 17, and 10 mg/liter, respectively, from Western blot analysis and Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses of all three products in culture media suggested heterogeneity in the carbohydrate content. Protein concentration of the starting material and at various stages of purification was estimated by the Micro BCA Protein assay. Extinction coefficients at 280 nm calculated from tryptophan and tyrosine contents matched well with those measured by amino acid analysis: E280(cm - mg/ml)−1= 0.63 for hIL5, 1.9 for shIL5Rα, and 1.65 for shIL5Rα-Fc. Throughout this study, concentrations of purified proteins were based on absorbance at 280 nm.Purification of hIL528 liters of sterile-filtered Drosophila media were diluted 3-fold with water, adjusted to pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column (11.4 × 14.1 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. hIL5 in the flow-through fractions was pooled, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 6 M HCl, and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (HA) equilibrated with Buffer T (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The column was washed with Buffer T, and bound hIL5 was eluted with 0.25 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Pooled fractions from the HA column were mixed with an equal volume of 3 M ammonium sulfate and applied to phenyl-Sepharose ff (5.7 × 7 cm) equilibrated with 1.5 M NH4SO4in Buffer P (20 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). hIL5 was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5-0 M NH4SO4in Buffer P. The pooled fraction from phenyl-Sepharose (600 ml) was concentrated to 80 ml, loaded onto Superose 12, and eluted with Buffer T + 0.15 M NaCl. The final yield of hIL5, approximately 500 mg, was >98% electrophoretically homogeneous based on silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels; nucleic acid and endotoxin were undetectable.Purification of shIL5Rα4.3 liters of sterile-filtered conditioned Drosophila media (MRD3) were diluted 2-fold with Buffer T, adjusted to pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (5 × 8.8 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer T. Receptor in flow-through fractions (9 L) was concentrated to 1900 ml using a Miniset 10K cutoff membrane (Filtron, Northborough MA). The concentrated Q-Sepharose pool was applied to an ABX-plus column (5 × 7 cm, J. T. Baker Chemical Co.) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 m M sodium acetate, pH 5.5), and washed with Buffer A. Bound receptor was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing receptor were immediately neutralized with pH 7.4 1 M Tris-HCl buffer. This ABX pool (240 ml) was adjusted to 5 m M CaCl2, sterile filtered, and loaded onto two lentil lectin columns (2.5 × 5.8 cm) in tandem, equilibrated with Buffer C (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl, and 5 m M CaCl2). Bound receptor was eluted with 0.25 M methyl D-mannosylpyranoside in Buffer C. The lentil column pool (88 ml) was concentrated to 12 ml on a YM-10 membrane (Amicon) and loaded onto a Superdex 75 preparation grade column (2.6 × 96.4 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5. Pooled fractions (29 ml) were stored at −70°C. The Superdex 75 column eluate contained 20 mg of receptor, with >98% electrophoretic homogeneity based on silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels.Purification of shIL5Rα-Fc Chimera4 liters of conditioned Drosophila media were diafiltered into 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and concentrated to 600 ml. The diafiltered and concentrated media were loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose ff column (2.5 × 5.8 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and washed with the same buffer. The Fc chimera was eluted with 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 3.0, and fractions were collected in 1 M Trizma base to raise the final pH to 7.7. The chimera was fractionated on a Superose 6 column into 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5. 2.8 mg of Fc chimera (>95% electrophoretically homogeneous in SDS-PAGE) was obtained from 4 liters of media. Mass Spectroscopy Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALD-MS) data were obtained on a Vestec Research model mass spectrometer (Persceptive Biosystems, Boston, MA). Samples were prepared for analysis by mixing 1 μl of a 1-6 pmol/ml solution of protein in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1 μl of the matrix, sinapinic acid, on the stainless steel target. The 337-nm line from a nitrogen laser (10 ns pulse width, 10 Hz repetition rate) was used for desorption/ionization of the sample. The spectra were the sum of ∼20-70 laser shots. Spectra were calibrated externally using the BSA (bovine serum albumin) and BSA dimer peaks.Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on a Sciex API-III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with a standard pneumatically assisted nebulization probe and an atmospheric pressure ionization source (Sciex, Ontario, Canada). Buffers and salts were removed by high performance liquid chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. Sample was loaded in aqueous buffer onto a 2.1 mm inner diameter C8 guard column, flushed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min and then step eluted with 60% CH3CN, 40% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of the sample was concentrated to near dryness and brought to a final concentration of ∼20 pmol/μl with methanol/water (50:50 v/v) containing 0.2% formic acid. Sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer by infusion with a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments) at 2 μl/min. Approximately 2 min of data were recorded and ∼40 pmol of the sample consumed. Enzymatic Deglycosylation and Cross-linking to 125I-hIL5 hIL5 was iodinated with Bolton-Hunter reagent to a specific activity of >350 Ci/mmol using the manufacturer's protocol (DuPont NEN). 100 μg of shIL5Rα or 10 μg of 125I-hIL5 were enzymatically deglycosylated by treating with 5,000 units of PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) in 50 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 12-16 h at 37°C in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μM leupeptin). Analysis of the shIL5Rα product by Western blot showed a reduction in molecular mass of ∼3-4 kDa relative to untreated receptor, consistent with loss of carbohydrate but absent proteolytic degradation (data not shown). The mobility was identical to shIL5Rα enzymatically deglycosylated in denaturing conditions (0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol), suggesting that deglycosylation was complete. Similarly, deglycosylation of hIL5 led to ∼1 kDa reduction in mobility on Western blots (data not shown).Cross-linking was performed by incubating 1 n M each of 125I-hIL5 and shIL5Rα together with 1 n M of the bifunctional cross-linker bis-suberimidate (Pierce) in 25 m M HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% BSA for 20-30 min at 4°C. Products were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions, followed by gel drying and autoradiography. B13 Cell Proliferation Assay The murine IL5/IL3-dependent cell line LyH7.B13 was subcultured twice weekly in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin (all Life Technologies, Inc.), plus 2-mercaptoethanol (5 × 10−5M, Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum (Globepharm), and 1-10 units of recombinant murine IL5 (Mitchell et al., 1993Mitchell D.L. Young M.A. Entwistle C. Davies A.N. Cook R.M. Dodd I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 332SGoogle Scholar). For assays, cells were washed and maintained in medium without IL5 for a minimum of 2 h. They were cultured for 48 h in triplicate (5,000 cells/well) in 96-well round bottom plates in the presence of appropriately diluted test samples and pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham) for the final 4 h. They were processed for scintillation counting in a 1205 Betaplate (LKB Wallac). Results are presented as Stimulation Index ± standard deviation, relative to unstimulated signal. Crystallization Crystals of deglycosylated hIL5 (from PNGaseF treatment in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.4, 25°C, 48 h) and of the complex between glycosylated hIL5 and shIL5Rα were obtained using the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion (McPherson, 1976McPherson A.J. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1976; 23: 249-345Google Scholar). Deglycosylated hIL5 was concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml in 100 m M HEPES buffer, pH 7.2. The complex was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of hIL5 (dimer) and shIL5Rα in 100 m M HEPES, pH 7.2. Typically, 2 μl of either protein solution were mixed with 2 μl of various precipitant concentrations and vapor equilibrated at several temperatures against the solution added to the protein. At each temperature, a three-dimensional matrix was established for each precipitant, in which protein concentration, precipitant concentration, and pH were varied. Ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, and various polyethylene glycols were used as precipitants. Determination of Molecular Ratio of hIL5 and shIL5Rα in Cocrystals Cocrystals were harvested under a microscope, washed twice in crystallization solution P (27% PEG 600 (v/v) in 100 m M sodium acetate, pH 5.0), solubilized in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were either stained using Coomassie Blue or silver-stained. Intensities of the bands of IL5 and shIL5Rα in the cocrystals were compared with those of controls (hIL5, shIL5Rα, or combinations of both proteins) by scanning with IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Co, San Leandro CA), and the peak areas were integrated. Crystal Structure Determination of Deglycosylated hIL5 Crystals of deglycosylated hIL5 belong to the space group C2 with a = 118.3 Å, b = 24.3 Å, c = 43.8 Å, and β = 110°. Assuming one deglycosylated monomer/asymmetric unit, the VMvalue is 2.1 Å3/dalton, which is within the range found for most protein crystals (Matthews, 1968Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar). These crystals show diffraction beyond 2.6-Å resolution and are stable in the x-ray beam for several days.X-ray diffraction data were measured from a single crystal using a Siemens two-dimensional position-sensitive detector. Approximately 5776 reflections were measured in 2 days to give 3054 u"

https://openalex.org/W1966049529,"Phospholamban (PLB) is a small, transmembrane protein that resides in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and regulates the activity of Ca2+-ATPase in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. We have used the baculovirus expression system in Sf21 cells to express milligram quantities of wild-type PLB. After purification by antibody affinity chromatography, the function of this recombinant PLB was tested by reconstitution with Ca2+-ATPase purified from skeletal SR. The results obtained with recombinant PLB were indistinguishable from those obtained with purified, canine cardiac PLB. In particular, PLB reduced the apparent calcium affinity of Ca2+-ATPase but had no effect on Vmax. At pCa 6.8, PLB inhibited both calcium uptake and ATPase activity of Ca2+-ATPase by 50%. This inhibition was fully reversed by addition of a monoclonal antibody to PLB, which mimics the physiological effects of PLB phosphorylation. Maximal PLB regulatory effects occurred at a molar stoichiometry of ∼3:1, PLB/Ca2+-ATPase. We also investigated peptides corresponding to the two main domains of PLB. The membrane-spanning domain, PLB26–52, appeared to uncouple ATPase hydrolysis from calcium transport, even though the permeability of the reconstituted vesicles was not altered. The cytoplasmic peptide, PLB1–31, had little effect, even at a 300:1 molar excess over Ca2+-ATPase."

In this study, two related SGF-1 polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa were purified. Specific interaction of these proteins with the SA site was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift and dimethyl sulfate methylation interference assays. The SGF-1 40-kDa protein was partially sequenced and characterized as a new member of the fork head/HNF-3 family. Several full-length cDNAs encoding the SGF-1 40-kDa and possibly also the 41-kDa proteins were cloned and sequenced.

We conclude that the 40- and 41-kDa SGF-1 proteins affect transcription of the sericin-1 gene via binding to the SA site. The silk glands of the silkworm Bombyx mori produce vast amounts of several silk proteins. Genes for the H- and L-chain fibroin are expressed in the posterior part of silk glands, whereas several serine-rich proteins arise from transcripts of two sericin genes expressed in the middle part of silk glands. We are interested in the regulation of this massive tissue-specific gene expression (see Ref. 1Suzuki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 231-235Google Scholar for a review). Several protein factors were shown to interact with DNA elements located upstream of the 5′-ends of the H-chain fibroin and sericin-1 genes (2Hui C. Matsuno K. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 651-670Google Scholar, 3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar).

Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar). Removal of this SC element curbs down in vitro transcription from the sericin-1 gene promoter in crude middle silk gland (MSG) nuclear extract (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar, 4Matsuno K. Takiya S. Hui C.-c. Suzuki T. Fukuta M. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1853-1858Google Scholar). POU-M1, a homologue of the Drosophila Cf1-a transcription factor, was recently found to be expressed in the middle (and to a lesser extent in the posterior) silk glands and shown to be identical with SGF-3 (5Fukuta M.

Another silk gland-enriched factor, named SGF-1, interacts with the SA site located in the proximal upstream region of the sericin-1 gene promoter. Removal of the SA element decreases in vitro transcription from the sericin-1 promoter in nuclear extract prepared from MSG (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar). A major tissue and sequence-specific complex was detected by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with a crude MSG extract using an oligonucleotide containing the SA element as a probe (4Matsuno K. Takiya S. Hui C.-c. Suzuki T. Fukuta M. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1853-1858Google Scholar). It was proposed that the protein component of this retarded complex is identical to SGF-1 (4Matsuno K. Takiya S. Hui C.-c. Suzuki T. Fukuta M. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1853-1858Google Scholar). The same protein probably binds also to two regions upstream of the H-chain fibroin gene (2Hui C. Matsuno K. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 651-670Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe purification of the SGF-1 protein and molecular cloning of its corresponding cDNAs. Bombyx SGF-1 is a homologue to the Drosophila fork head protein (6Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jäckle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Google Scholar) and therefore a new member of the fork head/HNF-3 family of transcriptional regulators. Preparation of Nuclear Extract Nuclear extract was obtained from MSG of 2-day-old final instar larvae as described earlier (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar). SGF-1 Binding to DNA-coupled Latex Particles SGF-1 binds to the SA site in the sericin-1 gene promoter (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar). DNA containing multiple repeats of the SA element was prepared by ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotides (SA20 oligonucleotide in Fig. 1). The ligated DNA was coupled with latex particles as described (8Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Google Scholar). The DNA-coupled particles were used to enrich SGF-1 binding activity from crude nuclear extract. The published guidance (8Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Google Scholar) was followed throughout the procedure, and all manipulations were done in a cold room. Typical binding reaction contained 35 mg of nuclear extract and 2 mg of Escherichia coli tRNA in 13 m M Hepes (pH 7.9), 8.3 m M MgCl2, 33 m M KCl, 170 m M NaCl, 17 m M EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.3 m M dithiothreitol in total volume of 1.5 ml. This mixture was pre-incubated for 20 min, 20 mg of latex particles coupled to 20 μg of DNA was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 60 min. Washes and elutions were performed with 20 m M Hepes (pH 7.9), 15% (v/v) glycerol, 10 m M EDTA, and increasing concentration of NaCl. Typically, two 5-min washes (0.3 ml each) with the above solution containing 0.1 M NaCl were followed by four washes containing 0.3 M NaCl and by four 100-μl elutions containing 0.5 M NaCl. The elutes were pooled, and this SGF-1-enriched fraction was referred to as latex fraction. The entire procedure was repeated until approximately 10 ml of the latex fraction was obtained. EMSA Binding reactions (20 μl) included 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 1 mg/ml nuclear extract and were carried out in 10 m M Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 m M NaCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 10 m M EDTA, and either 8% (v/v) glycerol or 2.5% Ficoll 400. When EMSA was performed with the latex fraction (0.2 μl/reaction) instead of the nuclear extract, the amount of heterologous nucleic acid was reduced to 0.5 μg/ml tRNA, and Nonidet P-40 and bovine serum albumin were added to final concentrations of 0.1% and 1 mg/ml, respectively. Similar conditions were used to examine renatured proteins. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the wild type SGF-1 binding site (SA site, see Ref. 3) was used both as a probe (5 fmol/reaction) and a specific competitor (SA oligonucleotide in Fig. 1). The mutated version of this oligonucleotide, which contained three T to A transitions, was found to compete inefficiently with the wild type probe and served as a control competitor (SAM1 oligonucleotide in Fig. 1). UV Cross-linking A pair of SAUV oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) was used to incorporate 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate and labeled dATP into the SA sequence. This probe was UV cross-linked (see Ref. 9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar, Suppl. 3) with SGF-1 present in the latex fraction. Reactions contained either excess of the unlabeled SA oligonucleotide, unlabeled SAM1 oligonucleotide, or no competing oligonucleotide. The optimal interval for UV irradiation was empirically determined to be 20-25 min. The reactions were not treated with DNase prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Dimethyl Sulfate Methylation Interference The protocol described in Ref. 9 (Suppl. 25) was followed except that a passive elution was used to recover DNA from acrylamide gels. Renaturation of Proteins SDS-PAGE was performed as described (see Ref. 9, Suppl. 13). Proteins were stained with zinc (10Ortiz M.L. Calero M. Patron C.F. Castellanos L. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 300-304Google Scholar), and the protein bands were excised, destained, and renatured as described (8Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Google Scholar). HPLC The Pharmacia Smart system micro HPLC was employed. The latex fraction was supplemented with solid guanidium hydrochloride, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 50% ACN to achieve final concentrations of 6 M, 0.1 and 4%, respectively. Up to 2 ml of this mixture was loaded on a μRPC C2/C18 PC 3.2/3 column. The gradient was run in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, from 4 to 40% ACN in 1 ml, and then from 40 to 80% ACN in 5 ml. The flow rate was 0.1 ml/min. The entire latex fraction was processed by reverse phase chromatography, aliquots containing 40 and 41 kDa proteins were pooled, and this material (total 0.8 ml) was referred to as reverse phase fraction. Trypsin digest of 40-kDa protein was concentrated according to the protocol used in Ref. 11. All material was loaded on a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column and fractionated as recommended by the manufacturer. Trypsin Digestion The reverse phase fraction was mixed with 20 μl of 1.5% deoxycholate, four times concentrated by a Speedvac, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid using the Sigma P5656 kit. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and stored at −70°C. Following the SDS-PAGE analysis, the gel was zinc stained, and the 40-kDa band was excised and destained with citric acid (10Ortiz M.L. Calero M. Patron C.F. Castellanos L. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 300-304Google Scholar). From this point, the gel slice was washed in ACN and treated with trypsin as described (11Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). Peptide Sequencing Custom sequencing (Takara) as well as the National Institute for Basic Biology facilities were used to obtain peptide sequences. cDNA Library Construction RNA fraction enriched for poly(A)+was isolated from MSG of the 2-day-old last instar larvae. The MSG cell layer was separated from the lumen containing silk proteins, and 150 mg of the cell layer was homogenized in 3.5 ml of solution containing 3 M LiCl, 6 M urea, 10 m M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and 0.4 mg/ml heparin. RNA was precipitated on ice and centrifuged. The precipitate was resuspended in 0.4 ml of the extraction solution supplied with the Quick-prep micro mRNA isolation kit (Pharmacia), and mRNA was isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized using the TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) and cloned into EcoRI/CIAP-treated lambdaZAP II vector (Stratagene). The library was plated in the E. coli SURE cells (Stratagene). Phagemids from positive clones were rescued by the Ex-assist/SOLR system (Stratagene). Northern Blot Poly(A)+RNA was obtained as described above; MSG lumen contents were eliminated if applicable. Samples of approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA per lane were electrophoresed in an agarose/formaldehyde gel as described (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was electroblotted on Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.) in 25 m M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). DNA Sequencing The sequence of SGF-1 cDNA 6 was determined from a set of overlapping deletions using the Sequenase version 2.0 system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Standard reactions containing dGTP were run in parallel with dITP-containing reactions. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to verify this sequence and to resolve sequences of other cDNA clones. Approximately 5000 pairs of MSGs were dissected from 2-day-old final instar larvae and used in batches of 1000 MSG pairs to prepare a total of 40 ml of nuclear extract containing 1.6 g of protein. This material was enriched for the SGF-1 binding activity using latex particles coupled with DNA containing the SGF-1 binding site SA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The estimated SGF-1 enrichment was greater than 500-fold, with 20-30% recovery. This fraction is further referred to as latex fraction. A bromodeoxyuridine-substituted oligonucleotide carrying the SGF-1 cognate sequence SA was prepared by filling in the SAUV oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 1. This probe was UV cross-linked with the latex fraction. Several specific bands were observed of molecular masses ranging from 52 to 60 kDa (data not shown). Some bands were apparently caused by probe or protein degradation during the incubation period. Our attempt to shorten the cross-linked probe by DNase digestion failed, probably because SGF-1 was degraded by proteases during the 37°C incubation step. Molecular mass of the SGF-1 protein was estimated within the range of 38-46 kDa, subtracting the contribution of the probe from the electrophoretic mobilities of the observed bands. SDS-PAGE analysis of the latex fraction revealed a prominent band of apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). The relative SGF-1 binding activity estimated by EMSA correlated well with the intensity of the 40-kDa protein band in various washes and successive elutions throughout the DNA affinity enrichment procedure (data not shown). The 40-kDa protein was therefore presumed to be identical with the SGF-1 factor. To confirm this hypothesis, the 40-kDa band was excised from SDS-PAGE, renatured, and analyzed by EMSA. The mobility of the resulting complex was identical with the mobility of the SGF-1+DNA complex in both the crude extract and the latex fraction (data not shown). The latex fraction was chromatographed on a reverse phase column. An additional, less abundant protein of approximately 41 kDa co-eluted with the 40-kDa protein in a single fraction composed of two overlapping peaks (Fig. 2 A, lane 4, and data not shown). This fraction was further referred to as reverse phase fraction. An aliquot of the reverse phase fraction was loaded on a SDS-PAGE, and both the 40- and 41-kDa protein bands were excised separately, renatured, and assessed in EMSA. Both proteins displayed the same binding specificity and produced retarded complexes migrating indistinguishable from the SGF-1 complex formed in crude extract (Fig. 3). We used the methylation interference assay to examine the interaction of the renatured proteins with the proximal upstream region of the sericin-1 gene in greater detail. Both proteins yielded clear, apparently identical dimethyl sulfate footprints (compare lanes 8 and 11 in Fig. 4 A). Indistinguishable footprints were obtained when the DNA probe was incubated either with crude extract or with the latex fraction (Fig. 4 A). This confirms that SGF-1 binding activity purified in the 40- and 41-kDa proteins is identical with the DNA binding activity ascribed to the SGF-1 factor in crude extract. The observed footprint is depicted in Fig. 4B and maps within the DNase I protected region defined as the SA site (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar). We will hereafter refer to the 40-kDa protein as SGF-1 (40 kDa) and to the 41-kDa protein as SGF-1 (41 kDa). Proteins present in the reverse phase fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid/deoxycholate, and the sediment was dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. One-tenth of this mixture was electrophoresed to estimate the total yield of SGF-1 by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2 B). About 4 μg of the SGF-1 (40 kDa) protein (approximately 100 pmol) and 1 μg of the SGF-1 (41 kDa) protein (25 pmol) were purified. These two proteins together comprised over 85% of the precipitated reverse phase fraction. The entire precipitated reverse phase fraction was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel, and the SGF-1 (40 kDa) protein was excised from the gel and digested by trypsin. The SGF-1 digestion products were separated by HPLC, and their sequences were partially determined. Several SGF-1 fragments (21A, 25A, 44A, 8B, and 25B) revealed useful sequences. These peptides are indicated by underlines in Fig. 5 A, and their sequences are listed in the figure legend. The partial SGF-1 peptide sequences were compared with a non-redundant protein sequence data base using the Fasta program (13Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar). The overlapping peptides 21A and 25A were found to be contained within the Drosophila fork head protein (6Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jäckle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Google Scholar). Peptide 8B was very similar to another part of Drosophila fork head (data not shown). We therefore concluded that SGF-1 belongs to the fork head/HNF-3 family (see Refs. 7 and 14). Several members of this family have been recently cloned in our laboratory from a Bombyx embryonic cDNA library.2 2S. Takiya, unpublished results. One of these clones appears to encode several SGF-1 peptides.3 3The actual identity of this clone was not clear at that time. Later in the course of the present study, it became evident that this embryonic clone actually codes SGF-1 (S. Takiya, unpublished data). This embryonic cDNA clone was used to screen a MSG cDNA library. Over 20 putative positive clones were identified in among approximately 3.5 × 105plaque-forming units of the unamplified library. 12 of them were isolated, mapped by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern hybridization, and partially sequenced. The entire 3.1-kb insert of the SGF-1 cDNA 6 clone was sequenced (Fig. 5 A). The sequence revealed a 1047-base pair-long ORF (nucleotides 36-1082), encoding a 38.8-kDa protein that contains all the peptides obtained by the SGF-1 (40 kDa) trypsin digest. The starting AUG codon is preceded by sequence AGCC, which corresponds relatively well with the Drosophila translation start consensus (15Cavener D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1353-1361Google Scholar). The SGF-1 cDNAs 6, 9, and 13 revealed essentially identical restriction maps when digested with PstI, XhoI, and KpnI enzymes (data not shown). The 5′-ends of these clones were partially sequenced and found to differ by only a few bases in length (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). The cDNA library was not amplified, and therefore these three cDNAs likely correspond to the (nearly) full-length copies.4 4Almost identical 5′-ends were found in four of the clones listed in Fig. 5 B (6, 9, 13, and 5) and in 4 embryonic SGF-1 cDNAs (S. Takiya, unpublished data). Comparison of the 3′-ends of clones 9 and 3 with clone 5 (Fig. 5 B) strongly suggests that the oligo(A) stretches found at the 3′-ends of the 9 and 3 clones were added by polyadenylation. Taken together, these data indicate that clones 6, 9, 13, and 5 are full-length cDNAs. The full-length cDNA clones are 3.1 or 3.9 kb long. Northern blot analysis revealed transcripts of apparent lengths of 5 and 6 kb. The first 1300 bases of SGF-1 cDNAs are rich in GC stretches and possess a potential for forming secondary structures. We presume that the discrepancy observed between lengths of SGF-1 cDNA clones and their transcript sizes is most likely explained by our failure to denature SGF-1 mRNAs completely. The 3′-untranslated end of SGF-1 cDNA 9 (and other cDNAs) differs from that of clone 6; four base pair substitutions were found within the last 100 base pairs (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). Sequences of the remaining portions of the 3′-untranslated region of clone 9 were not determined, but no differences were noticed after restriction mapping. We sequenced the entire ORF and the 5′-untranslated end of the SGF-1 cDNA 9 and found that this sequence was identical with the corresponding region of clone 6 (data not shown). Restriction mapping revealed that the 3′-end of clone 5 contains an extra 0.8-kb stretch; this sequence was not present in the other clones shown in Fig. 5 B. Partial sequencing at this region indicated that the 3′-end of clone 5 is merely an extended 3′-end found in the other cDNAs (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). The 5′-end and the ORF of cDNA 5 was sequenced except for the conserved fork head domain. No difference was found between the coding regions of clones 5 and 6 (data not shown). The SGF-1 cDNA clones 6 and 9 differ by base substitutions at their 3′-untranslated regions (see above). This is not due to the existence of two closely related SGF-1 genes, since Southern blot of genomic DNA showed the presence of a single hybridizing band in most restriction enzyme digests (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, we speculate that the observed differences between the two cDNA clones reflects occurrence of two slightly different SGF-1 alleles. We were interested to see whether SGF-1 was expressed specifically or predominantly by MSG and whether the time course of its expression was consistent with its presumed role as a regulator of the sericin-1 gene. We have detected two SGF-1 transcripts in MSG poly(A)+RNA preparations. The major transcript (approximately 5 kb)4was present in MSG of all stages examined, while the less abundant one (approximately 6 kb) was found in MSG of molting larvae in extremely low levels also occurred in MSG of 2-day-old final instar larvae (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, SGF-1 mRNA appearance preceded the massive expression of sericin-1 gene in the last larval instar (16Obara T. Suzuki Y. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 384-391Google Scholar), and the major 5-kb SGF-1 transcript was maintained throughout the last instar. The 5-kb SGF-1 mRNA could also be detected in the control tissue (Fig. 6 B, lane 5), although its relative amount was very low (see legend to Fig. 6, B and C).5 5SGF-1 mRNA is also expressed in posterior silk gland in the last and penultimate larval instars in a manner similar to its expression in MSG. The major transcript is also present in embryonic silk gland and a few other embryonic tissues (H. Kokubo and S. Takiya, unpublished data). We have identified two closely related SGF-1 proteins of observed molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa, respectively. They both yielded retarded EMSA complexes that comigrated with the complex generated by SGF-1 in crude extract (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the interaction of the SGF-1 (40 kDa) and SGF-1 (41 kDa) proteins with the methylated SA site appears identical when compared both with each other and with the SGF-1 protein present in crude extract (Fig. 4). In fact, the results of the methylation interference assay practically preclude that other protein(s), different from the 40- and 41-kDa ones, participate in the formation of the tissue- and sequence-specific SGF-1 complex in crude extract. The SGF-1 40- and 41-kDa proteins co-elute in a single fraction from reverse phase chromatography (Fig. 2 A and data not shown), further indicating their high similarity. We have analyzed over a dozen cDNA clones including several likely full-length cDNAs (Fig. 5 and data not shown).4These clones fall into three categories represented by SGF-1 cDNAs 6, 9, and 5. Based on a Southern blot hybridization, all of them originate from a single gene (Fig. 6 A) and possess an identical ORF encoding a 38.8-kDa protein. This protein is a new member of the fork head family and contains all peptide sequences found in the SGF-1 (40 kDa) protein fragments (Fig. 5 A and legend). As discussed above, the SGF-1 (40 kDa) and SGF-1 (41 kDa) proteins are likely to be close relatives. If they arose from different mRNAs, one would expect the presence of cDNA clones encoding different protein products. However, no such different cDNAs were obtained. We therefore assume that both the 40- and 41-kDa (apparent molecular mass) proteins probably correspond to the predicted molecular mass of 38.8 kDa of the product deduced from cDNA sequences. One possibility is that the 41-kDa protein is a post-translationally modified version of the 40-kDa polypeptide. The 1.2-kDa difference between 40 and 38.8 kDa is well within the limits of experimental error of molecular mass determination from SDS-PAGE. We did not study the differences between cDNAs 6, 9, and 5 in details. Our presumption is that the 3.1-kb-long clones 6 and 9, which differ by base substitutions at the 3′-end, are full-length cDNAs (Fig. 5 B),4representing two slightly different alleles of the SGF-1 gene. Both of these clones could arise by the usage of the most proximal polyadenylation signal (Fig. 5 B) and likely correspond to the major transcript observed on Northern blot (Fig. 6 B).4The 3.9-kb-long clone 5 contains additional 0.8 kb at its 3′-end, and its restriction map and partial sequence suggest that it is an extension of clone 9 (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). It is likely that a more distant polyadenylation site was used in the case of cDNA 5. This clone may correspond to the 6-kb transcript detected on Northern blot (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and 3).4 SGF-1 is a new member of the fork head/HNF-3 family. This family contains HNF-3 factors α, β, and γ, which regulate transcription of tissue-specific genes in rodent liver and several other organs derived from the embryonic gut (14Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Google Scholar). The other two members of this family are Xenopus XFKH-1 (17Dirksen M.L. Jamrich M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 599-608Google Scholar) and Drosophila fork head (6Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jäckle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Google Scholar), which are developmental regulators. Members of this family are characterized by a 110-amino acid-long conserved DNA binding motif (see Ref. 18Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar). This motif is highly conserved also in SGF-1 (Lys103-Glu212in Fig. 5 A, domain I in Fig. 7), indicating that SGF-1 is a true homologue of Drosophila fork head and mammalian HNF-3 rather than a homologue of some other Drosophila (19Hacker U. Grossniklaus U. Gehring W. Jäckle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8754-8758Google Scholar) or mammalian (7Clevidence E.D. Overdier D.G. Tao W. Qian X. Pani L. Lai E. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3948-3952Google Scholar, 20Kaestner K.H. Lee K.H. Schlondorff J. Hiemisch H. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7628-7631Google Scholar) fork head protein. In addition, the SGF-1 binding site (Fig. 4 B) closely resembles some sequences recognized by HNF-3 (21Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Google Scholar, 22Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19896-19905Google Scholar). Two additional domains (Leu286-Leu303and Asp331-Leu349, Fig. 5 A; domains II and III, respectively, in Fig. 7) are conserved between Drosophila fork head and the three mammalian HNF-3 factors. These two domains are transactivation domains required for transcriptional stimulation by HNF-3β (23Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar). Both of these domains can be recognized in SGF-1 (Fig. 7). Except for two gaps, domain II is well conserved between HNF-3β and SGF-1. It is likely that this conservation of structure is paralleled by conservation of function; these regions may be required for target gene transactivation. Further biochemical evidence is necessary to address this question. Drosophila fork head is a homeotic gene required for differentiation of embryonic termini. Aside from early terminal domains in ectoderm, fork head is expressed in four additional tissues: the developing midgut, salivary glands, nervous system, and the yolk nuclei. With the exception of midgut, expression persists until very late stages of embryonic development (6Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jäckle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Google Scholar). Salivary glands are missing in fork head mutant embryos (cited in Ref. 6). Lepidopteran silk glands are homologous to the salivary glands of Diptera, and SGF-1 is expressed in Bombyx embryos.3,5We speculate that the SGF-1 protein may be initially required for the development of silk glands and subsequently utilized in the control of genes coding for silk proteins. Indeed, besides the sericin-1 gene, SGF-1 probably interacts with an upstream region of the fibroin-H gene (2Hui C. Matsuno K. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 651-670Google Scholar), and there are putative SGF-1 binding sites in the regulatory regions of several other genes coding for silk components. To our knowledge, no target genes for the Drosophila fork head protein have been identified to date. There is conclusive evidence that SGF-1 stimulates sericin-1 gene transcription via interaction with the SA site (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar, 4Matsuno K. Takiya S. Hui C.-c. Suzuki T. Fukuta M. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1853-1858Google Scholar). The SGF-1 transcription-stimulating activity was ascribed to a DNA binding protein forming the major and the only sequence-specific retarded complex detected by EMSA, with the SA site containing probe in crude extract. The SGF-1 complex is tissue specific, being most profound when extract from middle or posterior silk glands is used (3Matsuno K. Hui C. Takiya S. Suzuki T. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18707-18713Google Scholar, 4Matsuno K. Takiya S. Hui C.-c. Suzuki T. Fukuta M. Ueno K. Suzuki Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1853-1858Google Scholar). We propose that the SGF-1 protein, which we have cloned in the present study, is involved in the sericin-1 gene regulation because 1) this is the protein that forms the sequence-specific complex with the SA site probe in crude extract (Figs. 3 and 4), 2) high SGF-1 mRNA levels are found in silk glands of animals of the appropriate developmental stages but not in the control tissue (Fig. 6 B),5and 3) SGF-1 is a new member of an established family of transcriptional regulators, possesses putative transactivation domains, and its Drosophila homologue is required for the development of salivary glands (see above). Nevertheless, a direct test, preferably in vitro transcription assay, is needed to study the function of recombinant SGF-1 protein and its domains in stimulation of the sericin-1 promoter activity. Other questions concern putative roles of SGF-1 in the control of other genes coding for silk components and possible SGF-1 interaction with other protein factors, namely SGF-3 (5Fukuta M. Matsuno K.

INTRODUCTIONDNA and RNA containing guanine tracts will associate in vitro in the presence of salt into four-stranded right-handed helices stabilized by a guanine base quartet (for review see Refs. 1Guschlbauer W. Chantof J.F. Thiele D. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1990; 8: 491-511Google Scholar, 2Sen D. Gilbert W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 435-438Google Scholar, 3Sundquist W.I. Nucleic Acids Mol.

Three major helical isoforms, characterized by parallel or cis or trans antiparallel strand orientations, have been identified by NMR and x-ray studies. These quadruplex structures are called the G4 nucleic acids. G4 structures anneal at moderate to low rates under physiological conditions and are greatly stabilized by millimolar concentrations of potassium, which is efficiently chelated by guanine carbonyl oxygens that line the axial cavity of the helix.Do G4 structures arise in vivo? Presently, this question is unresolved, although there is tantalizing evidence supporting roles for G4 structures at eukaryotic telomeres (7Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Google Scholar, 8Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Google Scholar) and at retroviral dimer linkage sequences (9Sundquist W.I. Heaphy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Google Scholar, 10Awang G. Sen D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11453-11457Google Scholar). Also, Sep1/Dst2/Xrn1/Kem1 is a yeast enzyme that catalyzes DNA strand exchange (11Tishkoff D.X. Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2593-2608Google Scholar, 12Dykstra C.C. Kitada K. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2583-2592Google Scholar), hydrolyzes RNA (13Larimer F.W. Stevens A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 85-90Google Scholar), and possesses a nucleolytic activity specific for DNA oligomers containing G4 domains (14Liu Z. Gilbert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1092Google Scholar). Null alleles of this gene lead to mitotic loss of chromosomes and meiotic arrest at pachytene (15Kim J. Ljungdahl P.O. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1990; 126: 799-812Google Scholar). These defects may be due to an inability of the mutant cell to properly process G4 structures that may arise during the course of chromosomal replication, recombination, or alignment. Further, a G4 DNA-annealing activity capable of accelerating the conversion of oligomers into G4 structures by a factor of 105was identified in a subunit of a Oxytricha telomere binding complex, suggesting that G4 structures do exist, perhaps transiently, at chromosome ends (16Fang G. Cech T.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 875-885Google Scholar).To explore the possible biological functions of G4 nucleic acids, we have probed extracts for activities specific for G4 DNA. We have identified and characterized a yeast protein, G4p2, that displays an avid and specific binding activity for G4 nucleic acids. G4p2 slightly prefers substrates containing antiparallel G4 domains over those containing the parallel form and strongly prefers substrates containing multiple G4 domains. G4p2 binds equivalently to DNA and RNA in G4 form. The protein was purified, and the gene encoding G4p2 was isolated and sequenced. The G4P2 gene is identical to MPT4 and STO1, genes that appear to function in a protein kinase-controlled signal transduction pathway and in cell cycle progression, respectively.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of G4 OligomersDNA and RNA oligomers (see Fig. 1) were synthesized on an ABI model 392 DNA synthesizer, and full-length products were purified on 8 M urea/polyacrylamide gels. G4 structures were annealed and purified on native polyacrylamide gels containing KCl under conditions specified by Sen and Gilbert (17Sen D. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 191-199Google Scholar) and stored in 10 m M Tris, pH 7.6, 1 m M EDTA, 100 m M KCl at 4°C. Yields were determined by absorbance at 260 nm.Mobility Shift Assays, Competitions, and SDS-PAGEGL(G4) (see Fig. 1) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and precipitated twice with ethanol. 5000 counts per second of labeled GL(G4) (about 8 fmol or 320 pg, unless otherwise indicated) was added to extract or G4p2 fractions in binding buffer (20 m M NaHepes, pH 7.3, 1 m M EDTA, 50 m M KCl, 5 m M BME,1 1The abbreviations used are: BMEβ-mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5 m M NaPO4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2.5% glycerol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg of double-stranded salmon sperm DNA, tracking dyes) in a final volume of 10 μl and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reactions were loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gels and run at room temperature in 50 m M TBE (50 m M Tris borate, 1 m M EDTA, pH 8.2) with 1 m M KCl at 12.5 V/cm. The gels were dried and exposed for several hours to x-ray film or to an imaging plate (Fuji) for 15 min.Competition experiments were carried out as above, with saturating amounts of GL(G4) probe. 10-fold serial dilutions of competitor nucleic acids were premixed with extract or G4p2 fractions in binding buffer just prior to adding the probe. Relative mass amounts of competitor to probe ranged from 0.1 to 1000 and were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Single-stranded competitors were fully denatured by treatment with 100 m M NaOH at 100°C just prior to use.SDS-PAGE was carried out by standard procedures (18Gallagher S.R. Smith J.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 10.2.1-10.2.21Google Scholar). 10-μl aliquots of G4p2 fractions were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and protein bands were visualized by staining twice with a silver staining reagent (Bio-Rad).Large Scale Preparation of Yeast ExtractDiploid yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain SK1) was cultured in 50 liters of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% dextrose), harvested at midlog phase, and lysed in liquid nitrogen according to published procedures (19Sorger P.K. Ammerer G. Shore D. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 199-223Google Scholar). The extract was prepared at 4°C. Proteins were extracted from lysed cells in extraction buffer (20 m M NaHepes, pH 7.3, 1 m M EDTA, 10 m M MgCl2, 420 m M KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 m M BME, 10% glycerol, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 1 h at 0.5 g of cell paste/ml. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min and dialyzed (Spectra/Por 7; molecular weight cutoff, 3500) with one change for 48 h against 10 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 m M NaHepes, pH 7.3, 1 m M EDTA, 45 m M KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 m M BME, 10% glycerol). The dialysate was cleared again by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 1 h and frozen at −100°C. The protein concentration and yield were determined to be 25 mg/ml and 0.07 g of protein/g of cell paste, respectively, using a Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad).Purification of G4p2All extract and G4p2 fraction manipulations were done at 4°C. Thawed yeast extract (12.5 ml) was dialyzed (Spectra/Por 7; molecular weight cutoff, 3500) against 1250 ml of buffer A (20 m M sodium bicarbonate, pH 11, 1 m M EDTA, 50 m M KCl, 100 m M NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 m M BME, 10% glycerol) for 12 h and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (240 mg in 12.5 ml) was loaded at 25 ml/h on a 25-ml S-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) bed, which had been equilibrated in buffer A and packed in a 2.5 × 10-cm EconoColumn (Bio-Rad). The bed was washed with 125 ml of buffer A, and proteins were eluted on simultaneous 50-ml linear gradients of decreasing NaCl concentration (100-0 m M) and increasing NaPO4pH 11 concentration (0-100 m M). Forty 1.25-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by mobility shift assay for G4p2 and by SDS-PAGE. Fractions 17-25 (11.25 ml) containing partially purified G4p2 were pooled.Half of the partially purified G4p2 from the previous step (6 ml) was concentrated with Microcon-10 microconcentrators (Amicon) to 0.15 ml, washed twice with 7 volumes of buffer B (20 m M NaHepes, pH 7.3, 1 m M EDTA, 50 m M KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 m M BME, 10% glycerol), and recovered in a volume of 0.5 ml. The sample was made 100 m M NaOH for 5 min and neutralized with HCl.A 1-ml G4 DNA affinity bed was prepared as follows. Oligomer GL (see Fig. 1) with biotin incorporated next to the 3′ end (Biotin-ON phosphoramidite, Clontech) was synthesized at a 1-μmol scale. The unpurified oligomer was converted into parallel G4 form under conditions specified by Sen and Gilbert (17Sen D. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 191-199Google Scholar). An aliquot was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and shown by gel electrophoresis to be composed of parallel G4 DNA and higher order G4 structures (20Sen D. Gilbert W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 65-70Google Scholar). The G4 DNA (3.95 mg) was bound to 2 ml of 50% streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) in 10 m M Tris, pH 7.6, 1 m M EDTA, 100 m M KCl by gentle rocking for 30 min. The affinity matrix was washed twice in buffer B with 100 m M NaCl, packed in a 0.7 × 5-cm EconoColumn (Bio-Rad), and equilibrated at 4°C.Partially purified G4p2 from the previous step (0.5 ml) was loaded at 2.3 ml/h on the G4 DNA affinity column and washed with 5 ml of buffer B with 100 m M NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a 5-ml convex exponential gradient of increasing NaCl concentration (100 m M to 1 M). Fifty 0.1-ml fractions were collected and assayed by mobility shift assay for G4p2 and by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 3). Fractions 21-27 (0.7 ml) containing largely pure G4p2 were pooled.Figure 3:Purification of G4p2. A, fractions from the G4 DNA affinity column were analyzed by mobility shift assay with 320 pg of probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 1 μl of a 100-fold dilution of each fraction was analyzed. The input fraction (IN) is pooled, and concentrated fractions 17 through 25 were obtained from the S-Sepharose FF pH 11 column. G4p2 is indicated. B, SDS-PAGE of the same fractions as in A. In each case, 10 μl of undiluted fraction was analyzed. G4p2 and molecular weights of markers are indicated. The gel was stained twice with silver.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Determination of the Keq for G4p2 Binding to G4 DNAMobility shift experiments as described above were carried out with 2.7 fm of GL(G4) probe (Fig. 1) and with 4-fold serial dilutions of G4p2 (1350, 338, 84.4, 21.1, and 5.27 fm) obtained from the G4 DNA affinity column (prep 2; see “Results”). Stock G4p2 was quantitated by titrating a dilution of G4p2 with increasing amounts of precisely quantitated GL(G4) DNA probe until binding to G4p2 was saturated. At saturation, molarity of the bound probe is equivalent to that of G4p2. By this method, prep 2 contains 1.35 μM G4p2. The dried gels were exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji), and the amounts of free probe at each G4p2 dilution were measured. Keqwas estimated from a plot of log(free G4p2 concentration) versus log(bound probe = (total probe - free probe)/free probe) (21Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Google Scholar). The free G4p2 concentration was estimated by subtracting the concentration of bound probe at each dilution, which equals the concentration of bound G4p2, from that of input G4p2.Peptide Sequencing and DNA Hybridization ProbesPartially purified G4p2 (2.7 ml) obtained from the S-Sepharose column was precipitated with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5 mg/ml deoxycholate and fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid. G4p2 was excised and sequenced (Harvard Microchemistry Facility). The sequences of two internal tryptic peptides (NT-49, TAQLSLQDYLNQQANNQFNKVPEAK and NT-40, EAQADAAAEIAEDAAEAEDAGKPK) were obtained. A unique oligomer (49C, 5′-CAAGATTACTTGAACCAACAAGCTAACAACCAATTCAACAAGGTTCCAGAAGCTAA-3′) incorporating most frequent codon usage information for yeast (22Davis T.N. Thorner J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 248-262Google Scholar) was synthesized based on reverse translated NT-49. This hybridization probe was tested on Southern blots of yeast genomic DNA and was found suitable for library screening.Isolation, Sequencing, and Subcloning of the G4p2 GeneOligomer 49C labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to screen 6 × 103plaques of recombinant λEMBL3a containing a yeast genomic library (23Snyder M. Elledge S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 730-734Google Scholar). Five positive plaques were pooled and rescreened at low density. Three positive plaques from the second screen were selected for further analysis.Selected phage DNA was pooled and used as template for thermal cycle sequencing with the CircumVent (New England Biolabs) sequencing reagents. To obtain access to the G4p2 gene, 1.2 pmol of a 128-fold degenerate oligomer (49A, 5′-AA(C/T)CA(A/G)CA(A/G)GC(A/G/C/T)AA(C/T)AA(C/T)CA-3′) derived from reverse translated NT-49 was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and was used as a primer on 400 ng of template DNA. The nucleotide sequence obtained permitted the synthesis of unique primers to extend similarly and to finish both strands of the DNA sequence encoding G4p2. A 5-kilobase EcoRI fragment from a λEMBL3a clone containing the intact G4p2 coding sequence was inserted into pUC19 using standard methods, generating the subclone pUC19G4p2.Preparation of Recombinant G4p2A bacterially expressed G4p2 fusion to glutathione S-transferase was produced with the pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) vector system. Two complementary oligomers (top, 5′-GATCTCCAACCCATTTGATTTGTTAGGTAACGACGTCGTCG-3′ and bottom, 5′-GATCCGACGACGTCGTTACCTAACAAATCAAATGGGTTGGA-3′) containing N-terminal G4p2 coding sequence were annealed and inserted into BamHI-cleaved pGEX-3X. A suitable clone containing the properly oriented insert was cleaved with AatII (at the site in the oligomer sequence) and EcoRI, and a 2.1-kilobase DNA fragment derived from pUC19G4p2 cleaved with EcoRI and partially with AatII was inserted. The desired clone was identified by restriction site analysis and by sequencing. This clone should direct the synthesis of a protein identical to G4p2 in an amino acid sequence after removal of the glutathione S-transferase domain, except the initiator methionine is replaced by glycine-isoleucine. A large scale preparation of recombinant protein was prepared in the Escherichia coli host strain LE392 according to recommended procedure (24Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 16.7.1-16.7.8Google Scholar). A yield of 0.75 mg of recombinant G4p2/liter of culture was obtained after proteolytic removal of the glutathione S-transferase domain with factor Xa.Data Base Searches and Sequence and Image Analysis ProgramsNon-redundant data base searches were carried out at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the BLAST network service. Sequence manipulation and analysis was done with the GCG Sequence Analysis software package 7.2. Secondary structure prediction was done with PHD 1.0 (25Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Google Scholar) via E-mail server. Silver-stained gels and autoradiographs were photographed and scanned onto PhotoCD (Kodak). Images were converted to PICT files with Photoshop 2.5.1 (Adobe), labeled with Canvas 2.1 (Deneba), and printed with a Phaser II SDX dye sublimation printer (Tektronix).RESULTSIdentification of a G4 Nucleic Acid Binding Protein, G4p2, in YeastWe have analyzed a yeast whole cell extract for binding activities specific for G4 DNA. Fig. 2 A shows a mobility shift assay with a parallel G4 DNA oligomer probe (Fig. 1 lists the oligonucleotides used) and excess double-stranded carrier DNA, demonstrating two major (G4p1 and G4p2) and several minor components of yeast that bind to GL(G4). (This paper deals with the characterization of G4p2; the characterization of G4p1 will be described elsewhere. 2J. D. Frantz and W. Gilbert, manuscript in preparation. 2) Protease and nuclease treatment of the extract showed that G4p2 is a protein without a nucleic acid component (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows competition binding experiments with specific DNAs in single-stranded or parallel G4 form. Single-stranded DNAs do not compete, but DNAs containing parallel G4 regions surrounded by either As or Ts compete effectively. This demonstrates that the G4 domain of the probe is required and sufficient for stable binding to G4p2. Mobility shift experiments with extracts from several yeast strains showed that G4p2 is not restricted to strain SK1 (data not shown). We undertook the purification of G4p2 in order to characterize it further.Figure 2:Identification of G4 nucleic acid-specific binding proteins in a yeast extract. A, 5-fold serial dilutions of yeast extract were analyzed by mobility shift assay with 320 pg of probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extract dilutions are indicated above the lanes. 1 μl of undiluted extract (25 μg) was analyzed in the left-hand lane. The G4 DNA probe and the two major G4 DNA binding proteins are indicated. B, the binding specificity of G4p2 was analyzed by mobility shift competition assays with 320 pg of probe and with 10-fold serial dilutions of unlabeled G4 and single-stranded competitor DNAs (see Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 1 μl of a 20-fold dilution of extract (1.25 μg) was analyzed. Relative mass of competitor over probe is indicated above the lanes. GL(SS) indicates single-stranded GL oligomer, and sal DNA(SS) indicates single-stranded salmon sperm DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purification of G4p2Small-scale batch experiments revealed that G4p2 binds to S-Sepharose at pH 11 in a sodium bicarbonate buffer and not in a sodium phosphate buffer. At pH 11, relatively few proteins in the yeast extract bind S-Sepharose, and fewer still are eluted by the buffer exchange. We used a G4 DNA affinity column as a second step. Table I outlines the purification and yields of G4p2. A decline in G4 DNA binding activity can be partially reversed by treating G4p2-containing fractions with 100 m M NaOH for several minutes just prior to loading G4p2-containing fractions on the G4 DNA affinity column. The final preparation contains 9.4 μg of G4p2/ml. In a subsequent purification of G4p2 (prep 2), we processed twice the amount of extract, and the concentration and buffer exchange step (Amicon) was omitted in favor of dialysis with improved yield (42 μg of G4p2/ml). Fig. 3 shows a SDS-PAGE gel of G4p2 containing fractions from the G4 DNA affinity column (prep 1), identifying a ∼32-kDa protein as G4p2. Quantitative estimates of G4p2 by mobility shift assay are in agreement with quantitative estimates of the ∼32-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. The protein is essentially purified in fraction 22. G4p2 comprises 0.017% of total yeast protein by mass or about 35,000 molecules/cell and is therefore a moderately abundant protein.Table I:Purification of G4p2 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Purified G4p2Fig. 4 shows a quantitation of a series of competition experiments with the purified protein. G4p2 possesses equivalent affinities for parallel G4 DNA and RNA (compare GL(G4) with rGL(G4)). This establishes the possibility that, in vivo, this protein binds DNA and/or RNA. G4p2 has the highest affinity for molecules containing multiple G4 domains, with a 100-fold preference for parallel G4 DNA bearing two G4 domains over a similar molecule with just one domain (Fig. 4, compare TGT2(G4 ) with TGT(G4 )). Further, G4p2 displays a mild (3-fold) preference for antiparallel G4 DNA over parallel G4 DNA (Fig. 4, compare TGT2(G′2 ) with TGT(G4 )) and virtually no affinity for single-stranded and double-stranded DNA competitor (Fig. 4, compare GL(SS) and GL(DS) with GL(G4 )). The small amount of competition observed with high concentrations of single-stranded competitor (Fig. 4, GL(SS)) can be attributed to conversion of a fraction of the competitor into G4 structures during the course of the experiment.Figure 4:Binding specificity of purified G4p2 for G4 nucleic acids. Purified G4p2 was analyzed by mobility shift competition assays with 2 ng of probe and with serial dilutions of unlabeled competitor nucleic acids (see Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound probe was measured by exposing dried gels to an imaging plate (Fuji). 1 μl of a 200-fold dilution of purifed G4p2 (210 pg, prep 2) was analyzed. Competitor nucleic acids are indicated. GL(SS) indicates a single-stranded GL oligomer, and GL(DS) indicates GL oligomer annealed to a complementary sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Incubations of purified G4p2 with parallel G4 DNA in the presence of various divalent cations and ATP indicate this protein, on its own, does not possess other activities, such as cleaving or unwinding activity, toward this substrate (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows that the equilibrium constant for G4p2 binding to parallel G4 DNA (GL(G4) is 2.2 × 108M−1in 50 m M KCl at pH 7.3 at room temperature. This value is comparable with those for other protein-DNA interactions, which involve proteins of moderate abundance (21Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Google Scholar).Figure 5:Equilibrium constant for G4p2 binding to GL(G4) . Mobility shift assays with 2.7 fm of probe and with 4-fold serial dilutions of G4p2 beginning with 1.35 pm were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Free probe was measured by exposing the dried gel to an imaging plate (Fuji). Total, bound, and free G4p2 was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Free G4p2 concentration at 50% probe occupancy is indicated and is equivalent to l/Keq.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cloning and Sequencing of the G4p2 GeneIn order to obtain the primary sequence of G4p2, we determined to isolate its gene. We had sufficient material at hand to obtain a partial amino acid sequence of G4p2. An aliquot of pooled fractions 21-27 obtained from the S-Sepharose column was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. G4p2 was excised, and the sequences of two internal peptides were obtained. A hybridization probe based on a reverse translated peptide sequence was used to screen a yeast genomic library in λEMBL3a, and three strongly hybridizing phage were isolated. A degenerate oligomer based on a reverse translated peptide sequence was used to obtain access into the G4p2 gene, and primer walking from the access point provided the remaining DNA sequence.Analysis of the G4p2 Peptide SequenceFig. 6 shows the DNA sequence encoding G4p2. It contains an open reading frame potentially encoding a protein of 273 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 29.9 kDa. The amino acid composition predicts a hydrophilic protein with an unusually high pI of 10.41, due in part to an abundance of lysine (11.4%). Five regions are characterized by skewed amino acid compositions. A region rich in proline (Fig. 6 A, (A)) is located at residues 38-54, and a region rich in serine and threonine (Fig. 6 A, (B)) is located at residues 77-102. Residues 119-141 are rich in alanine (Fig. 6 A, (C)), and residues 147-164 are rich in glutamine and asparagine (Fig. 6 A, (D)). Finally, a region containing mostly asparagine, arginine, and glycine (Fig. 6 A, (E)) is located at residues 225-245. Regions rich in glutamine or asparagine, such as regions (D) and (E) (Fig. 6 A), have been implicated in protein-protein contacts (26Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Google Scholar), whereas some arginine- and glycine-rich sequences, such as that in region (E) (Fig. 6 A), have been shown to bind RNA (27Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Google Scholar). The PHD secondary structure prediction algorithm (25Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Google Scholar) predicts with an expected accuracy of 61% that G4p2 contains α-helices at residues 114-140 (α-helix I) and 147-159 (α-helix II). Helix I harbors the alanine-rich region (Fig. 6 A, (C)) described above. A segment of helix I containing residues 125-138 is strongly amphipathic, with one side of the helix carrying five acidic residues. Helix II, which contains the glutamine- and asparagine-rich region (Fig. 6 A, (D)), has an interesting “zipper” of alternating hydrophobic and glutamine or asparagine (amido) residues.Figure 6:Nucleotide sequence of the G4P2 gene and its deduced amino acid sequence.

Yet, it is still unknown which segment(s) of IL-8Rs mediate these processes. Extensive research was performed during the last few years to identify the domains of the seven transmembrane receptors (7TMR) which interact with GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Domains that show a relatively low degree of conservation between 7TMR are believed to determine the activation of specific G proteins by a unique stimulus. The greatest degree of sequence and size heterogeneity resides within the third intracellular (3i) loop and the carboxyl terminus of 7TMR (13Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Google Scholar, 17Weiss E.R. Kelleher D.J. Wai Woon C. Soparkar S. Osawa S. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2841-2848Google Scholar), and both regions were shown to be involved in coupling or activation of G proteins (18Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

In the adrenergic and the muscarinic receptors, the 3i loop couples the G protein (19O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21734-21738Google Scholar) and consists of a long stretch of amino acids (e.g. 54 amino acids in the human β2-adrenergic receptor, 75 amino acids in the mouse m1 muscarinic receptor) (17Weiss E.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21734-21738Google Scholar). In other 7TMR, such as the bovine rhodopsin, the 3i loop is very short (22 amino acids) (22Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Google Scholar) but is still capable of activating various G proteins (17Weiss E.R. Kelleher D.J. Wai Woon C. Soparkar S. Osawa S. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2841-2848Google Scholar). It is believed that a longer and more complex 3i loop enables the receptor molecules to discriminate among different but highly homologous G proteins (8Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Google Scholar, 17Weiss E.R. Kelleher D.J. Wai Woon C. Soparkar S. Osawa S. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2841-2848Google Scholar). The involvement of the carboxyl terminus (C′) in the coupling and the activation of G protein in adrenergic receptors and in rhodopsin was shown to be mediated by the membrane proximal region of the C′ (19O'Dowd B.F.

It is believed that this region constitutes a putative fourth cytoplasmic loop due to anchoring to the lipid membrane via palmitoylcysteines (19O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Google Scholar, 22Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20118-20123Google Scholar). Another characteristic of the C′ which points to its importance for signaling is the fact that in most of the 7TMR studied, the serine and threonine residues in the C′ are phosphorylated during desensitization of the receptors. In some of the receptors, specific kinases (G protein-coupled receptor kinases) were shown to phosphorylate this region, thus facilitating the binding of arrestin-like proteins which inhibit receptor-G protein coupling (18Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar, 29Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Google Scholar). The importance of the C′ in signaling and coupling of G protein in chemotactic receptors is presently unknown; however, experimental and structural features found within this family suggest that this region may be important for the regulation of signaling events. In the case of the human fMLP receptor, peptides corresponding to amino acids 308-336 (residing in the C′) eliminate signaling by the receptor (23Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Google Scholar, 24Bommakanti R.K. Klotz K.-N. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 572-577Google Scholar). One of the peptides (amino acids 308-322) is located in the membrane proximal region (23Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Google Scholar), in a similar position to the palmitoylated cysteines in the adrenergic receptors and in rhodopsin. Since this region in the fMLP receptor does not contain cysteine residues, it probably regulates signaling by a different mechanism. The importance of the C′ for signaling in chemotactic receptors is further supported by the fact that numerous serine and threonine residues are located in this region. Phosphorylation of these residues might be a major mechanism of desensitization of the receptors. Indeed, fMLP and C5a receptors were shown to be phosphorylated during desensitization (30Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). In a recent paper by Takano et al. (31Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Google Scholar), it was also shown that C′ phosphorylation sites of platelet-activating factor receptor play a critical role in desensitization. The purpose of this study was to determine which regions of IL-8Rβ are involved in signal transduction. The structural similarity of IL-8Rβ with other chemotactic receptors, such as fMLP receptor, suggested that the C′ of IL-8Rβ may have an important role in mediating a specific signal in response to IL-8. In order to test whether the C′ of IL-8Rβ is involved in transducing signals, deletions of the C′ were constructed (Fig. 1,Table I) so that in each mutated receptor the additional deleted segment contained a cluster of serines/threonines and/or a consensus sequence between human IL-8Rα, human IL-8Rβ, and rabbit IL-8R. These mutated receptors were compared to a control wild type (WT) receptor for their expression (determined by monoclonal antibodies), binding of IL-8 (determined by Scatchard analysis), and transducing a signal in response to IL-8 (determined by chemotaxis). In this report, we shed light on the functional roles of the C′ of IL-8Rβ and provide evidence for the involvement of the membrane proximal domain of the C′ in signal transduction.Table I:Amino acids deleted in c′-truncated IL-8Rβ receptors Open table in a new tab The reagents were obtained from commercial sources, as follows: restriction endonucleases, ligation reagents, and DOTAP transfection reagent were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Cetus; Reagent kit for DNA sequencing was from U. S. Biochemicals; SP6, T3, and T7 primers were obtained from Stratagene; vectors (pCRTMII and pRc/CMV) and supercompetent cells XL-1 blue were purchased from Invitrogen; amp/IPTG/X-GAL plates were from Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc.; amp plates were obtained from Digene; low gelling temperature agarose (type XI), bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and monoclonal antibodies against human CD3 (Isotype: mouse IgG1) were purchased from Sigma; Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium, RPMI 1640, Dulbecco' phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc.; Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone Laboratories; Hepes buffer was purchased from Applied Scientific; Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; 125I-IL-8 (2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN; IL-8 (72 amino acids) was from Pepro Tech; FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Tago; 10-μm polycarbonate filters for chemotaxis were purchased from Poretics; mouse collagen type IV was from Collaborative Biomedical Products; Diff-Quik kits for fixation and staining of cells on chemotaxis filters were obtained from Biochemical Sciences. To assess the role of the C′ of IL-8Rβ in signal transduction, the gene for the wild type (WT) receptor and four C′-truncated genes were constructed by PCR using five different primers for the 3′ end of the IL8Rβ gene and one primer for the 5′ end. The primers were made by a DNA Synthesizer, Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. Table I shows which amino acids were deleted in each of the receptors. A schematic presentation of the various receptors is given in Fig. 1. Each of the receptor DNAs (WT and four truncated constructs, Fig. 1) was produced by PCR. The template DNA for the PCR consisted of the IL-8Rβ gene ligated to pRc/CMV. The IL-8Rβ open reading frame is encoded entirely in the third exon (32Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Lautens L.L. Bonner T.I. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11065-11072Google Scholar). The final mutated DNA fragments were ligated to pCRTMII vector, the constructs were transformed into supercompetent cells, and clones were selected on amp/IPTG/X-GAL plates. Selected clones were sequenced by the chain termination method (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar), using T3 or T7 primers. DNA from clones having the suitable coding sequence at the 3′ end of the IL-8Rβ coding region was shuttled into an expression vector (see below). The above mentioned constructs were subjected to HindIII/ XbaI digest, followed by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel. The relevant piece of DNA coding for the WT or truncated receptors was purified from the gel by using low gelling temperature agarose, Type XI. That piece was then ligated to the pRc/CMV expression vector previously digested by HindIII/ XbaI. The resulting constructs were then transformed into supercompetent cells, and subclones were selected on amp plates. The subclones chosen for transfection represent the WT receptor and four truncated receptors which were named β1 through β5, respectively (, Fig. 1, Table I). Full-length sequencing of selected subclones was performed using SP6, T7, and two additional primers (made specifically for the IL-8Rβ gene). No mutations were detected in β1, β2, β3, and β4. In β5, a point mutation due to an error in the PCR process was detected. This mutation resulted in a change in amino acid residue 38 from serine to proline. The changed amino acid is located in the N′ extracellular domain of the receptor, and it did not interfere with binding of IL-8 (based on a comparison of the IL-8 binding affinity and the number of binding sites/cell of cells transfected with β5 to those of cells transfected with β2, β3, and β4;Table II). It is important to note that in G protein-coupled receptors, ligand binding was shown to be essential for transducing signals, but the N′ domain was not found to have an active role in G protein coupling or signaling (17Weiss E.R.

Gray, ICOS Corp.) were grown as monolayers in growth medium (Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)). Cells were grown to approximately 75% confluency in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2at 37°C. Transfections with 5-20 μg of DNA were done with DOTAP transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer' instructions. The resulting transfected cells were given the same names as the receptors with which they were transfected (β1-β5). Control transfections were done with the vector (pRc/CMV) alone. Stably transfected cell lines were produced by adding G418 (800 μg/ml) to cultures (for maintenance of selection pressure) from day 4 after transfection and on. Stable 293 transfectants were trypsinized, washed twice in cell sorter buffer (CSB = phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, 0.02% NaN3, and 25 m M Hepes) and resuspended at the concentration of 4 × 106cells/ml in CSB. 25 μl of cells were aliquoted into a 96-well microtiter plate with a u-shaped bottom and mixed with 100 μl of monoclonal mouse anti-human IL-8Rβ antibodies (IgG1, 8.6 mg/ml, diluted 1:10000 in CSB). Baseline staining resulted from adding 100 μl of CSB to the cells instead of anti-human IL-8Rβ antibodies. Following a 30-min incubation at 4°C, the cells were washed three times in CSB, and 20 μl of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10 dilution in CSB) were added for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed twice in CSB and resuspended in 300 μl of CSB. At least 10,000 events of live and fresh cells were analyzed by FACS(Epics Profile, Coulter Corp.). Stable 293 transfectants were trypsinized, washed twice in cold bovine serum albumin medium (BSA medium = RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 25 m M Hepes buffer) and resuspended at the concentration of 2.5 × 106cells/ml in ice cold BSA medium. Samples of 200 μl were incubated with 10 dilutions of 125I-IL-8 in the presence or in the absence of unlabeled IL-8. In all dilutions, unlabeled IL-8 was in at least a 100 molar excess as compared to labeled 125I-IL-8. Following an incubation of 2 h at 4°C, the cells were spun for 2 min in a Microfuge. The supernatant was removed and the cells were then resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold BSA medium and layered on a cushion of 800 μl of 10% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Following an additional spin at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and the counts remaining in the pellet were assayed in a 1272 CliniGamma γ-counter (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The Langmuir protein-ligand binding model was used to estimate the number of receptors per cell and binding affinities for each receptor type in the study. Bound counts were first corrected for nonspecific binding, converted to picomole concentrations, and then fit directly to the model by nonlinear least squares regression. This procedure yields parameter estimates that are less biased than those that are estimated from the traditional Scatchard plot slope and intercept (36Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 543-576Google Scholar). The migration of 293 stable transfectants was assessed by a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique (37Falk W.R. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Google Scholar). The lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with aliquots of BSA medium or of each of the different IL-8 concentrations (diluted in BSA medium). The upper compartment of the chamber was loaded with a 50-μl cell suspension (5 × 105cells/ml in BSA medium) of 293 cells which were previously trypsinized and washed twice in BSA medium. The two compartments were separated by a polycarbonate PVPF filter, 10-μm pore size, coated with 20 μg/ml mouse collagen type IV for 2 h at 37°C. The chamber was incubated for 4.5-6 h at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation period, the filter was removed, fixed, and stained with a Diff-Quik kit. For each IL-8 concentration tested, cells migrating through to the underside of the filter were counted in three high power fields (× 400) by light microscopy (after coding the samples) in triplicate. Since the results of several experiments were combined in order to evaluate the migratory response, and since variation in potency of migration were observed between different experiments, the response to each of the IL-8 concentrations is shown as a chemotaxis index. The chemotaxis index in each experiment was evaluated by calculating the following ratio: chemotaxis index = the mean of the number of cells migrating to a specific IL-8 concentration/the mean of the number of cells migrating to BSA medium (= 0 ng/ml IL-8). The data are presented as the mean and standard errors (S.E.) of chemotaxis indices of 3-4 experiments. The baseline level of the number of transfected cells migrating was in a similar range for all the cells tested (β1-β5), with a mean of 6.7, ranging from 2-18 cells per high power field. Due to the large size of the cells and to limitations at the size of the high power field, the maximal response was limited to 70-80 cells per high power field. The p values of migration in response to each of the IL-8 concentrations in comparison to migration in response to BSA medium were calculated based on the actual numbers of migrating cells using Student' t test. Using the chemotaxis index, migration potencies of cells transfected with WT and truncated IL-8Rβ were analyzed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess trends across increasing concentrations of IL-8 and to compare receptor type profiles to BSA medium as well as to each other. Analyses of variance were followed with post hoc analyses and Student' t tests. Efforts were made to control type I compounding error rates. In some analyses, one-tailed strategies were used to test directional hypotheses. However, for simplicity, probabilities from two-tailed tests are presented, as results from these and other procedures led to similar conclusions. Anti-IL-8Rβ antibodies were used to exclude the possibility that truncation of different portions of IL-8Rβ resulted in an improper processing of the receptor, giving rise to a product that is not expressed on the cell surface. These assays showed that a high percentage of cells transfected with the WT receptor, as well as of cells transfected with all the truncated receptors, are expressing the receptor on the cell surface (Fig. 2). Yet, differences in the pattern of fluorescence and in intensity could be detected between the different receptors. The WT receptor (β1) and the two longer mutants (β2, β3) yielded a similar pattern of two-peak intensity of fluorescence. The two shorter mutants (β4 and β5) showed only one peak of fluorescence intensity, and the β5-transfected cells demonstrated a higher intensity of immunofluorescence than β4-transfected cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, the antibodies did not react with control cells transfected with the vector alone (data not shown). Binding of IL-8 is a prerequisite for transducing a signal by any of the receptors. We evaluated the IL-8 binding affinity of each of the receptors and the number of binding sites/cell on each of the receptor-transfected cell lines (WT and truncated receptors). Control cells transfected with the vector alone did not show any detectable binding of IL-8 (data not shown). Scatchard analysis showed that all the receptor-transfected cell lines (WT and truncated mutants) bound IL-8 with a comparable and high binding affinity (approximately 10−10M) (Table II). A comparison between the receptor-transfected cells showed differences in the numbers of binding sites/cell. The highest number of binding sites/cell was manifested on cells expressing the WT receptor (β1) with an average of 80,350 binding sites/cell (Table II). The average number of binding sites/cell on each of the four cell lines transfected with the truncated receptors (β2, β3, β4, and β5) was 3-fold lower than that of cells expressing the WT receptor (Table II). The four cell lines transfected with the mutated receptors (β2-β5) showed on average an equivalent number of binding sites/cell (Table II). Migration in response to IL-8 was used as a functional readout of signal transduction. Chemotaxis assays were performed in two separate sets of experiments, one covering IL-8 concentrations of 0.001-100 ng/ml and the other ranging from 10-1000 ng/ml (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively), because of space limitations of the chemotaxis chambers. Migration of 293 cells transfected with the WT receptor (β1) was optimal in response to 10-100 ng/ml (Figs. 3 and 4). Neutrophils have also been shown to respond optimally to the same concentrations of IL-8 (38Grob P.M. David E. Warren T.C. DeLeon R.P. Farina P.R. Homon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8311-8316Google Scholar). β1-transfected 293 cells did not migrate in response to IL-8 concentrations of 0.001-0.01 ng/ml (Fig. 3), and their migration was suboptimal in response to high concentrations of IL-8 (250-1000 ng/ml; Fig. 4). This gave rise to the typical bell-shaped dose-response curve of migration observed with many chemotactic stimuli (38Grob P.M. David E. Warren T.C. DeLeon R.P. Farina P.R. Homon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8311-8316Google Scholar). No migration in response to IL-8 was dete"

Neither the apoenzyme (the form in which the enzyme is isolated) nor the holoenzyme (reconstituted with the cofactor, adenosylcobalamin) has an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum associated with it. However, the addition of either the substrate, methylmalonyl-CoA, or the product, succinyl-CoA, results in the appearance of a transient EPR signal. The signal has hyperfine features that indicate coupling of the unpaired electron to the cobalt nucleus. In the presence of [CD3]methylmalonyl-CoA, an EPR signal is also seen and is similar to that obtained in the presence of protiated substrate. Power saturation studies reveal the presence of two components, a slow relaxing species (with an apparent g value of 2.11) and a fast relaxing species (with an apparent g value of 2.14) that can be partially resolved at low temperature and high power. The EPR-active intermediate is observed under catalytic conditions and is approximately midway in its resonance position between a free radical and cob(II)alamin. It is postulated to represent an exchange-coupled cob(II)alamin.…free radical pair. The signal bears close resemblance to those observed with partially dehydrated polycrystalline adenosylcobalamin following laser photolysis (Ghanekar, V. D., Lin, R. J., Coffman, R.

H., Beinert, H., and Blakley, R. L. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2338-2343). When cob(II)alamin is generated under noncatalytic conditions (i.e. in the presence of propionyl-CoA or by electrochemical reduction of enzyme-bound hydroxocob(III)alamin), a different EPR signal is observed with g┴ = 2.26 and g║ = 2.00, typical of base-on cob(II)alamin.

When cob(II)alamin is generated under noncatalytic conditions (i.e. in the presence of propionyl-CoA or by electrochemical reduction of enzyme-bound hydroxocob(III)alamin), a different EPR signal is observed with g┴ = 2.26 and g║ = 2.00, typical of base-on cob(II)alamin. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (see Fig. SI) and channels catabolites of odd chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, and cholesterol to the Krebs cycle (1Matsui S.M. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 857-861Google Scholar). The enzyme is dependent upon the cofactor, adenosylcobalamin(AdoCbl), 1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbladenosylcobalaminmWmilliwatt(s). a derivative of vitamin B12, for activity. Dysfunction of this enzyme leads to methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of organic acid metabolism (1Matsui S.M. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 857-861Google Scholar). In some bacteria, such as Propionibacterium shermanii, the mutase is important in the reverse metabolic direction, linking production of propionate from succinate, a pathway elucidated by Wood and co-workers (2Allen S.H.G. Kellermeyer R.W. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1964; 87: 171-187Google Scholar). adenosylcobalamin milliwatt(s). The first step in the mutase-catalyzed reaction is postulated to be homolytic fission of the Co-C bond of the cofactor to generate a carbon-centered deoxyadenosyl radical and a metal-centered cob(II)alamin radical (see Fig. SI, step i). Homolysis of the reactive Co-C bond is accelerated by a factor of ∼1011 by the enzyme (3Hay B.P. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 8012-8018Google Scholar). In the next step, the adenosyl radical, either directly or via a protein radical, is believed to initiate the rearrangement by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of methylmalonyl-CoA to generate a reactive primary radical on the substrate (see Fig. SI, step ii). The latter then rearranges to a more stable secondary radical on the product (see Fig. SI, step iii). The nature of the rearrangement step itself (i.e. whether it occurs via a free radical, a carbonium ion, a carbanion, or an organocobalt intermediate) is not known, and a large number of studies have attempted to model this step (4Choi G. Choi S.-C. Galan A. Wilk B. Dowd P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3174-3176Google Scholar, 5Dowd P. Wilk B. Wilk B.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7949-7951Google Scholar, 6Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Google Scholar, 7Wollowitz S. Halpern J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 8319-8321Google Scholar). Reabstraction of a hydrogen atom (see Fig. SI, step iv) to give product and recombination of the deoxyadenosyl and cobalamin radicals complete the catalytic cycle. This mechanism predicts the existence of a pair of paramagnetic species (one centered on cobalt and the other distributed between deoxyadenosine, substrate, product, and perhaps the protein) during the course of the reaction. In order to test this mechanism, we have examined the EPR spectra associated with the enzyme in the presence of both proteo- and deuterosubstrates and product. In addition, we have characterized the EPR spectrum of enzyme-bound cob(II)alamin generated under noncatalytic conditions. This study demonstrates the transient formation of an EPR-active species during catalysis that is distinct from the spectrum associated with bound cob(II)alamin under noncatalytic conditions. This provides evidence for the involvement of radicals in the rearrangement reaction catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The following were purchased from Sigma: coenzyme A (sodium salt), coenzyme B12, hydroxocobalamin hydrochloride, benzyl viologen, bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, Q-Sepharose (fast flow), and dithiothreitol. [CD3]Methylmalonic acid was purchased from MSD Isotopes. Phenyl-Sepharose (fast flow) and Superose 12 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Matrex Gel Blue A was purchased from Amicon, and casamino acids were from Difco. (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA and (R,S)-[CD3]methylmalonyl-CoA were synthesized and characterized as described previously (8Padmakumar R. Gantla S. Banerjee R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 318-320Google Scholar). [14C]CH3-methylmalonyl-CoA (56.4 Ci/mol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. The recombinant P. shermanii enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by a modification of the procedure employed for the human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (9Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Lai M. Liu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31630-31634Google Scholar). The E. coli strain K38 harboring the plasmids pMEX2 (containing the mutase gene behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter) and pGP1-2 (carrying the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase under control of a temperature-sensitive repressor) were generous gifts from Ian Scott (Texas A & M University). The cells were grown, and the mutase was induced essentially as described by McKie et al. (14McKie N. Keep N.H. Patchett M.L. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 293-298Google Scholar). E. coli cells (∼120 g, wet weight, obtained from 12 liters of culture) were suspended in 400 ml of 0.1 M potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m M EDTA, 5 m M benzamidine HCl, 2 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disrupted with a Heat Systems Ultrasonic Processor XL operated at an output setting of 7 for 6 × 1.5 min with 2-min breaks between the cycles to prevent overheating. The suspension was centrifuged at ∼75,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant fluid was immediately loaded on a Q-Sepharose (fast flow) column (5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 50 m M potassium Pi, pH 7.5. The first three steps of the purification were identical to those reported for the human mutase (9Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Lai M. Liu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31630-31634Google Scholar). The presence of the mutase was detected by Western analysis with rabbit antimutase antibodies generously provided by Janos Rétey (Universität Karlsruhe, Germany). The enzyme eluted from the Q-Sepharose column at ∼350 m M potassium Pi, from phenyl-Sepharose at 100 m M ammonium sulfate in 50 m M potassium Pi, and from the Matrex Gel Blue column at 300 m M potassium Pi. The final step involved chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column. The protein was eluted isocratically with 50 m M potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 150 m M KCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Activity of the bacterial mutase was either determined in the radiolabel assay at 37°C using [14C]CH3-methylmalonyl-CoA or in the coupled spectrophotometric assay at 30°C (9Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Lai M. Liu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31630-31634Google Scholar). 1 unit of activity catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of succinyl-CoA/min at 37°C unless stated otherwise. Steady state kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) using the Michaelis-Menten equation. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller, a model 5340 automatic frequency counter from Hewlett-Packard, and a gaussmeter. The specific conditions are provided in the figure legends. Spin quantitation was performed by comparison of the second integral of the sample spectra with that of a 1 m M cupric perchlorate standard. The samples were prepared as described in the figure legends. The value of the power for half saturation (P1/2) was calculated by fitting the data to Equation 1, logS(P)0.5=logA(1+Pp1/2)0.5b(Eq. 1) where S and P refer to signal amplitude and microwave power, respectively; A is a scaling factor; and b refers to the inhomogeneity parameter, which can vary from 1.0 for inhomogenous broadening to 2 for homogenous broadening (10Rupp H. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 537: 255-269Google Scholar). The bacterial apoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing apoenzyme with a 4-fold excess of AdoCbl on ice for 30 min. The protein was then concentrated in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon) and washed extensively with 50 m M potassium Pi, pH 7.5, until the filtrate was colorless and had no UV-visible absorption spectrum. The enzyme-bound cofactor (22 μM) was reduced electrochemically using a titration cell described previously (11Harder S.R. Feinberg B.A. Ragsdale S.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 283-287Google Scholar). Benzyl viologen (1 m M) was employed as a dye mediator, and the potential was poised at −350 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode. Once a stable current was observed, the sample was tipped in from the electrochemical chamber into the EPR tube side arm and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The recombinant enzyme from E. coli was purified 20-fold to near homogeneity. The summary of the purification is presented in Table I. Steady state kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme was performed using the radiolabel assay. The Km(app) for (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA is 168 ± 23 μM, comparable with the Km(app)of (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA of 160 μM reported for the wild type enzyme (12Kellermeyer R.W. Allen S.H.G. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2562-2569Google Scholar). The maximal specific activity is 38.5 ± 2 units/mg protein at 30°C and 50 ± 2 units/mg protein at 37°C.Table I:Purification of recombinant P. shermanii methylmalonyl-CoA mutase Open table in a new tab Neither the enzyme as isolated nor the holoenzyme reconstituted with AdoCbl have EPR spectra associated with them. When the holoenzyme was incubated with protiated or deuterated substrate (Fig. 1) or with succinyl-CoA (Fig. 2) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, an EPR spectrum was obtained. The signal disappeared if the sample was thawed and refrozen within 5 min (data not shown). Hyperfine splittings are well resolved in the high field region and have a spacing of ∼50 G. The total spin intensity of the signal in the presence of protiated substrate (Fig. 1, upper trace) is 0.4 spin/mol of enzyme. When deuterated substrate was incubated with the enzyme (Fig. 1, lower trace) the spectrum was similar to that obtained with protiated substrate; however, the spin intensity decreased to 0.15 spin/mol of enzyme. In the presence of succinyl-CoA (Fig. 2), a spectrum that is very similar to that shown in the upper trace of Fig. 1 was obtained, and the spin intensity was 0.18 spin/mol of enzyme.Figure 2:EPR spectrum of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in the presence of succinyl-CoA. An anaerobic and cold solution of holoenzyme (200 μM) was rapidly mixed with succinyl-CoA (10 m M) in the dark and then frozen. The instrument conditions were the same as those reported in the legend of Fig. 1 except that the resonator frequency was 9.64 GHz, and the sweep width was 1000 G. The line marker is at g = 2.1. Inset, power dependence of Signal A generated in the presence of succinyl-CoA. The data were fit to Equation 1 with the parameters reported in the text (the scaling factor (Equation 1, A) was 30.9 ± 0.8). Power dependence at 10 (○) and 25 K (□) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By varying the temperature and power, the signal shown in Fig. 1(upper trace) can be clearly seen to be composed of two features (Fig. 3 A). At low powers, Signal A (with g values of 2.11 and 2.0) predominates and shows saturation at 1 mW. The intensity of this signal remains unchanged up to 20 mW. With increasing microwave power, a fast relaxing species, Signal B, becomes well resolved. At 100 mW, Signal B is the major component, whereas at intermediate powers (5-20 mW) substantial amounts of both signals lead to a double-humped absorption feature. The peak to trough widths of Signals A and B are 155 and 120 G, respectively. Signal B shows splittings with spacing similar to that of Signal A (∼50 G), indicative of hyperfine coupling to the cobalt nucleus. The g values of Signal B are difficult to assign, but the crossover point is at g = 2.14. The power saturation data for Signal A could not be fit at any temperature to Equation 1. The deuterated sample exhibits a power dependence that is similar to that of the protiated sample. However, the two components are not well resolved, and a shift in the crossover point from g = 2.11 to g = 2.14 with increasing power is not seen (data not shown). At higher temperatures (>25 K) none of the spectra show the change in crossover point that results from predominance of Signal B (Fig. 3 B). The power dependence of Signal A observed in the presence of succinyl-CoA is less complex, and a typical dependence of signal intensity on the square root of power is observed. The power for half-saturation at 10 K is 0.99 ± 0.2 mW and at 25 K is 5.7 ± 0.8 mW (Fig. 2, inset) with an inhomogeneity parameter (Equation 1, b) of 1.00, indicating inhomogeneous broadening. At higher temperatures (100 K), saturation is not evident at a microwave power of 100 mW. In order to better understand the origins of Signals A and B, enzyme-bound cob(II)alamin was generated in one of two ways. In the first case, holoenzyme was exposed to propionyl-CoA, a substrate analog that slowly catalyzes the irreversible homolysis of the carbon-cobalt bond. Alternatively, enzyme-bound hydroxocobalamin was electrochemically reduced to cob(II)alamin. In both instances, the resulting EPR spectrum is typical of base-on cobalamin with g┴= 2.26 and g║= 2.0 (Fig. 4). Superhyperfine structure is observed in the high field lines that are split into triplets due to coupling to a nucleus with I = 1 at the lower axial position. We have purified the mutase to near homogeneity. Chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose was found to be essential for separating the mutase from a tenacious contaminant with a molecular mass of 44 kDa as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The contaminant was found by amino acid sequence analysis of a tryptic fragment to be the bacterial elongation factor, EF-Tu (the N terminus of this protein is blocked (13An G. Friesen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 33-39Google Scholar)). The activity of the bacterial mutase has been routinely measured in the reverse direction in a coupled system that requires three other enzymes. Thus, in order to compare the activities that we have measured in the radiolabeled assay with the values reported in the literature, we have reexamined the data presented in Fig. 3 by Kellermeyer et al. (12Kellermeyer R.W. Allen S.H.G. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2562-2569Google Scholar). The ratio of Vmax (forward)/Vmax (reverse) for the mutase from P. shermanii is ∼2.25. The specific activity (determined under Vmax conditions) of the bacterial mutase assayed in the reverse direction is reported to be 14.4 μmol of methylmalonyl-CoA formed per min/mg of protein at 30°C (12Kellermeyer R.W. Allen S.H.G. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2562-2569Google Scholar). This would correspond to a maximal specific activity in the forward direction of ∼32 μmol of succinyl-CoA formed per min/mg of protein. Our enzyme (maximal specific activity of 38.5 μmol of succinyl-CoA formed per min/mg of protein at 30°C) is thus comparable to the wild type enzyme and is ∼6-fold more active than the recombinant P. shermanii mutase isolated from the same E. coli strain by Leadlay and co-workers (14McKie N. Keep N.H. Patchett M.L. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 293-298Google Scholar). According to the mechanism depicted in Scheme I, the mutase-catalyzed reaction involves different pairs of biradical intermediates. This mechanism is postulated to be general for the AdoCbl-dependent enzymes (6Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Google Scholar, 15Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3893-3900Google Scholar, 16Finke R.G. Bleasdale C. Golding B.T. Molecular Mechanisms in Biorganic Processes. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1990: 244-279Google Scholar). When the bacterial mutase is reacted with substrate, a two-component transient EPR spectrum is obtained. Signal A is slow relaxing with a crossover g value of 2.11, whereas Signal B is fast relaxing with a crossover g value of 2.14. Hyperfine splittings resulting from coupling of the unpaired electron with the cobalt nucleus (I =) are evident in the high field region of the spectrum, where 5 out of the 8 lines are clearly resolved and centered at g = 2.00. The spacing (50 G) is considerably smaller than that of the splittings observed previously for enzyme-bound or -free cob(II)alamin (17Harder S.R. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.A. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Google Scholar, 18Frasca V. Banerjee R.V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8458-8465Google Scholar, 19Pilbrow J.R. Dolphin D. B. Wiley-Interscience, New York1982: 431-462Google Scholar), indicating less electron density on the cobalt in this intermediate. The spacing is generally ∼105 G for base-on cobalamin and 140-160 G for base-off cobalamins and cobinamides. Similar EPR spectra (showing only Signal A) have been reported for the wild type bacterial mutase (20Zhao Y. Such P. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 215-216Google Scholar, 21Zhao Y. Abend A. Kunz M. Such P. Retey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 891-896Google Scholar) and with the recombinant enzyme (22Keep N.H. Smith G.A. Evans M.C.W. Diakun G.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 387-392Google Scholar). However, these EPR spectra were not characterized either with respect to spin quantitation or power and temperature dependences. Thus, the contribution of the two components to the signal was missed. In addition, most of these spectra had poor resolution, and hyperfine splittings resulting from coupling to the cobalt nucleus were not observed (20Zhao Y. Such P. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 215-216Google Scholar, 22Keep N.H. Smith G.A. Evans M.C.W. Diakun G.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 387-392Google Scholar). Other AdoCbl-dependent enzymes in the presence of their respective substrates give rise to similar EPR spectra. These include ethanolamine ammonia lyase (23Babior B. Gould D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 34: 441-447Google Scholar), ribonucleotide reductase (24Orme-Johnson W.H. Beinert H. Blakley R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2338-2343Google Scholar), glutamate mutase (25Leutbecher U. Albracht S.P.J. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 144-146Google Scholar), and methyleneglutarate mutase (26Michel C. Albracht S.P. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 767-773Google Scholar). With both ribonucleotide reductase and glutamate mutase, Signal A was generated under freeze-quench conditions, and, with the former enzyme, the paramagnetic intermediate was shown to be kinetically competent. A different type of EPR spectrum has been reported for other AdoCbl-dependent enzymes in which the organic substrate radical centered at g = 2.0 appears as a doublet due to coupling to the unpaired electron on cobalamin (27Babior B.M. Moss T.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4537-4544Google Scholar, 28Cockle S.A. Hill H.A.O. Williams R.J.P. Davies S.P. Foster M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 275-277Google Scholar, 29Finlay T.H. Valinsky J. Mildvan A.S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1285-1290Google Scholar). Based on simulations, it has been proposed that the two radicals are ∼10 Å apart in these systems (30Schepler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Fee J.A. Abeles R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 397: 510-518Google Scholar, 31Buettner G.R. Coffman R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 480: 495-505Google Scholar). There are at least two possible interpretations of the observed EPR signal. One is that it is due only to cob(II)alamin in an unusual environment that results in its EPR spectrum being very different from those observed previously for the cofactor free in solution or bound to other enzymes (19Pilbrow J.R. Dolphin D. B. Wiley-Interscience, New York1982: 431-462Google Scholar, 32Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Google Scholar, 33Banerjee R.V. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1137Google Scholar). Alternatively, the signal could represent an exchange-coupled system in which the two spins interact strongly. Both possibilities have been raised previously (34Coffman R.E. Ishikawa Y. Blakley R.L. Beinert H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 307-318Google Scholar, 35Ghanekar V.D. Lin R.J. Coffman R.E. Blakley R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 215-221Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum observed with ribonucleotide reductase was simulated as the sum of the line shapes corresponding to two distinct hexacoordinate cob(II)alamin species (34Coffman R.E. Ishikawa Y. Blakley R.L. Beinert H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 307-318Google Scholar). However, the problem with this interpretation is that it did not account for the “other radical” that must exist according to a mechanism in which a diamagnetic parent generates paramagnetic products. Coffman and co-workers (35Ghanekar V.D. Lin R.J. Coffman R.E. Blakley R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 215-221Google Scholar) have observed a similar signal when partially dehydrated polycrystalline AdoCbl was photolyzed by lasers. Their interpretation was that this signal represented an exchange-coupled cob(II)alamin.…deoxyadenosyl radical pair. In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, we have examined the EPR spectrum of cob(II)alamin generated under noncatalytic conditions. Regardless of whether the cob(II)alamin is generated by electrochemical reduction or generated abortively in the presence of a substrate analog, the resulting EPR spectrum is typical of base-on cobalamin with g┴= 2.26 and g║= 2.0 (Fig. 4). In the presence of propionyl-CoA, a very poor substrate analog (36Hull W.E. Michenfelder M. Retey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 191-201Google Scholar), the unstable deoxyadenosyl radical is presumably quenched to deoxyadenosine. The observed EPR spectra rule out the possibility that Signal A is only due to cob(II)alamin in an unusual environment. Thus, the interpretation that we favor is that Signal A represents an intermediate in which the metal- and carbon-centered radicals interact strongly (Fig. SII). When, as in this case, the spins are dissimilar in nature, there is a high rate of mutual spin “flipping,” which is rapid compared with the difference in the precession frequencies in the external field. The field therefore sees only an average of the two radicals (37Abragam A. Bleaney B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transica spetions. Dover Publications, Inc., New York1986: 491-540Google Scholar), and the external magnetic field spectral line is observed at ½(giz+ gjz)βH = gzβHzinstead of at or near the individual frequencies (g = 2.26 for cobalt and g = 2.00 for a free radical). A recent study on the magnetic field dependence of and magnetic isotope effects on the reaction catalyzed by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase has provided evidence for the existence of a radical pair intermediate on this enzyme (38Harkins T.T. Grissom C.B. Science. 1994; 263: 958-960Google Scholar).Figure SII:Postulated nature of the exchange-coupled biradical intermediate. R is deoxyadenosyl, methylmalonyl, succinyl, or perhaps the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the substrate is one of the possible residences for the migrating radical (Fig. SI), we investigated whether the unpaired electron experiences magnetic effects due to the nuclear spins of adjacent protons on the substrate. The spectrum of the enzyme treated with [CD3]methylmalonyl-CoA is similar to that obtained with protiated substrate. The simplest explanation for the apparent absence of an isotope effect on the EPR spectrum is that the methyl protons of the substrate do not contribute to the observed hyperfine structure of the signal. However, this is not an unambiguous conclusion because the signal to noise ratio is low and weak hyperfine couplings due to protons could be missed. The power dependence studies reveal the presence of two components that are partially resolved at low temperatures and high powers. It is not known whether they represent two different radical species (for instance a cob(II)alamin.…deoxyadenosyl radical pair and a cob(II)alamin.…substrate radical pair) or whether they are two different states of the same biradical intermediate. The signals generated in the presence of deuterated substrate but not succinyl-CoA show the presence of both Signals A and B. This suggests that the two Signals A and B arise from two intermediates with their relative proportions varying in the different samples. Furthermore, with these two substrate-containing samples, we have been unable to obtain reasonable fits to the power saturation data using Equation 1 that is used to estimate the power for half-saturation of EPR signals due to a single species (10Rupp H. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 537: 255-269Google Scholar). This also supports the conclusion that the EPR signals observed in the presence of substrate are comprised of more than one species. What is the identity of the second radical contributing to Signal A? Based on the prevalence of Signal A (g = 2.11) in AdoCbl-dependent reactions (20Zhao Y. Such P. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 215-216Google Scholar, 22Keep N.H. Smith G.A. Evans M.C.W. Diakun G.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 387-392Google Scholar, 23Babior B. Gould D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 34: 441-447Google Scholar, 24Orme-Johnson W.H. Beinert H. Blakley R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2338-2343Google Scholar, 25Leutbecher U. Albracht S.P.J. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 144-146Google Scholar, 26Michel C. Albracht S.P. Buckel W. Eur. J.

Commun. 1981; 101: 215-221Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that it is the biradical intermediate common to all the enzymes (i.e. a deoxyadenosyl radical.…cob(II)alamin pair). Alternatively, it could represent a cob(II)alamin.…protein radical pair, assuming that a structurally similar protein radical is involved in all the enzymes in which this signal has been observed. In conclusion, our EPR spectra of cob(II)alamin generated under catalytic and noncatalytic conditions provide strong support for the interpretation that Signal A observed with this and other AdoCbl-dependent enzymes represents an exchange-coupled biradical intermediate in which the two dissimilar spins are strongly interacting. Whereas one of the two radicals is clearly on cob(II)alamin, the identity of the second radical in these EPR spectra, as well as the identity of the two components observed in the mutase-catalyzed reaction, remain important and as yet unanswered questions."
https://openalex.org/W2073599730,"Evidence is presented for the existence of a soluble heterotetramer containing the low and middle molecular weight neurofilament (NF) proteins, NF-L and NF-M, and one containing the low and high molecular weight proteins, NF-L and NF-H, and for their role in filament assembly. When a mixture of either pair of proteins was renatured in 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, pH 7.2, a new band representing a complex was observed in native gel electrophoresis. No new band was observed with a mixture of NF-M and NF-H. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that treatment of the complexes with SDS caused them to dissociate into their constituent polypeptide chains. Native neurofilaments dissociated in 2 M urea into a mixture of LM and LH complexes. Titration of NF-L with NF-M indicated that complex formation was complete at an approximately equimolar ratio of the two proteins. The LM complex had a sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, of 4.4 S, consistent with a tetrameric structure. Dialysis of a solution of the LM complex against 50 m M 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 0.17 M NaCl, pH 6.25, led to the formation of 10-nm filaments in good yield.

Like other members of the intermediate filament family (6Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 59: 593-625Google Scholar, 7Parry D.A.D. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Google Scholar), NF proteins have a central helical rod domain about 310 amino acids long which participates in the formation of coiled coil dimers, flanked by nonhelical head and tail domains. The large size of NF-M and NF-H is due to extra mass in their tail domains, which have been shown to project out from the core of the filament (9Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Google Scholar). The polypeptide composition of NF appears to be variable rather than fixed, with different ratios of the three proteins found in different tissues and with changes observed during growth and differentiation (10Nixon R.A. Shea T.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 81-91Google Scholar). NF dissociate into a mixture of the three proteins when dissolved in concentrated urea and reassemble into filaments when incubated at moderate salt concentrations and slightly acidic pH (11Geisler N. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 565-571Google Scholar, 12Liem R.K.H. Hutchison S.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3221-3226Google Scholar, 13Zackroff R.V. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 754-757Google Scholar). Purified NF-L readily forms filaments by itself in vitro, and studies of the pathway of NF assembly have thus far concentrated on reconstitution of homopolymer filaments from NF-L. Several intermediates in this process can be stabilized in soluble form under appropriate conditions. Thus NF-L assembly proceeds through dimers (14Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. Lustig A. Schulthess T. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Google Scholar), tetramers (15Lifsics M.R. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2866-2875Google Scholar, 16Hisanaga S.-I. Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Saito T. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 161-172Google Scholar), and octamers (17Hisanaga S. Ikai A. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 857-869Google Scholar), with further longitudinal and lateral aggregation finally leading to filaments (17Hisanaga S. Ikai A. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 857-869Google Scholar, 18Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 871-882Google Scholar). However, the NF-L homopolymer filaments whose in vitro assembly has been intensively studied never occur in vivo; rather, NF-L is always expressed in combination with at least one other neuronal IF protein (4Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 131: 109-167Google Scholar). In fact, when expressed by transfection in cultured cells, none of the three proteins, including NF-L, can polymerize by itself, but NF-L copolymerizes with NF-M or NF-H in appropriately cotransfected cells (19Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Google Scholar, 20Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Google Scholar). In vitro studies on NF-M and NF-H and on mixtures of proteins are generally consistent with the results of the transfection studies; NF-M, NF-H, or a combination of these two proteins form shorter and more irregular filaments and do so with relatively low efficiency, whereas each protein can coassemble efficiently with NF-L (e.g. Refs. 9Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Google Scholar, 21Balin B.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Brain Res. 1991; 556: 196-208Google Scholar, and 22Gotow T. Takeda M. Tanaka T. Hashimoto P.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 331-345Google Scholar). None of the studies on filament formation from mixtures of NF proteins has examined the details of the process or the nature of intermediates. Therefore, although NF-L homopolymer assembly in vitro has been extensively characterized, little is known about the assembly pathway of the heteropolymer filaments actually found in cells. In this study we demonstrate by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (“native gels”) the formation of two soluble heterotetramers, one containing NF-L and NF-M and the other containing NF-L and NF-H. Upon treatment with 2 M urea, intact NF dissociate into a mixture of the two complexes. The NF-L·NF-M complex is able to serve as a starting point for filament assembly. The implications of these results for the pathway of NF assembly and disassembly in vivo are discussed. Preliminary accounts of some of these results have been presented (23Hajarian H. Magadam F. Sterling E.A. Sainte-Marie S. Cohlberg J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 209aGoogle Scholar, 24Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Guillermo R. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 365aGoogle Scholar). NF were isolated from bovine spinal cord, and NF proteins were purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of 6 M urea as described previously (25Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Sainte-Marie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17009-17015Google Scholar), except that Toyopearl DE-650 Superfine (Supelco) was used. This gave much better resolution than Whatman DE52. For experiments on whole neurofilaments, crude spinal cord extract clarified by low-speed centrifugation was chromatographed on Sepharose 4B in 20 m M PIPES, 1 m M EGTA, 1 m M MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 m M PMSF, and 1 m M DTT, pH 6.8, and the void volume fractions, found to contain only the three NF proteins, were used in further experiments (9Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Google Scholar, 26Shecket G. Lasek R.J. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 1335-1344Google Scholar). Chicken gizzard desmin was purified by the method of Geisler and Weber (27Geisler N. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 425-433Google Scholar), with an additional step of single-stranded DNA-cellulose chromatography (28Nelson W.J. Traub P. J. Cell Sci. 1982; 57: 25-49Google Scholar) to remove small amounts of degraded desmin. Porcine lens vimentin was purified by the method of Geisler and Weber (29Geisler N. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 253-256Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman model E centrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner. The recorder voltages were input to a Macintosh SE computer through a MacAdios 8ain interface (GW Instruments). Solvent viscosities were measured with a capillary viscometer and densities determined pycnometrically for correction of observed sedimentation coefficients to s20,w. Protein stock solutions were dialyzed versus 4 M guanidine hydrochloride containing 1 m M DTT and 0.4 m M PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined by microbiuret assay (30Itzhaki R.F. Gill D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 9: 401-410Google Scholar). Molar concentrations were calculated using molecular weights of 6.2 × 104for NF-L, 9.8 × 104for NF-M, and 1.13 × 105for NF-H, averages of molecular weights determined from amino acid sequence data (31Guan R.J. Khatra B.S. Cohlberg J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8262-8267Google Scholar). Individual proteins were mixed and dialyzed overnight versus two changes of 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, 6 m M mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 m M PMSF, pH 7.2, in Sartorius microcollodion bags. Since 2 M urea electrophoresis with a continuous Tris chloride buffer system of uniform pH gave poor resolution and reproducibility, a discontinuous buffer system was used. The Tris-glycine system used by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was modified by lowering the ionic strength, raising the pH of the stacking gel and lowering the pH of the running gel, since high salt concentrations and extremes of pH might cause the proteins to precipitate or dissociate. The running gel, 16 cm × 14 cm × 1.5 mm, contained 4.5 ml of acrylamide solution (30% acrylamide, 0.8% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide), 7.5 ml of 8 M urea, 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.4, and 17.74 ml of H2O (final pH 8.0). Polymerization was initiated by addition of 10 μl of TEMED and 250 μl of 10% ammonium persulfate. The stacking gel contained 1.4 ml of acrylamide solution, 2.5 ml of 8 M urea, 80 m M Tris, pH 7.6, and 5.99 ml of H2O (final pH 7.2). Polymerization was initiated by adding 10 μl of TEMED and 100 μl of 10% ammonium persulfate. Samples of approximately 40-μl volume were layered onto the bottoms of 6-mm-wide wells. The electrode buffer contained 0.47 g/liter Tris and 2.38 g/liter glycine (pH 8.6). Because a dilute electrode buffer was used, electrophoresis was conducted in an apparatus containing upper and lower buffer chambers with volumes of 3 liters each in order to provide the required buffer capacity. Electrophoresis was conducted at 100 V (6 mA) for 15 h until the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel. The pH of the lower buffer dropped to about 8.0 during the run. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a lane from a 2 M urea gel was excised with a razor blade and incubated for 60 min in SDS sample buffer (0.0625 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.001% bromphenol blue at room temperature. The second dimension SDS gels contained 6-7.5% acrylamide and were prepared according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The first dimension gel was embedded on top of the stacking gel of the second dimension slab using 1% agarose dissolved in SDS sample buffer lacking glycerol. Protein samples in 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, 1 m M DTT, 0.4 m M PMSF, pH 7.2, were dialyzed at 37°C versus 50 m M MES, 0.175 M NaCl, 0.5 m M EGTA, 1 m M DTT, 0.4 m M PMSF, pH 6.25 (33Troncoso J.C. Haner M. March J.L. Reichelt R. Engel A. Aebi U. Aebi U. Engel J. Cytoskeletal and Extracellular Proteins: Structure, Interactions and Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany1989: 33-38Google Scholar). An aliquot of the suspension was applied to a Formvar-coated copper grid, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and examined at 80 kV in a Jeol 1200EX-II electron microscope. Electrophoresis of NF proteins was initially performed in the presence of 4 M urea, in which keratins readily form complexes (34Quinlan R.A. Cohlberg J.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 365-388Google Scholar). In these experiments the three NF proteins migrated independently and showed no evidence of complex formation (data not shown). Attempts at performing native gel electrophoresis in aqueous buffers lacking denaturants were unsuccessful; very little protein entered the gel, and heavy staining was observed at the bases of the sample wells. It was then found that inclusion of 2 M urea in the gel was sufficient to render the proteins soluble, and such gels provided evidence of heterooligomer formation (see below). We therefore performed sedimentation velocity experiments to verify that NF proteins retain their “native” states in 2 M urea (i.e. exhibit the same states in 2 M urea as they do in dilute pH 8 buffers), as has been reported for desmin (35Kaufmann E. Weber K. Geisler N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 733-742Google Scholar) and keratins (36Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Winter S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80 (7113-7113)Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the sedimentation coefficient as a function of urea concentration for different intermediate filament proteins. The s value of desmin remains almost constant up to a urea concentration of 6 M and begins to decrease at 7 M urea, in agreement with the findings of Kaufmann et al. (35Kaufmann E. Weber K. Geisler N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 733-742Google Scholar) that desmin tetramers dissociated to dimers in 7 M urea. Desmin existed as dimers in 2-3 M guanidine hydrochloride and then dissociated to monomers at 4 M guanidine. The s20,w values in 4 and 6 M guanidine, 2.1 and 1.9 S, are close to the value of 2.0 S expected for a randomly coiled polypeptide chain of 463 amino acid residues (calculated from the data in Ref. 37Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 729-736Google Scholar). Similar behavior for desmin in guanidine solutions was reported by Quinlan et al. (14Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. Lustig A. Schulthess T. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Google Scholar). For both NF-L and vimentin, a concentration of 5 M urea is required before any decrease in the s value is observed, suggesting that tetramers are stable up to 4 M urea. The sedimentation coefficient of NF-M is virtually independent of urea concentration, indicating that it undergoes no change in aggregation state within this range of urea concentrations. Thus, gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2 M urea should reflect the behavior of individual NF proteins and protein complexes in their “native” states. The mobilities of the three individual NF proteins in the 2 M urea gels are shown in Fig. 2, lanes 1-3. It should be noted that electrophoretic mobilities in native gels are functions of both size and charge, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about the relative sizes of the proteins under these conditions from their mobilities in this gel system. Presumably NF-L migrates as a tetramer and NF-M and NF-H as monomers or monomers in equilibrium with dimers (25Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Sainte-Marie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17009-17015Google Scholar). At higher acrylamide concentrations, the order of the bands changes, with NF-M migrating faster than NF-L (data not shown), consistent with a larger size for NF-L than NF-M under these conditions (38Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Google Scholar). For NF-H, in addition to the principal band migrating near the middle of the gel, a second band near the top of the gel was observed. The relative intensities of the two bands are variable; probably the band near the top of the gel represents an aggregated form of NF-H. In some experiments a minor second band for NF-M was observed which approximately comigrated with NF-L; the origin of this band is unknown. Lane 4 in Fig. 2 shows a sample in which NF-M and NF-L were mixed, dialyzed overnight against 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, then dialyzed overnight against 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The band for NF-M is missing, the band for NF-L is greatly reduced in intensity, and a new band with a lower mobility appears. This new band presumably represents a heterooligomer containing both polypeptides (“LM complex”). A mixture of NF-L and NF-H treated in the same fashion (lane 5) showed reduced intensities for the NF-L and NF-H bands and the appearance of a new lower mobility band presumably representing an NF-L·NF-H heterooligomer (LH complex) which migrated more slowly than the LM complex. Mixtures of NF-H and NF-M (lane 7) showed only bands corresponding to the individual proteins, indicating that no MH complexes were formed. When a mixture of all three proteins was examined (lane 8), both LM and LH complexes were observed, with some residual bands of reduced intensity corresponding to uncomplexed NF-L and NF-H. For all mixtures, results similar to those shown were obtained when the guanidine dialysis step was omitted, or when proteins were dialyzed directly from the 6 M urea buffer used for ion exchange chromatography into 2 M urea, 10 m M Tris, pH 7.2, and then mixed just before electrophoresis. However the best yields of complex were most consistently obtained when the guanidine dialysis step was included. The identity of the putative complexes was confirmed by the use of two-dimensional gel analysis. Native gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2 M urea was performed in the first dimension; then the lanes were excised and incubated in SDS in order to dissociate the oligomers into their constituent polypeptides, which were resolved in a second dimension in the presence of SDS. Fig. 3 A shows a pattern obtained from a mixture of NF-L and NF-M at a molar ratio (M:L) of 0.47; a band corresponding to a complex dissociated in the presence of SDS into NF-M and NF-L, whereas a second band with greater mobility contained only NF-L. Fig. 3 B shows a pattern obtained with a molar excess of NF-M, indicating an LM complex, an NF-M band, and a small amount of uncomplexed NF-L. A mixture of NF-L and NF-H is shown in Fig. 3 C, with a band for LH complex dissociating into NF-H and NF-L in the presence of SDS, along with separate bands for free NF-H and NF-L. A mixture of all three proteins (Fig. 3 D) shows LH and LM complexes dissociating into the expected components in the second dimension, along with spots for each of the three uncomplexed proteins. For this experiment, a pure neurofilament preparation containing only the NF triplet proteins was obtained by gel filtration of a crude spinal cord extract as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 2, lane 6, reveals that dialysis of these filaments against 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, pH 7.2, caused them to dissociate into a mixture of LM and LH complexes. The corresponding two-dimensional gel (Fig. 3 E) confirmed that the spots corresponding to the LH and LM complexes accounted for virtually all the protein in the solution. This experiment lends support to the idea that the LM and LH complexes represent structural entities present within intact filaments. A complexation titration was performed, in which the amount of NF-L was held constant while the amount of NF-M was increased, as shown in Fig. 4. In lanes 2-5, addition of increasing amounts of NF-M led to the gradual disappearance of the NF-L band, whereas all the NF-M was incorporated into the complex. (Only faint NF-M bands are seen in lanes 4 and 5.) By lane 5 only a faint NF-L band remained, corresponding to a small amount of NF-L which was not able to associate with NF-M. Addition of further NF-M led to the appearance of a strong NF-M band, indicating that after the equivalence point was reached, excess free NF-M was present. The mixture of lane 5, at a molar ratio M:L of 1.17, is close to the equivalence point at which complex formation was complete. This suggests that the LM complex contains equimolar amounts of the two proteins. A similar equivalence point was obtained in an experiment in which the amount of NF-M was held constant and the amount of NF-L was varied (data not shown). Also, a similar equivalence point was obtained in experiments where the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) instead of the microbiuret assay. It should also be noted that a molar ratio (M:L) of 1 corresponds to a mass ratio of 1.58; this is consistent with the two-dimensional gel patterns (Fig. 3), which always showed a greater intensity of the NF-M spot than the NF-L spot derived from the dissociation of a band for ML complex. One example of a titration of NF-L with NF-H is shown in lanes 8-13. In this experiment, addition of increasing amounts of NF-H led gradually to near complete disappearance of the NF-L band. Initially (lane 8) all of the NF-H was incorporated into the complex, but with increasing amounts of NF-H added a significant portion of the NF-H remained uncomplexed. The proportion of NF-L and NF-H which appeared competent in complex formation differed among protein preparations, but complete complex formation was never observed. Therefore, we did not attempt to interpret these experiments in terms of an equivalence point. A preparation of pure LM complex (Fig. 5, inset, fourth lane) in 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, pH 7.2, was dialyzed against a buffer favoring filament reconstitution at 37°C (see “Experimental Procedures”) and examined by electron microscopy. Filaments with a diameter of 10-12 nm were observed, with virtually no unpolymerized protein appearing on the grid. This suggests that the LM complex can serve as an intermediate in filament assembly (see “Discussion”). A series of absorbance traces from a sedimentation velocity experiment on a solution of LM complex in 2 M urea, 20 m M Tris, pH 7.2, is shown in Fig. 6. A 2 M urea gel of this solution showed virtually 100% complex, similar to Fig. 5. A well defined boundary indicative of a single sedimenting species was observed, with initial absorbance traces (not shown), indicating that about 29% of the material formed rapidly sedimenting aggregates. (Aggregation was a more severe problem when renaturation was performed at higher protein concentrations.) A sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, of 4.4 S was observed, compared with values of 3.7 S for NF-L tetramers and 5.5 S for NF-L octamers (17Hisanaga S. Ikai A. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 857-869Google Scholar). This value was confirmed by sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation of a preparation of the complex dialyzed against 10 m M triethanolamine, pH 8.0, which showed NF-L and NF-M cosedimenting at the same rate as bovine serum albumin, whose s20,w is 4.31 S (40Shulman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1953; 44: 230-246Google Scholar) (data not shown). This sedimentation coefficient is consistent with a tetrameric structure for the LM complex (see “Discussion”). This study has demonstrated that LM and LH complexes form when appropriate mixtures of NF proteins are renatured together in a low ionic strength buffer containing 2 M urea. The sedimentation coefficient observed for the LM complex, intermediate between the values for the NF-L tetramer and NF-L octamer, is consistent with a tetrameric structure for this oligomer. An increase in the s value of the tetramer from 3.7 S for L4to 4.4 S for L2M2is exactly what would be predicted from the dependence of sedimentation coefficient on the 2/3 power of the molecular weight (41Scheraga H.A. Mandelkern L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 179-184Google Scholar). A tetrameric structure is also supported by the results of preliminary cross-linking studies employing dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (24Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Guillermo R. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 365aGoogle Scholar, 42Guillermo R. Cross-linking Studies on Heterooligomers of Low and Middle Molecular Weight Neurofilament Proteins. M.S. thesis. California State University, Long Beach, CA1990Google Scholar). The relevance of the heterotetramers to neurofilament structure and assembly is indicated by two key findings. First, when filaments isolated by gel filtration of crude spinal cord extract, which had not previously been subjected to conditions favoring filament disassembly, were exposed to 2 M urea, they dissociated into a mixture of LM and LH complexes. Second, when a solution containing virtually 100% LM complex was dialyzed against a standard filament reassembly buffer, filaments were obtained in good yield. It could be argued that neither of these findings proves the relevance of the complexes to NF assembly. In regard to the first observation, it is conceivable that the 2 M urea treatment initially gave different dissociation products which subsequently rearranged to form a mixture of LM and LH complexes with virtually no free protein remaining, but this seems unlikely. In regard to the filament reassembly, it is possible that the LM heterotetramers are not productive assembly intermediates, that the LM complexes dissociated into NF-L and NF-M which then reassociated via completely different intermediates to form filaments. For example, although tropomyosin is composed of αβ coiled coil heterodimers, renaturation under certain conditions favors formation of αα and ββ homodimers which can then reequilibrate to heterodimers (43Brown H.R. Schachat F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2354-2363Google Scholar, 44Lehrer S.S. Qian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1134-1138Google Scholar, 45Jancsó A. Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5891-5897Google Scholar). One should, however, note for comparison the behavior of a dead-end complex of vimentin and keratin, which when added to a keratin filament reconstitution mixture not only was incapable of forming filaments but actually inhibited further filament formation (46Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Google Scholar). Rigorous proof that LM complex can serve as a true assembly intermediate rather than a dead-end complex would require demonstration that a covalently cross-linked LM complex is capable of forming filaments (cf. Ref. 46), and such studies are now in progress. The specificity observed in heterooligomer formation is the same as that observed in NF assembly; thus, the specific requirement for NF-L and one of the other NF proteins seen in assembly experiments (see the Introduction) can be explained by the behavior of the proteins at the level of tetramer formation. Thus the failure of NF-M and NF-H to coassemble in the absence of other IF proteins can be explained by their failure to form a heterotetrameric assembly intermediate. While Carden and Eagles (47Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 587-591Google Scholar) did observe the formation of disulfide cross-links between NF-M and NF-H upon oxidation of the soluble material formed from dissociating NF at low ionic strength, it should be noted that the NF preparations used in these studies contained considerable non-NF protein contamination, and the soluble material was heterogeneous in size (48Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 227-237Google Scholar). The detailed structure of the LM and LH complexes is not yet certain. While the titration data suggest that LM tetramers contain two copies each of NF-L and NF-M, other models cannot be ruled out. For example, electron microscopic observations of the frequency of NF-H tail domain projections in NF reconstituted from a mixture of NF-L and NF-M led Hisanaga and Hirokawa (9Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Google Scholar) to conclude that there was one such projection per tetrameric unit, not two; this leads to the expectation that a tetramer containing three NF-L polypeptide chains associated with one chain of either NF-M or NF-H (L3M or L3H) would constitute a structural entity within filaments. However, these authors mentioned the possibility that each projection could represent more than one tail domain, an idea consistent with the titration data of Fig. 4. Clearly further work is required to settle these questions. Experience with the incorrect three-chain model for keratins (49Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Aynardi-Whitman M. Zackroff R. Goldman R.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 46: 465-474Google Scholar), which was also based largely on evidence from titration studies, argues for caution in this regard. In an electron microscopic study (50Mulligan L. Balin B.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Ip W. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 145-160Google Scholar), antigenic epitopes on the NF-L tail domain which were accessible in filaments reconstituted from NF-L alone were found to be relatively inaccessible in native NF; this was taken to suggest that NF-L/NF-M and NF-L/NF-H heterodimers occur within NF. The results presented here do not distinguish between a tetramer consisting of a dimer of homodimers, e.g. (L2)(M2), or a dimer of heterodimers, e.g. (LM)2. Finally, the present results do not identify the molecular interactions responsible for the observed specificity in heterotetramer formation. Initial results with truncated mouse NF-L constructs missing head or tail domains suggest that this specificity is due to specific interactions among the central rod domains of the three proteins. 2T. Tran, A. Ansari, J. Cohlberg, M. Lee, and D. Cleveland, unpublished experiments. These studies will be reported elsewhere. These studies suggest that NF protein heterooligomers, rather than individual NF proteins, are the intermediates for filament assembly and disassembly in vivo. According to this model, in de novo filament assembly, newly synthesized NF proteins would form LM and LH tetramers, which would then associate to form 10-nm filaments. During filament disassembly, e.g. that triggered by head domain phosphorylation (17Hisanaga S. Ikai A. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 857-869Google Scholar, 51Nixon R.A. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 29-38Google Scholar, 52Sacher M.G. Athlan E.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18480-18484Google Scholar), LM and LH tetramers would dissociate from the filaments and be released into the soluble phase. The incorporation of axonally transported protein into the stationary filamentous network (51Nixon R.A. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 29-38Google Scholar, 53Nixon R.A. Sihag R.K. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 501-506Google Scholar) would occur through exchange of heterotetramers released from the filaments with heterotetramers present in the moving phase (54Angelides K.J. Smith K.E. Takeda M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 55Okabe S. Miyasaka H. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 375-386Google Scholar); replacement of one type of heterotetramer by another with a different protein composition would then be responsible for changes in the protein composition of NF observed during development (10Nixon R.A. Shea T.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 81-91Google Scholar). While the NF triplet proteins are the principal constituents of NF in mature neurons of the central nervous system, in some neuronal cells and neuronal precursors they are present with other “neuronal IF proteins,” peripherin, α-internexin, vimentin, and nestin (2Shaw G. Burgoyne R.D. The Neuronal Cytoskeleton. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 185-214Google Scholar, 5Liem R.K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 12-16Google Scholar). In these neurons, as yet uncharacterized heterotetramers or other heterooligomers containing NF triplet proteins in combination with vimentin, peripherin, or α-internexin would serve as assembly intermediates.

Here we report the purification and structural analysis of one of the components of this material. The results explain its resistance to enzymatic digestions and demonstrate the existence of a previously unidentified core-related structure. In addition, we present evidence that XylβMU also primes the synthesis of molecules that lack the typical tandem galactosyl residues found in the core oligosaccharide region of GAG chains. Human melanoma cells UACC-903 were obtained from Dr. J. M. Trent, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase was obtained from Oxford Glycosystems, and bovine β-glucuronidase was the generous gift of Dr. Phil Stahl, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. C-18 (SPICE) cartridges (400 mg and 2 g) were purchased from Analtech Inc. [6-3H]Galactose (15 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; and QAE-Sephadex, XylβMU, and routine chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Six T450 culture flasks each containing ~1.8 × 108melanoma cells (UACC-903) at 80% confluency were incubated for 5 days at 37°C in 7% CO2atmosphere. Each flask contained 200 ml of serum-free Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium supplemented with 1 m M XylβMU. The cells were removed by centrifugation and the medium was lyophilized and then reconstituted in 40 ml of water. A mixture of 54,000 cpm of [3H]Gal-labeled anionic MU-β-xylosides previously purified from another batch of these cells was added to the reconstituted medium to monitor purification. The radiolabeled material had been purified by C-18 chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex as described below and in previous work (9Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Google Scholar). The material contained a single negative charge as determined by ion-exchange HPLC on a Varian AX5 column. The mixture of labeled and unlabeled material was dialyzed extensively against water using 3500 Mrcut-off dialysis tubing. The material retained within the tubing was chromatographed on a 5-ml column of QAE-Sephadex and the anionic molecules were eluted with 100 m M NaCl. The eluate was desalted on a 2-g bed C-18 cartridge (Alltech) by washing with water and the MU-β-xyloside-based products were eluted with 40% MeOH. The sample was concentrated by evaporation to 0.5 ml and digested with 40 milliunits of A. ureafaciens sialidase and 50 milliunits of bovine testicular β-glucuronidase together in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 6.0, with 4 m M CaCl2at 37°C for 16 h. It was again chromatographed on QAE-Sephadex to remove the neutralized material and the remaining anionic material was eluted with 100 m M NaCl. This was desalted on a C-18 cartridge, eluted with 40% MeOH, dried, reconstituted with 40% MeOH, and stored at 4°C. About 15 μg of the anionic material described above was digested with a combination of 0.3 units of β-glucuronidase and 25 milliunits of α- N-acetylgalactosaminidase in 100 m M sodium citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.0 (Supplied by Oxford Glycosystems), in a volume of 50 μl for 20 h at 37°C. Following digestion the neutral and anionic xylosides were separated on QAE-Sephadex as described above, desalted on a C-18 cartridge, and dried for analysis. Compositional analyses were carried out at the UCSD Glycobiology Core. The sample was hydrolyzed in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, 100°C, for 4 h and the hydrolysate was analyzed by HPAEC-PAD on a Dionex DX500 (Dionex Corp.) on a CarboPac PA-1 column. All monosaccharide components and the MU residue were eluted using a linear gradient of sodium acetate from 0 to 100 m M between 5 and 25 min with constant, 16 m M sodium hydroxide concentration throughout the run. The elution position and detector response were determined with authentic standards. Initial qualitative analysis of the hydrolysate was done on silica gel plates developed in EtAC:Pyr:AcOH:H2O, 5:5:1:3, solvent system. Sugars were detected either by silver nitrate spray or by ninhydrin spray for amino sugars. The samples analyzed were: I, ~25 μg of the undigested anionic xyloside; IA, ~15 μg of the material neutralized by the combined α- N-acetylgalactosaminidase and β-glucuronidase digestions; IB, ~10 μg of the material which remained anionic after the combined enzyme digestion. Each sample was repeatedly exchanged in D2O (99.96%, Aldrich Chemical Co.) with intermediate lyophilization, and finally dissolved in 40 μl of 99.996% D2O. Spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Plus 500 MHz spectrometer (Varian Applications Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) using a Nano-NMR probe. The Nano-NMR probe spins samples rapidly (1-2 kHz) at the magic angle to remove the magnetic-susceptibility contributions to the 1H NMR line widths (11Barbara T.M. J. Magn. Res. Ser. A. 1994; 109: 265-269Google Scholar). This unique technology produces high-resolution spectra in sample volumes <40 μl, thus lowering solvent contaminants and background. The probe temperature was 25 or 30°C (as indicated in the figure legends) and the spin rate was typically about 1850 Hz. Proton one-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained in about 1000 scans using presaturation of the HOD peak. TOCSY two-dimensional spectra (12Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Google Scholar) were obtained using a 10-kHz MLEV17 spin lock of either 50- or 100-ms duration, 1.6 s (sample I), or 1.0 s (samples IA, and IB) of presaturation, 88 (sample I) or 48 (sample IA and IB) scans per t1data point, and 300 complex data points in t1; total measuring time was 30 h for sample I, and 13 h for samples IA and IB. Double quantum-filtered COSY (DQFCOSY) spectra (13Piantini U. Sorenson O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Google Scholar) were obtained using either 300 (samples I and IA) or 350 (sample IB) complex t1data points having 48 scans each; measurement times were 18 and 21 h, respectively. ROESY two-dimensional data (14Kessler H. Griesinger R. Kerssebaum R. Wagner K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 607-609Google Scholar) for sample I were obtained using a 2-KHz pulsed spinlock of 200 ms duration, using 192 scans per 300 complex t1data points (60 h experiment). All two-dimensional spectra were obtained in a phase-sensitive mode using hypercomplex sampling in t1, and included presaturation of the HOD resonance. Line broadening (0.2 Hz) was applied to one-dimensional spectra, while two-dimensional spectra were weighted with gaussian functions. Chemical shifts are given relative to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate added as internal standard to xyloside I. In the case of xylosides, IA and IB were actually measured relative to the residual HOD peak at 4.80 ppm. When analyzing Me2SO- d6solutions chemical shifts were referenced to the Me2SO multiplet at 2.49 ppm. LSIMS analysis was performed with a VG 70-SE (VG Instruments, United Kingdom) magnetic sector mass spectrometer, in both positive and negative ion modes. The instrument was equipped with a cesium ion gun operated at 23 kV and with an emission current of 2-3 μA, in the positive mode and 18 kV, with an emission current of 4-5 μA in the negative mode. Spectra were recorded in the mass range 200-2000 at constant magnetic field. The xyloside (~10 μg) dissolved in 5 μl of 40% methanol was applied to the stainless steel target holding 2 μl of glycerol/thioglycerol matrix. The scans were repeated after addition of sodium chloride to confirm the identity of the molecular ion. Electrospray experiments were performed at the Scripps Research Institute Mass Spectrometry Facility using an API III Perkin Elmer Sciex triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with an upper mass range of m/z 2400. The ion spray interface was used for sample introduction with a potential of the interface sprayer at 3.4 kV. All solvents and reagents were of 99.9% purity and were obtained from Aldrich or Curtin Matheson. Water was purified on a Nanopure filtration system. The sample was dissolved in a methanol/water solvent at 20-50 μM and injected into the spectrometer at 4.0 μl/min. In a previous study we labeled and purified a group of [3H]Gal-labeled β-xyloside-based products that were secreted into the medium by human melanoma cells (9Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Google Scholar). We determined the structures of ~90% of these products by sequential enzymatic digestions and HPLC analysis, as reported. Applying the same methods to analyze the size and charge of the remaining 10-15% of anionic species showed that this labeled material contains 3-5 monosaccharides and a single negative charge by anion-exchange HPLC (data not shown). In the previous study, one of the keys to solving the structures of the other components was sequential enzymatic or chemical degradations of the anionic molecules. However, the negative charge on the uncharacterized material was resistant to all treatments and digestions which included: mild acid hydrolysis that cleaves sialic acids, Newcastle Disease Virus sialidase, A. ureafaciens sialidase, bovine β-glucuronidase, Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, sequential mild acid hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase digestion, jack bean β-galactosidase digestion, or a sequential digestion with human placental β-hexosaminidase A followed by β-glucuronidase, and treatment with mercuric acetate (or chloride). The last procedure cleaves the glycosidic linkage of terminal uronic acids that contain a 4,5-unsaturated bond (15Ludwigs W. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Google Scholar, 16Shibata S. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6548-6555Google Scholar). In addition, this material cannot be metabolically labeled when cells are incubated for 12 h with up to 1 mCi/ml 35SO4under conditions that heavily label chondroitin sulfate chains at the same time (data not shown). Thus, the molecule(s) does not appear to contain sulfate esters. Since these treatments failed to provide any structural information, we turned to the purification of larger amounts of nonradiolabeled material for direct chemical analysis. Human melanoma cells were grown in the presence of 1 m M XylβMU for 5 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To monitor purification and the completeness of sialidase and β-glucuronidase digestions of the nonradiolabeled material, 54,000 cpm of [3H]Gal-labeled β-xylosides with one negative charge were added to the culture medium at this point. This labeled tracer was purified from a separate batch of cells by C-18 and ion-exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex and a small portion was characterized by prior β-glucuronidase and sialidase digestions. This provided an estimate of the amount of the tracer material that should be resistant to the digestion in the mixture and, therefore, a measure of the expected yield. The flow chart in Fig. 1 shows the purification strategy based on the methods used to obtain the radiolabeled material. A combination of dialysis, C-18, and QAE-Sephadex anion-exchange chromatographies coupled with β-glucuronidase and sialidase digestions gave nearly the expected yields based on our previous results (9Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Google Scholar) and prior analysis of the radiolabeled tracer itself (see Table I). At this point, we could not determine the purity of the nonlabeled material in the preparation because its isolation was solely based on the use of the radioactive tracer.Table I:Recovery of 3 H-Gal radiolabeled anionic xylosides Open table in a new tab The monosaccharide composition of the preparation was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MU, Xyl, Gal, GlcA, and GalNH2were detected in molar ratios of 1.0:1.1:2.1:0.6:1.6. Stronger hydrolysis conditions (6 N trifluoroacetic acid, 18 h, 100°C) did not show the presence of any other monosaccharide. To further characterize the molecule, a portion of the sample was subjected to FAB-MS analysis in both positive ion and negative ion modes. These analyses indicated that the major component has a native molecular mass of 1011 (data not shown). The sample was then analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry in both negative and positive ion modes. The results in the negative ion mode (Fig. 2 A) showed a major pseudomolecular ion at m/z 1010 and minor peaks at m/z 1032 ([M - 2H− + Na−]−) and 1054 ([M - 3H− + 2Na−]−) resulting from the substitution with Na− ions (22 μm each). Detailed analysis of the structure of the minor components (peaks between 1068 and 1196 atomic mass units) is in progress. Fig. 2 B, shows the results in positive ion mode with the expected [M + H−]− (m/z 1012), [M + Na−]− (m/z 1034), and [M + 2Na− - H−]− (m/z 1056). Thus, the native molecular mass for the major component by electrospray mass spectrometry is 1011 and agrees with that obtained by FAB-MS. This mass is consistent with the following structure, HexNAc1HexA1Hex2Pent1MU1. Several other minor components were detected (less than 10% each): m/z 994, corresponding to HexNAc1Pent2MU1; m/z 818, corresponding to HexNAc1HexA1Pent2MU1; and m/z 747 and 769, corresponding to HexA1Pent3MU1pseudomolecular ion and its monosodiated form. Other fragments detected in the negative ion mode (Fig. 2 A) are consistent with the following structures: HexNAc1HexA1Hex2Pent1MU1(SO3H)1(m/z 1092, [M - H−]−; m/z 1114, [M - 2H− + Na−]−; m/z 1136, [M - 3H− + 2Na−]−), HexNAc1Pent3MU1(SO3H)1(m/z 1092 [M - H−]−; m/z 1114, [M - 2H− + Na−]−) and HexNAc1HexA1Hex2Pent1MU1(CH3)1(m/z 1068, [M - 3H− + 2Na−]−). This indicates that a pentasaccharide with the same primary structure as the major compound can be substituted with either a monosulfate ester, or a methyl ester (or ether) in some cases. Very little fragmentation of the major molecular ion is observed (m/z 806). The anionic xyloside mixture (sample I) was digested with a combination of β-glucuronidase and α- N-acetylgalactosaminidase and then separated into neutral (IA) and anionic (IB) fractions by QAE-Sephadex chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Electrospray analyses of these two fractions are shown in Fig. 2 C (xyloside IA, positive ion mode), and Fig. 2 D (xyloside IB, negative ion mode). Since these samples were analyzed after exchanging the hydroxyl protons with D2O for NMR analysis, and dissolved in H2O for electrospray analysis, partial deuteration leading to heterogeneity of individual peaks is observed. The two major ions seen in the neutral fraction shown in Fig. 2 C at m/z 657 and 331, are consistent with a primary structure containing Hex2Pent1MU1and Pent1MU1, respectively, where a proton has been substituted by sodium. The two corresponding pseudomolecular ions are observed at m/z 309 and 640. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of remaining anionic sample IB in the negative ion mode (Fig. 2 D) showed the presence of some remaining major product (m/z 1011). In addition, other pseudomolecular ions seen are consistent with the following structures: HexNAc1HexA1Hex1Pent1MU1(m/z 849, minor), HexA1Pent3MU1(m/z 747), HexNAc1HexA1Pent1MU1(m/z 687, major), HexA1Pent2MU1(m/z 615), and Pent1MU (m/z 307, major). Fragment ions arising from the cleavage of the N-acetylhexosamine glycosidic linkage are also observed at m/z 806 (1011-HexNAc), m/z 645 (849-HexNAc), and 483 (687-HexNAc). The minor novel MU glycans detected by electrospray mass spectrometry are listed in Table II.Table II:Minor novel MU glycons detected by electrospray mass spectrometry Open table in a new tab Because of the small amount of material available (estimated between 10 and 25 μg for the different samples analyzed), one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR analysis were carried out using a Nano-NMR probe containing 40 μl of the sample solution. The standard, 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin β-xyloside (XylβMU) was analyzed in the same fashion for comparison (Fig. Z1). 1H NMR data for 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin is available in the literature (17Sadtler Standard Spectra, Proton NMR Spectra, Spectrum #3220, M. Sadtler Research Laboratories, Inc., Philadelphia, PA.Google Scholar). The one-dimensional 1H NMR of XylβMU was recorded in Me2SO- d6. The signals corresponding to the methyl and aromatic hydrogens were readily assigned as indicated in Table III. The anomeric signal of the β-xyloside appears at δ 5.045. This represents a downfield shift of 1.132 ppm relative to the anomeric resonance of a terminal non-reducing β-xylose residue linked to OH-3 of an underlying mannose residue, recorded in the same solvent (18Davrowski U. Davrowski J. Grosskurth H. von der Lieth C-W. Ogawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1057-1065Google Scholar). However, not all of the expected signals were found in the one-dimensional spectrum. Only two sharp doublets at δ 3.364 and 3.770, and two broad signals at δ 5.37 and 5.10, corresponding to hydroxyl protons, were observed. These signals were resolved by a combination of two-dimensional DQFCOSY and TOCSY experiments (not shown) run at different temperatures (between 22°C and 65°C). In this way, the remaining resonances overlapping the residual HOD peak could be assigned. The DQFCOSY experiment showed the expected coupling between the aromatic protons d and e, and between the aromatic proton b and the methyl proton in the coumarin ring. The DQFCOSY spectrum also located the Xyl H-2 signal at 3.24 ppm, which represents a downfield shift of 0.2 ppm relative to the value reported in Ref. 2. The broad doublets at δ 5.100 and 5.370 were assigned to OH-3 and OH-2, respectively, on the basis of their coupling with H-1, H-2, and H-3. From the analysis of the connectivities of these hydroxyl groups it was also evident that the signal of H-3 is superimposed to that of H-2 (δ 3.24). Thus the signal at δ 3.364 was assigned to Xyl H-4, and that at δ 3.770 to Xyl H-eq. H-5ax in a β-linked xylose is expected to produce a doublet of doublets slightly downfield from the H-2 resonance. The TOCSY spectrum showed a correlation between H-4 and a signal at δ 3.260 that was assigned to H-5ax. The TOCSY spectrum also showed a cross-peak between H-4 and a signal overlapped to H-1, this signal most likely corresponds to OH-4. It has to be pointed out that a downfield shift of 0.17-0.35 ppm from the values obtained in D2O was reported when using Me2SO as the solvent (18Davrowski U. Davrowski J. Grosskurth H. von der Lieth C-W. Ogawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1057-1065Google Scholar). The assignments of the proton resonances in the xylose ring (with the exception of H-1 and H-2, deprotected by the aromatic ring) correspond very well with the reported assignments for a 4-substituted methyl xyloside which spectra were also obtained in Me2SO- d6at 30°C (19Rivera-Sagredo A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Martin-Lomas M. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 221: 37-47Google Scholar).Table III:1H chemical shifts of the constituent monosacharides of compounds I, IA, and IB and the reference compound MU b-Xyloside.Chemical shifts are given in ppm downfield from 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate Open table in a new tab Chemical shifts are given in ppm downfield from 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum obtaine"

The levels of HMG1 mRNA and protein in cells overexpressing HMG1 protein were enhanced about 7- and 3-fold, respectively, in comparison with control cells, whereas those in cells overexpressing HMG2 protein were enhanced about 17- and 9-fold. The expression of reporter genes transfected into the cells was enhanced approximately 2-fold in cells overexpressing HMG1, but not HMG2, in comparison with those in control cells, irrespective of the sources of the genes and promoters. The minichromosome derived from the reporter plasmid in cells overexpressing HMG1 protein was more susceptible to micrococcal nuclease digestion than those in cells overexpressing HMG2 protein and control cells. The enhanced accessibility to micrococcal nuclease was not restricted to the expressing gene and promoter but involved the entire minichromosome, suggesting that the enhancement of gene expression resulted from changes in the condensation of the entire minichromosomal region by HMG1 protein. Minichromosomes in cells overexpressing HMG contained enhanced amounts of the respective HMG proteins and simultaneously reduced amounts of histone H1s. These results suggest that HMG1 and −2 proteins have different functions in the modulation of chromatin structure, and that HMG1 protein may sustain the structure of the respective gene to ensure that its activity as a template is expressed fully.

https://openalex.org/W2016643526,"Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) contains three disulfides and 53 amino acids. Reduced/denatured EGF refolds spontaneously in vitro to acquire its native structure. The mechanism of this folding process has been elucidated by structural analysis of both acid and iodoacetate trapped intermediates. The results reveal that the folding is accompanied by a sequential flow of unfolded EGF (0-disulfide) through three groups of folding intermediates, namely 1-disulfide, 2-disulfide, and 3-disulfide (scrambled) EGF isomers, to reach the native structure. Equilibrium occurs among isomers of each class of disulfide species, and the composition of intermediates appears to be highly heterogeneous. Together, at least 27 fractions of folding intermediates have been identified, but there exist only limited numbers of well populated species which constitute more than 80% of the total intermediates found during EGF folding.Six species of such well populated intermediates have been isolated, which included two 1-S-S, two 2-S-S, and two 3-S-S scrambled species. Their disulfide structures have been identified here. Both 1-S-S isomers are found to contain non-native disulfides. One of the 2-S-S species consists of two non-native disulfides and the other admits two native disulfides. Among the six disulfides of the two scrambled species, only one is native. Together, native disulfides constitute 25% of the total disulfides found in these six well populated intermediates. These results contrast sharply to those observed with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, which has shown that well populated folding intermediates consist of exclusively native disulfides (Weissman, J. S., and Kim, P. S. (1991) Science 253, 1386-1393). We propose that well populated folding intermediates, regardless of whether they contain native or non-native disulfides, do not necessarily represent the productive species and specify the folding pathway.Furthermore, conditions influencing the efficiency of EGF folding have been investigated. It is demonstrated here that under optimized compositions of redox agents, including the use of cysteine/cystine and protein disulfide isomerase, the in vitro folding of EGF could be achieved quantitatively within 1 min.

J. 1990; 270: 1-16Google Scholar) and ribonuclease A (Creighton, 1979Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 411-431Google Scholar; Konishi et al., 1981Konishi Y. Ooi T. Scheraga H.A.

In the case of BPTI, eight (including native) disulfide-bonded intermediates out of 75 possible species were initially described (Creighton, 1978Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 231-297Google Scholar; Creighton and Goldenberg, 1984Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-524Google Scholar). Some of those well populated 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates appeared to contain non-native disulfides and were proposed to be involved in the process of folding. This original BPTI model was recently re-examined using modern separation and analytical methodologies. In that study (Weissman and Kim, 1991Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Google Scholar), it was concluded that all well populated folding intermediates consisted of only native disulfide bonds. Raging debates ensued as a consequence of these discrepancies (Creighton, 1992Creighton T.E. Science. 1992; 256: 111-112Google Scholar; Weissman and Kim, 1992Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1992; 256: 112-114Google Scholar), and discussions are focused mainly upon the importance of intermediates containing non-native disulfides. In those studies, however, no non-native 3-disulfide intermediates have been described. bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor recombinant human epidermal growth factor reduced glutathione oxidized glutathione cysteine cystine matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization guanidinium chloride high performance liquid chromatography phenylthiohydantoin. On the contrary, kinetically trapped non-native 3-disulfide (scrambled) intermediates were detected and characterized in recent studies of recombinant hirudin (Chatrenet and Chang, 1992Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3038-3043Google Scholar, Chatrenet and Chang, 1993Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Google Scholar) and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (Chang et al., 1994Chang J.-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Google Scholar). They were found reproducibly in high concentrations and were observed under a wide range of folding conditions, including those favorable conditions which permit regeneration of the native protein to be completed within 30 s. Furthermore, the level of accumulation of the scrambled species has been shown to depend upon the redox potential applied and thus could be experimentally manipulated (Chang, 1994Chang J.-Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-650Google Scholar). In one case, more than 98% of the total sample was found to be trapped as scrambled intermediates before trace amount of the native structure even appeared (Chang et al., 1994Chang J.-Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Google Scholar). These findings indicate that scrambled proteins may play an essential role along the pathway of productive folding. This proposal, however, contradicts conventional wisdom which considers scrambled species as abortive structures of “off-pathway” folding. One may further suggest that the presence of scrambled intermediates is not a general phenomenon and represents only isolated, unusual cases for hirudin and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor. In order to clarify these uncertainties, studies on disulfide folding pathway using other comparable proteins are required. In this report, we use recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is also a small, compact protein (53 amino acid residues), and like hirudin, contains only antiparallel β-sheet and no α-helix (Carver et al., 1986Carver J.A. Cooke R.M. Esposito G. Campbell I.D. Gregory H. Sheard B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 77-81Google Scholar; Montelione et al., 1987Montelione G.T. Wuethrich K. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5226-5230Google Scholar), as an example to study the behavior of folding intermediates and confirm the formation of non-native 3-disulfide in-termediates during folding. We also examine conditions that enhance the efficiency of EGF folding. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was derived from Escherichia coli. Cells and was supplied by Protein Institute Inc., Broomall, PA. The purity was greater than 98% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal sequence analysis. The recombinant EGF is fully biological active when compared with standards. Reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cys-Cys), thermolysin (P-1512), and Glu-C protease were obtained from Sigma. Protein disulfide isomerase (number 7318) was purchased from Takara, Kyoto, Japan. Control foldings are those performed either in Tris-HCl buffer alone (control -) or in the same buffer containing 0.25 m M of 2-mercaptoethanol (control +). Results of control foldings serve as standards for measuring the efficiencies of EGF folding in the presence of various redox agents. EGF (1.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.5) containing 5 M of GdmCl and 30 m M of dithiothreitol. Reduction and denaturation of EGF was carried out at 22°C for 90 min. To initiate the folding, the sample was passed through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. Desalting took about 1 min and unfolded EGF was recovered in 1.1 ml, which was immediately diluted with the same Tris-HCl buffer to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, both in the absence (control -) and presence (control +) of 0.25 m M 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding intermediates were trapped in a time course manner by mixing aliquots of the sample with an equal volume of (a) 4% trifluoroacetic acid in water (reversible trapping) or (b) 0.4 M iodoacetic acid in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.5) (irreversible trapping). In the case of iodoacetate trapping, carboxymethylation was performed at 22°C for 30 min, followed by desalting using the PD-10 column. Trapped folding intermediates were separated by HPLC. The procedures of unfolding and refolding are as those described in the control folding experiments. Selected concentrations of redox agents or denaturants were introduced immediately after unfolded EGF was desalted through the PD-10 column. Folding intermediates were trapped reversibly or irreversibly as those described above. Six fractions of well populated intermediates (I-A, I-B, II-A, II-B, III-A, and III-B), derived from the “control -” folding and trapped by iodoacetate, were isolated for structural analysis. 1-Disulfide intermediates (I-A and I-B) (3 μg) were digested with 0.3 μg of Glu-C protease or trypsin in 30 μl of ammonium bicarbonate solution (50 m M, pH 8.0) for 16 h at 23°C. In this case, fully reduced carboxymethylated EGF was processed in parallel as a control. The samples were then acidified with an equal volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid and directly subjected to automatic sequencing. 2- and 3-disulfide intermediates (~30 μg) were treated with 3 μg of thermolysin in 100 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 m M, pH 6.4). Digestion was carried out at 23°C for 16 h. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. Amino analysis was performed with the dabsyl chloride precolumn derivatization method (Chang and Knecht, 1991Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 52-58Google Scholar), which permits direct evaluation of the disulfide (cystine) content. Amino acid sequencing was done with either an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer or a Hewlett-Packard G-1000A sequencer. The digests of I-A and I-B were mainly analyzed by the HP sequencer, because it gives more reliable quantitation on the recovery of PTH-Cys(Cm). Cystine-containing peptides were mostly analyzed by the ABI instrument. An internal standard, 2-nitroacetophenone, which eluted in between PTH-His and PTH-Tyr was introduced in order to ensure precise quantitation of PTH derivatives (Ramseier and Chang, 1994Ramseier U. Chang J.-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 231-233Google Scholar). It was predissolved in the solvent (2 μM) which transfers PTH derivatives from the conversion flask to the HPLC. During the analysis of cystine containing peptides, a unique signal di-PTH-cystine appeared when both half-cystines were recovered in the same degradation cycle (Haniu et al., 1994Haniu M. Acklin C. Kenney W. Rohde M.F. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 43: 81-86Google Scholar). di-PTH-cystine is eluted near PTH-Tyr, but can be easily distinguished from the tyrosine derivative by an additional absorbance at 313 nm. The MALDI mass spectrometer was a home-built time of flight instrument with a nitrogen laser of 337-nm wavelength and 3-ns pulse width. The apparatus has been described in detail elsewhere (Boernsen et al., 1990Boernsen K.O. Schaer M. Widmer M. Chimia. 1990; 44: 412-416Google Scholar). The calibration was performed either externally or internally, by using standard proteins (hypertensin, Mr1031.19; synacthen, Mr2934.50 and calcitonin, Mr3418.91). Analysis of the iodoacetate-trapped folding intermediates is further explained in the legend of Fig. 1. The biological activity of recombinant EGF was compared with the standard recombinant EGF using the assay method described (Savage et al., 1973Savage Jr., C.R. Hash J.H. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7669-7672Google Scholar). The ED50as determined by the dose-dependent stimulation of thymidine uptake by Balb/c 3T3 cells is 2.0 ng/ml. Refolded EGF was compared with a standard sample by an HPLC stability-indicating assay. The fully biological active EGF samples and standard were assayed by reversed phase HPLC described in the legend of Fig. 2. Refolded native EGF is assessed by comparing their HPLC with that of the standard. Folding intermediates of EGF were first analyzed for their disulfide contents in order to evaluate the rate of disulfide formation during the folding. This was done with amino acid composition analysis (Chang and Knecht, 1991Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 52-58Google Scholar). Two sets of samples obtained from the folding experiments performed in the absence (control -) and presence (control +) of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.25 m M) were analyzed. The results showed that: (a) the decrease of cysteine (detected in the form of carboxymethylcysteine) was quantitatively accounted for by the recovery of disulfide, and (b) the rate of total disulfide recovery remained indistinguishable regardless of whether the folding was carried out in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. In both experiments, three intact disulfides formed after 24 h of folding (data not shown). The data for Cys/Cys-Cys composition played a crucial role in the identification of scrambled EGF. It was subsequently revealed by HPLC analysis that the yield of native EGF was indeed dependent upon the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, or Cys, or reduced glutathione, the formation of three disulfide bonds was accompanied by the quantitative recovery of native EGF. Without 2-mercapto-ethanol, about 45% of the 3-disulfide EGF were trapped as species distinguishable from the native one (see Fig. 2, 24-h samples). These trapped EGF species are scrambled non-native 3-disulfide species. Folding intermediates of EGF were further characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry in order to determine the concentrations of disulfide species presented in the intermediates. The results were obtained from samples folded in the buffer alone (control -) and trapped by iodoacetic acid. The data (Fig. 1) demonstrate a sequential flow of unfolded EGF through 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates to the 3-disulfide species. The high level of accumulation of 2-disulfide intermediates indicated that the conversion of 2-disulfide species to 3-disulfide species constituted one of the major rate-limiting steps of EGF folding. The 24-h folded sample was shown to contain virtually only 3-disulfide species which further confirmed that the non-native species trapped in the 24-h sample (Fig. 2) are the scrambled EGF. Folding intermediates of EGF were analyzed by HPLC. The raw data, presented in Fig. 2, were obtained from the samples of control - experiment trapped either by acid (right column) or by iodoacetic acid (left column). In order to be able to interpret these chromatograms, structural information of the fractionated intermediates was required. Therefore, 18 fractions of intermediates were first isolated from the 30-min iodoacetate-trapped sample (Fig. 3) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Concentrations of disulfide species presented in each of those fractions are given in Fig. 4. The results revealed that this sample comprised a minimum of seven 1-disulfide isomers and 13 2-disulfide isomers. Most 1-disulfide species eluted at fractions 16 (I-A) and 17 (I-B) and 2-disulfide species mostly accumulated within fractions 3 (II-A) and 6 (II-B). Similar analysis of the 7-h and 48-h samples (Fig. 3) showed that fractions 4 (III-A) and 5 (III-B) contained predominantly (>92%) 3-disulfide scrambled species. The three groups of intermediates were extensively overlapped, but predominant fractions of these three disulfide species were fortunately well separated. It was also apparent that along the folding process, equilibrium existed among isomers of each disulfide species. For instance, the concentration of 2-disulfide intermediates ascended and then descended as folding progressed, but the relative ratio of fractions 3, 6, and 7 (which contained exclusively 2-disulfide species) remained constant. Scrambled 3-disulfide species and 1-disulfide species behaved similarly during the folding.Figure 4:Analysis by mass spectrometry of folding intermediates of EGF isolated by HPLC. Eighteen fractions were isolated from the 30-min sample (trapped by iodoacetate) (see Fig. 3) and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry in order to determine the disulfide species contained in each fraction. The content of disulfide species is determined by the mass peak height and expressed as percentage in each fraction. The data should be allowed a standard deviation of ± 10%. Fractions 4 and 5 contain only minute amounts of intermediates and are shown to be comprised of about 50% each of 2-disulfide and 3-disulfide (scrambled) species. A separate analysis of the 7-h trapped sample shows that fractions 4 and 5 contain predominantly (>90%) 3-disulfide species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data demonstrated that the folding pathway of EGF was characterized by a sequential flow of unfolded EGF (R) through three groups of equilibrated intermediates, namely, 1-disulfide, 2-disulfide, and 3-disulfide (scrambled) isomers. With the control - folding experiment, 45% of the folding intermediates were stuck as scrambled species (see Fig. 2, 24-h sample), unable to convert to the native EGF due to the lack of free thiols to catalyze their disulfide reshuffling. This problem was overcome by including 2-mercaptoethanol (data not shown) in the folding buffer, in which recoveries of native EGF were found to be greater than 96% after 24 h of folding. The HPLC profiles of acid-trapped intermediates (Fig. 2, right column) did not fully resemble those of iodoacetate-trapped counterparts. Notably, most acid-trapped 2-disulfide species were eluted under the same fraction (the peak marked as II). Thus, interpretation of EGF folding based on the analysis of acid-trapped samples can be very tricky. The predominance of a single peak containing 2-disulfide species can easily mislead to the simplification that folding of EGF undergoes only one species of 2-disulfide intermediates. The pattern of the 24-h acid-trapped sample is indistinguishable from that of iodoacetate-trapped sample, because both contained only 3-disulfide EGF. This can be achieved by a number of strategies. The most common one is “peptide mapping.” This requires isolation and analysis of every enzyme fragmented peptides, as will be shown in the following section. Alternatively, it can be done by selective labeling of disulfide bonds (after reduction) with a color (Chang, 1993Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4043-4049Google Scholar) or fluorescent thiol-specific reagents (Weissman and Kim, 1991Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Google Scholar). Both methods need microgram amounts of the intermediates, HPLC separation of peptides, and numerous attempts of sequence analysis. The most sensitive and effective method, however, is to take the advantage of modern Edman chemistry and the known sequence of EGF by direct sequencing of the peptide mixture of 1-disulfide intermediates. This strategy is sketched in Fig. 5 and described as follows: 1) select an enzyme that will produce a mixture of peptides, with all cysteines located at different positions in the peptide sequences; 2) subject the peptide mixture to automatic sequencing and quantitate recoveries of PTH-Cys(Cm) at expected cycles of Edman degradation. Cysteines which are not involved in disulfide pairings will be recovered as PTH-Cys(Cm), and those engaged in the disulfide linking will generate a blank gap; 3) compare the results obtained from the folding intermediates to that of control sample (fully reduced carboxymethylated EGF). This method requires low picomoles (nanograms) of samples, no HPLC separation of peptides and basically only one sequence analysis for each intermediate. For EGF, such peptide mixtures could be generated by either trypsin or Glu-C protease digestion (Fig. 5). The sequencing data obtained from the analysis of Glu-C digests are given in Fig. 6. It shows unambiguously that I-A and I-B contain Cys14-Cys24and Cys6-Cys14, respectively, both are non-native disulfides (Fig. 8). The results obtained from trypsin digests are equally conclusive (data not shown).Figure 8:Disulfide structures of six well populated folding intermediates of EGF. The arrows do not imply the direct conversion between the indicated species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The choice of methods for elucidating the disulfide structures of 2- and 3-disulfide intermediates is limited to the technique of peptide mapping. In this approach, selection of enzymes is critical. The digestion should be carried out at neutral or acidic pH and allow at least partial cleavage at peptide bonds between all neighboring cysteines. Thermolysin has been found to be an ideal enzyme for this purpose. Peptides were separated by HPLC (Fig. 7). Distinctions between cystine- and non-cystine-containing peptides can be generally recognized. Those which do not appear constantly in all mappings most likely contain disulfides. All peptides were analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. Crucial data which permit assignments of disulfide pairings are presented in Table I. Two cystine peptides, with nearly equal recoveries and corresponding to two native disulfides, Cys14-Cys31and Cys33-Cys42, were found in II-A-7 and II-A-12, respectively. Despite the shoulder peak of II-A-12, sequence and mass analysis have revealed no contaminants of minor sequences. The two disulfide bonds of species II-B were also found in two major peaks. II-B-15 consisted of three peptides linked by two disulfide bridges, which could be oriented in a combination of either Cys14-Cys33/Cys24-Cys31or Cys14-Cys31/Cys24-Cys33. The finding of Cys14-Cys33in peak II-B-7 confirms that the former structure is the correct one. In this intermediate, both disulfides are non-native. Scrambled EGFs are 3-disulfide species. For III-A, the disulfides were detected in five peaks. Cys14-Cys33and Cys24-Cys31were identified in III-A-5 and III-A-10 (Table I). Cys6-Cys42was found in three different peaks (III-A-13, III-A-15, and III-A-17), due to nonspecific cleavages by thermolysin. In III-A, all disulfides are non-native. III-B is the most predominant scrambled species. Its three disulfides were recovered in four major peaks. Cys24-Cys31was found in III-B-2 and Cys33-Cys42was detected in III-B-8. The third disulfide of III-B, Cys6-Cys14, was found in III-B-14 as well as the tailing shoulder (right-hand) of III-B-11 (Table I). For all four well populated intermediates, there is no evidence of contamination of minor species (<10%). The results of their disulfide structures are summarized in Fig. 8.Table I:Structures of the disulfide containing peptides derived from the well populated folding intermediates of EGF Open table in a new tab Two systems of redox agents, GSH/GSSG and Cys/Cys-Cys were evaluated here. The effect of GSH was found to be similar to that of 2-mercaptoethanol which was to promote the conversion of scrambled EGF to the native EGF. In achieving this, it neither accelerated the flow of intermediates between unfolded species and scrambled species nor altered the patterns of intermediates compositions. The only obvious difference between those performed with and without GSH was the level of accumulation of scrambled species and the recovery of native EGF. Without GSH (control -), about 50% of EGF was trapped as scrambled species. In the presence of GSH, the yield of native EGF was nearly quantitative after 24 h of folding. GSSG played a different role. It enhanced the flow of intermediates between 0-disulfide EGF and scrambled species and as a consequence also accelerated the recovery of native EGF during the early phase of folding. In the presence of 0.5 m M of GSSG, the only detectable intermediates after 3 h of folding were scrambled species, and a substantial portion of scrambled EGF also become trapped, unable to convert to the native EGF even after 24 h of folding under these conditions. By including a mixture of GSH/GSSG in the folding solution, both the flow of intermediates and the conversion of scrambled EGF to the native EGF were accelerated. Under these conditions, folding of EGF was achieved quantitatively within 4 h. Cys/Cys-Cys also regulated the folding of EGF through a similar mechanism, except that it is more potent than the GSH/GSSG system. Direct comparison of the Cys-Cys and GSSG indicated that the former was about 5-10-fold more effective (at equal molar basis) in promoting the flow of intermediates to the 3-disulfide states (Fig. 9). In another experiment, it was demonstrated that trapped scrambled EGF species were able to reshuffle their mismatched disulfides to acquire the native structure within 1 h when 1 m M of Cys was introduced. Along this process of reorganization (consolidation), scrambled species remained in equilibrium. The above findings suggested that both the speed of EGF folding and the recovery of native EGF could be greatly improved under optimized compositions of redox agents. To demonstrate this potential, unfolded EGF was refolded in the Tris-HCl buffer containing 4 M sodium chloride and in the presence of the following redox systems: (a) GSH/GSSG (4 m M/2 m M); (b) Cys/Cys-Cys (4 m M/2 m M), and (c) Cys/Cys-Cys (4 m M/2 m M) plus protein disulfide isomerase (40 μM). Selection of these conditions was intended to (a) allow head-on comparison of the potencies between the GSH/GSSG and Cys/Cys-Cys systems and (b) assess the efficacy of protein disulfide isomerase (Epstein et al., 1963Epstein C.J. Goldberger R.F. Anfinsen C.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 439-449Google Scholar; Freedman, 1984Freedman R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 438-441Google Scholar; Bulleid, 1993Bulleid N.J. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1993; 44: 125-150Google Scholar). The outcome was judged by the rate of the recovery of native EGF. It revealed that Cys/Cys-Cys was 10-fold more effective than GSH/GSSG in promoting the formation of native EGF. The improvement was multiplied by another 7-fold when 40 μM of protein disulfide isomerase was added. Under these optimized conditions, folding of EGF completed within one minute (Fig. 10). Denaturants (8 M urea or 5 M GdmCl) were included in the folding buffer in order to examine their effects on the folding mechanism of EGF. EGF was allowed to refold in the presence of 8 M urea without or with 0.25 m M of 2-mercaptoethanol (8 M urea - and 8 M urea +). These two experiments were repeated in the presence of 5 M GdmCl (5 M GdmCl - and 5 M GdmCl +). Folding intermediates were trapped by iodoacetic acid and analyzed by HPLC. T"

NPM is implicated in a range of diverse cellular functions, but its role in apoptosis is unclear. The physiological process of apoptosis is a ubiquitous mechanism for the regulation of tissue homeostasis, embryogenesis, and immune system maturation (1Kerr J.F. Winterford C.M. Harmon B.V.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. B. 1994; 345: 237-241Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be induced by both physiological and nonphysiological means and has been shown to require specific gene transcription and new protein synthesis in many but not all cells. However, in either case, the apoptotic process is the same. Although there are a few exceptions (e.g. lack of frequent DNA strand breaks (5Falcieri E. Martelli A.M. Bareggi R. Cataldi A. Cocco L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 19-25Google Scholar, 6Ucker D.S. Obermiller P.S. Eckhart W. Apgar J.R. Berger N.A. Meyers J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3060-3069Google Scholar)), apoptosis results in a series of morphological and biochemical events characterized by chromatin condensation and margination, cell shrinkage, internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, and budding of membrane-bound vesicles (7Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar, 8Cotter T.G. Lennon S.V. Glynn J.G. Martin S.J. Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 1153-1159Google Scholar, 9Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R.

Furthermore, the kinase inhibitor staurosporine has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (11Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1899-1910Google Scholar, 12Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Google Scholar). Based on these extensive similarities, it would appear that there is a common pathway(s) of apoptotic induction. There have been an enormous number of descriptive studies of apoptosis in specific cell types that are related to the initial triggering events. This is in contrast with the fewer studies on the downstream effector processes that control the apoptotic cascade described above. Many studies into the molecular mechanism of apoptosis have concentrated on either specific gene products implicated in apoptosis (and their protein-protein interactions) or enzyme activities (kinases or endonucleases) often in mixed populations of nonapoptotic and apoptotic cells. Although some agents do induce apoptosis en masse, the induction is often cell-cycle phase dependent, and consequently only a fraction of the cell culture population is undergoing apoptosis synchronously. Several authors have reported that an early event in apoptosis of cultured cells (13Yamada T. Ohyama H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1980; 37: 695-699Google Scholar, 14Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 109: 78-87Google Scholar, 15Martin S.J. Bradley J.G. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp.

Thus, for some cells, density gradient separation provides a convenient means of separating out a pure population of cells at a similar stage of apoptosis, even when the culture contains only a low percentage of apoptotic cells.

In most systems, mixed non-apoptotic and apoptotic cells were examined, increasing the complexity of the analysis. However, in only one of these studies (19Robaye B. Doskeland A.P. Suarez-Huerta N. Doskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 503-510Google Scholar) was a pure population of apoptotic cells (those that became detached from a monolayer) compared with control cells, and in that case the cells were prelabeled with radioisotope. Extended prelabeling restricts the analysis to proteins with longer half-lives as they incorporate relatively more label than those with shorter half-lives and does not reveal whether any active protein synthesis occurs during apoptosis. However, Baxter and Lavin (24Baxter G.D. Lavin M.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1949-1954Google Scholar) examined two different cell lines with the same two apoptotic inducers, revealing a single common apoptotic-dependent dephosphorylation event. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescence-activated cell sorter fetal bovine serum matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry the protein product of the NPM gene also known as numatrin, B23, NO38, and nucleophosmin proliferating cell nuclear antigen high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline. We are interested in the putative common apoptotic induction pathway and have utilized high resolution two-dimensional PAGE to search for changes in protein synthesis/degradation (turnover) that are common between two different inducers of apoptosis. We used metabolic labeling as a sensitive measure of subtle protein turnover changes that are unable to be revealed by analysis of total protein levels, e.g. by prelabeling of the cells, immunoblotting, or general protein staining. Two separate stimuli, both of which have been shown to induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cell lines, were chosen for these studies. Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase at low concentrations, has been shown to induce apoptosis in both CEM-C7 cells (25Bansal N. Houle A.G. Melnykovych G. Leuk. Res. 1989; 13: 875-882Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (26Perez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1209-1215Google Scholar). Bazar and Deeg (27Bazar L.S. Deeg H.J. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 80-86Google Scholar) demonstrated the apoptotic induction of Jurkat cells using 5 m M EGTA for 24 h. As our interest lies in the putative common apoptotic induction pathway, these two diverse stimuli were chosen. The experimental paradigm involved comparison of the protein turnover between untreated cells and a pure population of apoptotic cells obtained by density gradient centrifugation. In this report, we show that apoptotic Jurkat cells can be metabolically labeled with methionine/cysteine and that there is no extensive proteolysis in those cells. In addition, we have identified one of the few proteins that showed a change in turnover (down-regulation) using quantitative analysis. The identified protein was numatrin/B23/nucleophosmin (NPM), which is a ubiquitous nucleolar phosphoprotein that displays a number of activities. These include a potential role as a positive regulator of cell proliferation (i.e. it is dramatically increased in tumorigenic cells (28Feuerstein N. Chan P.K. Mond J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10608-10612Google Scholar) and decreased upon growth arrest (29Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1818-1822Google Scholar)) and possibly a role in ribosomal assembly and processing, based on its localization in the granular region of the nucleolus (30Spector D.L. Ochs R.L. Busch H. Chromosoma. 1984; 90: 139-148Google Scholar), among other identified activities. It is yet to be ascertained whether NPM plays a role in the induction of apoptosis or is merely affected as a consequence of apoptotic induction. Cell culture reagents RPMI 1640, L-methionine-free and sodium phosphate-free RPMI 1640, dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), and streptomycin/penicillin were from Life Technologies, Inc., and FBS (characterized) was from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). EXPRE35S35S-[35S]methionine/cysteine mix (>1000 Ci/m M), and [32P]orthophosphate (∼9000 Ci/m M) were from DuPont NEN. Lovastatin was a gift from A. W. Alberts (Merck) and was prepared by conversion of the lactone form to the sodium salt as described (31Mumby S.M. Buss J.E. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1990; 1: 216-220Google Scholar). EGTA and Percoll were from Sigma. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available. Jurkat T-lymphoblasts (Clone E6-1, ATCC TIB 152) were cultured in 90% RPMI 1640, 10% FBS (characterized), supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin, and maintained at a concentration between 105and 106cells/ml in a humidified incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2at 37°C. Following chelator (EGTA) or drug (lovastatin) treatment, PBS-washed cells were layered in 30% Percoll RPMI 1640 on top of a discontinuous gradient with increasing concentrations (10% each step) of Percoll in RPMI to 100% as described (32Hamblin A.S. O'Garra A.O. Klas G.G.B. Lymphocytes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd, Oxford1987: 209-228Google Scholar). Healthy cells (normal buoyant density) banded between the 40 and 50% layers while the apoptotic cells (increased buoyant density) banded between the 50 and 60% layers. Following centrifugation at 400 × g for 30 min, cells were washed in PBS and RPMI 1640 prior to metabolic labeling, preparation for DNA separation, flow cytometry, or laser confocal microscopy. DNA was isolated and separated according to Lennon et al. (33Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Google Scholar). Briefly this involved lysis of the cells, incubation with RNase A, and followed by phenol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction. The high and low molecular weight DNA was separated by centrifugation, precipitated with ethanol overnight, and quantitated by spectrofluorimetry. The DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel in Tris boric acid EDTA buffer and visualized by UV fluorescence after staining the gels with ethidium bromide. Flow cytometry (FACS) was conducted following ethanol fixation, RNase digestion, and propidium iodide incubation as described (34Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities of the samples were measured by quantitative flow cytometry using an EPICS C system (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL). Cells were prepared for microscopy using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) by fixation in 2% formaldehyde, permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, and staining with propidium iodide, with images being generated as described by O'Keefe et al. (35O'Keefe R.T. Henderson S.C. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1095-1110Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of cells was conducted as follows. For [35S]methionine/cysteine, the labeling medium was 90% methionine-free RPMI 1640, 10% dialyzed FBS; for [32P]orthophosphate labeling, cells were preincubated for 30 min in 90% phosphate-free RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS (characterized) prior to addition of the radiolabel for 3 h. Metabolically labeled samples were prepared as described by Garrels and Franza (36Garrels J.I. Franza Jr., B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5283-5298Google Scholar) except as noted (37Patterson S.D. Latter G.I. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1076-1083Google Scholar). For nuclei enrichment and postnuclear supernatant preparation, the PBS-washed cells were resuspended in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.03 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in a microfuge tube on ice. The cells were then passaged through a 28-gauge needle several times and centrifuged at low speed (325 × g) for 2 min to pellet the nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed once with the same buffer and once with PBS prior to lysis with a boiling SDS containing Tris buffer and treatment with DNase/RNase (38Patterson S.D. Garrels J.I. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 249-257Google Scholar). High resolution two-dimensional PAGE was performed according to previously published procedures (39Garrels J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 411-423Google Scholar), with modifications noted (37Patterson S.D. Latter G.I. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1076-1083Google Scholar) by the Two-Dimensional Gel Laboratory Core Facility at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. For [35S]methionine/cysteine and [32P]orthophosphate, 500,000 and 100,000 dpm of precipitable counts of material was loaded per gel, respectively (<10 μg total protein). A broad range first-dimensional gel generating a pH gradient of approximately 3.5-7.5 and a second dimension gel of 10% acrylamide was used for all experiments reported here. The gels were dried immediately following electrophoresis and imaged using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000TM(Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) (37Patterson S.D. Latter G.I. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1076-1083Google Scholar). Preparative two-dimensional gels (2D Investigator, Millipore, MA) loaded with 500-1000 μg of total protein were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm) in Tris-glycine/10% methanol (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) for 45 min using a Genie electroblotter (Idea Scientific, MN). Following blotting and rinsing with deionized water, the blots were briefly stained with Amido Black (0.1% in methanol/acetic acid) and destained in water. The spots of interest were excised and stored in water at −20°C. The collected spots were then processed for tryptic digestion as described by Aebersold et al. (41Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Google Scholar, 42Aebersold R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 71-88Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18column (300 Å, 5 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm) using a 1090L system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Column effluent was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions were collected manually and stored at −80°C until sequence analysis. Sequence analysis was conducted by Dr. R. Kobayashi (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) using a 470A sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Micropreparative two-dimensional PAGE gels were run as for the analytical gels, except that a larger diameter IEF gel tube of 0.065 inches in diameter was used, and 50 μg of unlabeled whole cell lysate supplemented with 500,000 dpm of labeled cell lysate was loaded. Transfer to nitrocellulose was performed as described above. The blot was blocked and then incubated with appropriately diluted primary antisera and detected using enzyme-conjugated horse anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)′2followed by chemiluminescent detection using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). The monospecific antisera used were raised against numatrin/B23/nucleophosmin (kindly provided by Dr. M. Olsen, University of Mississippi Medical Center, MI) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (43Brand S.R. Bernstein R.M. Mathews M.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4120-4128Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Drs. S. Brand and M. Mathews, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Protein for matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was isolated following preparative two-dimensional PAGE as described above but with blotting to Immobilon-CD and subsequent staining with QuickStain (Zoion Research, MA) (44Hess D. Covey T.C. Winz R. Brownsey R.W. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1342-1351Google Scholar). Limited cyanogen bromide cleavage/elution (1 M CNBr in 70% formic acid for 5 min) was performed on a single protein spot in a volume of 5 μl, sufficient to cover the diced and five times alkaline methanol (20 m M Tris, pH 9.0, 50% methanol)-washed membrane pieces. One-third of this digest was mixed with 10 μl of matrix (5 mg/ml α-cyano 4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CHCl3/MeOH (2:2:5)), and 1 μl was applied to the probe. A Kompact MALDI III (Kratos Analytical, Ramsey, NJ) kindly made available by Kratos Analytical was used for this analysis. The spectra were obtained in positive ion mode with 20 kV accelerating voltage and externally calibrated using the dehydrated matrix ion (MH+ 172.1) and myoglobin (MH+16951). Analysis of the radiolabeled two-dimensional PAGE patterns was conducted utilizing the Quest II software system described by Monardo et al. (45Monardo P.J. Boutell T. Garrels J.I. Latter G.I. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 137-143Google Scholar). The analysis procedure details have been described elsewhere (46Garrels J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5269-5282Google Scholar). Storage phosphoimages obtained as described above were used for the quantitative analysis. These digital images were then background subtracted and smoothed. Spots were detected and fitted with gaussians, and the spots were then matched to corresponding spots in images to be compared. The spot volumes were calculated in parts/million as a fraction of the sample loaded on the gel. There is then an additional normalization adjustment in each gel to make the average ratio of spot parts/million values closer to 1.0. In our case, this normalization was performed with the highest quality (quality 4) spots of which there were over 250 that matched on all four gels. There were over 750 valid spots on all four gels. We considered only spots that were greater than 60 ppm in at least one of the two gels being compared (the control or the treated) for both sets of treatments for the original experiment and in both sets of treatments for the repeat experiment as well. To confirm that both EGTA and lovastatin induced apoptosis in our Jurkat T-lymphoblasts, the treated cells were analyzed for characteristic morphological changes, “DNA laddering,” and DNA content by flow cytometry following separation on a Percoll density gradient. The detailed results of the analysis of lovastatin-treated cells before and after treatment and following Percoll density gradient fractionation are shown in Fig. 1. Morphological analysis revealed that some of the treated cells exhibited characteristic apoptotic features, that is, condensed chromatin, apparent decreased cell volume, and apoptotic bodies. Due to the loss of nuclear material and enhanced side scatter owing to the condensation of the residual chromatin, a sub- or hypo-diploid DNA content peak was observed by FACS following apoptotic induction (Fig. 1) (47Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 447-459Google Scholar). Fractionation of treated cells by Percoll density gradient centrifugation yielded a pure population of apoptotic cells of increased buoyant density (Fig. 1 D). There were very few cells that appeared morphologically normal in this apoptotic population, and there was little DNA in an undegraded state, as revealed by the FACS analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, in the population of treated cells of normal buoyant density, there were some cells that exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptosis, and some degraded DNA was observed by FACS and agarose electrophoresis of isolated low molecular weight DNA (Fig. 1 C). It is possible that either these cells represent a very early stage of apoptosis prior to increased buoyant density or they are at a later stage of apoptosis when the cells are beginning to decrease their buoyant density due to cell membrane fragility. The apoptotic induction of Jurkats by lovastatin was not apparent at 12.5 μM (the level required to inhibit prenylation (38Patterson S.D. Garrels J.I. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 249-257Google Scholar)) but showed a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic induction from 50 to 100 μM with a further increase being apparent after 48 h compared with 24 h (data not shown). This is presumably due to effects on processes other than the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. However, lovastatin has been shown to induce apoptosis at lower concentrations in both CEM-C7 cells (5 μM for 72 h) (25Bansal N. Houle A.G. Melnykovych G. Leuk. Res. 1989; 13: 875-882Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (10 μM for 24 h) (26Perez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1209-1215Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that EGTA was able to induce apoptosis in Jurkats, confirming the results previously obtained by Bazar and Deeg (27Bazar L.S. Deeg H.J. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 80-86Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the sub-diploid peak is apparent by FACS (compare panels A and B), and the characteristic DNA ladder is apparent (lane 2, morphological data not shown). Fewer cells were induced to undergo apoptosis with EGTA compared with lovastatin. However, these cells were also separated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation to yield a pure apoptotic population at a similar stage of apoptosis to the lovastatin-induced apoptotic cells (data not shown).Figure 2:FACS and DNA laddering of EGTA-treated Jurkat T-lymphoblasts. FACS data from control cells (A) and EGTA (5 m M for 24 h)-treated cells (B). DNA integrity was also assessed by agarose electrophoresis in the right panel with labeling as follows: M, 1-kilobase ladder; 1, control cells; and 2, EGTA-treated cells. Equal quantities of approximately 1 μg of DNA were loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Following separation of control, drug, and chelator-treated cells by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, the cells were washed and then incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine mix for 3 h. Three populations of cells were obtained in this manner, being the control and treated cells of normal buoyant density and treated cells of increased buoyant density. Cell lysates were prepared and separated by two-dimensional PAGE. Fig. 3 shows the two-dimensional PAGE patterns obtained from two of the populations, control and apoptotic cells (those of increased buoyant density), for cells treated with lovastatin. The treated cells of normal buoyant density showed a pattern most similar to the control cell but with some features of the apoptotic cells (data not shown). The most striking feature of these separations is the similarity of the patterns despite the clearly apoptotic appearance of the treated cells of increased buoyant density (see Fig. 1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of metabolic radiolabeling following separation of apoptotic cells, thus demonstrating that there is active synthesis in these apoptotic Jurkat cells. For example, Baxter and Lavin (24Baxter G.D. Lavin M.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1949-1954Google Scholar) in their examination of phosphorylation status prelabeled the cells, as did Robaye et al. (19Robaye B. Doskeland A.P. Suarez-Huerta N. Doskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 503-510Google Scholar) in their study of protein turnover. Previous studies have mostly used unfractionated populations (17Voris B.P. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11319-11329Google Scholar, 18Villa P. Miehe M. Sensenbrenner M. Pettmann B. J.

Urol. 1990; 143: 161-166Google Scholar) or prelabeled the cells prior to apoptotic induction and enrichment of the apoptotic population by detachment of the cells (19Robaye B. Doskeland A.P. Suarez-Huerta N. Doskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 503-510Google Scholar). An in vivo study of degenerating intersegmental muscles of the tobacco hornworm also used two-dimensional PAGE of both isolated cellular protein and in vitro translated mRNA, demonstrating that there was new protein synthesis in these cells undergoing apoptosis (22Wadewitz A.G. Lockshin R.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 19-23Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that apoptotic cells have a decreasing capacity for protein synthesis (48Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Google Scholar) and an increased proteolytic activity (49Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878Google Scholar, 50Del-Bino G. Lassota P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 93: 27-35Google Scholar, 51Bruno S. Del-Bino G. Lassota P. Giaretti W. Darzynkiewicz Z. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 1113-1120Google Scholar). Yet, our data clearly show this not to be a general phenomenon. There is also not a marked decrease in protein synthesis. However, despite the similarity of the patterns, some proteins were obviously decreased by both apoptotic inductions (arrow in Fig. 3 for lovastatin apoptotic induction). It was decided to undertake a quantitative analysis of the two-dimensional PAGE patterns to determine how many proteins were coordinately regulated by these two treatments. To determine how many proteins displayed a common coordinate regulation (either increased or decreased levels) between both types of apoptotic induction, quantitative analysis of both pairs of control/apoptotic two-dimensional PAGE patterns was undertaken. Two different methods of apoptotic induction were used so that any changes that were specific to the particular type of apoptotic induction, and not part of a common apoptotic dependent effect, could be ruled out. Stringent criteria were applied to the analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein spots were identified that exhibited changes of g"

This inactivation depends upon DNA and hydrolyzable ribonucleoside triphosphate.

Gel filtration experiments implicate a 150-kDa factor as being responsible. Mutant DnaAcos protein, which causes overinitiation in vivo, is insensitive to the inactivating factor, suggesting a requirement for this negative control in vivo.

Mutant DnaAcos protein, which causes overinitiation in vivo, is insensitive to the inactivating factor, suggesting a requirement for this negative control in vivo. We propose that a soluble factor controls initiation through down-regulation of DnaA protein. Initiation of genomic replication in Escherichia coli occurs at a unique origin (oriC) on the chromosome and is responsible for coupling replication to the cell cycle (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 2Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 5-8Google Scholar). DnaA protein, the key initiation factor, binds four 9-mer DnaA boxes in the minimal oriC origin (245 base pairs). This complex promotes the opening of 13-mer AT-rich regions in the minimal origin and directs the DnaC-mediated delivery of DnaB helicase to the exposed single strands. The complementary strands are subsequently synthesized by a replisome that includes DnaB, DnaG primase, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The tight binding of ATP and ADP to DnaA protein (KD= 0.03 and 0.1 μM, respectively) has been shown to have a profound influence on the protein' activity for initiation in vitro (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar, 4Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Google Scholar, 5Yung B.Y. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1282-1285Google Scholar). The ATP-bound form of DnaA protein is active for initiating replication; the ADP form, while capable of binding oriC, is inefficient for catalyzing strand separation and thus feeble for initiation. However, the cellular presence of the nucleotide-bound form is still unknown. DnaA protein is present at a level of >1000 molecules/cell (6Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Google Scholar, 7Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Google Scholar), although only ∼20 molecules of the protein seem to be involved in the oriC complex (8Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Google Scholar, 9Crooke E. Thresher R. Hwang D.S. Griffith J. Kornberg A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 16-24Google Scholar). The cellular amount and synthesis of DnaA protein do not oscillate during the cell division cycle, and the protein is stable for at least 90 min in growing cells (10Sakakibara Y. Yuasa S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 87-94Google Scholar). Since initiation occurs properly in a strain in which the dnaA gene is expressed constitutively using the lac promoter (11L-Olesen A. Skarstad K. Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Boye E. Cell. 1989; 57: 881-889Google Scholar), modulation of DnaA protein activity may be responsible for regulating initiation rather than cyclic expression of the dnaA gene. In vivo roles of DnaA protein include an apparent regulation of the “on-off switch” of chromosomal initiation. Overproduction of DnaA protein in vivo can shift the timing of initiation to a point earlier in the cell cycle (11L-Olesen A. Skarstad K. Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Boye E. Cell. 1989; 57: 881-889Google Scholar). Certain dnaA mutants can cause excessive initiation (7Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Google Scholar, 10Sakakibara Y. Yuasa S.

Genet. 1979; 168: 185-195Google Scholar, 16Katayama T. Nagata T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 491-502Google Scholar). The dnaAcos mutant is cold-sensitive (30°C) for growth and overinitiates the replication of its chromosome at the nonpermissive temperature (14Kellenberger-Gujer G. Podhajska A.J. Caro L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1978; 162: 9-16Google Scholar). Excessive initiation in dnaAcos cells appears to be due to alterations in the regulation of DnaA function rather than to an oversupply of the mutant form of the protein (7Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Google Scholar). Whereas de novo protein synthesis is absolutely necessary for new rounds of initiation in wild-type dnaA cells, hyperinitiation in the dnaAcos mutant can occur without concomitant protein synthesis (14Kellenberger-Gujer G. Podhajska A.J. Caro L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1978; 162: 9-16Google Scholar). The specific activities of purified DnaAcos protein and wild-type DnaA protein for catalyzing minichromosome (oriC plasmid) replication in a crude in vitro system at 30°C are very similar (17Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Google Scholar). However, there are significant differences between DnaAcos protein and the wild-type form; DnaAcos protein is unable to bind ATP and ADP, and as such, these nucleotides are unable to influence the activity of the mutant protein. Strikingly, DnaAcos protein also has the capacity to initiate replication for longer periods in vitro; whereas initiation by wild-type DnaA protein (0.40 pmol) ceases after 15 min in a crude replication system, that by DnaAcos protein continues for at least 45 min (17Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that a considerable fraction of wild-type DnaA protein in cells is inactivated, whereas DnaAcos protein is not (7Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that an activity in the soluble fraction of a cell lysate is capable of inactivating wild-type DnaA protein specifically for minichromosome replication. The initiation potential of DnaAcos protein is not affected by exposure to the soluble fraction. Thus, we propose that a soluble factor may be an important regulator controlling initiation frequency. The insensitivity of DnaAcos protein to the negative factor coincides with the nonattenuated activity in vitro and the overinitiation trait in vivo.

The reactions were complemented with purified monomeric DnaA (52 kDa; 0.96 × 106units/mg) or DnaAcos (0.84 × 106units/mg) protein and incubated for 20 min at 30°C. Nucleotides incorporated into acid-insoluble material were trapped on GF/C filters and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions were assembled at 0°C and incubated at 30°C for the indicated times. Typically, reactions (25 μl) contained 40 m M HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6 at 1 M), 2 m M ATP, 11 m M magnesium acetate, 7% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (Mr30,000-70,000), 40 m M phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase; 1.0 μg of M13mpRE85 or ΦX174 RF I DNA (3.0 nmol as nucleotide), 3.8 pmol of wild-type DnaA or DnaAcos protein, and 200 μg (unless indicated otherwise) of a WM433 extract (fraction II noted above). Portions (5 μl) of the mixtures were added to in vitro DNA synthesis reactions (second-stage reaction) to measure DnaA protein activity remaining after the inactivation procedure (“residual activity”). One unit of inactivation corresponds to a 1-unit decrease in the specific activity of DnaA protein/min at 30°C. DnaA protein (11.5 pmol) was added to mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 m M HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6 at 1 M), 2.5 m M magnesium acetate, 0.3 m M EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.007% Triton X-100, 7 m M dithiothreitol, and 1 μM ATP and incubated for 15 min at 0°C (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar, 20Crooke E. Castuma C.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16779-16782Google Scholar). For nucleotide-free DnaA protein, the same conditions were used, except that ATP was omitted. Reaction conditions were the same as those described for replication of ΦX174 ssDNA (21Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Google Scholar), except for the addition of rifampicin (40 μg/ml), phosphocreatine (50 m M), and creatine kinase (100 μg/ml). Each reaction (20 μl) included WM433 fraction II crude extract (100 μg of protein) and M13 A-site ssDNA (300 pmol as nucleotide; 41 fmol as circle) (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Google Scholar) as template. DnaA protein (provided as a component of the first-stage reaction) was added, and the samples were incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Nucleotides incorporated into acid-insoluble material were trapped on GF/C filters and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoblot analysis (7Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Google Scholar), density centrifugation (23Hwang D.S. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19244-19248Google Scholar), and agarose (7%) gel electrophoresis (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were performed as described. Commercially obtained ΦX174 RF I DNA was further purified by treatment in ammonium acetate (2.6 M) and ethidium bromide (0.4 mg/ml), extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and precipitated in ethanol as described (25Stemmer W.P.C. Bio/Techniques. 1991; 10: 726Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Unlike wild-type DnaA protein, DnaAcos protein is capable of catalyzing multiple rounds of replication in vivo without de novo protein synthesis (14Kellenberger-Gujer G. Podhajska A.J. Caro L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1978; 162: 9-16Google Scholar). In a crude in vitro replication system, DnaAcos protein can initiate replication of oriC plasmids for a longer time than the wild-type form (17Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Google Scholar). Since an unknown secondary factor may modulate DnaA protein activity, we have examined whether the activities of wild-type DnaA and DnaAcos proteins are altered when incubated with a crude cell extract (Fig. 1). While DnaAcos protein remained active after exposure to a soluble protein extract, the activity of wild-type DnaA protein decreased to background levels (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analysis with anti-DnaA serum detected no significant decrease in either the level of DnaA protein or its apparent molecular mass during treatment with the protein extract (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the inactivation of DnaA protein does not seem to be due to overall proteolytic degradation, a result consistent with the stability of DnaA protein in vivo (10Sakakibara Y. Yuasa S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 87-94Google Scholar). The oriC plasmid (M13mpRE85) was included with the cell extract for this inactivation. Inasmuch as adequate superhelicity is required for oriC plasmids to serve as templates for replication in vitro (27Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Google Scholar), nicking of template DNA by endonucleases in the protein extract might be responsible for the observed inefficient replication. However, agarose gel electrophoresis did not reveal any significant changes in the amount or form of template DNA present in the mixture prior to replication (Fig. 1 C). Thus, such changes are not the cause of the loss of replication activity (also see below). The inactivation we observed here (Fig. 1 A) required the inclusion of a cell extract; mixtures in which the extract was replaced with bovine serum albumin in buffer (Fig. 2 A) or H2O (data not shown) were unable to inactivate DnaA protein. Furthermore, DnaA protein must be exposed to the extract for its inactivation to occur. Replication did not decrease when the extract was first incubated without DnaA protein and then mixed with DnaA protein and added to replication reactions (Fig. 2 B). The protein extract seems to act directly upon DnaA protein during the first incubation and does not generate an inhibitor for the subsequent replication reaction. The extent of inactivation was proportional to the amount of extract added (Fig. 2 C), further suggesting that a factor(s) in the extract is responsible for the inactivation of DnaA protein. The inactivation activity of the extract is heat-labile in that heating the extract at 55°C for 5 min prevented the extract from being able to act upon DnaA protein (data not shown). The inclusion of DNA during the treatment of DnaA protein with the cell extract is necessary for inactivation to occur. When DnaA protein was incubated with the extract (40 min) in the presence of oriC template DNA (M13mpRE85) and then the mixture was added to a replication reaction, 80% of the replication activity was lost (Fig. 1 A and Table I). In contrast, significant replication was observed when DnaA protein was incubated with the extract (40 min) in the absence of DNA and then assayed in a replication reaction in which template DNA was provided (Table I). However, the need for specific DNA sequences, such as a DnaA box, was not found in that M13mp19 RF I, ΦX174 RF I, and ΦX174 ssDNA supported the inactivation of DnaA protein (Table I). The ability of nontemplate DNA to promote the inactivation process confirms the finding that the loss of replication activity is not caused by changes in template DNA (Fig. 1 C).Table I:DNA requirements for the inactivation of DnaA proteinWild-type DnaA or DnaAcos protein (3.8 pmol) was added to a standard first-stage reaction (25 μl) that lacked or included DNA (1.0 μg for double-stranded DNA; 0.5 μg for ssDNA). Portions (5 μl) of the mixtures, either before or after an incubation period (40 min, 30°C), were added to an in vitro DNA synthesis complementation reaction (20 min, 30°C) that contained M13mpRE85 as template DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). When M13mpRE85 was present in the first-stage reaction, template DNA was not added to the replication reaction. DnaA protein activity remaining after the first-stage incubation (residual activity) was compared with that obtained before and is indicated in percent (in each case, an activity of 100% corresponds to 400-600 pmol of DNA synthesized). Open table in a new tab Wild-type DnaA or DnaAcos protein (3.8 pmol) was added to a standard first-stage reaction (25 μl) that lacked or included DNA (1.0 μg for double-stranded DNA; 0.5 μg for ssDNA). Portions (5 μl) of the mixtures, either before or after an incubation period (40 min, 30°C), were added to an in vitro DNA synthesis complementation reaction (20 min, 30°C) that contained M13mpRE85 as template DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). When M13mpRE85 was present in the first-stage reaction, template DNA was not added to the replication reaction. DnaA protein activity remaining after the first-stage incubation (residual activity) was compared with that obtained before and is indicated in percent (in each case, an activity of 100% corresponds to 400-600 pmol of DNA synthesized). ATP was essential for the inactivation of DnaA protein (Fig. 3 A), with maximal inactivation occurring at concentrations of 100 μM or higher (Fig. 3 B). The requirement for ATP was similar when either the nucleotide-free or ATP-bound form of DnaA protein was used (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the exogenous ATP appeared not to be necessary for the formation of the ATP form of DnaA protein and may be needed for the inactivating factor. Compounds related to ATP were used to examine the nucleotide specificity for DnaA protein inactivation. To prevent DnaA protein from forming complexes with the ATP analogs, the ATP-bound form of DnaA protein was used. Clearly, CTP, GTP, and UTP at 0.5 m M sustained inactivation of ATP-DnaA protein, whereas ADP and the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS could not (Table II).Table II:Nucleotide requirements for the inactivation of DnaA proteinDnaA protein was incubated with ATP (5 μM; 15 min, 0°C) to form the nucleotide-bound form. The resulting ATP-DnaA protein (3.8 pmol) was added to a standard first-stage reaction (25 μl) that contained the indicated nucleotides. Portions (5 μl) of the mixtures, either before or after an incubation period (40 min, 30°C), were added to an in vitro DNA synthesis complementation reaction (20 min, 30°C; see “Experimental Procedures”). DnaA protein activity remaining after the first-stage period (residual activity) was compared with that obtained before and is indicated in percent (in each case, an activity of 100% corresponds to 300-400 pmol of DNA synthesized). Open table in a new tab DnaA protein was incubated with ATP (5 μM; 15 min, 0°C) to form the nucleotide-bound form. The resulting ATP-DnaA protein (3.8 pmol) was added to a standard first-stage reaction (25 μl) that contained the indicated nucleotides. Portions (5 μl) of the mixtures, either before or after an incubation period (40 min, 30°C), were added to an in vitro DNA synthesis complementation reaction (20 min, 30°C; see “Experimental Procedures”). DnaA protein activity remaining after the first-stage period (residual activity) was compared with that obtained before and is indicated in percent (in each case, an activity of 100% corresponds to 300-400 pmol of DNA synthesized). DnaA protein participates in the assembly of primosomes at sites other than oriC (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Google Scholar, 28Seufert W. Messer W. Cell. 1987; 48: 73-78Google Scholar, 29Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18895-18906Google Scholar). The ABC primosome system requires DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins; DnaG primase; and E. coli single strand binding protein-coated ssDNA that contains a hairpin structure with a single DnaA box (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Google Scholar). DnaA protein binds to its recognition sequence and, with the aid of DnaC protein, loads the DnaB helicase onto the template. DnaG primase then forms a complex with DnaB protein and synthesizes primer RNA on ssDNA. DnaA protein-dependent replication of ssDNA (template termed M13 A-site) was examined to see whether or not the inactivation of DnaA protein is specific for initiation at oriC. DnaA protein was incubated with the cell extract; portions of the mixture were added to replication reactions; and DNA synthesis initiated at oriC or the hairpin on M13 A-site ssDNA was measured. While DnaA protein was unable to initiate replication at oriC, its action in this ssDNA replication system was indistinguishable from that of DnaA protein that had not been exposed to the cell extract (Fig. 4). This finding supports the observation that DnaA protein is not globally altered (Fig. 1 B) and indicates that a factor in the cell extract inactivates some function of DnaA protein that is required for initiation at oriC but that is dispensable for initiation of ssDNA replication. The rate of DNA synthesis in a crude cell extract complemented with DnaA protein (0.19 pmol) decreased after ∼10 min (Fig. 5). With the addition of fresh DnaA protein, replication was revived and continued for an additional 20 min (Fig. 5). The extent of the additional DNA replication was proportional to the amount of DnaA protein added. This finding indicates that DnaA protein in a crude cell extract loses much of its initiation capacity, while the other factors needed for DNA synthesis retain their activities. The crude cell extract (12 mg, 3.9 × 107units) was fractionated through a gel filtration column to determine if the DnaA protein-inactivating factor behaved as a single entity. Column fractions were incubated with ΦX174 RF I DNA, ATP, and DnaA protein, and then replication activities were measured. A peak decrease in DnaA protein activity was observed for fraction 33, which corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 6). The yield of the inactivating factor activity in a pool of fractions 31-39 was 62% of the loaded activity. The loss of DnaA protein activity required incubation of DnaA protein with the column fractions (Fig. 6), and as expected, the inclusion of ATP and DNA in the inactivating step was necessary (data not shown). While the inactivating factor failed to bind to several chromatographic resins (data not shown), it had affinity for DEAE-cellulose (DE52). Fractions eluted from a DE52 column by a linear gradient of sodium chloride were assayed for the inactivation of DnaA protein (Fig. 7); one major peak of DnaA-inactivating activity was observed. The yield of activity in the pool of fractions 27-43 was 54%. This pooled fraction had a 4.5-fold increase in specific activity over fraction II and required ATP and ΦX174 RF I DNA for inactivation (data not shown). Chromosomal replication is regulated at the initiation stage, most likely through a balance of positive- and negative-acting factors. Here we have indicated that a soluble cellular factor inactivates DnaA protein for initiating replication at oriC in vitro and propose that such a negative factor plays an important role in controlling initiation in vivo. A mutant form of DnaA protein, DnaAcos, which overinitiates replication at oriC, is not affected by exposure to the factor; the inability to respond to such a negative-acting factor may be deeply involved in the overinitiation observed for dnaAcos mutants. Unlike wild-type DnaA protein activity, DnaAcos protein activity for initiation in vitro is thermosensitive, and its specific activity at 42°C is only 25% of that at 30°C (17Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Google Scholar). Since the dnaAcos mutant can grow normally at 42°C, these facts also support the importance of down-regulation of initiation activity. Considerable portions of DnaA and DnaAcos proteins are found as aggregates during their purification from overproducing cells (6Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Google Scholar, 17Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Google Scholar, 18Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Google Scholar). Aggregates of wild-type DnaA protein include phospholipids with a composition similar to that of cell membranes (23Hwang D.S. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19244-19248Google Scholar). The initiation activity of the aggregate form is about half of that of monomeric DnaA protein in a crude replication system and is completely absent in a system reconstituted with purified proteins (23Hwang D.S. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19244-19248Google Scholar). The inactivated DnaA protein observed here, however, differs from the aggregated form; constant velocity centrifugation through sucrose indicated that a large majority (>80%) of DnaA protein was monomeric following treatment with the crude extract either in the presence or absence of ΦX174 RF I DNA and ATP (data not shown). Genetic analyses and reconstitution studies with purified components have identified >10 different proteins that are necessary for replication from oriC (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Among these numerous participants, DnaA protein seems to be the only factor that is inactivated by the soluble crude extract (Fig. 5). This finding supports the hypothesis that the inactivating factor has a specific role in the control of chromosome initiation during cell growth. We found that the inactivation of DnaA protein is specific for initiation at oriC; initiation of A-site ssDNA replication is not affected (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that the DNA-binding and DnaB helicase-loading activities of DnaA protein are not affected. Perhaps DnaA protein' additional function of strand separation of the AT-rich region of oriC is what is lost. A possible molecular mechanism for the inactivation of DnaA protein may include enhanced hydrolysis of the tightly bound ATP. Wild-type DnaA protein has a weak intrinsic ATPase activity; tightly bound ATP is very slowly hydrolyzed to ADP at 37°C in the presence of DNA, thereby generating replicatively inefficient ADP-DnaA protein (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar). The requirement of sequence-independent DNA for the hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar) is similar to that described here for the inactivation of DnaA protein (Table I). Although the slow conversion of ATP-DnaA protein to the ADP form can occur independently of other cellular components (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar), the inactivating factor may stimulate the feeble intrinsic ATPase. In the regulation of eukaryotic cell growth, a similar example is seen in the oncogenic Ras GTPase; the very weak GTPase of Ras protein is stimulated by interaction with GTPase-activating protein, and the GTP-bound form active for signaling cell proliferation is rendered to the GDP-bound inactive form (30McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Google Scholar). DnaA protein inactivated by the 150-kDa factor appears to resemble the ADP form that is inert for initiation at oriC (3Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-267Google Scholar), but is active for initiation of A-site ssDNA (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Google Scholar). 2J. Garner and E. Crooke, unpublished data. The requisite hydrolysis of a ribonucleotide to inactivate DnaA protein (Table II) suggests that the inactivation process may either be energy-consuming or involve a phosphorylation event. However, phosphorylated forms of DnaA protein have not been detected (data not shown). A protein termed IciA (inhibitor of chromosomal initiation) was previously shown to prevent the strand opening at oriC and to act as a specific inhibitor of initiation in vitro (31Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. Cell. 1990; 63: 325-331Google Scholar). The action of the factor we describe here differs from that of IciA protein in that (i) IciA protein must be bound to the 13-mer region of oriC to inhibit the initiation activity of DnaA protein, while the proposed inactivating factor can restrain the action of DnaA protein in the absence of oriC (Table I); (ii) IciA protein is a homodimer of 33-kDa subunits, as opposed to the apparent native molecular mass of ∼150 kDa observed for the DnaA protein-inactivating factor (Fig. 6); and (iii) there is an absolute requirement for a nucleoside triphosphate for the inactivation of DnaA protein (Fig. 3 and Table II). None is required for IciA protein to function. A rapidly growing bacterium (doubling time of <60 min) must initiate the next round of chromosomal replication before ongoing replication has been completed and the cell divides and thus will bear multiple copies of oriC (32Helmstetter C.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham I.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umberger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1594-1605Google Scholar). Initiation of the multiple origins within a cell is synchronous, occurring at the same time during the cell cycle. Modification of adenine residues in the sequence GATC by DNA-adenine methylase (the dam gene product) (33Hattman S. Brooks J.E. Masurekar M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 367-380Google Scholar) is essential for this synchrony (2Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 5-8Google Scholar); dam−cells with either point or null mutations are viable (34Marinus M.G. Carraway M. Frey A. Brown L. Arraj J.A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1983; 192: 288-289Google Scholar, 35Marinus M.G. Morris N.R. Mutat. Res. 1975; 28: 15-26Google Scholar), but exhibit an asynchronous phenotype (36Boye E. L-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, semiconservative replication of fully methylated origins produces hemimethylated oriC DNA that binds to the cell membrane (37Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M. Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Google Scholar). The hemimethylated state of oriC seems to be maintained for 10 min (38Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Google Scholar); and then Dam methylase modifies the GATC sites in the oriC region, and the resultant fully methylated DNA is released from the membrane. This process, termed sequestration, plays a role in establishing the synchrony of initiations of multiple chromosomes and preventing secondary initiation at newly replicated origins. The recently identified seqA gene encodes a protein that appears to negatively modulate replication by sequestration (39Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Google Scholar). seqA-deficient cells are viable, but cannot sequester oriC DNA or synchronize initiations. The action of SeqA protein in controlling initiation is independent of the proposed negative regulation through the inactivation of DnaA protein. An extract prepared from seqA null cells had the same specific activity for inactivating DnaA protein as wild-type cells and did not affect DnaAcos activity (data not shown). Thus, SeqA protein and the DnaA-inactivating factor appear to act independently to affect initiation at oriC. Sequestration of oriC to the membrane is transient during the cell cycle, with the duration being much shorter than the time between initiations (38Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Google Scholar). As such, it is likely that an as yet unidentified factor functions to determine the occurrence of initiation during the cell cycle. The DnaA-inactivating factor may play a role in this regulation. DnaAcos protein is insensitive to the factor and thus may retain an initiation-competent state for an extended period and cause repeated initiations. A system for inactivating DnaA protein may be necessary for controlling the on-off switch of initiation during the cell cycle. Purification of the inactivating factor is in progress.

To explore the mechanism(s) by which this portion of Rb may regulate cell growth, we have sought to characterize cellular proteins that associate with the Rb amino terminus using an in vitro protein-binding assay. Here we report that at least one such protein is a cell cycle-regulated Rb/histone H1 kinase (RbK) whose enzymatic and/or Rb association activity is most prevalent in G2/M phases of cells. In contrast to previously characterized cyclin-dependent and Rb-associated kinases, such as cdk1 (cdc2) and cdk2, G2/M RbK 1) is not depleted by incubation with p13suc-beads, 2) is not detected with antisera against several Rb-associated cyclins-cdks, and 3) associates with Rb via the Rb amino terminus, a region that is dispensable for interaction with other Rb-associated kinases. RbK is clearly distinct from previously characterized mitotic cdks since cyclin A-cdc2, cyclin A-cdk2, cyclin B-cdc2, and cyclin B-cdk2 did not associate with the Rb amino terminus. Coprecipitation experiments with Rb antisera confirmed the association of Rb with a RbK-like kinase in metaphase-arrested cells in vivo. Interestingly, G2/M RbK did not appreciably associate with an analogous portion of p107, a Rb-related protein. Taken together, these data indicate that the Rb amino terminus specifically associates with a novel cell cycle-regulated kinase in late cell cycle stages.

Microinjection of the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of p105-Rb into certain Rb-negative tumor cells has been shown to block subsequent DNA synthesis and suggested that Rb' growth-limiting function may be restricted to a discrete temporal “window” approximately 6 h prior to the initiation of S phase (38Goodrich D.W.

These results suggested that Rb function may be critically important for the management of cell cycle progression through a G1“checkpoint” subsequent to which a cell is committed to replicating DNA. Consistent with the notion that the Rb carboxyl terminus plays an important role in mediating growth suppression, this portion of Rb has been shown to be a “hotspot” for mutations in human tumors (5Horowitz J.M.

Precise mapping experiments with Rb mutants created in vitro have corroborated evidence from tumor cells, delineating amino acids within exons 12 through 18 and 19 through 22 (the so called Rb-“pocket”) as being essential for p105-Rb to complex with these viral and cellular proteins (47Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Google Scholar, 48Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ewen M.E. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3761-3769Google Scholar). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of p105-Rb are believed to be necessary and perhaps sufficient for at least one Rb function. However, this simplified view of Rb activity has been challenged by the results of recently reported functional assays. Karantza et al. (49Karantza V. Maroo A. Fay D. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6640-6652Google Scholar) reported that the induced expression of full-length p105-Rb in synchronously growing S phase cells resulted in the arrest of cell cycle progression in G2. Interestingly, an Rb cDNA carrying a mutation within the Rb carboxyl terminus that abrogates the association of Rb with SV40 large-T antigen also led to growth arrest in G2suggesting that regions outside of the Rb pocket are necessary for growth arrest in this cell cycle compartment (49Karantza V. Maroo A. Fay D. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6640-6652Google Scholar). In addition to these observations, a variety of amino-terminal Rb mutations have been shown by Qian et al. (50Qian Y. Luckey C. Horton L. Esser M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5363-5372Google Scholar) to abrogate Rb-mediated growth suppression and to block Rb phosphorylation in vivo despite the retention of E2F-binding activity within the Rb pocket. More importantly, rare instances of mutations within the Rb amino terminus have been detected in retinoblastoma patients, supporting the supposition that lesions within this portion of Rb result in profound loss-of-function mutations (51Hogg A. Bia B. Onadim Z. Cowell J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7351-7355Google Scholar, 52Dryja T.P. Rapaport J. McGee T.L. Nork T.M. Schwartz T.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 1122-1128Google Scholar). The precise function(s) of the ∼400 amino acids of Rb that are linked upstream of the Rb pocket domain is(are) unknown. This amino-terminal portion of Rb is well conserved in human, mouse, chicken, and Xenopus Rb proteins, and results of in vitro mutagenesis experiments suggest that this region is also critical for Rb-mediated growth suppression (50Qian Y.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 221-230Google Scholar). As such, Rb appears to be modular in structure, possessing a protein-binding domain within the Rb carboxyl terminus and a separable upstream region of as yet unknown function. As a first step toward the biochemical and functional characterization of the Rb amino terminus, we sought to identify cellular proteins that specifically bound the amino terminus of human and mouse Rb proteins. Here we report the detection of a novel cell cycle-regulated serine-threonine kinase that specifically associates with this portion of Rb and phosphorylates the Rb amino terminus and histone H1 in vitro. A549 and 5637 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD), ML-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Stephen H.

To generate polyclonal antisera against human Rb protein, a full-length human Rb cDNA in plasmid pBSK+ was used as substrate for the PCR using the exon 1 and exon 11 oligonucleotides indicated below. A resulting 1.1-kilobase pair amino-terminal Rb fragment was inserted in frame into pGEX2TK, a bacterial-fusion protein expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). This portion of the Rb cDNA encodes the amino-terminal 380 amino acids of human Rb protein. Following bacterial transformation, fusion proteins were induced with IPTG, and a 68-kDa GST-Rb fusion protein was purified as described previously (57Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

A bacterial plasmid containing a human Rb cDNA, pBSK-HRbC (59Friend S.H. Bernards R. Rogelj S. Weinberg R.A. Rapaport J.M. Albert D.M. Dryja T.P. Nature. 1986; 323: 643Google Scholar), was linearized with BamHI and Rb exons 1 through 11 were amplified by the PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), a thermal cycler, and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GTCATGCCGCCCAAAACCCCCCGAAAA-3′ (exon 1) and 5′-TAACTGGAGTGTGTGGAGGAATTATAT-3′ (exon 11). Rb oligonucleotides were synthesized with sites for BamHI cleavage at their 5′ ends and amino-terminal Rb PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated with BamHI-digested pGEX2TK (Pharmacia), generating plasmid pGEX2TK-HuRb, such that the Rb reading frame is collinear with that of GST. To generate a similar mouse GST-Rb fusion protein, a bacterial plasmid carrying the mouse Rb cDNA, pBSK115ROX (53Bernards R. Shackleford G.M. Gerber M.R. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Schartl M.

BL21 bacterial cells were transformed with GST fusion plasmids, and fusion proteins were purified following induction with IPTG and collection on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Fusion proteins were harvested from 100 to 1000 ml of post-induction bacterial extracts with glutathione-agarose beads that had been previously equilibrated with NETN (20 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 100 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.5% powdered milk. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and protein concentrations were estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. GST fusion proteins were used in in vitro protein-binding assays as described previously (61Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Mammalian cell extracts were prepared from cells that were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by the addition of 1 ml of EBC buffer (50 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 120 m M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 m M NaF, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin). Following incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aliquots of cell extracts (0.5 ml, 5 × 106to 1 × 107cell equivalents) were precleared of proteins with affinity for the GST moiety by incubation with gentle rocking for 1 h at 4°C with at least 5 μg of GST protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. GST protein-bound beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and discarded. Precleared cell extracts were then incubated with 5 μg of bead-bound GST fusion proteins with gentle rocking for 1 h at 4°C. Following exhaustive washes with NETN, protein-bound beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 50 m M HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 10 or 20 m M MgCl2, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 25 μM unlabeled ATP. In some experiments 0.1 mg/ml histone H1 (Sigma) or 1 μg of various GST fusion proteins or purified cellular proteins were included as kinase substrates. GST-E2F-1 and purified phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) were kind gifts of Drs. Joseph R. Nevins (Duke University Medical Center) and Nicholas K. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). After incubation for 10-20 min at room temperature, samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled kinase substrates were visualized following exposure to Hyperfilm for 5 h to overnight at −80°C. Phosphoamino acid analyses were performed as described previously (19Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Google Scholar, 62Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J.

A. 1994; 91: 192-196Google Scholar) utilized unlabeled whole cell extracts prepared from cells multiply infected with recombinant viruses carrying epitope-tagged cyclin A-cdc2 and cyclin A-cdk2 or cyclin B-cdc2 and cyclin B-cdk2 cDNAs. Each cyclin cDNA was epitope tagged at its amino terminus with a nine amino acid moiety (NH2-EEEEYMPME-CO2H) derived from the medium T antigen of polyoma virus to which a monoclonal antibody was available. BL21 cells were transformed with a bacterial p13sucexpression plasmid, pRKDSUC (a gift of Dr. Katherine I. Swenson, Duke University Medical Center), and p13sucexpression was induced by the addition of IPTG to cultures at an OD600 of 0.6. After 4 h of growth at 37°C, cells were harvested, resuspended in p13suclysis buffer (50 m M Tris pH 8.0, 5 m M EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation at 17,400 × g for 30 min. Recovered supernatants (6 ml) were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (100 cm × 2.6 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.3, and 0.5 M NaCl. Aliquots of column fractions were resolved on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and fractions containing pure p13sucprotein were pooled and coupled to CNBR-Sepharose (5 mg of p13sucprotein/ml of Sepharose) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pharmacia). To preclear cell extracts of p13suc-associated kinases, 0.5 ml of unlabeled cell extracts were incubated with 100 μl of p13suc-Sepharose beads (containing 500 μg of p13sucprotein) with gentle agitation for 60 min at 4°C. Precleared cell extracts were then clarified by centrifugation at 4°C and supernatants examined for in vitro Rb binding activity and/or histone H1 kinase activity. Exponentially growing A549 cells were arrested in early G1by incubation in methionine-free media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) and 0.5 m M hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 48 h. To obtain an S phase cell population, G1/S-arrested cells were washed with serum-free DMEM, refed with complete DMEM and harvested 6 h later. Populations of cells arrested in mitotic metaphase were prepared by incubation of cells in 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 h. CHO cells were synchronized as described by Seth et al. (65Seth A. Gupta S. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4125-4136Google Scholar), and cell cycle status was monitored by propidium iodide staining and flow-cytometric analysis. Approximately 2 × 106cells were collected by trypsinization or gentle agitation (metaphase-arrested cells), washed with PBS, and fixed in methanol for 10 min at −20°C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 10 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Sigma), and stained with a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at room temperature. The timing of DNA synthesis was determined by monitoring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into mammalian cell DNA. Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in serum-free media, trypsinized, washed with PBS, and precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cell precipitates was quantified by scintillation counting. Since previous reports have suggested that the Rb amino terminus is functionally important, we sought to identify and characterize cellular proteins that specifically interact with this portion of Rb. We reasoned that cellular proteins (N-RBPs) that associate with Rb via its amino terminus in vivo might form stable complexes with Rb in vitro and thus might be detected by affinity chromatography. Furthermore, we speculated that one or more N-RBPs might be a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase since Rb is phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner. To prepare amino-terminal Rb reagents for in vitro protein-binding assays, Rb oligonucleotides and the PCR were used to generate a GST fusion protein that encodes the first 380 amino acids of human Rb. In addition, an equivalent GST-Rb fusion protein was prepare"

We have recently found that IL-2 induced an increase in the binding of discrete transcription factors of the ATF/cAMP-responsive element binding factor (CREB) family at G1/S, and that this effect was inhibited by rapamycin (Feuerstein, N., Huang, D., Hinrichs, S. H., Orten, D. J., Aiyar, N., and Prystowsky, M. B. (1995) J. Immunol. 154, 68-79). We now show, by using high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, that rapamycin inhibited selectively the synthesis of three discrete IL-2-induced soluble proteins (35 kDa/pI 5, 68 kDa/pI 4, 110 kDa/pI 4.3). Analysis of nuclear proteins demonstrated that rapamycin selectively blocked the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an obligate cofactor of DNA polymerase-, an important component for DNA replication. Rapamycin inhibited the IL-2-induced PCNA mRNA, and the murine PCNA promoter activity in IL-2-stimulated cells. Inducible CRE-binding proteins were shown previously to be required for PCNA promoter activity in IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes. Using DNA binding gel mobility shift assay we demonstrated that rapamycin potently inhibited the binding of CREB/ATF transcription factors to CRE elements in the murine proximal PCNA promoter. These results suggest that PCNA is a preferred target in a rapamycin-sensitive transduction pathway, and that the mechanism by which rapamycin inhibits PCNA gene expression may involve the inhibition of the interaction of CREB/ATF transcription factors with CRE elements in the proximal PCNA promoter."

It has been reported that this mutant also antagonizes hGH activation of the rat or human prolactin (PRL) receptor in cell-based assays, with no agonist activity. We have now tested this mutant in a sensitive MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)-ESTA (eluted stain assay) bioassay using rat PRL receptors in the Nb2 cell line. We confirm that G120R acts as an efficient antagonist of native hGH, but show that it can also act as an agonist to generate intracellular signals leading to metabolic activation and proliferation of Nb2 cells. We have demonstrated an unusual sensitivity to the presence of zinc (Zn2+). In the absence of added Zn2+, G120R shows weak but full agonist activity in the bioassay, and this can be blocked by co-incubation with recombinant hGH-binding protein. G120R can therefore be utilized to discriminate between the molecular mechanisms of hGH interactions with its somatogenic and lactogenic receptors.

On an average, the TSK myocardial fibroblast cultures showed a 4-fold increase in collagen synthesis and 4.4- and 3.6-fold increases, respectively, in α1(I) and α1(III) collagen mRNA steady state levels. The increased α1(I) and α1(III) collagen mRNA levels were mainly due to increased transcription rates (3.4- and 3.8-fold higher, respectively) of the respective genes. Furthermore, we showed that the up-regulation of α1(I) procollagen gene transcription in TSK mice myocardial fibroblasts was due to the lack of the strong inhibitory influence of a regulatory sequence contained in the promoter region encompassing nucleotides −675 to −804.

Goblet cells are abundant constituents of the surface epithelium within the small and large intestine. Although these cells have been long recognized to secrete a complex mixture of mucin glycoprotein onto the cell surface, their functional importance in gastrointestinal tract mucosa has not been well defined. Characterization of the molecular basis of goblet cell differentiation and function has also been quite limited. Although substantial advances have been made in the cDNA cloning of genes encoding the protein backbones of mucin glycoproteins from the gastrointestinal tract and elsewhere, the enormous size and complexity of these genes have made these of limited utility to define those elements responsible for goblet cell specific expression (1Ohmori H.

Observations in recent years have led to the recognition of a family of small proteins which are also selectively expressed by mucin-producing goblet cells in gastrointestinal tract mucosa. This family of proteins, designated trefoil peptides, are distinguished by a unique six-cysteine motif (called a “P” domain) which results in the formation of three intrachain loops within these small peptides due to disulfide bond formation in a 1-5, 2-4, 3-6 configuration (8Thim L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 85-90Google Scholar, 9Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 239-243Google Scholar). Members of the trefoil peptide family appear to be expressed in a region-specific fashion along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. Human spasmolytic polypeptide, or hSP, bears two trefoil motifs and is expressed primarily in the stomach (10Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Gautier C. Wolf C. Hareuveni M. Chambon P. Lathe R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 407-414Google Scholar), although the porcine homologue was originally isolated from pancreas (11JK H. Thim L. Jacobsen H.E. Regul. Pept. 1982; 3: 207-219Google Scholar). pS2, bearing a single trefoil motif and initially cloned as the product of an estrogen-responsive gene from a breast cancer cell line (12Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Google Scholar), is normally expressed only in the gastric antrum in man (13Rio M.C. Bellocq J.P.

In contrast to pS2 and hSP, ITF is normally selectively expressed in the normal small and large intestinal mucosa complementing the pattern of expression of the other members of the family in the normal gastrointestinal tract (16Podolsky D.K.

Understanding of the functional role of the trefoil peptides in gastrointestinal tract biology is now emerging.

Lynch-Devaney K. Kindon H. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 376-383Google Scholar). This concept is consistent with observed patterns of expression of trefoil peptide in association with injury in gastrointestinal tract disorders. Thus, expression of hSP and pS2, normally confined to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, as well as ITF has been observed adjacent to intestinal ulceration in patients with Crohn's disease and peptic ulcer disease in man (19Rio M.C. Chenard M.P. Wolf C. Marcellin L. Tomasetto C. Lathe R. Bellocq J.P. Chambon P.

Cook G.A. Skultety K.J. Yeomans N.D. Giraud A.S. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: A195Google Scholar). The selective expression of ITF in intestinal goblet cells suggests that characterization of the gene encoding this peptide may provide insight into regulatory elements responsible for goblet cell-associated gene expression. Among the trefoil family members, only the pS2 gene normally expressed in gastric mucosa has been reported (21Jeltsch J.M. Roberts M. Schatz C. Garnier J.M. Brown A.M.C. Chambon P.

To investigate the mechanisms responsible for goblet cell differentiation within the intestine, and as a basis for further study of the genetic elements responsible for “ectopic” expression of ITF in pathologic conditions, we have cloned the rat ITF gene and its 5′-flanking region. Reporter gene constructs under the control of the rat ITF promoter were able to direct expression in a relatively goblet cell-specific fashion. A rat genomic library constructed by a partial digest of DNA from an adult male Sprague-Dawley rat with Sau3A cloned into EMBL3/SP6/T7 λ phage was obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). This library contains 2.3 × 106independent clones with an average insert size of 16 kb (range: 8-20 kb). Phage were plated out on 150-mm plates at a density of 5 × 104plaque-forming units per plate in a bacterial lawn of competent Escherichia coli NM538. After 8 h of growth at 37°C duplicate nitrocellulose filter lifts were made. After phage denaturation and cross-linking by standard methods, membranes were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M sodium citrate), 20 m M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA at 42°C for 2 h. Membranes were then placed in a solution identical to the one used for prehybridization substituting 10% dextran sulfate for SDS and using 3 × 105cpm/ml of 32P-labeled T3411 probe. T3411, the rat intestinal trefoil factor cDNA described previously (17Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11017-11021Google Scholar), was labeled by random priming using Klenow DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (30Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biol. 1983; 132: 13-66Google Scholar). Push columns (Primerase columns; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Hybridization was performed for 48 h at 42°C, followed by three 10-min washes at room temperature in 2 ×SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then two 20-min washes at 37°C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were blotted and exposed overnight to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens at −70°C. Positive plaques were picked and phage eluted into λ diluent before secondary screening on 100-mm plates. Conditions for secondary and tertiary screening were performed in a manner identical to primary screening. Phage DNA was prepared from plate lysate by a modification of methods described in Maniatis et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).2 2M. Babyatsky, personal communication. Plate lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant collected and subjected to 72,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of λ diluent, two samples pooled, spun briefly to pellet contaminants, and the cleared supernatant layered over a CsCl gradient with SM (SM: 100 m M NaCl, 10 m M MgSO4, 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% gelatin) as the diluent, set up as 1 ml with ρ = 1.7, 1 ml with ρ = 1.5, and 2 ml with ρ = 1.45 in a 13 × 51-mm centrifuge tube. Gradients were subjected to 120,000 × g at 20°C for 1 h. Intact bacteriophage was collected from the interface of ρ = 1.5 and 1.45 and dialyzed twice for 1 h against 100 m M NaCl, 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 m M MgCl2. Phage solution was digested with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 65°C for 4-12 h and phage DNA extracted with phenol once, phenol/chloroform once, and chloroform once, then ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 m M EDTA). Phage DNA from each plaque-purified cross-hybridizing phage was subjected to restriction digestion with a variety of restriction enzymes and Southern blot was performed with the T3411 probe used to screen the genomic library. Based upon Southern blot, an appropriate restriction fragment containing the entire RITF gene was selected for subcloning into plasmid. The selected restriction fragment was ligated into appropriately cut pKS+ Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) and used to transform competent XL1-Blue E. coli (Stratagene). Large scale preparation of plasmid DNA was performed by CsCl gradient and by affinity resin purification (Magic Maxiprep; Promega, Madison, WI). Exons, large portions of introns, and the entire 5′- and 3′-flanking regions were sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and oligonucleotide primers synthesized in a sequential overlapping manner. Final sequence was determined from both strands. Reaction products were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels by standard techniques. Sequence comparisons were made using the BESTFIT and BLAST programs (32Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acic Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the RITF gene was searched for potential enhancer, promoter, and repressor elements using Signal Scan v.3.01 (33Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 203-206Google Scholar). The sequences of the 5′-flanking regions of reported genes expressed in intestinal tissue were retrieved from the GenBankTM data base and compared with the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat ITF gene using the local and global homology search capabilities of the ALIGN PLUS program (Scientific & Educational Software, State Line, PA). The transcriptional start site was established by RNase protection assay based upon the sequence established from the subcloned gene and its 5′-flanking region. A 315-bp fragment straddling the junction of the 5′-flanking region and the first exon was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction primed with synthetic oligonucleotides designed as a sense strand 23-mer starting 230 bp upstream of the translational start site and an antisense 24-mer 61 bp 3′ to the translational start site. The RITF gene subcloned into pKS+ plasmid was used as template, and 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 64°C for 1.5 min, 72°C for 2 min were performed, followed by 72°C for 8 min to complete extension. PCR product was polished with Klenow fragment and subcloned into the SrfI site of the plasmid vector PCR Script (Stratagene), and competent XL1-Blue cells were transformed. Plasmid DNA was prepared with plasmid affinity columns (Wizard Miniprep; Promega). Orientation and sequence was confirmed by sequencing with universal primers as described above. The plasmid was linearized by digestion with NotI to provide a 5′ overhang, and a 315-bp 32P-labeled riboprobe was generated by in vitro transcription with priming at the T7 site of the PCR Script vector using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion; Austin, TX). Probe was purified on a 5% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel prior to hybridization with total RNA from rat colon and RNase digestion using the RPA II Kit (Ambion; Austin, TX). Products of digestion were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% Long Ranger, 8 M urea gel (AT Biochem; Malvern, PA) and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70°C between two intensifier screens. Confirmation of the predicted transcriptional start site was carried out by primer extension using a primer designated RITF-C (5′-caggaggacgtttcgggtcctt-3′ within exon I of the RITF gene (predicted nucleotides +86 to +107). After labeling of the primer 5′ end with [α-32P]ATP by standard techniques, primer extension was carried out by the method of Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after initial precipitation of the primer with 150 μg of total RNA prepared from rat colonic mucosa in 100 μl by the addition of 3 M sodium acetate (10 μl) and absolute ethanol (250 μl) at −70°C. Products of primer extension were evaluated on an 8% Long Ranger gel run side by side with a sequence ladder produced with the RITF 20C plasmid, using the RITF-C oligonucleotide as primer (1 pmol/m), 35S-dATP (DuPont NEN and the Sequenase version one sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The promoterless luciferase gene construct pXP2 (34Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Lee Kaplan. Starting with pRITF20C, an 8.7-kb EcoRI fragment of one cross-hybridizing phage containing the entire RITF gene as well as ∼1.7 and 1.8 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, respectively, was subcloned into pKS+ Bluescript and the plasmid cut at the NcoI site, a single base pair upstream of the start ATG codon. The 5′ overhang was polished by mung bean nuclease digestion followed by ligation with phosphorylated XhoI linker using T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid was then digested with BamHI to completion, and the resulting 1.7-kb fragment, containing only the 5′-flanking region, was resolved on a 1% agarose gel and isolated by digestion with GELase (Epicenter Technologies; Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions and ethanol precipitation. The multiple cloning site of pXP2 was digested with BamHI and XhoI to completion and double-cut vector was isolated from a 1% agarose gel with Geneclean (BIO 101; La Jolla, CA) by the manufacturer's instructions. The 1.7-kb BamHI- XhoI fragment was ligated into prepared vector to form the construct −1671 RITF-Luc and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells (Clontech Laboratories; Palo Alto, CA). To confirm correct orientation and preservation of the start codon of luciferase, plasmid DNA was subjected to restriction mapping and sequencing of the insertion junctions. A construct consisting of the −1671 RITF promoter driving the human growth hormone gene was prepared in the following manner: −1671 RITF-Luc was digested to completion with BamHI and BglII to release the full length of the 5′-flanking region. The ∼1.7-kb BamHI- BglII fragment was isolated electrophoretically on a 1% agarose gel and isolated by GELase as above. pΦGH (Nichols Institute; San Juan Capistrano, CA), a plasmid containing a polycloning site preceding the human growth hormone gene, was digested with BamHI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. To increase the efficiency of cloning, BamHI-cut and dephosphorylated pΦGH was ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and unligated plasmid was electrophoretically separated from undigested and religated plasmid on a 1% agarose gel and isolated using Geneclean (BIO 101). The BamHI- BglII fragment of −1671 RITF-Luc and BamHI-cut pΦGH were ligated using T4 DNA ligase, taking advantage of the compatibility of BamHI and BglII cohesive ends. DH5α E. coli were transformed and minipreps of plasmid DNA digested with EcoRI to screen for clones with correct insert orientation. The new plasmid, −1671 RITF-hGH, was sequenced at both insert junctions and through the translational start site of the growth hormone gene to confirm the proper sequence of the insert and the initiation site of translation. Deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the RITF gene driving the luciferase gene were derived from the −1671 RITF-Luc construct taking advantage of convenient restriction sites. For −980 RITF-Luc, the HincII- XhoI fragment of the 5′-flanking region was isolated from −1671 RITF-Luc by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and agarose digestion using GELase followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 3 M ammonium hydroxide. Gel-isolated HincII- XhoI fragment was ligated into pXP2 digested with SmaI and XhoI. Plasmid −704 RITF-Luc was derived by digestion of −1671 RITF-Luc with XbaI followed by Klenow treatment of the 5′ overhang to make it blunt. Plasmid was then cut with XhoI and the XbaI- XhoI fragment isolated from an agarose gel as above. The XbaI- XhoI fragment was ligated into pXP2 digested with SmaI and XhoI. Further deletion plasmids, −664 RITF-Luc, −331 RITF-Luc, and −153 RITF-Luc, were constructed by treatment of −1671 RITF-Luc with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease after creation of a 5′ overhang using BamHI digestion to cut the plasmid at the 5′ end of the promoter insert (Erase-a-Base System, Promega). All plasmids were transformed into DH5α E. coli, grown in LB media, and plated out. Positive colonies were selected by the method of Grunstein (35Grunstein M. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3961-3965Google Scholar) using a 240-bp probe of the 3′-most end of the 5′-flanking region of RITF generated by PCR. Synthetic 19-mer primers for PCR were selected based on the known sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the RITF gene and subjected to denaturing at 95°C, annealing at 42°C, and extension at 72°C for 30 cycles, followed by a terminal extension at 72°C for 8 min. Correct size of probe was confirmed on agarose gel and identity confirmed by mapping with restriction digestions. Probe was radiolabeled by nick translation with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP. Unincorporated nucleotide was eliminated chromatographically using a Primerase column (Stratagene). All deletion constructs were mapped by restriction digestion and the insert-vector junctions confirmed by sequencing as above. Plasmid for transfections was prepared by alkaline lysis and resin column purification (Qiagen; Chatsworth, CA). Plasmid preparation purity was confirmed by A260/ A280of >1.6, and supercoiling of DNA was established by the appearance on agarose gel electrophoresis prior to use in transfection experiments. Caco-2 cells, an intestinal cell line capable of enterocyte-like differentiation obtained from the ATCC, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter D-glucose, 25 m M HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum, 4 m ML-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Caco-2 cells were grown at confluence for at least 2 weeks prior to use in transfections. LS174T cell line also obtained from the ATCC was maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Eagle's balanced salt solution, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The H2 subclone of the HT-29 cell line obtained as a gift from Dr. Daniel Louvard was grown in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glucose (nondifferentiating conditions) or in the presence of galactose as the sole source of carbohydrate to induce goblet cell-like differentiation as described previously (36Huet C. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Coudrier E. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 345-357Google Scholar, 37Phillips T.E. Huet C. Bilbo P.R. Podolsky D.K. Louvard D. Neutra M.R. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 1390-1403Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in 5% CO2at 37°C. Transfection was accomplished by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Sixteen hours prior to transfection, 8 × 105cells were plated out in triplicate in 35-mm wells of a six-well cell culture plate. Complete media was refreshed 2 h prior to transfection. Efficiency of transfection was standardized by co-precipitation of the construct of interest with pTK-GH, consisting of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving the human growth hormone gene as a reporter gene (38Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Google Scholar), and adjusting for the amount of human growth hormone expressed, as determined by a commercially available radioimmunoassay (hGH Allegro Kit; Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid DNA was added to each well and incubated at constant 5% CO2for 4 h before a 2-min exposure to 15% glycerol. Cells were subsequently cultured for 48 h prior to assay for reporter gene expression. For luciferase activity, cells were lysed and assayed immediately for light production in the presence of luciferase substrate using a commercial luciferase assay system (Promega) measured in a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Monolite 2010). Luciferase activity was expressed as relative light units. All luciferase activity was adjusted for transfection efficiency reflected in the level of growth hormone, expressed as nanograms of hGH/ml of medium. Where noted, promoter activity was expressed as a percentage of the expression of the maximal promoter construct RSV-Luc (a gift from Dr. Loyal Tillotson), consisting of the RSV promoter joined to the luciferase gene.

Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 1390-1403Google Scholar) was grown in differentiating and undifferentiating media (as described for H2 cells) in cell culture flasks with a removable glass slide bottom for subsequent immunostaining (Lab-Tek Chamber Slide System; Nunc, Naperville, IL). N2 cells were seeded as 5 × 105cells/flask 16 h prior to transfection. Complete medium was replaced with serum-free medium and 2 μg/flask plasmid DNA, either −1671RITF-hGH or pTKGH, was combined with 1.5 μl of cationic liposome (Transfectam; Promega) and added to the cells in culture. Sixteen hours later, complete medium was returned to the cells. After 48 h of further culture, cells were fixed and dried. Slides were blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum for 30 min at 25°C and then incubated with guinea pig-anti-human growth hormone (Arnel; New York, NY) at 1:20,000 in L4-1-3 supernatant (a mouse monoclonal anti-human mucin previously described; Ref. 39Podolsky D.K. Fournier D.A. Lynch K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1251-1262Google Scholar) for 1 h at 25°C. After washing with PBS, slides were further incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat-anti-guinea pig IgG (Cappel; Durham, NC) 0.12 mg/ml and fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) 0.24 mg/ml at 25°C for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS, drying, and mounting with glycerol:PBS (6:1). Samples were examined using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 scanning confocal imaging system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Zeiss; New York). The fluorescence of fluorescein-anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-anti-guinea pig IgG was excited using the 488- and 568-nm lines, respectively, of the argon-krypton mixed gas laser in the confocal microscope. The confocal parameters of scan rate, aperture, gain, black level, and frames accumulated were the same for all samples. The rat genomic library was screened with the full-length cDNA probe of rat ITF. This probe has been shown previously to specifically hybridize with ITF mRNA in Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization (17Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc"

This group of mutants also demonstrated a spectrum of substitutions at P1′. Kinetic analyses of selected variants identified P1Tyr and P1His as the most efficient tPA-specific inhibitors, with second-order rate constants (ki) of 4.0 × 105M−1s−1and 3.6 × 105M−1s−1, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2076532479,"The herpes simplex virus helicase-primase complex, a heterotrimer of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 proteins, displays a single predominant site of primer synthesis on ϕX174 virion DNA (Tenney, D. J., Hurlburt, W. W., Micheletti, P. M., Bifano, M., and Hamatake, R. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5030-5035). This site was mapped and found to be deoxycytosine-rich, directing the synthesis of a primer initiating with several guanine residues. The size and sequence requirements for primer synthesis were determined using oligonucleotides containing variations of the predominant template. Although the efficiency of primer synthesis on oligonucleotides was influenced by template size, it was absolutely dependent on nucleotide sequence. Conversely, the ATPase activity on oligonucleotide templates was dependent on template size rather than nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, only oligonucleotides containing primase templates were inhibitory in a coupled primase-polymerase assay using ϕX174 DNA as template, suggesting that primer synthesis or primase turnover is rate-limiting. Additionally, stimulation of helicase-primase by the UL8 component and that by the ICP8 protein were shown to differ mechanistically using different templates: the UL8 component stimulated the rate of primer synthesis on ϕX174 virion DNA and oligonucleotide templates, while ICP8 stimulation occurred only on ϕX174 virion DNA.

The size and sequence requirements for primer synthesis were determined using oligonucleotides containing variations of the predominant template. Although the efficiency of primer synthesis on oligonucleotides was influenced by template size, it was absolutely dependent on nucleotide sequence. Conversely, the ATPase activity on oligonucleotide templates was dependent on template size rather than nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, only oligonucleotides containing primase templates were inhibitory in a coupled primase-polymerase assay using ϕX174 DNA as template, suggesting that primer synthesis or primase turnover is rate-limiting. Additionally, stimulation of helicase-primase by the UL8 component and that by the ICP8 protein were shown to differ mechanistically using different templates: the UL8 component stimulated the rate of primer synthesis on ϕX174 virion DNA and oligonucleotide templates, while ICP8 stimulation occurred only on ϕX174 virion DNA. Replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) 1The abbreviations used are: HSVherpes simplex virus type 1PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA during infection utilizes viral proteins that display functions conserved throughout DNA replication systems. The viral proteins that are essential in vivo include a heterodimeric processive DNA polymerase, a heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and an origin of DNA replication-binding protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Challberg M.D. Semin. Virol. 1991; 2: 247-256Google Scholar and 2Weller S.K. Wagner E.K. Herpesvirus Transcription and Its Regulation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 105-135Google Scholar). The helicase-primase complex, composed of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 proteins (UL5/8/52), possesses helicase, DNA-dependent NTPase, and primase activities (3Crute J.J. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R.

By virtue of these activities and analogies with other systems, the helicase-primase complex is thought to unwind DNA at the replication fork (helicase) and to synthesize oligoribonucleotide primers for use by DNA polymerase (primase). herpes simplex virus type 1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In vitro, a subassembly of the UL5 and UL52 proteins displays the activities of the heterotrimer (6Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3573-3578Google Scholar, 7Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R.

However, aside from low levels of NTPase activity from the UL5 protein (9Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar), 2J. J. Crute, personal communication. the individual subunits of the helicase-primase complex are inactive (6Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3573-3578Google Scholar, 7Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Google Scholar, 9Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar, 10Parry M.E. Stow N.D. Marsden H.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 607-612Google Scholar). This has made assignment of individual functions to the specific subunits difficult. Recent mutational analysis of the UL52 protein has been used to suggest its role in the primase rather than helicase activity of the UL5/52 subassembly (12Klinedinst D.K. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3693-3701Google Scholar, 13Dracheva S. Koonin E.V. Crute J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of conserved helicase domains in UL5 eliminates virus replication (14Zhu L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 469-479Google Scholar) and abolishes low levels of NTPase activity of the isolated UL5 subunit.2However, both UL5 and UL52 are required for helicase activity (6Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3573-3578Google Scholar).2 The UL8 protein has been shown to have an auxiliary role in primase activity in vitro (9Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar), specifically in stimulating the level of primer synthesis (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). UL8 also facilitates a functional interaction of helicase-primase with the HSV single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) in vitro, resulting in increased primer synthesis when the complex also contains UL8. 3R. K. Hamatake, M. Bifano, W. W. Hurlburt, and D. J. Tenney, manuscript in preparation. UL8 has also been implicated in directing nuclear localization of the heterotrimeric complex in vivo (15Calder J.M. Stow E.C. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 531-538Google Scholar) and in the formation of a complex of helicase-primase with the origin-binding protein (16McLean G.W. Abbotts A.P. Parry M.E. Marsden H.S. Stow N.D J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2699-2706Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies using an in vitro model of HSV rolling circle replication were used to demonstrate that UL8 is required for the synthesis of long leading strands of DNA. 4J. Gottlieb and M. D. Challberg, personal communication. In general, template sequence requirements for primases are thought to be rather nonspecific to enable primers to be synthesized frequently during lagging strand DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 17Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 275-306Google Scholar). On the other hand, the primases of Escherichia coli (18Swart J.R. Griep M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar), as well as the mammalian polymerase-α-primase complex (23Yamaguchi M. Hendrickson E.A. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1170-1183Google Scholar) have all been shown to invoke some level of template specificity for their initiation. Here we identify the predominant HSV primase initiation site within the ϕX174 virion DNA template and use DNA oligonucleotides to define the size and sequence requirements for primer synthesis. In contrast with primer synthesis, the ATPase activity of helicase-primase was found to be independent of nucleotide sequence. We also use oligonucleotide templates to further characterize the activity of the enzyme and to distinguish the stimulation of primer synthesis by the UL8 component of helicase-primase from that by HSV ICP8 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Single-stranded ϕX174 and M13 virion DNAs were from New England Biolabs Inc. and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. ϕX174 DNA sequence numbering was according to the GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank (accession number J02482) (24Sanger F.

Oligonucleotide DNAs were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX), except for those containing the HSV origin of replication (25Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell.

These were similar to those used by Hazuda et al. (26Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Google Scholar) and were obtained from National Biosciences (Plymouth, MN). Polyadenosine, polyguanosine, polydeoxyadenosine, and polydeoxythymidine were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. HSV proteins were expressed by recombinant baculovirus infection of Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen). Baculoviruses expressing the HSV UL5, UL8, and UL52 proteins (27Dodson M.S. Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar) were a generous gift of I. Robert Lehman. The baculoviruses expressing the HSV UL42 (29Hamatake R.K. Bifano M. Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Cordingley M.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2181-2189Google Scholar) and ICP8 (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) proteins were described previously. Insect cells were cultured in spinner flasks with large micocarrier impellers (Bellco Glass, Inc.) containing serum-free Sf900 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.1% (w/v) pluronic F-68 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin to 100 μg/ml. Purification of the recombinant HSV DNA polymerase-UL42 complex and ICP8 (28Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar) and of the UL5/52 subassembly and UL8 (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) was described previously. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients (30Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar) based on predicted amino acid sequences. Primase-dependent HSV DNA polymerase activity was assayed as described (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) in reactions modified from those of Sherman et al. (9Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar). [3H]dTTP (78 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) incorporation using 50 ng of ϕX174 virion DNA template (28.6 fmol of circular molecules) was terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (29Hamatake R.K. Bifano M. Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Cordingley M.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2181-2189Google Scholar). HSV DNA polymerase-UL42, ICP8, UL5/52, and UL8 were added as indicated. Although not extensively characterized, HSV helicase-primase is most active in this assay, where ~400-1000 molecules of the primase are required for the extension of a single primer by HSV DNA polymerase. 5D. J. Tenney and R. K. Hamatake, unpublished observations. Primer synthesis assays were carried out as described (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). 10-μl reactions contained ϕX174 virion DNA at a 30 μg/ml nucleotide concentration (17 n M circular molecules) except where noted. Oligonucleotide DNAs were used at 2 μM linear molecules. Products were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide, Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) gels and visualized by autoradiography. Kinetic analysis of primer production was performed with various concentrations of 50-mer oligonucleotide template (see Table I, o50) and 1.88 pmol of UL5/52 with or without 5.6 pmol of UL8. Autoradiographs were scanned using an LKB laser densitometer and analyzed using Gelscan XL software (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Vmax and Km values were determined using KinetAsyst II software (IntelliKinetics, Inc.), which fit the amount of primers synthesized (v) to the following equation: v = Vmax⋅S/(Km + S). Vmax is expressed in absorbance units from scanning laser densitometry of autoradiographs, and Km for the DNA template is expressed in micromolar nucleotide.Table I:Oligonucleotides used as templates Open table in a new tab Following radiolabeled primer synthesis on ϕX174 DNA, dNTPs were added to 50 μM each along with MgCl2to ≈≈10 m M and 0.25 units of modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, United States Biochemical Corp.). Radiolabeled primers were extended during incubation at 37°C for 60 min. The resultant double-stranded DNA molecules were digested with restriction enzymes and resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 4% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), TBE gels and by denaturing PAGE using 7 M urea, 8% acrylamide, TBE gels, followed by autoradiography. Size markers consisted of restriction enzyme-digested ϕX174 replicative factor I (supercoiled) DNA that was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Assays for DNA-dependent ATPase activity were modified from the method of Crute et al. (3Crute J.J. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6585-6596Google Scholar) and contained 50 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 2 m M ATP, 4 m M MgCl2, 1 m M dithiothreitol, and 10-20 μg/ml M13 virion effector DNA in a 50-μl total volume. Incubation was for 30 min at 30°C. The hydrolysis of ATP was determined by the release of inorganic phosphate (31Lanzetta E.P. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Google Scholar) by adding 20 μl of the reaction to 300 μl of 0.03375% (w/v) malachite green, 0.3% ammonium molybdate. Absorbance at 620 nm was measured. We reported previously that HSV helicase-primase synthesizes primers at predominant sites within ϕX174 and M13 virion DNA templates (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). To investigate the template specificity of the enzyme, we mapped the predominant site within ϕX174 DNA. Radiolabeled primers were synthesized on ϕX174 DNA with HSV helicase-primase. Incubation of the primed ϕX174 molecules with DNA polymerase and dNTPs resulted in a completely double-stranded DNA molecule except for a nick or gap at the original site of primer initiation. The DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases, and the products were resolved by native PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The predominant radiolabeled primer was localized to the 770-base pair HincII fragment (nucleotides 2593-3362). Further digestions mapped the primer to the 270-base pair HincII- SacII fragment (nucleotides 2593-2862) and the 182-base pair HinfI- SacII fragment (nucleotides 2681-2862). This primer was synthesized at multiple concentrations of enzyme and in the presence or absence of the UL8 subunit (Fig. 1 A). Resolution of the primer-initiated product from the HincII digestion by denaturing PAGE revealed it to be 112 nucleotides in length, thus originating 112 nucleotides from the HincII site at nucleotide 2593, corresponding with a primer initiation at ϕX174 nucleotide 2705 (Fig. 1 B). Although Fig. 1 B shows the total product from the HincII digestion, the purified radiolabeled 770-nucleotide product from nondenaturing PAGE was also 112 nucleotides in length on denaturing PAGE (data not shown). The template was found to be deoxycytosine-rich, directing the synthesis of a guanine-rich primer. The size of the predominant primer synthesized was previously estimated to be 12 nucleotides based on comparison with end-labeled poly(A), partially digested with ribonuclease U2 (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). By comparison with similarly digested radiolabeled poly(G), however, we now surmise that the primer is 10 nucleotides in length (data not shown). This estimate is supported by the results presented below. Therefore, the sequence of the primer synthesized using the predominant template is 5′-GGGAGGGUAG-3′. Examination of the sequence surrounding ϕX174 nucleotide 2705 revealed several areas of potential secondary structure (data not shown). By analogy with other primases (reviewed in Ref. 17Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 275-306Google Scholar), secondary structure could potentially facilitate initiation by HSV helicase-primase. We tested the ability of an oligonucleotide containing the sequence surrounding the predominant site but with little potential for secondary structure (Table I, oligonucleotide o50) to serve as a template for primer synthesis. The results (Fig. 2 A) indicate that the oligonucleotide is able to serve as a template for the synthesis of the same size primer as that produced using the ϕX174 virion DNA molecule using [α-32P]UTP labeling. Furthermore, the addition of the UL8 component to the UL5/52 subassembly increased the amount of primers synthesized on the oligonucleotide as well as the ϕX174 circular molecule (compare - and + UL8 lanes). The two faster migrating bands of lower intensity were found by RNase sequencing to initiate with one or two G residues rather than three G residues of the 10-mer (data not shown). An oligonucleotide with the complementary sequence to o50 (Table I, o50r) could not be used as a template (Fig. 2 A). These results confirm the mapping of the preferred site and suggest that nucleotide sequence and not secondary structure most likely determines recognition by the enzyme. Interestingly, oligonucleotides containing 84 nucleotides that comprise the entire HSV origin of replication sequence (ori1 and ori2; see “Experimental Procedures” for sequence), including deoxycytosine-rich regions similar to the mapped template in ϕX174, also failed to serve as substrates for primer synthesis (Fig. 2 A). The template activity of oligonucleotide o50 was confirmed further using labeling conditions with [α-32P]CTP instead of and in combination with [α-32P]UTP (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that a DNA oligomer can serve as a template for the HSV primase and establish the importance of template sequence in initiation of primer synthesis. The next series of experiments was designed to determine the influence of oligonucleotide template size and nucleotide sequence on primer synthesis. Fig. 3 A shows the result of truncating the template at the 3′- and 5′-ends. The autoradiograph is overexposed to enable visualization of very low levels of primers synthesized. Truncation of the template generally resulted in lower levels of primers; however, some changes abolished primer production. Truncation to 12 nucleotides (o12) still resulted in template activity. Truncation of the 3′-A residue of o12 to form o11B resulted in a marked reduction in the amounts of primer synthesized, although the size of the primers was unchanged. Truncation of the next 3′-residue (G) in o10B resulted in undetectable levels of primer synthesis. Deletion of CTP from the synthesis reaction had no effect using o12 as a template (data not shown); therefore, this 3′-G residue is not copied into the primer. Restoration of the 3′-AG sequence with simultaneous truncation of the template 5′-end enabled primer synthesis; however, the major products were reduced in size to nine and eight nucleotides with the o11A and o10A templates, respectively. These results suggest that the 3′-AG sequence is important to primer synthesis, warranting further investigation (see below). Additionally, oligonucleotides could be truncated to 11 nucleotides (o11B, 3′-GCCCTCCCATC-5′; the underlined residue is the first base copied into the primer or primer position 1) and still provide a template for synthesis of the 10-mer primer. Although removal of the 5′-A residue did not allow labeling of the primer by incorporation of [α-32P]UTP (o9), movement of the A residue farther 3′ restored labeling of a seven-nucleotide product (Fig. 3 A, o9A). These results show that a DNA as small as nine nucleotides can serve as a template for the HSV primase. The results of changes in template sequence are shown in Fig. 3 B. The wild-type oligomer template used for these studies was o12 (Fig. 3 B). The importance of the 3′-AG-5′ residues at the 3′-end of the template (Fig. 3 B, o12) was seen after primase activity was abolished with changes to 3′-TT-5′ (Fig. 3 B, o12TT) or to 3′-GA-5′ (o12AG). In addition to its ability to synthesize smaller primers (see above), the HSV primase could produce larger products when an insertion of an extra C residue (o16A) resulted in lengthening of the 10-mer primer to 11 nucleotides. The next set of oligonucleotide templates examined the effect of insertion of a T residue (or an A residue in the T position, S-3) in different positions within the central seven positions of the 12-base template. The results above with o9A (Fig. 3 A) showed that a change at primer position 7 (C to A in the template) did not eliminate primer synthesis and, in fact, resulted in a template with relatively high activity. Oligonucleotides S-1 through S-6 represent changes in template sequence giving rise to changes in primer residues 6 through 1, respectively. The results using oligonucleotides S-1 through S-4 suggest that a change in any of the template positions directing synthesis of primer nucleotides 3-6 result in a marked decrease, but not elimination, of primer synthesis when compared with wild-type o12 (Fig. 3 B). A change in primer position 2 (S-5) virtually eliminated primer synthesis, while one at primer position 1 (S-6) only slightly decreased the abundance of primers (Fig. 3 B). These results show that the sequence at each position within this preferred template sequence in ϕX174 DNA contribute to the magnitude of the predominant primer synthesized. To investigate whether the preferred template usage by HSV helicase-primase was determined by the ability of the enzyme to bind to the DNA template, we investigated the ATPase activity of the enzyme on various oligonucleotide substrates. The results presented in indicate that ATPase activity is more dependent upon template size than on the ability to serve as a template for primer synthesis. Several oligonucleotides that did not serve as templates for detectable direct primer synthesis activity served as excellent templates for ATPase activity (Table II). The correlation of HSV helicase-primase NTPase activity and template size parallels the findings with T4 helicase-primase (32Liu C.-C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2813-2820Google Scholar) and suggests that primase template activity, but not ATPase template activity, is absolutely dependent upon nucleotide sequence.Table II:ATPase activity and inhibition of coupled primase-polymerase activity using oligonucleotide DNAs Open table in a new tab The preferred oligonucleotide templates were used to examine the function of helicase-primase in the coupled primase-polymerase assay. This assay measures HSV DNA polymerase activity that is dependent upon primer synthesis on a single-stranded ϕX174 virion DNA template. 20, 80, 150, 300, or 2000 ng of test oligonucleotide was incubated on ice with UL5/52 for 30 min, followed by the addition of other proteins and reaction components. Titration of oligonucleotides containing the preferred primer synthesis template into the assay inhibited the polymerase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 results (in nanograms of oligonucleotide) are presented in Table II. Oligonucleotides that could not serve as primase templates did not reduce coupled primase-polymerase activity to 50% of control levels when added at concentrations as high as 2 μg. Inhibition was confirmed to be specific for the HSV helicase-primase complex using o25, o17A, o17, and o17NEG. The oligonucleotides that inhibited the coupled HSV primase-polymerase assay (o25, o17A, and o17) did not inhibit HSV DNA polymerase-UL42 or modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase) activity on a singly primed ϕX174 template or polymerase-α-primase activity (data not shown). Oligonucleotide o17NEG, which did not serve as a template for primase activity, did not inhibit any of the activities (data not shown). We interpret these results to indicate that primase oligonucleotide templates compete for primase activity with the ϕX174 DNA template, while those oligonucleotides that do not direct the synthesis of a primer do not compete. The fact that these oligonucleotides are suitable substrates for ATPase activity indicates that primase activity, but not ATPase activity, is required and limiting in the coupled primase-polymerase assay. The UL8 component of the HSV helicase-primase complex stimulates the rate of primer synthesis by a subassembly of the UL5 and UL52 components on a ϕX174 circular DNA template (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) and on oligonucleotide templates (Figs. 1 and 2). ICP8, the HSV single-stranded DNA-binding protein, also stimulates primer synthesis on the ϕX174 virion DNA template by helicase-primase when it contains the UL8 protein.3The mechanism by which either of these proteins stimulates the primase is unknown, although neither UL8 nor ICP8 changes the preferred primase initiation site in ϕX174 DNA.5To learn more about stimulation of primase activity by the UL8 and ICP8 proteins, we tested their effects on the 50-mer oligonucleotide template. Stimulation of primer synthesis on ϕX174 virion DNA by the ICP8 protein can be seen in Fig. 4, although a more in-depth study is presented elsewhere.3The optimum ratio of ICP8 to DNA was established using the ϕX174 template (Fig. 4). Primer synthesis by UL5/8/52 was increased by increasing amounts of ICP8 to a maximum of one molecule of ICP8/40 nucleotides of DNA. ICP8 also stimulates the ATPase activity of UL5/8/52 on ϕX174 DNA and is optimum at a similar ratio of ICP8 to DNA.3ICP8 inhibited primer synthesis at a level of one molecule/20 nucleotides, the level that is optimum for stimulation of HSV polymerase (28Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the ICP8 molecule binding 12-40 nucleotides of DNA (33O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Google Scholar, 34Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Google Scholar), thereby excluding the binding of helicase-primase. To compare the effect of ICP8 on primer synthesis, we varied the DNA template concentration at this optimum ratio of one ICP8 molecule/50 nucleotides (Fig. 5). Primer synthesis on the ϕX174 DNA template was increased by ICP8 at various ICP8/DNA concentrations (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, on the o50 template, the level of primers was unaffected by the addition of ICP8 (Fig. 5 B). This finding differs from that with UL8, where stimulation of primer synthesis occurs on both ϕX174 circles and oligonucleotide templates (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the mechanism of stimulation of primer synthesis differs between the UL8 and ICP8 proteins because the stimulation by ICP8 may depend on the nature of the DNA template. The stimulation of primer synthesis by UL8 was examined further through kinetic analysis using different amounts of the oligonucleotide DNA template. Previously, a ϕX174 DNA template was used to show that UL8 increased the rate of primer synthesis by a subassembly of the UL5 and UL52 proteins (~3-fold), but did not change the Km for DNA (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). Using various amounts of oligonucleotide o50 as a template, kinetic analysis revealed that the rate of primer synthesis by UL5/52 (Vmax) on the oligonucleotide template was increased in the presence of UL8 ~10-fold from 0.6 to 5.9 relative absorbance units. In addition, the Km for the DNA template was increased using the oligonucleotide from 3.3 μM without UL8 to 8.8 μM with UL8. This increase in Km for DNA upon the addition of UL8 is consistent with filter binding studies using fragments of ϕX174 DNA,5suggesting that primer synthesis on oligonucleotide templates may be more sensitive to UL8-induced changes in helicase-primase than is primer synthesis on circular templates. The fact that stimulation of primer synthesis by the UL8 subunit is greater on the oligonucleotide template suggests that this template may provide a better substrate for further analysis of the mechanism of UL8 activity than circular DNA molecules. The HSV helicase-primase complex displays relatively low specific activity in vitro on a poly(dT) DNA template (4Crute J.J. Tsurumi T. Zhu L. Weller S.K. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2186-2189Google Scholar, 7Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Google Scholar). Additionally, the UL8 component of helicase-primase stimulates activity on natural but not homopolymer templates (9Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar).3These results first indicated that the activity of the complex or its subunits may display template specificity. We sought to determine the template specificity for primer synthesis by helicase-primase to further examine its activity in vitro and to distinguish the effects of various stimulatory factors including the UL8 component (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) and ICP8.3 We mapped a single predominant site of HSV helicase-primase primer synthesis on the ϕX174 DNA template. This site was preferentially utilized regardless of whether the UL5/52 subassembly or the UL5/8/52 heterotrimer was used (Ref. 11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar and this report). DNA oligonucleotides containing the ϕX174 sequence at this site were used to confirm the mapping and to examine the requirements for primer synthesis. Template secondary structure was not required as oligonucleotides with virtually no potential for secondary structure could still direct specific primer initiation. Specificity was not at the level of binding to the DNA as the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the helicase-primase complex was independent of the preferred template sequence. These results do not, however, exclude the possibility of functionally separate single-stranded DNA-binding sites for the different activities. This theory is consistent with demonstration of weak ATPase activity of the isolated UL5 subunit2and localization of the primase activity within the UL52 subunit (12Klinedinst D.K. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3693-3701Google Scholar, 13Dracheva S. Koonin E.V. Crute J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). The predominant template sequence in ϕX174 DNA was found to be 3′-AGCCCTCCCA-5′, with primer synthesis beginning at the 3′-most C residue (underlined; primer position 1). A 10-nucleotide [α-32P]UTP-labeled primer was produced on the ϕX174 molecule and on oligonucleotides long enough to support its synthesis. Only the 3′-penultimate G residue of the template was absolutely required for primer synthesis; substitutions at any one of the other positions decreased but did not eliminate primer synthesis. Substitution of the template C residue at the 4th position from the 3′-end (primer position 2) virtually eliminated primer synthesis. Substitution of the C residue at primer position 1 had relatively little effect, while substitutions at any of the primer positions 3-6 decreased but did not eliminate primer synthesis. Although primer levels were increased by extension of the preferred template at either the 3′- or 5′-ends, the smallest template tested, nine nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, o9A), yielded detectable specific primer synthesis. Although secondary structure contributes to DNA template recognition by several characterized primases, these enzymes also display specificity for nucleotide sequence of the template (reviewed in Ref. 17Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 275-306Google Scholar). These include E. coli dnaG primase recognition of the sequence 3′-GTC-5′ with synthesis of a primer initiating with 5′-pppAG-3′ (18Swart J.R. Griep M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12970-12976Google Scholar, 19Yoda K.-Y. Yasuda H. Jiang X.-W. Okazaki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6531-6546Google Scholar), T4 primase recognition of 3′-TTG-5′ or 3′-TCG-5′ with synthesis of a primer initiating with 5′-pppAC-3′ or 5′-pppGC-3′ (35Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Google Scholar, 36Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Google Scholar), T7 primase recognition of 3′-CTGG(T/G) or 3′-CTGTG-5′ with synthesis of a primer initiating with 5′-pppACC(A/C)-3′ or 5′-pppACAC (22Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar, 37Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase-α-primase recognition of 3′-CPyPy-5′ (where Py is pyrimidine) with synthesis of a primer initiating with purine residues (23Yamaguchi M. Hendrickson E.A. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1170-1183Google Scholar). HSV primase is similar to other characterized primases in that it initiates with a purine residue. However, while the prokaryotic enzymes do not tolerate changes in the consensus template sequences, changes in individual template residues, aside from the 3′-G residue, did not eliminate HSV primase activity. Another characteristic that was found to be consistent with other primases is that recognition of the template by HSV primase required a residue at the 3′-side of the primer initiation sequence that was not copied into the primer. This G residue, in the case of HSV primase, could not be truncated or substituted by an A or T residue. The fact that an oligonucleotide extending only 2 bases past this 3′-G residue was able to serve as a template distinguished HSV primase from E. coli and T7 primases, which require at least six nucleotides 3′ to the 3′-GTC-5′ initiation site (18Swart J.R. Griep M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12970-12976Google Scholar, 22Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar). The site of primer synthesis by HSV helicase-primase on ϕX174 DNA mapped in this study is only the most predominant, although other sites are used (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). We believe, however, that primer synthesis at this site accurately reflects the activity of the enzyme in vitro. Perhaps a number of factors contributed to the preference for this initiation site including sequence of flanking DNA as well as labeling conditions. As with other primases, other sites may be preferred under different reaction conditions (23Yamaguchi M. Hendrickson E.A. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1170-1183Google Scholar, 35Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Google Scholar). Nevertheless, sites selectively used under particular labeling conditions are a subset of those utilized under nonselective conditions where all primers synthesized can be examined (35Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Google Scholar). In addition, the sequence mapped in this study also served as a template when labeling with [α-32P]CTP (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the levels of primers synthesized on the predominant template correlated with the amount of primase activity in the coupled primase-polymerase assay under nonselective conditions (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). More detailed analyses, including those that directly examine the sequence of primers made at many template sites (37Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Google Scholar), are needed to determine the exact template sequence requirements for HSV primase. It is important to note that concurrent with this work, Gottlieb and Challberg4have determined the preferential sites of HSV primase initiation on a single-stranded E. coli vector (pBluescript) using [α-32P]CTP labeling. The template sequences mapped in their work have nucleotide sequences similar to that of the template mapped here. Oligonucleotides that contained the preferred primase template sequence of HSV helicase-primase were used in further studies of the enzyme. We found that although oligonucleotides may serve as equivalent substrates for the ATPase activity (and therefore binding) of HSV helicase-primase, only those containing a specific initiation site competed for coupled primase-polymerase activity. Therefore, the primase and not the ATPase activity of the enzyme appeared to be limiting for DNA synthesis on single-stranded templates. Our results could be due to temporal sequestration of the enzyme by oligonucleotides containing the template sequence during synthesis of a primer. To determine the precise role of the ATPase, helicase, and primase functions of helicase-primase, more complex systems, such as in vitro models of HSV rolling circle replication (38Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Google Scholar), will be required. Other primases have shown template-specific activity and changes in specificity depending on the presence of various subunits (18Swart J.R. Griep M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12970-12976Google Scholar, 22Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi M. Hendrickson E.A. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1170-1183Google Scholar, 36Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Google Scholar, 39Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Google Scholar, 40Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10879-10885Google Scholar). We found, however, that neither the UL8 component of helicase-primase nor the ICP8 single-stranded DNA-binding protein altered the preferential site of initiation on the ϕX174 DNA molecule (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar).5Therefore, the mechanism of in vitro stimulation of primer synthesis by these proteins is unrelated to initiation site specificity. The stimulatory effects of the two proteins, however, were distinguishable using primer synthesis on oligonucleotide templates. Kinetic studies were used to show that UL8 increased the rate of primer synthesis on oligonucleotide templates, similar to the findings using a circular template (11Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). This demonstrated that the effect of UL8 was likely to be independent of template secondary structure and nucleotide length. While the ICP8 protein requires the helicase-primase complex containing UL8 for its stimulatory effect, ICP8 did not increase primer synthesis on oligonucleotide templates at a range of concentrations. These results suggest that the UL8 component and the ICP8 protein act by different mechanisms to stimulate primer synthesis. Consistent with these results is the finding that the stimulatory properties of UL8 and ICP8 differ with respect to the ATPase activity of HSV helicase-primase using various effector DNA templates.3Further studies are needed to define the different mechanisms by which these proteins stimulate primer synthesis. We are indebted to I. Robert Lehman for the generous gift of recombinant baculoviruses expressing HSV helicase-primase and HSV DNA polymerase proteins and to Alan Wahl for providing HeLa S3 cells and suggestions for isolation of polymerase-α-primase. We appreciate insightful discussions during the course of this study with Carolyn DiIanni and Richard Colonno and suggestions regarding large-scale baculovirus infections from Steven Weinheimer. We also extend thanks to Patrick McCann for sequencing ladders and to James Crute, John Gottlieb, and Mark Challberg for communication of results prior to publication."
https://openalex.org/W1993516070,"Classic LCAT deficiency (CLD) and fish eye disease (FED) are two clinically distinct syndromes, associated with defects in the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene resulting in total (CLD) or partial (FED) enzyme deficiency.

Evaluation of mutant LCAT gene transcription by Northern blot analysis demonstrated LCAT mRNA of normal size and concentration. Although all constructs gave rise to similar intracellular LCAT mass, the amount of enzyme present in the media for LCAT<sup>147</sup>, LCAT<sup>156</sup>, and LCAT<sup>300</sup> was reduced to less than 10% of normal, suggesting that these mutations disrupted LCAT secretion. Western blot analysis of cell culture media containing wild type or mutant LCAT demonstrated the presence of a single normal-sized band of 67 kDa. The ability of the different enzymes to esterify free cholesterol in high density lipoprotein-like proteoliposomes (α-LCAT-specific activity) was reduced to less than 5% of normal for CLD mutants LCAT<sup>147</sup> and LCAT<sup>228</sup> and FED mutants LCAT<sup>4</sup>, LCAT<sup>123</sup>, LCAT<sup>293</sup>, and LCAT<sup>347</sup>, whereas that of LCAT<sup>156</sup>, LCAT<sup>158</sup>, and LCAT<sup>300</sup> ranged from 45 to 110% of control. Although most FED mutant LCAT enzymes retained the ability to esterify free cholesterol present in α- and β-lipoproteins of heat-inactivated plasma, esterification was undetectable in all CLD mutants (LCAT<sup>147</sup>, LCAT<sup>156</sup>, and LCAT<sup>228</sup>). In contrast, all mutant enzymes retained the ability to hydrolyze the water soluble, short-chained fatty acid substrate <i>p</i>-nitrophenolbutyrate. In summary, our studies establish the functional significance of nine LCAT gene defects associated with either FED or CLD. Characterization of the expressed LCAT mutants identified multiple, overlapping functional abnormalities that include defects in secretion and/or disruption of enzymic activity. All nine LCAT mutants retained the ability to hydrolyze the water-soluble PNPB substrate, indicating intact hydrolytic function. Based on these studies we propose that mutations in LCAT residues 147, 156, 228 (CLD) and 10, 123, 158, 293, 300, and 347 (FED) do not disrupt the functional domain mediating LCAT phospholipase activity, but alter structural domains involved in lipid binding or transesterification."
https://openalex.org/W1991468020,"When murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are induced to differentiate by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), erythroid-specific genes are transcriptionally activated; however, transcriptional activation of these genes is severely impaired in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A)-deficient MEL cells. The transcription factor NF-E2, composed of a 45-kDa (p45) and an 18-kDa (p18) subunit, is essential for enhancer activity of the globin locus control regions (LCRs). DNA binding of NF-E2 and alpha-globin LCR enhancer activity was significantly less in HMBA-treated protein kinase A-deficient cells compared to cells containing normal protein kinase A activity; DNA binding of several other transcription factors was the same in both cell types. In parental cells, HMBA treatment and/or prolonged activation of protein kinase A increased the amount of NF-E2.DNA complexes without change in DNA binding affinity; the expression of p45 and p18 was the same under all conditions. p45 and p18 were phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro, but the phosphorylation did not affect NF-E2.DNA complexes, suggesting that protein kinase A regulates NF-E2.DNA complex formation indirectly, e.g. by altering expression of a regulatory factor(s). Thus, protein kinase A appears to be necessary for increased NF-E2.DNA complex formation during differentiation of MEL cells and may influence erythroid-specific gene expression through this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1551171898,"The yeast ubiquitin (Ub) conjugating enzyme CDC34 plays a crucial role in the progression of the cell cycle from the G<sub>1</sub>to S phase. In an effort to identify proteins that interact with CDC34 we undertook a genetic screen to isolate genes whose increased expression suppressed the cell cycle defect associated with the <i>cdc34-2</i> temperature-sensitive allele. From this screen, the poly-Ub gene <i>UBI4</i> was identified as a moderately strong suppressor. The fact that the overexpression of a gene encoding a single Ub protein could also suppress the <i>cdc34-2</i> allele indicated that suppression was related to the increased abundance of Ub. Ub overexpression was found to suppress two other structurally unrelated <i>cdc34</i> mutations, in addition to the <i>cdc34-2</i> allele. In all three cases, suppression depended on the expression of Ub with an intact carboxyl terminus. Only the <i>cdc34-2</i> allele, however, could be suppressed by Ub with an amino acid substitution at lysine 48 which is known to be involved in multi-Ub chain assembly. Genetic results showing allele specific suppression of <i>cdc34</i> mutations by various Ub derivatives suggested a specific noncovalent interaction between Ub and CDC34. Consistent with this prediction, we have shown by chemical cross-linking the existence of a specific noncovalent Ub binding site on CDC34. Together, these genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that Ub suppression of these <i>cdc34</i> mutations results from the combined contributions of Ub-CDC34 thiol ester formation and a noncovalent interaction between Ub and CDC34 and therefore suggest that the correct positioning of Ub on a surface of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is a requirement of enzyme function."

https://openalex.org/W1484518952,"A HeLa S3 subline is unusual in accumulating relatively large amounts of glucosaminyl(acyl)phosphatidylinositol (GlcN(acyl)PI), a derivative of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in which both GlcN and a fatty acid are linked to inositol hydroxyl groups (D. Sevlever, D. Humphrey, and T. L. Rosenberry, submitted for publication). This lipid is a proposed intermediate on the biosynthetic pathway for glycosyl-PI (GPI) anchors of membrane proteins. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that exogenous inositol phospholipids can enter this biosynthetic pathway and be metabolized to GlcN(acyl)PI. When HeLa S3 cells were incubated for 24 h with exogenous PI or sn-1-acyl-2- lyso-phosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI) labeled with 3H in the inositol group, 25-30% of the label was recovered in cell-associated lipids and most of the remaining 70-75% in hydrophilic metabolites in the medium. The predominant labeled lipid was PI, with smaller amounts of lyso-PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and GlcN(acyl)PI. Both exogenous lipid precursors gave the same distribution of labeled lipids, and a similar distribution was observed for endogenous inositol phospholipids metabolically labeled with [3H]inositol. Addition of excess inositol had no effect on the conversion of [3H]lyso-PI to [3H]GlcN(acyl)PI, indicating that the conversion did not result from breakdown to [3H]inositol followed by resynthesis. The cellular orientation of incorporated PI and lyso-PI was determined by incubating cells at 4°C with PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). This enzyme cleaves only PI and lyso-PI on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. After 24-h incubation with either precursor, only about 15% of cell-associated [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI was on the outer leaflet. However, more than 60% of the [3H]PI was on the outer leaflet after 1-h incubation with either precursor, suggesting that substantial sn-2 acylation of exogenous [3H]lyso-PI occurred in the outer leaflet. This suggestion was confirmed by examining labeled lipids in cells after uptake of [3H]lyso-PI at 4°C. No transmembrane translocation of lyso-PI, PI phosphorylation, or PI glycosylation occurred at this temperature, but some sn-2 acylation was apparent and more than 90% of the [3H]PI formed was on the outer leaflet. These data indicate that sn-2 acylation can occur in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, perhaps by transacylation from other cell surface phospholipids.

When HeLa S3 cells were incubated for 24 h with exogenous PI or sn-1-acyl-2- lyso-phosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI) labeled with 3H in the inositol group, 25-30% of the label was recovered in cell-associated lipids and most of the remaining 70-75% in hydrophilic metabolites in the medium. The predominant labeled lipid was PI, with smaller amounts of lyso-PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and GlcN(acyl)PI. Both exogenous lipid precursors gave the same distribution of labeled lipids, and a similar distribution was observed for endogenous inositol phospholipids metabolically labeled with [3H]inositol. Addition of excess inositol had no effect on the conversion of [3H]lyso-PI to [3H]GlcN(acyl)PI, indicating that the conversion did not result from breakdown to [3H]inositol followed by resynthesis. The cellular orientation of incorporated PI and lyso-PI was determined by incubating cells at 4°C with PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). This enzyme cleaves only PI and lyso-PI on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. After 24-h incubation with either precursor, only about 15% of cell-associated [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI was on the outer leaflet. However, more than 60% of the [3H]PI was on the outer leaflet after 1-h incubation with either precursor, suggesting that substantial sn-2 acylation of exogenous [3H]lyso-PI occurred in the outer leaflet. This suggestion was confirmed by examining labeled lipids in cells after uptake of [3H]lyso-PI at 4°C. No transmembrane translocation of lyso-PI, PI phosphorylation, or PI glycosylation occurred at this temperature, but some sn-2 acylation was apparent and more than 90% of the [3H]PI formed was on the outer leaflet. These data indicate that sn-2 acylation can occur in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, perhaps by transacylation from other cell surface phospholipids.

In the affected cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a somatic mutation blocks the first step in the GPI biosynthetic pathway, the linkage of GlcNAc to PI (Armstrong et al., 1992Armstrong C.

Iwamoto N. Kagimoto T. Takatsuki K. Nakakuma H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 571-579Google Scholar). As a consequence of the mutation, affected PNH cells fail to express GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, several of which are important in the regulation of complement activation (Yamashina et al., 1990Yamashina M. Ueda E. Kinoshita T. Takami T. Ojima A. Ono H. Tanaka H. Kondo N. Orii T. Okada N. Okada H. Inoue K. Kitani T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1184-1189Google Scholar). One possible therapeutic strategy for PNH is to provide exogenous GlcNAc-PI or other early precursors in the GPI biosynthetic pathway that could bypass the genetic block. As a prelude to investigating cell uptake of these PI derivatives, we have initiated studies on the uptake of exogenous PI and sn-1-acyl-2- lyso-phosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI). The spontaneous transfer of phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol from donor vesicles to cells is consistent with a monomer transfer model in which lipid monomers dissociate from the donor vesicles, diffuse through the aqueous phase, and associate with the cell membrane (Ferrell et al., 1985Ferrell J.E.

After cell association, the exogenous lipids can be transferred inside the cell by transbilayer translocation (flipping) or endocytosis. The incorporated lipids will be susceptible to further metabolism in compartments where the appropriate metabolic enzymes are available. phosphatidylinositol sn-1-acyl-2- lyso-phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate GlcN-PI with a fatty acid acyl group on inositol phospholipase A2 PI-specific phospholipase C glycoinositol phospholipid GPI-specific phospholipase D phosphatidylcholine sn-1-acyl-2- lyso-phosphatidylcholine paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Dulbecco' modifed Eagle' medium thin layer chromatography. A HeLa S3 subline was chosen as an initial model for uptake studies since these cells contain a significant amount of GlcN(acyl)PI (about 107molecules/cell), a proposed intermediate on the GPI biosynthetic pathway. 2D. Sevlever, D. R. Humphrey, and T. L. Rosenberry, submitted for publication. The goal of this study was to characterize the generation of radiolabeled lipids from exogenous PI or lyso-PI that were 3H-labeled in the inositol group. The steady-state levels of these labeled lipids were compared with those of endogenous inositol phospholipids labeled by incubation with [3H]inositol. After the addition of either [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI to the cells, we observed interconversion of PI and lyso-PI and a time-dependent appearance of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and GlcN(acyl)PI. This is the first report of the metabolic labeling of a free GPI with exogenous inositol phospholipid precursors. The transbilayer distribution of PI and lyso-PI was also studied with the use of PI-PLC to cleave PI and lyso-PI in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer. [3H]PI was taken directly from a commercial stock (DuPont NEN, 13 Ci/mmol) in ethanol. [3H]Lyso-PI and [32P]lyso-PI were prepared by phospholipase A2(PLA2, bee venom, Sigma) treatment either of commercial [3H]PI or of endogenous lipids produced by incubation of [3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., 20 Ci/mmol) or [32P]orthophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) with HeLa S3 cells. The 3H-labeled endogenous lipids were fractionated by chromatography on octyl-Sepharose with a linear gradient of 5-60% n-propyl alcohol in 100 m M NH4OAc,2and [3H]lyso-PI (1 Ci/mmol) was eluted at 35% n-propyl alcohol. The 32P-labeled lipids were resolved prior to PLA2treatment by TLC in CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COCH3/CH3COOH/H2O (30: 10: 40: 10: 5, v/v). The [32P]PI band was washed from the scraped silica with n-butyl alcohol and incubated with bee venom PLA2(0.1 mg/ml) in 5 m M Tris-Cl, 1 m M NaCl, 0.6 m M CaCl2(pH 8) at 25°C for 16 h, and the product [32P]lyso-PI was isolated by extraction as described (Darnell et al., 1991Darnell J.C. Osterman D.G. Saltiel A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 279-291Google Scholar). TLC mobilities of the metabolically labeled inositol phospholipids were calibrated by comparison to standard [3H]PI and [3H]lyso-PI derived from the commercial [3H]PI. Susceptibility of the [3H]lyso-PI and [32P]lyso-PI to PI-PLC, but not to PLA2, also was confirmed. Aliquots of radiolabeled inositol phospholipids in ethanol were added to serum-free medium (≤1% ethanol), and the mixtures (1-20 n M labeled lipid) were bath-sonicated for 5-10 min prior to incubation with cells. The distribution of metabolic products obtained from cells incubated with radiolabeled lyso-PI was the same when this precursor was derived from either commercial [3H]PI or endogenous labeling with [3H]inositol or [32P]orthophosphate. Furthermore, addition of exogenous PC or PI (10 μM) to the sonication mixture also did not affect the distribution of metabolic products from [3H]lyso-PI incorporation. HeLa S3 cells were maintained on a 60-mm diameter dish in 3 ml of Dulbecco' modified Eagle' medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc. or Celox), 10% horse serum or 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% CO2at 37°C until nearly confluent (4-8 × 106cells). The HeLa S3 line (a cloned HeLa cell line provided to the American Type Culture Collection after about 400 passages) was shown previously to produce mannosylated GPIs (Hirose et al., 1992Hirose S.

During passaging leading up to the current studies, these cells were collected by scraping from culture flasks rather than by trypsinization. The passaging and culture procedures reproducibly generated cells with a more rounded morphology and a much higher level (3-4-fold) of GlcN(acyl)PI than the parental S3 cells. 3D. Sevlever, D. Schiemann, and T. L. Rosenberry, manuscript in preparation. Karyotype analysis showed the same modal chromosome count (65, 66, 67) and the same copy numbers of HeLa markers (one of M1, one of M2, two of M3, one of M4) reported for HeLa S3. For metabolic labeling with [3H]inositol, cells were incubated with inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed newborn calf serum for 60 h. Cells (1.5 × 107) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi) in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For lipid uptake and metabolism studies, cells were washed to remove serum protein before addition of serum-free DMEM containing 0.02-0.3 μCi of radiolabeled lipids and returned to the incubator for indicated times (0.5-24 h). The cell viability was determined to be over 95% in the presence of serum-free medium for 24 h by trypan blue exclusion. At each time point the conditioned medium was removed from one plate of cells, and the labeled cells were rapidly scraped from the dish in 3 ml of prechilled phosphate buffer saline (140 m M NaCl, 10 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7). Pelleted cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline and lysed by addition of 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) to a final mixture of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v). The remaining cell pellet was re-extracted twice with 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v), and the combined extract supernatants were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. The dried supernatants were partitioned by resuspending in 400 μl of H2O-saturated n-butyl alcohol and 200 μl of n-butyl alcohol-saturated water. The aqueous phase was removed and extracted with 200 μl of H2O-saturated n-butyl alcohol, and the combined n-butyl alcohol phases were re-extracted with 200 μl of n-butyl alcohol-saturated water. The resultant aqueous phases also were combined. One ml of conditioned medium removed from the cells at each time point also was dried and partitioned with n-butyl alcohol. The n-butyl alcohol phases from both the cell lysate and the conditioned medium were dried and resuspended in 15 μl of n-butyl alcohol to spot on TLC (Silica Gel 60). The TLC plate was developed in a solvent system of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v) and scanned to determine the mobility and the amount of each labeled band with a BioScan System 200 Imaging Scanner and Nscan software. Bands in silica from extracts of cells labeled with a mixture of [3H]- and [32P]lyso-PI were scraped into Formula 963 (DuPont) for 2 days prior to scintillation counting with channel settings that gave >97% resolution of 3H and 32P. Label in the dried aqueous phase from conditioned medium was resuspended in 6 ml of water and analyzed by chromatography on a Dowex 1-X8 column (2 ml) (from Baker, Phillipsburg, NC; Berridge et al., 1983Berridge M.J.

Standards were eluted as follows: inositol and sn-glycero-3-phospho- D1- myo-inositol were not retained; inositol cyclic 1,2-phosphate was eluted with 20 and 50 m M ammonium formate and inositol mono- and polyphosphates with 150 and 400 m M ammonium formate (also see Volwerk et al., 1992Volwerk J.J. Birrell G.B. Hedberg K.K. Griffith O.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 613-622Google Scholar). PI-PLC was prepared from the medium of Bacillus subtilis which overexpresses PI-PLC of Bacillus thuringiensis (Henner et al., 1988Henner D.J. Yang M. Chen W. Hellmiss R. Rodriguez H. Low M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10383Google Scholar; Deeg et al., 1992Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.A. Yang S.H. Ferguson T.R. Reinhold V.N. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18573-18580Google Scholar). The medium was concentrated by tangential filtration (Millipore Pellicon 0.45-μm filter), and the enzyme was purified by column chromatography on octyl-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose. Cells were incubated with radiolabeled lipid, and at the designated time the conditioned medium with residual radiolabel was removed and the cells were washed once with prechilled phosphate buffer saline. Fresh serum-free medium containing 0.15-0.25 μg/ml PI-PLC was prechilled to 4°C and added to the cells. The incubation was continued in an environment of 5% CO2at 4 or 37°C for an additional hour before cell harvesting. This concentration of PI-PLC was sufficient to cleave all the PI and lyso-PI on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane (e.g. see text below). The medium containing PI-PLC was removed and the PI-PLC-treated cells were washed three times before scraping to ensure a complete removal of PI-PLC. The harvested cells and the medium were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v), partitioned with n-butyl alcohol and water, and analyzed by TLC as described above. [3H]PI Incorporation-In an initial set of experiments, [3H]PI was prepared as a liposomal suspension in serum-free medium and added to HeLa S3 cells as they approached a confluent state of cell growth. Samples of cells and medium were then taken at various times up to 24 h and partitioned between n-butyl alcohol and water, and the lipids in the n-butyl alcohol phase were fractionated by TLC. Label associated with the cells approached a steady state of about 30-35% of the total added label with a t of less than 30 min, and this level of cell-associated label was maintained up to 24 h. TLC analysis revealed that about 20% of the total label corresponded to cell-associated [3H]PI after 1 h of incubation, and only a slight further increase in this percentage was observed over the next 24 h (Fig. 1 A). At least four labeled metabolic products were detected by phase partitioning and TLC analysis. The two more abundant products corresponded to [3H]lyso-PI and to a class of derivatives appearing in the aqueous phase that we denoted “hydrophilic metabolites.” The appearance of these products with time also is shown in Fig. 1 A. Two less abundant products, [3H]PIP and GlcN(acyl)[3H]PI, also were identified (see below). The level of cellular [3H]lyso-PI showed a biphasic pattern in Fig. 1 A, rising to 8% of the total label at 1 h and gradually declining to 3% by 24 h. The levels of hydrophilic metabolites and the minor lipid species increased continuously up to 24 h. The total recovery of 3H label in the experiments in Fig. 1 was greater than 95%. In addition to the 30-35% of label associated with the cells, 65% of the total label was recovered in the medium. More than one-half of the medium label corresponded to [3H]PI throughout most of the labeling period (Fig. 1 B). The basis of this incomplete uptake of [3H]PI was unclear and is considered further under “Discussion.” Most of the remaining medium label was in hydrophilic metabolites, with only a trace amount of [3H]lyso-PI. The hydrophilic metabolites in the medium reached a plateau of 20% of total label by 1 h and increased slowly up to 24 h. [3H]Lyso-PI Incorporation-A number of fibroblast cell lines have been shown to take up [3H]lyso-PI rapidly (Volwerk et al., 1992Volwerk J.J. Birrell G.B. Hedberg K.K. Griffith O.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 613-622Google Scholar). When HeLa S3 cells were incubated with [3H]lyso-PI under the same conditions as in Fig. 1, the initial cellular uptake of label was greater than that with [3H]PI (Fig. 2 A). About 60% of the total label became cell associated within 1 h. However, the cell-associated label did not remain as [3H]lyso-PI. Cell-associated [3H]lyso-PI declined rapidly from 30% of the total label at 1 h to 11% by 5 h and 3% at 24 h. The loss in cellular [3H]lyso-PI was accompanied by a rise in cellular [3H]PI, which reached a maximal level of 40% by 3-5 h. The pronounced uptake and conversion of [3H]lyso-PI into [3H]PI indicated extensive acylation of exogenous [3H]lyso-PI at the sn-2-hydroxyl group of glycerol. As a result of this conversion, the distribution of labeled species inside the cell following [3H]lyso-PI labeling progressively approached that obtained with [3H]PI labeling, and after a 24-h labeling period the distribution and levels of labeled species obtained from both precursors were virtually identical. To conclude that exogenous [3H]lyso-PI or [3H]PI is metabolically converted directly to other radiolabeled lipid products, it was important to document that exogenous phospholipid was not degraded to [3H]inositol and in turn utilized in de novo synthesis of 3H-labeled products. This possibility seemed unlikely, as addition of a large excess of inositol (10 m M) to the medium during 24-h labeling with [3H]lyso-PI as in Figs. 2, A and B, did not change the distribution of label in [3H]PI, [3H]PIP, and [3H]GlcN(acyl)PI (data not shown). In a more rigorous test, lyso-PI mixtures radiolabeled with 3H in inositol and 32P in phosphate were presented to cells, and the ratios of 32P to 3H in the lipid products were compared with the ratio in the initial mixture. PI is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and inositol (see Catt and Balla, 1989Catt K.J. Balla T. Annu. Rev. Med. 1989; 40: 487-509Google Scholar). If lyso-PI were degraded to [3H]inositol and [32P]phosphate prior to resynthesis of labeled PI, PIP, and GlcN(acyl)PI, the 32P/3H ratios in these lipid products should differ dramatically from that in the lyso-PI precursor pool. As shown in Table I, however, these ratios remained essentially unchanged, indicating that the lipid products are derived directly from lyso-PI.Table I:Retention of 3H and 32P in inositol phospholipids metabolized from lyso-PIHeLa S3 cells were cultured as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” except that 25 m M HEPES (pH 7.4) was added. Mixtures of [3H]lyso-PI (300,000 cpm) and [32P]lyso-PI (40,000 cpm) were incubated with the cells for 8 or 24 h with or without addition of 20 m M sodium phosphate. TLC chromatography of 3H- and 32P-labeled lipids extracted from the cells showed distributions similar to that in Fig. 6 A for both isotopes. Ratios of 32P counts/min to 3H counts/min for the indicated TLC bands were determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Ratios in each band were similar under the four labeling conditions, and means and standard errors are shown. Open table in a new tab HeLa S3 cells were cultured as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” except that 25 m M HEPES (pH 7.4) was added. Mixtures of [3H]lyso-PI (300,000 cpm) and [32P]lyso-PI (40,000 cpm) were incubated with the cells for 8 or 24 h with or without addition of 20 m M sodium phosphate. TLC chromatography of 3H- and 32P-labeled lipids extracted from the cells showed distributions similar to that in Fig. 6 A for both isotopes. Ratios of 32P counts/min to 3H counts/min for the indicated TLC bands were determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Ratios in each band were similar under the four labeling conditions, and means and standard errors are shown. The medium was also depleted of [3H]lyso-PI rather rapidly (Fig. 2 B). Only 7% of the total label corresponded to [3H]lyso-PI in the medium at 2.5 h, and just a trace amount of organic phase label ([3H]lyso-PI plus [3H]PI) was in the medium after 5 h. Most of the medium label was in hydrophilic metabolites after 2.5 h. The virtual complete removal of [3H]lyso-PI from the medium contrasted with the incomplete uptake of [3H]PI noted above, although the percentage of [3H]lyso-PI degraded to labeled hydrophilic metabolites in the medium was only slightly larger than that observed with [3H]PI in Fig. 1. The composition of these hydrophilic metabolites was investigated by a conventional Dowex 1-X8 chromatography procedure in which inositol and inositol phosphates are resolved by stepwise elution with ammonium formate (Berridge et al., 1983Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar; Ross and Majerus, 1986Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation with [3H]lyso-PI, approximately 33% of the hydrophilic metabolite pool in the medium corresponded to inositol and/or sn-glycero-3-phospho- D1- myo-inositol, 19% to inositol cyclic 1,2-phosphate, and 48% to inositol phosphates. After 2.5 h of incubation, the percentages were 52, 19, and 29%, respectively. The nature and the location of the enzymes involved in the degradation to hydrophilic metabolites was studied by adding [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI to conditioned medium that had been incubated with unlabeled cells for 6-15 h. After the incubation, [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI was recovered without detectable metabolic breakdown, indicating that the hydrophilic metabolites had to be produced by cell-associated enzymes that presumably were on the cell surface. To clarify the processes by which the metabolic products derived from exogenous [3H]PI or [3H]lyso-PI were produced, the transbilayer orientations of the cellular [3H]lyso-PI and its lipid metabolic products were studied. PI and lyso-PI on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer can be determined quite selectively by treatment of intact cells with purified bacterial PI-PLC, since this enzyme hydrolyzes only inositol phospholipids located on this outer leaflet without penetrating the membrane (Higgins et al., 1989Higgins J.A. Hitchin B.W. Low M.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 913-916Google Scholar). With this technique, the transbilayer distribution of PI in the plasma membrane of red blood cells from human, ox, sheep, and pig was shown to be asymmetric, with 80-95% of the PI in the cytosolic or inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Low and Finean, 1977Low M.G. Finean J.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 235-240Google Scholar; Butikofer et al., 1990Butikofer P. Lin Z.W. Chiu D.T.Y. Lubin B. Kuypers F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16035-16038Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells were incubated with [3H]lyso-PI for various times, and the washed cells were subjected to PI-PLC treatment at 4°C. This low temperature treatment should inhibit endocytosis nonspecifically (Al-Awaqati, 1989Al-Awaqati Q. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 49-59Google Scholar), and it also impeded exogenous lipid translocation and metabolism in experiments described below. After 1 h of labeling, PI-PLC removed more than 80% of the cellular [3H]lyso-PI (Fig. 3), but this percentage decreased to 15% at 24 h. These data indicate that [3H]lyso-PI initially was in the outer leaflet where it was susceptible to PI-PLC and progressively was translocated (flipped) to the inner leaflet where it was resistant to PI-PLC. It is noteworthy that the initial [3H]PI formed after brief incubation with [3H]lyso-PI for less than 1 h was up to 60% susceptible to PI-PLC, whereas less than 15% of the [3H]PI was cleaved after 24-h labeling (Fig. 3). This observation suggests that at least some acylation of cell-associated [3H]lyso-PI occurred on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, a possibility that is addressed further below. When cells with incorporated [3H]lyso-PI are treated with PI-PLC at 37°C instead of at 4°C, not only the initial [3H]PI and [3H]lyso-PI available on the cell surface will be susceptible to cleavage, but labeled lipids that translocate from the inner to the outer leaflet (flop) during the exposure of cells to PI-PLC will also be cleaved. To assess the extent to which flopping occurs in HeLa S3 cells, cells were incubated with [3H]lyso-PI for 3 h, washed, and then exposed to PI-PLC for 1 h of continued incubation at 37°C. About 25% of the [3H]PI formed after the 3-h incubation was cleaved at 37°C (data not shown), an amount comparable with that removed by 4°C cleavage in Fig. 3. Since no more labeled PI was cleaved by the 1-h PI-PLC treatment at 37°C than at 4°C, the flopping of PI over this period at 37°C was not significantly faster than at 4°C. We show below that flipping of lyso-PI and PI becomes negligible at 4°C, so we would expect that flopping also would not occur at this temperature. It thus appears that flopping of PI in HeLa S3 cells is not significant over 1 h at 37°C. In human erythrocytes, the t for PI to reach a steady-state flip-flop distribution was reported to be 3 h (Butikofer et al., 1990Butikofer P. Lin Z.W. Chiu D.T.Y. Lubin B. Kuypers F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16035-16038Google Scholar). The observation that a higher percentage of [3H]PI was cleaved by 4°C PI-PLC treatment after shorter incubations with [3H]lyso-PI (Fig. 3) implied that at least some acylation of [3H]lyso-PI into [3H]PI occurred on the outer leaflet, although it remained possible that some [3H]PI initially generated on the inner leaflet flopped back to the outer leaflet. To resolve this question, HeLa S3 cells were incubated with [3H]lyso-PI in 5% CO2at 4°C (instead of 37°C as in Fig. 2) for various times before lipid extraction (Fig. 4 A). Incorporation of the label was slightly retarded at 4°C, but the cell-associated label still reached nearly 60% of the total at 5 h.

https://openalex.org/W2010855686,"Polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibody raised to a synthetic discontinuous peptide derived from the human γ-interferon (huIFN-γ) sequence recognizes soluble human γ-interferon receptor (Seelig, G. F., Prosise, W. W., and Taremi, S. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 358-363). We sought to use this reagent to identify a ligand-binding domain within IFN-γ-receptor. To do this, the neutralizing anti-idiotypic antibody was used to probe overlapping linear peptide octamers of the extracellular domain of the huIFN-γ receptor. A 22-amino-acid residue receptor segment 120-141 identified by the antibody was synthesized. CD and NMR analysis indicates that peptide 120-141 has no apparent secondary structure in water or in water containing 50% trifluoroethanol. The synthetic receptor peptide inhibited huIFN-γ induced expression of HLA/DR antigen on Colo 205 cells with an approximate IC50of 35 μM. Immobilized peptide specifically bound recombinant huIFN-γ but did not bind human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on a microtiter plate in a direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding results are supported by two-dimensional transferred nuclear Over-hauser effect (TRNOE) NMR data obtained on the peptide in the presence of recombinant huIFN-γ. Characterization of the conformation of the bound peptide by TRNOE suggests that this peptide assumes a distinct conformation. Intramolecular interactions within the bound peptide were detected at two non-contiguous regions and at a third region comprising a β-turn formed by the sequence DIRK. We believe that this represents the structure of the receptor within the ligand-binding domain.

Two small regions within the cytoplasmic domain have been identified as important to the function of this receptor (Farrar et al., 1991Farrar M.A. Fernandez-Luna J. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19626-19635Google Scholar, Farrar et al., 1992Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Google Scholar; Cook et al., 1992Cook J.R.

The extracellular domain is believed to interact directly both with “accessory factors” required to generate the full complement of transduction signals (Hibino et al., 1992Hibino Y. Kumar C.S. Mariano T.M. Lai D. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3741-3749Google Scholar; Gibbs et al., 1992Gibbs V.C. Williams S.R. Gray P.W. Schreiber R.D. Pennica D. Rice G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell.

Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 6908-6915Google Scholar). Studies on the extracellular domain by Stuber et al., 1993Stuber D. Friedlein A. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H-W. Garrota G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2430-2432Google Scholar suggest that all of the disulfide bonds may be required for full ligand binding capacity. Using proteolytic digestion, Fountoulakis et al. (1991) found that the shortest fragment capable of retaining full γ-interferon binding was a 25-kDa fragment including residues 6-227. They suggest that a smaller 15-kDa fragment (residues 94-227) which bound to immobilized huIFN-γ with low affinity carries part of the receptor-binding domain. Monoclonal antibodies raised against huIFN-γ receptor possessing inhibitory activity have been broadly mapped to amino acid residues between 26-133 and 70-210 (Garotta et al., 1990Garotta G. Ozmen L. Fountoulakis M. Dembic Z. van Loon A.P.G.M. Stuber D. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 6908-6915Google Scholar). A neutralizing anti-idiotypic antibody which binds to the extracellular domain of huIFN-γ receptor has previously been described (Seelig and Prosise, 1992Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16C: 101Google Scholar). This anti-idiotypic antibody was derived from a neutralizing anti-huIFN-γ antibody which had been raised against a synthetic peptide containing tethered segments from both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus (Seelig and Prosise, 1992Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16C: 101Google Scholar; Seelig et al., 1994Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. Taremi S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 358-363Google Scholar). In this paper, we use this unique antibody tool to probe specific regions of the receptor which are responsible for the ligand-receptor interactions. Using the method described by Geysen et al., 1987Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Google Scholar, immobilized overlapping octamers of the rhuIFN-γ receptor were synthesized, peptide regions were identified, free peptides were synthesized, and analyzed both for their ability to bind rhuIFN-γ and for their antagonist activity. To further probe the receptor peptide-ligand interactions, we have examined the rhuIFN-γ-bound structure of the peptide using two-dimensional transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (TRNOE). The TRNOE experiment has been applied to a wide range of small ligands complexed with macromolecules to gain information about the structure of the bound ligand (Otting, 1993Otting G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 760-768Google Scholar). This technique is an extension of the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiment to systems involved in chemical exchange. It has been described for the one-dimensional case (Clore and Gronenborn, 1982Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar) and more recently for the two-dimensional case (Campbell and Sykes, 1991Campbell P.A. Sykes B.D. J. Magn. Res. 1991; 93: 77-92Google Scholar). In the free ligand, negative NOEs are normally weak or absent, reflective of both the ligand' small size and short correlation time (Noggle and Schirmer, 1971Noggle J.H. Schirmer R.E. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect: Chemical Applications. Academic Press, New York1971: 4-75Google Scholar). When bound to a large molecule, however, the fast exchange situation permits transfer of magnetization from the bound state to the free ligand population. Large negative NOEs will be observed and are reflective of the ligand' conformation in its bound state. Significant information can be obtained about the bound conformation of the ligand and compared with the solution conformation of the ligand (Neuhaus and Williamson, 1989Neuhaus D. Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1989: 175-181Google Scholar). The binding of the 120-141 peptide to rhuIFN-γ seemed well suited for this type of study. We discuss the peptides, their respective antibodies, and the implications from the NMR data in relation to the binding of huIFN-γ to its cellular receptor. Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) and Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Avondale, PA) supplied horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. Cambridge Research Biochemical (Valley Stream, NY) was the source for the derivatized pins, control pins, antibodies, and Fmoc- L-amino acids used in the Geysen immobilized peptide synthesis. Mouse monoclonal anti-HLA/DR antibody was from Becton-Dickinson. Anti-idiotypic antibody was raised in BALB/c mice followed by intraperitoneal injections with rabbit polyclonal antibody P616 (raised against peptide 15-21-GGG-132-138) as described before (Seelig and Prosise, 1992Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16C: 101Google Scholar). Rh-GM-CSF (Escherichia coli; nonglycosylated; Schering-Plough/Sandoz) was purified to a constant maximal specific activity by a methodology similar to that described for recombinant murine GM-CSF (Trotta et al., 1987). Expression of rhuIFN-γ was as described previously (Lunn et al., 1992Lunn C.A. Davies L. Dalgarno D. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. Lundell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17920-17924Google Scholar) utilizing standard techniques of recombinant DNA methodology described by Nagabhushan and Leibowitz, 1985Nagabhushan T.L. Leibowitz P.J. Kisner D.L.

In each case, cloned variants were purified to constant specific activity by a methodology similar to that detailed by Nagabhushan et al. (1988). Recombinant murine γ-interferon was purified as described by Trotta et al., 1986Trotta P.P. Seelig G.F. Le H.V. Nagabhushan T.L. Friedman R. Merigan T. Sveevalson T.

Peptides 120-141acm and 120-141(Tyr)acm were synthesized by Multiple Peptide Synthesis (San Diego, CA) as the HCl salt with the acetamidomethyl modification of the cysteine side chain. In the case of 120-141(Tyr)acm, a conservative replacement of the Val-121 in the native sequence for a Tyr-121 was also made. The presence of the Tyr-121 provides a facile method both for quantitation and for conjugation as desired. All other peptides were synthesized using the solid-phase method described by Merrifield, 1963Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Google Scholar. The t-butyloxy carbonyl amino protecting group, symmetrical anhydrides, and the solid-phase peptide synthesizer (model 430A) were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Following the loading of the phenylacetamido (polystyrene) starting resin as well as the complete assembly, the NH2-terminal t-Boc group was removed with 65% trifluoroacetic acid. The resin was then neutralized, washed with ethanol, and dried; the peptide was cleaved from the resin with a 10:1.5 ratio of liquid hydrogen fluoride-anisole at 0°C for 60 min. The cleaved, deprotected peptides were solubilized with aqueous acetic acid, washed with t-butyl methyl ether, and then lyophilized. All peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-4 Dynamax 400 Å widebore column (Rainin Associates, Woburn, MA). Amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation was employed to confirm the peptide sequences. Fast atom bombardment mass spectral analysis was carried out on a VG ZAB-SE double focusing mass spectrometer operating at an accelerating voltage of 8 kV. Circular dichroism measurements were made on an IBM-interfaced Jasco 500C spectropolarimeter at room temperature using 1.0-cm path length cells with a protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Overlapping octamer peptides were synthesized on polyethylene pins in a 96-pin format using the method of Geysen et al. (1987). The peptides were synthesized using Fmoc/ t-butyl protecting groups; the amino acids coupled were highly activated pentafluorophenyl and oxo-benzotriazine esters. Approximately 20-50 pmol of peptide were synthesized on each pin. Rabbits were injected intradermally with 0.1 ml of sample/site of injection. Each sample consisted of 0.5-1.0 mg of peptide in 500 μl of sterile PBS emulsified with 500 μl of Freund' complete adjuvant. Boosts were performed with Freund' incomplete adjuvant at 4-week intervals or as needed judged by ELISA response to peptide and huIFN-γ receptor. Rabbit antibodies were screened for specific binding of antigens by employing a direct solid-phase ELISA at room temperature. A 96-well microtiter plate (NUNC; Intermed; Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 100 μl of antigen/well for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed five times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS). The plate was subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and again washed five times with TBS. The wells were then coated with the antibody of interest for 1 h, washed five times with TBS, and coated with 2.5 ng of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Following incubation for 1 h, the plate was washed five times with TBS. The plate was then developed by adding either 2-2′-azino-bis[3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide to each well. The horseradish peroxidase reaction product was detected colorimetrically at 414 nm (ABTS) or at 450 nm (TMB) 20 min after the addition of the enzyme substrates. Control wells were also developed in which one of the three assay components (antigen, antibody, or peroxidase-labeled antibody) was deleted. Immobilized pins were blocked for 1 h by inverting the pins onto a standard 96-well microtiter plate and incubating in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% ovalbumin. The pins were incubated overnight at 4°C in the appropriate mouse or rabbit antisera diluted 1:500 in the above PBS solution, followed by a wash with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The pins were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugate, washed, and then developed with the colorimetric detection methods described in the previous section.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar was employed with bovine serum albumin as a standard for the proteins and the species appropriate IgG as a standard for the antibodies. The bio-ELISA assay for HLA/DR induction by huIFN-γ was carried out according to the method of Gibson and Kramer, 1989Gibson U.E.M. Kramer S.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 125: 105-113Google Scholar. The Colo 205 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CLL 222). Stock cultures were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were trypsinized and seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of at least 105cells/well in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated overnight in the wells at 37°C in a 5% CO2incubator. Culture media in the presence of polypeptides and a fixed amount of interferon (150 p M) were added in a 0.1 ml volume to the wells containing Colo 205 cells, and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the media was removed from each well and the wells were washed three times with culture media. Aliquots (0.2 ml) of culture media were added to the wells and the plates incubated for 48 h at 37°C to allow for induction of HLA/DR antigen. The wells were next washed with PBS and then fixed for 2 min with ice-cold anhydrous ethyl alcohol. After the alcohol was removed, the wells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal anti-HLA/DR antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. PBS was used to wash the wells, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was added to each well for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS and then developed as described for the ELISA plates. RhuIFN-γ NMR samples were prepared by dialyzing 0.5 m M protein against 20 m M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.015% sodium azide. Rh-GM-CSF NMR samples were prepared in the same buffer at a concentration of 0.45 m M protein. Peptide and peptide-protein solutions were prepared by dissolving 5.0 mg of the solid peptide into either the 20 m M phosphate buffer or into the dialyzed protein solution to yield a final peptide concentration of 4.3 m M. The pH of all NMR samples was adjusted by adding trace amounts of either dilute sodium hydroxide or phosphoric acid. The final volumes in the NMR tubes were brought to 0.55 ml by diluting with approximately 60 μl of deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA). The final pH of the NMR samples used for the transferred NOE studies was 7.0. All NMR experiments were carried out at 500 MHz on a GN-500 Omega NMR spectrometer with the temperature of the probe maintained to within ±0.2°C. Phase-sensitive double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) (Rance et al., 1983Rance M. Sorensen M. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Würthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Google Scholar) and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (Bax and Davis, 1985Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) data sets as well as phase-sensitive NOESY data sets in the hypercomplex mode (States et al., 1982States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) were acquired at 15°C, pH 6.0, for the assignment of the proton peptide resonances. The mixing times used in the TOCSY and NOESY experiments were 55 and 150 ms, respectively. For the transfer NOE experiments, phase-sensitive NOESY data sets in the hypercomplex mode were collected at 15°C, pH 7.0, for the free peptide and for the peptide plus rhuIFN-γ, at mixing times of 80, 100, and 225 ms. The two-dimensional data sets were collected with either 256 or 512 free induction decays (FIDs) using a spectral width of 7000 Hz, 2048 data points, and 64 scans/FID with the carrier frequency set on the residual water line. Water suppression was accomplished by presaturation with minimal power for 1.5 s prior to the first 900pulse. Digitized data were exported to a remote SparcII workstation (Sun Microsystems) and analyzed using the Felix 2.10 NMR processing program (Biosym Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). All data sets were processed with squared sine-bell window functions followed by Fourier transformation. Data sets were zero filled to yield final two-dimensional matrices with sizes of either 1K × 1K or 2K × 2K real points. NOESY data sets were subject to first-order polynomial base line correction in both dimensions after Fourier transformation. Murine polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibody was previously raised against rabbit polyclonal antibody to discontinuous peptide 1, an inhibitory peptide comprised of regions from huIFN-γ corresponding to amino acid residues 15-21 and 132-138 2The numbering of huIFN-γ peptides and protein was derived from the full-length 146 amino acid species of huIFN-γ as predicted from the cDNA sequence (Gray and Goeddel, 1983Gray P.W. Goeddel D.V. Hollaender A. Laskin A.I. Rodgers P. Proceedings of a Symposium on the Biological Basis of New Developments in Biotechnology. Plenum Press, New York1983: 35-61Google Scholar). and tethered by a Gly-Gly-Gly linkage (Seelig et al., 1994Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. Taremi S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 358-363Google Scholar). This anti-idiotypic antibody specifically recognizes rhuIFN-γR and prevents binding of the receptor to rhuIFN-γ (Seelig et al., 1994Seelig G.F. Prosise W.W. Taremi S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 358-363Google Scholar). The epitope of the anti-idiotypic antibody was examined using the method described by Geysen et al. (1987). Neutralizing anti-idiotypic antibody recognized octapeptides in the region 120-141 3The numbering of huIFN-γR peptides and protein was derived from the cDNA sequence described by Aguet et al. (1988) including the 14-amino-acid signal sequence. of rhuIFN-γR (Fig. 1). Neither murine preimmune serum or rabbit polyclonal antibody to discontinuous peptide 1 showed any recognition of these peptide regions (data not shown). To confirm this observation, and to explore the three regions which were weakly recognized by the anti-idiotypic antibody, peptides corresponding to regions 34-49, 51-62, 103-120, 120-141(Tyr)acm, and 126-139 were synthesized. ELISA analysis of the ability of anti-idiotypic antibody to bind each of these peptides resulted in the recognition of only two peptides, 120-141(Tyr)acm and 126-139. Recognition above background was not observed for any of the other peptides. In addition, recognition of huIFN-γ by the anti-idiotypic antibody can be completely prevented by addition of 300 n M peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm (data not shown). This further supports the thesis that the site recognized on the intact receptor, like that on the overlapping octapeptides, is the receptor region 120-141. Four synthetic peptides corresponding to regions within the extracellular portion of the huIFN-γ receptor, one corresponding to an intracellular region, as well as the soluble rhuIFN-γ protein, were used to elicit rabbit polyclonal antibody response. Each antibody was tested for its ability to prevent huIFN-γ-induced expression of HLA/DR antigen on the surface of Colo 205 cells (Table I). Of the six peptides examined, only two peptide-derived polyclonal antibodies (Ab 493-89 and Ab 495-89 raised against peptides 120-141(Tyr)acm and 123-138, respectively), and the protein-derived antibody SP68 inhibited expression of the HLA/DR antigen on the surface of Colo 205 cells. The fact that the peptide recognized by the anti-idiotypic antibody was able to generate antibody with an inhibitory response is consistent with the observed antagonist activity of the anti-idiotypic antibody. This further supports the observation that the region 120-141 of the receptor may represent a portion of the epitope of the anti-idiotypic antibody.Table I:Response of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to γ -interferon receptor and its peptides Open table in a new tab The inhibitory activity and ability of the anti-idiotypic antibody to recognize huIFN-γ receptor suggests that this antibody possesses the “internal image” of huIFN-γ. Thus, the epitope for the anti-idiotypic antibody on huIFN-γ receptor is likely to exist on or near the binding site for huIFN-γ. It was hypothesized that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the epitope might interfere with the ability of the huIFN-γ to induce biological activity. In order to further explore this possibility, the antagonistic property of the peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm was examined (Fig. 2). A concentration of 35 μM reduced the huIFN-γ induction of HLA/DR antigen on Colo 205 cells by 50%. In contrast, concentrations of greater than one m M were required for inhibition by peptides corresponding to regions 51-62, 197-213, 214-223, and 224-240 on huIFN-γ receptor (data not shown). The observation that the peptide identified by the anti-idiotypic antibody inhibits biological activity indicates that the peptide may directly bind to huIFN-γ. Direct ELISA binding studies were performed to study the interaction between the peptide and huIFN-γ. Receptor peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm, an irrelevant peptide corresponding to a region of huIFN-γ, a scrambled 4A scrambled version of the 120-141(Tyr)acm peptide IADPIC(acm)RELKKIPEGRYDQGKK which was synthesized. version of peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm, or no peptide at all was coated on the ELISA plate. After blocking, rhuIFN-γ or rh-GM-CSF was then incubated on the plate. Polyclonal anti-huIFN-γ or anti-GM-CSF antibodies and the appropriate secondary antibody were then incubated to detect huIFN-γ and GM-CSF binding, respectively (Fig. 3). Only peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm was recognized in this format and it was only recognized by rhuIFN-γ. Van Volkenburg et al., 1993Van Volkenburg M.A. Griggs N.D. Jarpe M.A. Pace J.L. Russell S.W. Johnson H.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6206-6213Google Scholar noted a related murine IFN-γ receptor peptide binds to murine IFN-γ. Due to the sequence similarity of the murine and human receptors, recombinant murine γ-interferon was also examined in the system. Under the conditions examined, murine γ-interferon recognized the peptide slightly (approximately 10% of the absorbance by ELISA that was observed for an equivalent amount of rhuIFN-γ). Thus, there may be some cross-recognition by murine and human γ-interferon for binding sites on the receptor. This has been suggested in a very recent paper by Szente et al., 1994Szente B.E. Soos J.M. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1645-1654Google Scholar. The peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm was not recognized by rh-GM-CSF, and rhuIFN-γ did not bind to an irrelevant peptide. These data further support the premise that peptide 120-141(Tyr)acm may bind directly to rhuIFN-γ. However, another method was sought to probe the binding of the peptide to huIFN-γ.
