https://openalex.org/W1980639973,"Comparisons of carbon isotopic data on benthic foraminifera from Deep Sea Drilling Project sites 502 (western Caribbean) and 503 (eastern Pacific) indicate that the difference between the Atlantic and the Pacific in the per mil enrichment in carbon-13 of total dissolved carbon dioxide increased about 6 million years ago and again 3 million years ago, when the difference reached the modern level (1 per mil). Comparisons of planktonic foraminiferal oxygen isotopic data for the Caribbean and the Pacific suggest that the salinity of Caribbean surface waters began increasing 4 million years ago, possibly in response to shoaling of the Panama isthmus. These results suggest that modern circulation patterns in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific developed by 3 million years ago in concert with changing tectonic, climatic, and biogeographic patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2055424827,"Much of the controversy concerning the theory of punctuated equilibrium stems from skepticism about the biologic validity of fossil morphospecies, particularly for supposedly simple invertebrate taxa like cheilostome Bryozoa that form the bulk of the fossil record. However, evidence from breeding experiments and protein electrophoresis shows that morphospecific identity of cheilostomes is heritable and that morphospecies are genetically distinct with no indication of morphologically cryptic species. Thus paleontologists can study cheilostome evolution at the species level, and previously demonstrated pattems suggesting punctuated speciation in cheilostomes should be taken at face value."
https://openalex.org/W2070200670,"N-β-Alanyldopamine is the major tyrosine metabolite in the hemolymph and cuticle during pupal tanning in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L. Its concentration in hemolymph increases over 800-fold above larval levels by the start of tanning and decreases as the pupal cuticle darkens and hardens. It is a major catechol in species representing several insect orders and is the preferred substrate for pupal cuticular o-diphenol oxidase. In insects, N-β-alanyldopamine appears to be the main precursor for tanning chemicals at certain developmental stages."

The seed contains an appreciable concentration of L-canavanine, a potent antimetabolite and structural analog of L-arginine. This bruchid beetle uses the nitrogen stored in this toxic allelochemical as an effective dietary nitrogen source for amino acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970140783,"Understanding how stars like the sun formed constitutes one of the principal challenges confronting modern astrophysics. In recent years, advances in observational technology, particularly at infrared and millimeter wavelengths, have produced an avalanche of critical data and unexpected discoveries about the process of star formation, which is blocked from external view at optical and shorter wavelengths by an obscuring blanket of interstellar dust. Fueled by this new knowledge, a comprehensive empirical picture of stellar genesis is beginning to emerge, laying the foundations for a coherent theory of the birth of sunlike stars."
https://openalex.org/W1979874137,"Sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the genus Desulfotomaculum utilized inorganic pyrophosphate as a source of energy for growth in the presence of fixed carbon (acetate and yeast extract) and sulfate. Pyrophosphate does not support the growth of Desulfovibrio under the same growth conditions. Over a limited range of concentrations, growth is proportional to pyrophosphate, and extracts of bacteria grown on pyrophosphate medium have enzymatic activities similar to extracts prepared from bacteria grown on medium containing lactate plus sulfate. The variety of cell types observed in crude anaerobic pyrophosphate-enrichment cultures from a marine environment suggests that this unique type of energy metabolism is not restricted to the sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfotomaculum."

During this time the technology has been advanced from laboratory experiments to a pilot plant with a coal feed rate of 250 tons per day, and findings from several areas of science and technology have been important. The process is now in the final stage of development to generate the data needed to design a plant of commercial size."

https://openalex.org/W2004457892,"Public debate about Soviet oil has become more widespread in the past 5 years, but during this period Soviet petroleum exports have ceased to be made available by volume. Soviet oil consumption has usually been estimated by deducting exports from total production. This article takes the alternative approach, using Soviet statistics from a variety of sources, to build up a sectoral pattern of Soviet oil demand and to consider this in the broader context of total Comecon energy supply and demand. From this focus future prospects for the Comecon energy balance are analyzed."
