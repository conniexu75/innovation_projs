https://openalex.org/W3006384066,"Loneliness is a potent predictor of negative health outcomes, making it important to identify risk factors for loneliness. Though extant studies have identified characteristics associated with loneliness, less is known about the cumulative and relative importance of these factors, and how their interaction may impact loneliness. Here, 4,885 individuals ages 10-97 years from the US completed the three-item UCLA Loneliness Survey on TestMyBrain.org. Using census data, we calculated the population and community household income of participants' census area, and the proportion of individuals in the participant's census area that shared the participant's demographic characteristics (i.e., sociodemographic density). We evaluated the relative importance of three classes of variables for loneliness risk: those related to the person (e.g., age), place (e.g., community household income), and the interaction of person X place (sociodemographic density). We find that loneliness is highly prevalent and best explained by person (age) and place (community household income) characteristics. Of the variance in loneliness accounted for, the overwhelming majority was explained by age with loneliness peaking at 19 years and declining thereafter. The congruence between one's sociodemographic characteristics and that of one's neighborhood had no impact on loneliness. These data may have important implications for public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3006026173,"Growing conditions for crops such as coffee and wine grapes are shifting to track climate change. Research on these crop responses has focused principally on impacts to food production impacts, but evidence is emerging that they may have serious environmental consequences as well. Recent research has documented potential environmental impacts of shifting cropping patterns, including impacts on water, wildlife, pollinator interaction, carbon storage and nature conservation, on national to global scales. Multiple crops will be moving in response to shifting climatic suitability, and the cumulative environmental effects of these multi-crop shifts at global scales is not known. Here we model for the first time multiple major global commodity crop suitability changes due to climate change, to estimate the impacts of new crop suitability on water, biodiversity and carbon storage. Areas that become newly suitable for one or more crops are Climate-driven Agricultural Frontiers. These frontiers cover an area equivalent to over 30% of the current agricultural land on the planet and have major potential impacts on biodiversity in tropical mountains, on water resources downstream and on carbon storage in high latitude lands. Frontier soils contain up to 177 Gt of C, which might be subject to release, which is the equivalent of over a century of current United States CO2 emissions. Watersheds serving over 1.8 billion people would be impacted by the cultivation of the climate-driven frontiers. Frontiers intersect 19 global biodiversity hotspots and the habitat of 20% of all global restricted range birds. Sound planning and management of climate-driven agricultural frontiers can therefore help reduce globally significant impacts on people, ecosystems and the climate system."

https://openalex.org/W3005540557,"This work provides an internationally comparable consumer food waste dataset based on food availability, energy gap and consumer affluence. Such data can be used for constructing meaningful and internationally comparable metrics on food waste, such as those for Sustainable Development Goal 12. The data suggests that consumer food waste follows a linear-log relationship with consumer affluence and starts to emerge when consumers reach a threshold of approximately $6.70/day/capita level of expenditure. These findings also imply that most empirical models overestimate consumption by not accounting for the possibility of food waste in their analysis. The results also show that the most widely cited global estimate of food waste is underestimated by a factor greater than 2 (214 Kcal/day/capita versus 527 Kcal/day/capita). Comparison with estimates of US consumer food waste based on national survey data shows this approach can reasonably reproduce the results without needing extensive data from national surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3005858280,"Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and impaired autophagy all are general features of senescent cells. However, the cross-talk among these events and processes is not fully understood. Here, using NIH3T3 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, we show that stress-induced DNA damage provokes the SASP largely via cytosolic chromatin fragment (CCF) formation, which activates a cascade comprising cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), NF-κB, and SASP, and that autolysosomal function inhibits this cascade. We found that CCFs accumulate in senescent cells with activated cGAS-STING-NF-κB signaling, promoting SASP and cellular senescence. We also present evidence that the persistent accumulation of CCFs in prematurely senescent cells is partially associated with a defect in DNA-degrading activity in autolysosomes and reduced abundance of activated DNase 2α. Intriguingly, we found that metformin- or rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy significantly lessened the size and levels of CCFs and repressed the activation of the cGAS-STING-NF-κB-SASP cascade and cellular senescence. These effects of autophagy activators indicated that autolysosomal function contributes to CCF clearance and SASP suppression, further supported by the fact that the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 blocked the role of autophagy-mediated CCF clearance and senescence repression.

https://openalex.org/W3004991677,"Unique stimuli stand out. Despite an abundance of competing sensory stimuli, the detection of the most salient ones occurs without effort, and that detection contributes to the guidance of adaptive behavior. Neurons sensitive to the salience of visual stimuli are widespread throughout the primate visual system and are thought to shape the selection of visual targets. However, a neural source of salience remains elusive. In an attempt to identify a source of visual salience, we reversibly inactivated parietal cortex and simultaneously recorded salience signals in prefrontal cortex. Inactivation of parietal cortex not only caused pronounced and selective reductions of salience signals in prefrontal cortex but also diminished the influence of salience on visually guided behavior. These observations demonstrate a causal role of parietal cortex in regulating salience signals within the brain and in controlling salience-driven behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3006310073,"Cellular long-chain fatty acids' (LCFAs) uptake is a crucial physiological process that regulates cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK has been shown to modulate LCFAs uptake in several kinds of cells, but whether it exerts an impact on intestinal LCFAs uptake is not quite clear. In the current study, we found that AMPK reinforced LCFAs uptake in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Moreover, intestinal epithelium-specific AMPK deletion impaired intestinal LCFAs absorption and protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, we discovered that AMPK deletion reduced the CD36 protein level by upregulating Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of CD36 in IECs. Furthermore, our results revealed that AMPK affected PARK2 (gene name of Parkin) mRNA stability in a YTHDF2-dependent manner through FTO-dependent demethylation of N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A). Besides, AMPK promoted the translocation of CD36 to the plasma membrane in IECs, but the inhibition of AKT signaling suppressed this effect, which also halted the accelerated fatty acid uptake induced by AMPK. These results suggest that AMPK facilitates the intestinal LCFAs uptake by upregulating CD36 protein abundance and promoting its membrane translocation simultaneously. Such findings shed light on the role of AMPK in the regulation of intestinal LCFAs uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3006078748,"Background HIV counseling and testing are key to control and prevent the spread of the virus and improve the lives of people living with HIV. Although the risk of acquiring the virus is high, only 27% of young Ethiopian women age 15 to 24 years old were tested and counseled for HIV. This coverage is low to achieve the 90-90-90 goal. Identifying factors associated with low utilization of HIV testing and counseling services among young females (aged 15 to 24 years) is important to identify the barriers and improve uptake. Therefore, this analysis was done to identify factors associated with low utilization of HIV counseling and testing services among young Ethiopian women. Methods The study used the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. The data was downloaded from The DHS program with permission. A total of 2661 young women (aged 15 to 24 years) were included in the final model. Data was weighted to consider disproportionate sampling and non-response. A Complex data management technique was applied to consider the complex sampling technique used in the DHS. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with HIV testing among young women. Result Among sexually active young women, 33.5% (95%CI; 30.1, 37.1) were tested for HIV. Young women who attended primary ((AOR 2.8; (95% CI; 2.0, 3.9)), secondary (AOR 4.7; (95% CI; 3.1, 7.3)) or higher education (AOR; 5.6; 95% CI; 2.6, 12.0), those who had multiple sexual partners (AOR 5.5; 95% (CI; 1.3, 23.3)), young women who ever used alcohol (AOR 1.46; 95% (CI; 1.1, 2.0)) and young women who visited health care facilities (AOR 1.8; (95% CI; 1.4, 2.3)) had higher odds of being tested for HIV. On the other hand, young women from the rural areas had lower odds (AOR 0.5; (95% CI; 0.3, 0.7)) of being tested for HIV. Conclusion HIV testing among sexually active young women in Ethiopia was low. Educational status, place of residence, alcohol intake, number of sexual partners and visiting health facility 12 months before the survey were found significant predictors of HIV testing. Therefore, the Ethiopian government should encourage girls to complete secondary education to improve HIV testing and counseling. Young women should be encouraged to visit health facilities to improve HIV testing service uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3006541154,"Cases of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) have been associated with specific mutations within the gene encoding the human Golgi TMEM165 (transmembrane protein 165), belonging to UPF0016 (uncharacterized protein family 0016), a family of secondary ion transporters. To date, members of this family have been reported to be involved in calcium, manganese, and pH homeostases. Although it has been suggested that TMEM165 has cation transport activity, direct evidence for its Ca2+- and Mn2+-transporting activities is still lacking. Here, we functionally characterized human TMEM165 by heterologously expressing it in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Protein production in these two microbial hosts was enhanced by codon optimization and truncation of the putatively autoregulatory N terminus of TMEM165. We show that TMEM165 expression in a yeast strain devoid of Golgi Ca2+ and Mn2+ transporters abrogates Ca2+- and Mn2+-induced growth defects, excessive Mn2+ accumulation in the cell, and glycosylation defects. Using bacterial cells loaded with the fluorescent Fura-2 probe, we further obtained direct biochemical evidence that TMEM165 mediates Ca2+ and Mn2+ influxes. We also used the yeast and bacterial systems to evaluate the impact of four disease-causing missense mutations identified in individuals with TMEM165-associated CDG. We found that a mutation leading to a E108G substitution within the conserved UPF0016 family motif significantly reduces TMEM165 activity. These results indicate that TMEM165 can transport Ca2+ and Mn2+, which are both required for proper protein glycosylation in cells.

The group of CDGs has rapidly broadened over the last decade notably because of the development of advanced high-throughput sequencing techniques and consequent identification of responsible genes. This also involves a recent identification of a CDG subtype associated with specific mutations in the gene encoding TMEM165 (transmembrane protein 165) (1Foulquier F. Amyere M. Jaeken J. Zeevaert R.

TMEM165 belongs to a family of poorly characterized membrane proteins (UPF0016 and Pfam PF01169), which are highly conserved through evolution and widely distributed among a high number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. A specific signature of all the orthologous members is the presence of one or two copies of the highly conserved EXGD(K/R)(T/S) motif (2Demaegd D. Colinet A.S. Deschamps A. Morsomme P.

However, data obtained in recent studies gave several indications of their implication in calcium and manganese homeostasis. Namely, we reported that Gdt1p is required for high Ca2+ tolerance and proper Ca2+ response to salt stress (3Demaegd D. Foulquier F. Colinet A.S. Gremillon L. Legrand D. Mariot P. Peiter E.

Regarding the manganese homeostasis, deletion of GDT1 has been shown to lead to intracellular Mn2+ overaccumulation and to modulation of the activity of the Mn2+-dependent enzyme Sod2p (4Thines L.

The implication of Gdt1p, as well as of TMEM165, in manganese homeostasis is further supported by the fact that they are degraded by high external Mn2+ concentrations (5Potelle S. Dulary E. Climer L.

Additionally in the presence of high Ca2+, a lack of Gdt1p in yeast or TMEM165 in human cells was shown to result in protein glycosylation defects possibly because of an imbalanced Golgi-related homeostasis of calcium and/or manganese, two important elements for enzymes acting in glycosylation processes (5Potelle S.

This phenotype is exacerbated in a strain deleted for the Golgi-localized Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase PMR1 (3Demaegd D. Foulquier F. Colinet A.S. Gremillon L. Legrand D. Mariot P. Peiter E. Van Schaftingen E.

Also, it has been shown that a truncated version of TMEM165 partially restores the growth of gdt1Δ strain under high Ca2+ concentration. The N-terminal extension of TMEM165 is not present in Gdt1p and has been hypothesized to act as a nonconserved autoregulatory domain (3Demaegd D. Foulquier F. Colinet A.S. Gremillon L. Legrand D. Mariot P. Peiter E. Van Schaftingen E. Matthijs G. Morsomme P. Newly characterized Golgi-localized family of proteins is involved in calcium and pH homeostasis in yeast and human cells.Proc. Natl.

To improve the expression and activity of TMEM165 in yeast, we have constructed three codon-optimized versions of TMEM165: a full-length version (TMEM165), a version truncated of the first 55 amino acids (Δ55TMEM165), and a version truncated of the first 78 amino acids (Δ78TMEM165) (Fig. S1). The Δ78TMEM165 version is equivalent to the yeast Δ23Gdt1p in which the putative signal sequence has been removed. As shown in Fig. 1A, the codon optimization significantly improved the heterologous production of the three TMEM165 versions in S. cerevisiae gdt1Δpmr1Δ strain. Fig. 1B shows that the nonoptimized full-length TMEM165 was not able to complement the growth defect of the gdt1Δpmr1Δ in the presence of 400 mm Ca2+, whereas the nonoptimized Δ55TMEM165 slightly decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity. This Ca2+ sensitivity was, on the other hand, fully suppressed by the expression of the codon-optimized versions of TMEM165. Strikingly, the expression of Δ78TMEM165 confers higher tolerance when compared with the strains expressing the other TMEM165 variants as well as GDT1. Because the truncated versions are produced at approximately the same level, this better complementation is likely due to the differential truncation. This phenotype is consistent with the previously discussed possibility that the nonconserved N-terminal part of TMEM165 acts as an autoregulatory domain (3Demaegd D. Foulquier F. Colinet A.S. Gremillon L. Legrand D. Mariot P. Peiter E. Van Schaftingen E. Matthijs G. Morsomme P.

In addition to calcium homeostasis, Gdt1p and TMEM165 were recently proposed to play an important role in the regulation of Golgi Mn2+ homeostasis (4Thines L. Deschamps A. Sengottaiyan P. Savel O. Stribny J. Morsomme P. The yeast protein Gdt1p transports Mn2+ ions and thereby regulates manganese homeostasis in the Golgi.J. Biol.

Glycosylation abnormalities in Gdt1p/TMEM165 deficient cells result from a defect in Golgi manganese homeostasis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 (27008884): 1489-150010.1093/hmg/ddw026Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was previously shown that deletion of GDT1 confers an extrasensitivity toward Mn2+ in the pmr1Δ background. The expression of the full-length TMEM165 and the Δ55TMEM165 variants in the gdt1Δpmr1Δ strain did not restore the tolerance to high Mn2+ because the growth was similar to that of the control strain harboring an empty vector. On the contrary, and just as observed in Ca2+-related phenotypic assay, the sensitivity level of the gdt1Δpmr1Δ strain to high Mn2+ was diminished by expression of the truncated Δ78TMEM165 (Fig. 2A). To provide further evidence of the involvement of TMEM165 in Mn2+ homeostasis, the total Mn2+ levels of the WT strain and of gdt1Δpmr1Δ carrying different TMEM165 forms were evaluated using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Fig. 2B). Consistent to our recently reported data (4Thines L. Deschamps A. Sengottaiyan P. Savel O. Stribny J. Morsomme P. The yeast protein Gdt1p transports Mn2+ ions and thereby regulates manganese homeostasis in the Golgi.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29632074): 8048-805510.1074/jbc.RA118.002324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the cellular Mn2+ content of the gdt1Δpmr1Δ strain was ˜30-fold higher when compared with the WT. As already indicated by the growth assay, the cellular Mn2+ content of gdt1Δpmr1Δ was significantly decreased when expressing Δ78TMEM165. It displayed even lower Mn2+ content than gdt1Δpmr1Δ expressing GDT1, suggesting that Δ78TMEM165 would be more active than Gdt1p, as also indicated by the growth test. Interestingly, whereas the growth of the gdt1Δpmr1Δ mutant expressing TMEM165 or the Δ55TMEM165 was similar to the negative control (with empty vector) when exposed to high Mn2+, the total Mn2+ content of gdt1Δpmr1Δ expressing either of the two TMEM165 forms was significantly lower than the negative control and reached levels similar to the strain expressing GDT1. This indicates that although not capable of suppressing the sensitivity of gdt1Δpmr1Δ to high Mn2+, the full-length TMEM165 and the Δ55TMEM165 are still functionally efficient to complement the absence of GDT1 in terms of the Mn2+ content regulation. To unambiguously demonstrate the transport activity of TMEM165, we performed an in vivo functional transport assay in the L. lactis DML1 strain loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+/Mn2+-sensitive Fura-2 probe. Using this strategy, we have previously demonstrated Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport activity of Gdt1p (4Thines L. Deschamps A. Sengottaiyan P. Savel O. Stribny J. Morsomme P. The yeast protein Gdt1p transports Mn2+ ions and thereby regulates manganese homeostasis in the Golgi.J. Biol.

Rep. 2016; 6 (27075443): 2428210.1038/srep24282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the combination of the codon optimization and truncation of the nonconserved N-terminal sequence improved the heterologous expression and functional complementation of TMEM165 in S. cerevisiae. We therefore selected the two truncated variants of TMEM165 and applied a codon optimization specific for heterologous expression in bacteria (Fig. S2). We then verified that these two forms are indeed well-produced in the selected bacterial host (Fig. 3A). The L. lactis cells expressing Δ55TMEM165 or Δ78TMEM165 or containing the empty vector were loaded with the Fura-2 probe. The changes in fluorescence intensity monitored over time correspond to variation of intracellular free cation (Ca2+/Mn2+) concentration, reflecting Ca2+ or Mn2+ transport (Fig. 3B). Upon addition of CaCl2 in the external medium, the cells expressing the truncated TMEM165 variants exhibited a strong increase of the emission of fluorescence at 510 nm after excitation at 340 versus 380 nm (ratio 340/380), reflecting Ca2+ influx, whereas almost no increase was detected in the control strain harboring the empty plasmid. The Mn2+ transport assay takes advantage of the fact that manganese quenches Fura-2–emitted fluorescence, which, when excited at 360 nm (the Fura-2 isosbestic point), is independent of the Ca2+ concentration (4Thines L. Deschamps A. Sengottaiyan P. Savel O. Stribny J. Morsomme P. The yeast protein Gdt1p transports Mn2+ ions and thereby regulates manganese homeostasis in the Golgi.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29632074): 8048-805510.1074/jbc.RA118.002324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly as for Ca2+ transport, the cells expressing the two TMEM165 variants exhibited significantly more pronounced fluorescence quenching after the addition of MnCl2 when compared with the negative control. Although the slight signal decrease observed for the negative control might reflect transport of Mn2+ by L. lactis endogenous transporters, the stronger quenching observed for the clones producing either of the TMEM165 indicates that they mediate Mn2+ influx in L. lactis. Strikingly, the cells expressing Δ78TMEM165 exhibited markedly more pronounced 340/380 increase and more intense fluorescence quenching than the cells with Δ55TMEM165, reflecting better capability of the shorter TMEM165 version to mediate Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport in L. lactis. This observation supports the above described data obtained in S. cerevisiae–related assays. Given this higher activity, Δ78TMEM165 was selected to determine its affinity for Ca2+ and Mn2+ and to further investigate whether the CDG-linked mutations affect the transport activity. The apparent Km for Ca2+ and Mn2+ were determined by in vivo transport measurements in L. lactis at a range of concentrations of CaCl2 and MnCl2 (2.5–200 μm CaCl2 and 10–400 μm MnCl2). The analysis, which exhibited typical Michaelis–Menten saturation kinetics (Fig. 4), revealed the apparent Km of 21 ± 4 μm for Ca2+ and of 170 ± 30 μm for Mn2+. This observation suggests greater affinity of TMEM165 for Ca2+ than for Mn2+, which is consistent with our previously shown data for Gdt1p (4Thines L. Deschamps A. Sengottaiyan P. Savel O. Stribny J. Morsomme P. The yeast protein Gdt1p transports Mn2+ ions and thereby regulates manganese homeostasis in the Golgi.J. Biol.

To assess the impact of the CDG-specific missense mutations E108G, R126H, R126C, and G304R on the transport activity, these mutations were introduced in Δ78TMEM165 by site-directed mutagenesis. We first verified that all these mutated forms are well-produced in bacteria (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the G304R mutated variant was detected by Western blotting as a product of higher size when compared with the nonmutated or the other mutated versions of Δ78TMEM165. Then, using the Fura-2-based functional assay in L. lactis, we determined their impact on Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport capacity (Fig. 5B) and on the transport kinetics by estimating the apparent Km (Table 1). The estimated kinetic parameters indicated that none of the missense mutations modulated the affinity of Δ78TMEM165 for Mn2+, and only Δ78TMEM165 with R126C and G304R mutations displayed a reduced affinity for Ca2+. The cells expressing Δ78TMEM165 with the E108G substitution within the conserved motif displayed significantly lower final fluorescence signal (340/380) after CaCl2 addition, as well as less intense final quenching by MnCl2. This indicates a reduced capacity of the mutated protein to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ although no reduced affinity for the two cations. Similarly, a drop (although to a lesser extent) in the Ca2+/Mn2+ transport capacity was also observed for Δ78TMEM165-R126C. Interestingly, the substitution of the same arginine at position 126 to histidine (R126H) resulted in no reduction of the transport capacity for the two cations. No significant reduction of Ca2+ or Mn2+ transport capacity was observed for the Δ78TMEM165 containing G304R mutation.Table 1The apparent Km (μm) for Ca2+ and Mn2+ estimated by in vivo transport measurements in L. lactis expressing the non"
https://openalex.org/W3005810861,"Background The aim was to identify a novel prognostic miRNA signature for colon cancer (CC) in silico. Methods Data on the expression of miRNAs and relevant clinical information for 407 patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the samples were randomly split into a validation set (n = 203) and training set (n = 204). The differential expression of miRNAs between normal tissues and patients with CC was analyzed. We detected a miRNA expression signature in the training dataset by using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Then, we verified the signature in the validation set. Association of the miRNA signature with overall survival was assessed in the validation cohort and combined cohort by log-rank test and based on Kaplan-Meier curves. The receiver operating characteristic and disease-free survival analyses were performed to evaluate the miRNA signature of CC in the combined cohort. Multivariate and univariate Cox analyses related to survival for the miRNA signature were performed, and a nomogram was built as a prognostic model for CC. To explore the function of target genes of the miRNA signature, Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were used. Results Between the matched normal tissues and colon cancer tissues, 267 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, and a single-factor CoxPH model showed that 13 miRNAs were related to overall survival in the training cohort. Then, a five-miRNA signature was identified using a CoxPH regression model with multiple factors. The five-miRNA signature had significant prognostic value in the training cohort and was validated in the validation cohort and combined cohort. A total of 193 target genes of the miRNA signature were identified. According to the results of functional analysis of the target genes, the signaling pathways MAPK, AMPK and PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, and microRNAs in cancer were remarkably enriched. Conclusion A five-miRNA signature had increased prognostic value for CC, which may provide important biological insights for the discovery and development of molecular predictors to improve the prognosis of patients with CC."

Thus far these responses have been measured with standardized self-report scales, but this study used biometric software for automated facial action analysis to analyze the changes that occur during physical exercise. A sample of 132 young, healthy individuals performed an incremental test on a cycle ergometer. During that test the participants' faces were video-recorded and the changes were algorithmically analyzed at frame rate (30 fps). Perceived exertion and affective valence were measured every two minutes with established psychometric scales. Taking into account anticipated inter-individual variability, multilevel regression analysis was used to model how affective valence and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) covaried with movement in 20 facial action areas. We found the expected quadratic decline in self-reported affective valence (more negative) as exercise intensity increased. Repeated measures correlation showed that the facial action mouth open was linked to changes in (highly intercorrelated) affective valence and RPE. Multilevel trend analyses were calculated to investigate whether facial actions were typically linked to either affective valence or RPE. These analyses showed that mouth open and jaw drop predicted RPE, whereas (additional) nose wrinkle was indicative for the decline in affective valence. Our results contribute to the view that negative affect, escalating with increasing exercise intensity, may be the body's essential warning signal that physiological overload is imminent. We conclude that automated facial action analysis provides new options for researchers investigating feelings during exercise. In addition, our findings offer physical educators and coaches a new way of monitoring the affective state of exercisers, without interrupting and asking them."

Fast-growing Arvicolinae rodent species might be advantageous wild-type animal models for behavioural and medical research related to USV ontogeny. For the yellow steppe lemming Eolagurus luteus, only audible calls of adults were previously described. This study provides categorization and spectrographic analyses of 1176 USV calls emitted by 120 individual yellow steppe lemmings at 12 age classes, from birth to breeding adults over 90 days (d) of age, 10 individuals per age class, up to 10 USV calls per individual. The USV calls emerged since 1st day of pup life and occurred at all 12 age classes and in both sexes. The unified 2-min isolation procedure on an unfamiliar territory was equally applicable for inducing USV calls at all age classes. Rapid physical growth (1 g body weight gain per day from birth to 40 d of age) and the early (9-12 d) eyes opening correlated with the early (9-12 d) emergence of mature vocal patterns of USV calls. The mature vocal patterns included a prominent shift in percentages of chevron and upward contours of fundamental frequency (f0) and the changes in the acoustic variables of USV calls. Call duration was the longest at 1-4 d, significantly shorter at 9-12 d and did not between 9-12-d and older age classes. The maximum fundamental frequency (f0max) decreased with increase of age class, from about 50 kHz in neonates to about 40 kHz in adults. These ontogenetic pathways of USV duration and f0max (towards shorter and lower-frequency USV calls) were reminiscent of those in laboratory mice Mus musculus."
https://openalex.org/W3006432302,"Background Posture is influenced by many factors and dental occlusion seems to have its role on postural stabilization. Our rationale to perform the study was to find out if there are differences of static plantar pressure and stabilometric parameters depending on different dental conditions. Methods The observational study consisted in plantar pressure assessment and stabilometric analysis of 95 right-handed healthy volunteer subjects (mean age 22.94 ± 2.52 years) by using the PoData system. Each subject followed four measurements with open eyes: mandibular postural position, maximum intercuspation, biting on cotton rolls and maximum mouth opening. Plantar pressure was recorded on 1st and 5th metatarsal heads and heel, and was expressed as percentage of weight distribution on each foot. The recorded centre of pressure (CoP) parameters were: CoP path length, 90%confidence ellipse area and maximum CoP speed. Statistical analysis used repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni posthoc analysis and Friedman test. Results Loading on the left 5th metatarsal head was significantly higher in maximum mouth opening condition when compared to maximum intercuspation and to biting on cotton rolls. The left heel loading was significantly lower in the maximum mouth opening in comparison to maximum intercuspation. The CoP path length and maximum CoP speed were significantly higher in maximum mouth opening compared to the other three conditions. Confidence ellipse area had significantly lower values in maximum intercuspation and in the biting on cotton rolls conditions compared to the mandibular postural position, and in maximum intercuspation compared to maximum mouth opening. Conclusion In young adults with an optimum functional occlusion the static plantar pressure is influenced by the maximum mouth opening. An improved postural stability was recorded in maximum intercuspation (a condition used during swallowing) in comparison to mandibular postural position (a condition that allows relaxation of the masticatory muscles after functional moments)."
https://openalex.org/W3005817281,"The Barcelona Brain Health Initiative is a longitudinal cohort study that began in 2017 and aims to understand and characterize the determinants of brain health maintenance in middle aged adults. A cohort of 4686 individuals between the ages of 40 and 65 years free from any neurological or psychiatric diseases was established, and we collected extensive demographic, socio-economic information along with measures of self-perceived health and lifestyles (general health, physical activity, cognitive activity, socialization, sleep, nutrition and vital plan). Here we report on the baseline characteristics of the participants, and the results of the one-year follow-up evaluation. Participants were mainly women, highly educated, and with better lifestyles compared with the general population. After one year 60% of participants completed the one-year follow-up, and these were older, with higher educational level and with better lifestyles in some domains. In the absence of any specific interventions to-date, these participants showed small improvements in physical activity and sleep, but decreased adherence to a Mediterranean diet. These changes were negatively associated with baseline scores, and poorer habits at baseline were predictive of an improvement in lifestyle domains. Of the 2353 participants who completed the one-year follow-up, 73 had been diagnosed with new neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Changes in vital plan at follow-up, as well as gender, sleep quality and sense of coherence at baseline were shown to be significant risk factors for the onset of these diagnoses. Notably, gender risk factor decreased in importance as we adjusted by sleep habits, suggesting its potential mediator effects. These findings stress the importance of healthy lifestyles in sustaining brain health, and illustrate the individual benefit that can be derived from participation in longitudinal observational studies. Modifiable lifestyles, specifically quality of sleep, may partially mediate the effect of other risk factors in the development of some neuropsychiatric conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3005870854,"The stringent response (SR) is a highly conserved stress response in bacteria. It is composed of two factors, (i) a nucleotide alarmone, guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp), and (ii) an RNA polymerase-binding protein, DksA, that regulates various phenotypes, including bacterial virulence. The clinically significant opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses two genes, dksA1 and dksA2, that encode DksA proteins. It remains elusive, however, which of these two genes plays a more important role in SR regulation. In this work, we compared genome-wide, RNA-Seq–based transcriptome profiles of ΔdksA1, ΔdksA2, and ΔdksA1ΔdksA2 mutants to globally assess the effects of these gene deletions on transcript levels coupled with phenotypic analyses. The ΔdksA1 mutant exhibited substantial defects in a wide range of phenotypes, including quorum sensing (QS), anaerobiosis, and motility, whereas the ΔdksA2 mutant exhibited no significant phenotypic changes, suggesting that the dksA2 gene may not have an essential function in P. aeruginosa under the conditions used here. Of note, the ΔdksA1 mutants displayed substantially increased transcription of genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, and we also detected increased polyamine levels in these mutants. Because SAM is a shared precursor for the production of both QS autoinducers and polyamines, these findings suggest that DksA1 deficiency skews the flow of SAM toward polyamine production rather than to QS signaling. Together, our results indicate that DksA1, but not DksA2, controls many important phenotypes in P. aeruginosa. We conclude that DksA1 may represent a potential target whose inhibition may help manage recalcitrant P. aeruginosa infections."
https://openalex.org/W3006649446,"Background As an essential component in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, tree planting is the key to keeping carbon dioxide emissions under control. In 1992, the United Nations agreed to take action at the Earth Summit to stabilize and reduce net zero global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Tree planting was identified as an effective method to offset CO2 emissions. A high net photosynthetic rate (Pn) with fast-growing trees could efficiently fulfill the goal of CO2 emission reduction. Net photosynthetic rate model can provide refernece for plant’s stability of photosynthesis productivity. Methods and results Using leaf phenotype data to predict the Pn can help effectively guide tree planting policies to offset CO2 release into the atmosphere. Tree planting has been proposed as one climate change solution. One of the most popular trees to plant are poplars. This study used a Populus simonii (P. simonii) dataset collected from 23 artificial forests in northern China. The samples represent almost the entire geographic distribution of P. simonii. The geographic locations of these P. simonii trees cover most of the major provinces of northern China. The northwestern point reaches (36°30’N, 98°09’E). The northeastern point reaches (40°91’N, 115°83’E). The southwestern point reaches (32°31’N, 108°90’E). The southeastern point reaches (34°39’N, 113°74’E). The collected data on leaf phenotypic traits are sparse, noisy, and highly correlated. The photosynthetic rate data are nonnormal and skewed. Many machine learning algorithms can produce reasonably accurate predictions despite these data issues. Influential outliers are removed to allow an accurate and precise prediction, and cluster analysis is implemented as part of a data exploratory analysis to investigate further details in the dataset. We select four regression methods, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and generalized additive model (GAM), which are suitable to use on the dataset given in this study. Cross-validation and regularization mechanisms are implemented in the XGBoost, SVM, RF, and GAM algorithms to ensure the validity of the outputs. Conclusions The best-performing approach is XGBoost, which generates a net photosynthetic rate prediction that has a 0.77 correlation with the actual rates. Moreover, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.57, which is approximately 35 percent smaller than the standard deviation of 3.97. The other metrics, i.e., the MAE, R2, and the min-max accuracy are 1.12, 0.60, and 0.93, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability of machine learning models to use noisy leaf phenotype data to predict the net photosynthetic rate with significant accuracy. Most net photosynthetic rate prediction studies are conducted on herbaceous plants. The net photosynthetic rate prediction of P. simonii, a kind of woody plant, illustrates significant guidance for plant science or environmental science regarding the predictive relationship between leaf phenotypic characteristics and the Pn for woody plants in northern China."
https://openalex.org/W3005580847,"Abstract Kidney cancer incidences are rising globally, thereby fueling the demand for targeted therapies and precision medicine. In our previous work, we have identified and characterized the Ras-Association Domain Family encoding ten members that are often aberrantly expressed in human cancers. In this study, we created and analyzed the Rassf10 knockout mice. Here we show that Rassf10 haploinsufficiency promotes neoplasia formation in two established mouse cancer models (Rassf1A −/− and p53 −/− ). Haploinsufficient Rassf10 knockout mice were significantly prone to various diseases including lymphoma (Rassf1A −/− background) and thymoma (p53 −/− background). Especially Rassf10 −/− and p53-deficient mice exhibited threefold increased rates of kidney cysts compared with p53 −/− controls. Moreover, we observed that in human kidney cancer, RASSF10 is frequently epigenetically inactivated by its CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Primary tumors of renal clear cell and papillary cell carcinoma confirmed that RASSF10 methylation is associated with decreased expression in comparison to normal kidney tissue. In independent data sets, we could validate that RASSF10 inactivation clinically correlated with decreased survival and with progressed disease state of kidney cancer patients and polycystic kidney size. Functionally, we revealed that the loss of Rassf10 was significantly associated with upregulation of KRAS signaling and MYC expression. In summary, we could show that Rassf10 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. In combination with other markers, RASSF10 silencing can serve as diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarker in kidney diseases."

It remains unclear whether MSCs were effective in treating mice with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and its underlying mechanism. In the present study, MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of 4–6 week-old C57BL/6N male mice. AH was induced in female mice by chronic-binge ethanol feeding for 10 days. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) transplantation of MSCs or saline were performed in mice on day 10. Blood samples and hepatic tissues were harvested on day 11. Biochemical, liver histological and flow cytometric analyses were performed. Compared to the control mice, the AH mice had significantly increased liver/body weight ratio, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferases (AST), hepatic total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic neutrophil and macrophage infiltration (P<0.001), which were markedly reduced by i.p. transplantation of MSCs (P<0.01). Compared to the control mice, the hepatic glutathione (GSH) was prominently lower in the AH mice (P<0.001), which was markedly enhanced after i.p. injection of MSCs (P<0.001). MSCs were effective for the treatment of AH mice, which might be associated with their ability in inhibiting hepatic neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and alleviating oxidative stress."

Currently, there is limited information on the circulating HIV-1 strains, the distribution of these strains and antiretroviral (ART) resistant viruses in different regions of the country, and the HIV-1 strains harbored by the high-risk groups like female sex workers (FSW) reported to be the source of recombinant and ART resistant viruses. Methods Dried Blood Spots (DBS), collected from 325 infected FSWs in ten cities from 2012 DRC HIV/STI Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey, were tested for HIV-1 genotypes and antiretroviral resistance mutations. Regional segregation of HIV-1 clades was detected using phylogenetics. The significance for differences in HIV-1 subtype and drug resistance mutations were evaluated using Chi-square tests.

Based on env sequences, the predominant subtype was A1 (44%), and recombinants as defined pol sequences comprised 35% of the total sample. Paired sequences of pol and env from DRC FSW revealed mosaic recombinant in 54% of the sequences. Distinct geographic distributions of different HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants were observed. Subtype A1 was prevalent (40%) in Goma located in the East and significantly higher than in Mbuji-Mayi (p<0.05) in the South-central region, or in Lubumbashi in the South. Antiretroviral resistance was detected in 21.5% of 93 pol sequences analyzed, with the M184I/V and K103N mutations that confer high-level resistance to NRTI and NNRTI, respectively, being the most frequent mutations. However, the K103N mutant viruses were found only in the East. Conclusion HIV-1 variants found in DRC FSW reflect those reported to circulate in the general population from the corresponding geographical locations. HIV-1 mosaic genetics were readily detected in FSW. Importantly, ART resistance mutations to NNRTI and NRTI were common in the DRC sex workers."
https://openalex.org/W3005635172,"Improper positioning, attachment, and suckling are constructs for ineffective breastfeeding technique (IBT). IBT results in inadequate intake of breast milk, which leads to poor weight gain, stunting, and declines immunity. Besides, IBT increases the risk of postpartum breast problems. Despite its impact on maternal and child health, breastfeeding technique is not well studied in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of IBT and associated factors among lactating mothers attending public health facilities of South Ari district, Southern Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 lactating mothers attending public health facilities of South Ari district from March 1-29, 2019. A structured observational checklist and interviewer-administered questionnaires were used. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were carried out using binary logistic regression to assess the association between explanatory variables and IBT. Statistical significance was declared at p-value < 0.05.Overall, the prevalence of IBT was 63.5% [95% confidence interval (CI); 59.0%, 68.0%]. Having no formal education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 5.0, 95% CI: 2.3, 10.5], delivering at home [AOR: 4.5; 95% CI; 1.6, 13.1], having breast problems [AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.7], being primiparous [AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2], not receiving counseling during pregnancy and postnatal period [AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.9 and AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 5.1 respectively] were significantly associated with IBT.IBT was very high in the study area. Thus, empowering women, increasing institutional delivery, and providing continuous counseling about breastfeeding throughout the maternal continuum of care is invaluable to improve breastfeeding techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3006155777,"Hepatitis C (HCV) infection is a significant health threat, with increasing incidence rates in the setting of the opioid crisis. Many patients miss appointments and cannot initiate treatment. We implemented financial incentives to improve appointment attendance in a primary care-based HCV treatment setting.We conducted a systems-level financial incentives intervention at the Adult Primary Care HCV Treatment Program at Boston Medical Center which provides care to many patients with substance use disorders. From April 1 to June 30, 2017, we provided a $15 gift card to patients who attended appointments with an HCV treatment provider. We evaluated the effectiveness of the incentives by 1) conducting a monthly interrupted time series analysis to assess trends in attendance January 2016-September 2017; and 2) comparing the proportion of attended appointments during the intervention to a historical comparison group in the previous year, April 1 to June 30, 2016.327 visits were scheduled over the study period; 198 during the intervention and 129 during the control period. Of patient visits in the intervention group, 72.7% were attended relative to 61.2% of comparison group visits (p = 0.03). Appointments in the intervention group were more likely to be attended (adjusted odds ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.24). Interrupted time series analysis showed that the intervention was associated with an average increase of 15.4 attended visits per 100 appointments scheduled, compared to the period prior to the intervention (p = 0.01).Implementation of a financial incentive program was associated with improved appointment attendance at a safety-net hospital-based primary care HCV treatment program. A randomized trial to establish efficacy and broader implementation potential is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3006476572,"Host-associated microbial communities can influence the overall health of their animal hosts, and many factors, including behavior and physiology, can impact the formation of these complex communities. Bacteria within these communities can be transmitted socially between individuals via indirect (e.g., shared environments) or direct (e.g., physical contact) pathways. Limited research has been done to investigate how social interactions that occur in the context of mating shape host-associated microbial communities. To gain a better understanding of these interactions and, more specifically, to assess how mating behavior shapes an animal’s microbiome, we studied the cloacal bacterial communities of a socially monogamous yet genetically polygynous songbird, the North American tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor). We address two questions: (1) do the cloacal bacterial communities differ between female and male tree swallows within a population? and (2) do pair-bonded social partners exhibit more similar cloacal bacterial communities than expected by chance? To answer these questions, we sampled the cloacal microbiome of adults during the breeding season and then used culture-independent, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess bacterial communities. Overall, we found that the cloacal bacterial communities of females and males were similar, and that the communities of pair-bonded social partners were not more similar than expected by chance. Our results suggest that social monogamy does not correlate with an increased similarity in cloacal bacterial community diversity or structure. As social partners were not assessed at the same time, it is possible that breeding stage differences masked social effects on bacterial community diversity and structure. Further, given that tree swallows exhibit high variation in rates of extra-pair activity, considering extra-pair activity when assessing cloacal microbial communities may be important for understanding how these bacterial communities are shaped. Further insight into how bacterial communities are shaped will ultimately shed light on potential tradeoffs associated with alternative behavioral strategies and socially-transmitted microbes."
https://openalex.org/W3005850760,"Despite the existence of evidence-based recommendations to decrease risk and progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) for some time, self-reported practices suggest that eyecare professionals’ advice and people with AMD’s adherence to these recommendations can be very poor. This study uses qualitative methods to explore Australian eyecare professionals’ perspective on barriers to effective AMD care. Seven focus groups involving 65 optometrists were conducted by an experienced facilitator. A nominal group technique was used to identify, prioritize and semi-quantify barriers and enablers to AMD care. Participants individually ranked their perceived top five barriers and enablers with the most important granted a score of 5 and the least important a score of 1. For each barrier or enabler, the number of votes it received and its total score were recorded. Barriers and enablers selected by at least one participant in their top 5 were then qualitatively analysed, grouped using thematic analysis and total score calculated for each consolidated barrier or enabler. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 10 ophthalmologists and 2 optometrists. Contributions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with NVivo software. One hundred and sixty-nine barriers and 51 enablers to AMD care were identified in the focus groups. Of these, 102 barriers and 42 enablers were selected as one of their top 5 by at least one participant and further consolidated into 16 barriers and 10 enablers after thematic analysis. Factors impacting AMD care identified through analysis of the transcripts were coded to three categories of influence: patient-centered, practitioner-centered, and structural factors. Eyecare professionals considered poor care pathways, people with AMD’s poor disease understanding / denial, and cost of care / lack of funding, as the most significant barriers to AMD care; they considered shared care model, access, and communication as the most significant enablers to good AMD care. These findings suggest that Australian eyecare professionals perceive that there is a need for improved patient support systems and appropriately funded, clearer care pathway to benefit people with AMD."

Despite recent advances in the medical care, minimal attempts are made to improve psychological health in these patients. In this study, we aim to describe the psychological morbidity in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia and their mothers in Sri Lanka.This case control study was conducted in the three largest thalassaemia centres of Sri Lanka. All patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia aged 4-18 years were recruited as cases whilst a randomly selected group of children without chronic diseases were recruited as controls. Psychological morbidity of children was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and depressive symptoms of mothers was assessed by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.288 transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia patients and equal number of controls were recruited. Abnormal emotional, conduct, hyperactivity and peer relationship symptom scores were reported by 18%, 17%, 9% and 14% of patients with thalassaemia respectively. Prevalences of abnormal psychological symptom scores in all domains were significantly higher among patients compared to controls. Abnormal conduct symptoms were significantly more prevalent among patients with HbE β-thalassaemia and those with suboptimal pretransfusion haemoglobin levels, lower transfusion volumes, hypothyroidism and undernutrition. Short stature was associated with abnormal emotional and hyperactivity scores. Depressive symptoms were significantly higher among mothers of patients with thalassaemia. Higher depressive symptom scores in mothers were significantly associated with abnormal emotional, conduct and peer relationship symptom scores in children.A higher proportion of patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia had abnormal psychological symptom scores. Abnormal conduct symptoms were more prevalent among patients with HbE β-thalassaemia, those who were inadequately transfused and having hypothyroidism and undernutrition. Mothers of the children with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia had significantly higher depressive symptoms which were significantly associated with psychological symptoms among children."
https://openalex.org/W3006215986,"Broiler chickens experience an acute-phase response (APR) through vaccination, which reflects the innate immunity and stress related to immunization. It is also considered that APR can modulate adaptive immunity and response to infection. As biomarkers for APR, assessing the acute-phase proteins (APPs) function and their levels in response to immunization is of great value for vaccine design, development and administration. In this study, the heterophils/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and the level of APPs was evaluated in broilers with three different Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination regimens. Inactivated ND vaccine (IND) was administered by the intramuscular route. Live attenuated strains, Lasota and Vitapest, was administered by ocular routes. H/L ratio, serum amyloid A (SAA) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) were measured before and after two rounds of vaccination on days 10 and 21. In a comparison between the three vaccines, H/L ratio in IND group significantly increased to 3 fold (1.48 ± 0.41) after the first vaccination while the Lasota and Vitapest showed a milder response. The concentration of SAA increased after 24h by 1.8-fold in IND group (0.116 ± 0.015 mg/L) and 2-fold in Lasota group (0.14 ± 0.002 mg/L). Significant changes were found in Vitapest group after 48h post vaccination (0.113 ± 0.016 mg/L). Elevation pattern of AGP, 24 hours after first vaccination in IND (3.5-fold) and Vitapest (2.5-fold) was different from Lasota in which the peak was reached after 48 hours (2.9-fold). Except for IND group, no significant changes in SAA and AGP concentrations were detected after the second vaccination. A significant positive correlation between SAA values at day 22 and HI titers at day 28 (r = 0.998, P≤0. 0.005) was found. According to these results, different types of ND vaccines can cause different patterns of acute phase responses. Assessment of stress and level of acute-phase proteins can be used for prediction of immune response outcomes in vaccine design and development."
https://openalex.org/W3005560092,"There are multiple common methods for collecting fossil material in the field for paleoecological analyses, so it is important to determine if and how different methods may affect the similarities and differences among taxonomic samples. Here, we evaluate the influence of two fossil collection field methods (stratigraphically in-place bulk-sediment versus picking up weathered-out fossils from the ground surface) on paleoecological results, using the Pennsylvanian marine invertebrate assemblages of the Finis Shale in Texas. Based on an informal review of recent paleoecology papers, we observed that the lithology of the study material and the nature of the research question correspond to choice of field collection protocols; however, collection protocols are not always clearly explained or justified in the text of the papers. For the present case study, we collected stratigraphically equivalent samples from three outcrops using both the surface pick-up and in-place bulk sediment methods. We found a difference in the abundance and composition of paleocommunities between these two collection methods. Evidence to support this includes the significant differences between samples using PERMANOVA (p < 0.001), the clear separation in ordination space of samples clustered by sampling method, the significantly higher richness in the surface samples (p < 0.001), and the considerable variation in relative abundances of various taxa and taxonomic groups. Richness and evenness were higher among the surface-collected samples, possibly due to collector bias, weathering artifacts, or spatial and temporal variability. Paleontologists strive to do the best science possible with the material available. Often, paleoecological research methods are limited by time, funding, or the nature of the material. In such cases, we recommend examining both collection methods, even if for only a fraction of the sampling. If only one method is possible, we recommend the use in-place, bulk-collected samples."

For this aim, we used a four-wave longitudinal study with a one-year interval in schoolchildren in grades 1-4 in Russia and Kyrgyzstan (N = 490, mean age was 7.65 years at grade 1). The results of mixed-effects growth models revealed that growth in the precision of symbolic representation was larger than in the nonsymbolic representation. Moreover, growth in nonsymbolic representation was fully explained by growth in fluid intelligence (FI), visuospatial working memory (VSWM) and processing speed (PS). The analysis demonstrated that growth in nonsymbolic magnitude representation was significant only for pupils with a high level of FI and PS, whereas growth in precision of symbolic representation did not significantly vary across pupils with different levels of FI or VSWM."
https://openalex.org/W3006012082,"Brain aggregates of β amyloid (βA) protein plaques have been widely recognized as associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, and their identification can assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We investigate the feasibility of using a spectral x-ray coherent scatter system with a silicon strip photon-counting detector for identifying brain βA protein plaques. This approach is based on differences in the structure of amyloid, white and grey matter in the brain. We simulated an energy- and angular-dispersive X-ray diffraction system with an x-ray pencil beam and Silicon strip sensor, energy-resolving detectors. The polychromatic beam is geometrically focused toward a region of interest in the brain. First, the open-source MC-GPU code for Monte Carlo transport was modified to accommodate the detector model. Second, brain phantoms with and without βA were simulated to assess the method and determine the radiation dose required to obtain acceptable statistical power. For βA targets of 3, 4 and 5 mm sizes in a 15-cm brain model, the required incident exposure was about 0.44 mR from a 60 kVp tungsten spectrum and 3.5 mm of added aluminum filtration. The results suggest that the proposed x-ray coherent scatter technique enables the use of high energy x-ray spectra and therefore has the potential to be used for accurate in vivo detection and quantification of βA in the brain within acceptable radiation dose levels."
https://openalex.org/W3006579549,"Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on animal as well as human hosts. Targeting the vector, while feeding on animals, can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Agricultural animals are regularly vaccinated with recombinant proteins for the control of multiple endo- and ecto-parasitic infestations. The use of a Subolesin-vaccine showed a mark reduction in tick reproductive fitness. The orthologous gene of Subolesin, called Akirin in insects, might provide a valuable species-specific intervention against outdoor biting An. arabiensis. However, the biological function of this nuclear protein has not yet been investigated in this mosquito. The effects on An. arabiensis lifetable parameters were evaluated after Akirin was knocked down using commercial small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and in vitro transcribed double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The siRNA mediated interference of Akirin significantly reduced fecundity by 17%, fertility by 23% and longevity by 32% when compared to the controls in the female mosquitoes tested. Similarly, dsRNA treatment had a 25% decrease in fecundity, 29% decrease in fertility, and 48% decrease in longevity, when compared to the control treatments. Mosquitoes treated with Akirin dsRNA had a mean survival time of 15-days post-inoculation, which would impact on their ability to transmit malaria parasites. These results strongly suggest that Akirin has a pleiotropic function in An. arabiensis longevity and reproductive fitness."

The life expectancy of the world population has increased in the last decades, bringing as complications the occurrence of diseases that undergoing metabolic, bone, cardiological, vascular and neurological alterations. HIV-infected patients experience these changes early and are living longer due to the success of antiretroviral therapy. The objectives of this study was to evaluate some changes in the plasma hemostatic profile of 115 HIV-reactive elderly individuals over 60 years old in the chronic phase of infection, and compare with 88 healthy uninfected elderly individuals. Plasma determinations of D-dimers, Fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor, Antithrombin, Prothrombin Time, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, and platelet count were performed. In the HIV-reactive group, these variables were analyzed according to viral load, protease inhibitor use and CD4+ T lymphocyte values. After adjusted values for age and sex, the results showed higher levels of Antithrombin (103%; 88%, p = 0.0001) and Prothrombin Time activities (92.4%; 88.2%, p = 0.019) in the HIV group compared to the control group. We observed higher values of Fibrinogen in protease inhibitor users in both the male (p = 0.043) and female (p = 0.004) groups, and in the female HIV group with detected viral load (p = 0.015). The male HIV group with a CD4+ count> 400 cells / mm3 presented higher von Willebrand Factor values (p = 0.036). D-Dimers had higher values in the older age groups (p = 0.003; p = 0.042, respectively).Our results suggest that the elderly with chronic HIV infection with few comorbidities had a better hemostatic profile than negative control group, reflecting the success of treatment. Protease inhibitor use and age punctually altered this profile."

Three genetic maps were obtained, one for each of the parents and an integrated one. In these three maps, 17 linkage groups were constructed. The female and male parent maps contained 2657 and 4088 SNP markers, respectively, and had genetic distances of 2689.65 and 2558.41 cM, respectively, whereas the integrated map was 2470.02 cM, and contained 6,384 SNP markers. QTL mapping based on six agronomic traits, namely fruit transverse diameter, vertical diameter, single fruit weight, pericarp brittleness, pericarp puncture hardness, and average sarcocarp firmness were conducted, and 25 QTLs were detected in seven linkage groups. Explained phenotypic variation rate ranged from 17.7% to 35%.

https://openalex.org/W3006540368,"Introduction As HIV is very effectively acquired during condomless receptive anal intercourse (AI) with serodiscordant and viremic partners, the practice could contribute to the high prevalence among female sex workers (FSW) in eSwatini (formerly known as Swaziland). We aim to estimate the proportion reporting AI (AI prevalence) among Swazi FSW and to identify the correlates of AI practice in order to better inform HIV prevention interventions among this population. Methods Using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), 325 Swazi FSW were recruited in 2011. We estimated the prevalence of AI and AI with inconsistent condom use in the past month with any partner type, and inconsistent condom use during AI and vaginal intercourse (VI) by partner type. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify behavioural and structural correlates associated with AI and AI with inconsistent condom use. Results RDS-adjusted prevalence of AI and AI with inconsistent condom use was high, at 44%[95% confidence interval (95%CI):35–53%]) and 34%[95%CI:26–42%], respectively and did not vary by partner type. HIV prevalence was high in this sample of FSW (70%), but knowledge that AI increases HIV acquisition risk low, with only 10% identifying AI as the riskiest sex act. Those who reported AI were more likely to be better educated (adjusted odds ratio(aOR) = 1.92[95%CI:1.03–3.57]), to have grown up in rural areas (aOR = 1.90[95%CI:1.09–3.32]), have fewer new clients in the past month (aOR = 0.33[95%CI:0.16–0.68]), and for last sex with clients to be condomless (aOR = 2.09[95%CI:1.07–4.08]). Although FSW reporting AI in past month were more likely to have been raped (aOR = 1.95[95%CI:1.05–3.65]) and harassed because of being a sex worker (aOR = 2.09[95%CI:1.16–3.74]), they were also less likely to have ever been blackmailed (aOR = 0.50[95%CI:0.25–0.98]) or been afraid to walk in public places (aOR = 0.46[95%CI:0.25–0.87]). Correlates of AI with inconsistent condom use were similar to those of AI. Conclusions AI is commonly practised and condom use is inconsistent among Swazi FSW. Sex act data are needed to determine how frequently AI is practiced. Interventions to address barriers to condom use are needed, as are biomedical interventions that reduce acquisition risk during AI."
https://openalex.org/W3006226539,"Background Higher alanine transaminase (ALT), indicating poor liver function, is positively associated with diabetes but inversely associated with body mass index (BMI) in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, suggesting liver function affects muscle mass. To clarify, we assessed the associations of liver enzymes with muscle and fat mass observationally with two-sample MR as a validation. Methods In the population-representative “Children of 1997” birth cohort (n = 3,455), we used multivariable linear regression to assess the adjusted associations of ALT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at ~17.5 years with muscle mass and body fat percentage observationally. Genetic variants predicting ALT, ALP and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) were applied to fat-free and fat mass in the UK Biobank (n = ~331,000) to obtain unconfounded MR estimates. Results Observationally, ALT was positively associated with muscle mass (0.11 kg per IU/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.12) and fat percentage (0.15% per IU/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.17). ALP was inversely associated with muscle mass (-0.03 kg per IU/L, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.02) and fat percentage (-0.02% per IU/L, 95% CI -0.03 to -0.01). Using MR, ALT was inversely associated with fat-free mass (-0.41 kg per 100% in concentration, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.19) and fat mass (-0.58 kg per 100% in concentration, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.30). ALP and GGT were unclearly associated with fat-free mass or fat mass. Conclusion ALT reducing fat-free mass provides a possible pathway for the positive association of ALT with diabetes and suggests a potential target of intervention."

Methods Twenty-one patients with serial 2D FSPGR-MR cine scans of the head and neck conducted through the course of definitive radiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer. Included patients had at least one cine scan before, during, or after radiotherapy, with a total of 52 cine scans. Contours of 7 swallowing related regions-of-interest (ROIs), including pharyngeal constrictor, epiglottis, base of tongue, geniohyoid, hyoid, soft palate, and larynx, were manually delineated from consecutive frames of the cine scan covering at least one swallowing cycle. We applied a modified thin-plate-spline robust-point-matching algorithm to register the point sets of each ROI automatically over frames. The deformation vector fields from the registration were then used to estimate the motion during swallowing for each ROI. Registration errors were estimated by comparing the deformed contours with the manual contours. Results On average 22 frames of each cine scan were contoured. The registration for one cine scan (7 ROIs over 22 frames) on average took roughly 22 minutes. A number of 8018 registrations were successfully batch processed without human interaction after the contours were drawn. The average registration error for all ROIs and all patients was 0.36 mm (range: 0.06 mm– 2.06 mm). Larynx had the average largest motion in superior direction of all structures under consideration (range: 0.0 mm– 58.7 mm). Geniohyoid had the smallest overall motion of all ROIs under consideration and the superior-inferior motion was larger than the anterior-posterior motion for all ROIs. Conclusion We developed and validated a deformable registration framework to automate the estimation of swallowing motion from 2D MR cine scans."

Methods In this retrospective study, a total of 13 patients with IC or SBO aged ≧65 years were analyzed. CVRR was measured in patients with IC and SBO and controls. Results CVRR averaged to 8.8% ± 2.5% in controls, 1.4% ± 0.4% in patients with IC, and 2.4% ± 1.0% in SBO groups (p < 0.001). CVRR was significantly lower in patients with IC and SBO than that in controls. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the possibility that CVRR may serve as a clinical index for assessing the functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with IC or SBO."

Whereas the initial obvious conclusion is that age, sex, and ethnicity are strong predictors of eGFR, more rigorous interpretation suggests that this is a byproduct of the mathematical model produced when deriving new predictors from another.While statistical models have the ability to identify vertical collinearity (predictor-predictor), lateral collinearity (predictor-outcome) is seldom identified and discussed in statistical analysis. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting the correlation between age, gender, and ethnicity with eGFR derived from regression analyses."

The CareTrack Kids (CTK) study assessed care of Australian children aged 0-15 years, in 2012 and 2013, to evaluate the proportion in line with guideline-based indicators for 17 common conditions. Overall adherence to guideline-based recommended practice occurred 59.8% of care encounters (95% CI: 57.5-62.0), and 78.3% (95% CI: 75.1-81.2) for head injury. This paper presents results for head injury, at indicator level.A modified version of the RAND-UCLA method of indicator development was used. Indicators, measurable components of a standard or guideline, were developed from international and national guidelines relating to head injury in children and were ratified by clinical experts using a Delphi process. Paediatric nurses extracted data from medical records from general practitioners (GPs), emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient wards in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, for children under 15 years receiving care in 2012-13. Our purpose was to estimate the percentage adherent for each indicator.The medical records of 629 children with head injury were examined. Fifty-one percent of children were under 5 years old, with more males (61%) than females. Thirty-eight indicators were assessed. Avoidance of nasotracheal airways (100%; 95% CI: 99.4-100) or nasogastric tubes (99.7%; 95% CI: 98.5-100) for children with a head injury had the highest adherence. Indicators relating to primary and secondary assessment of head injuries were mostly adhered to. However, adherence to other indicators was poor (e.g., documentation of the past history of children (e.g., presence or absence of seizures) before the injury; 29.9% (95% CI: 24.5-35.7)), and for others was difficult to estimate with confidence due to small sample sizes (e.g., Children with a head injury who were intubated had PaO2 above 80mm Hg; 56.0% (95% CI: 28.6-80.9)). Indicators guiding clinical decision making regarding the need for CT scan had insufficient data to justify reporting.This study highlights that management of head injury in children mostly follows guidelines, but also flags some specific areas of inconsistency. Individual sites are encouraged to use these results to guide investigation of local practices and inform quality improvement endeavours."

https://openalex.org/W3006306844,"Objectives Hyperkyphosis is associated with restricted pulmonary function and posture, potentially contributing to poor sleep. A previous study reported older women with hyperkyphosis had worse self-reported sleep quality, but it is less clear if this association exists in men. We examined the association between hyperkyphosis and subjective and objective sleep quality in a cohort of older men. Design Longitudinal analysis of data from large cohort of older men participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Setting Community. Participants We studied 754 men participants in MrOS who had kyphosis measured during the 3rd clinic visit (2007–2009) and future subjective and objective sleep quality assessed between 2009–2012 (an average of 2.9 years later). Intervention N/A. Measurements To measure kyphosis, 1.7 cm thick wooden blocks were placed under the participant’s head to achieve a neutral spine position while lying supine on a DXA table. We collected data on both subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and objective (wrist actigraphy: Total Sleep Time [TST], Wake After Sleep Onset [WASO], Sleep Efficiency [SE], Sleep Onset Latency [SOL]; and polysomnography: Apnea Hypopnea Index [AHI]) sleep measurements. Those who required >3 blocks were considered hyperkyphotic (n = 145 or 19.2%). Results In unadjusted and multivariable analyses, men with hyperkyphosis did not report having worse self-reported sleep characteristics based on PSQI and ESS. Similarly, there were no significant associations between hyperkyphosis and objective sleep measures. When examined as a continuous predictor (blocks ranging from 0–8), results were no different. Conclusions Although we hypothesized that poor posture in those with hyperkyphosis would interfere with sleep, in this sample of older men, worse kyphosis was not associated with self-reported or objectively measured poor sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W3006377851,"Many studies have used grit (in the form of lead (Pb) pellets) presence in avian gizzards as an indicator of Pb shot exposure. However, due to nearly complete pellet absorption in gizzards or rapid passage of pellets, the absence of Pb shot presence in a gizzard does not confirm lack of Pb shot exposure. This study provides the basis for an additional technique to identify if elevated tissue Pb concentration is due to Pb shot exposure. Bioaccessibility of Pb and trace elements (Sb, As, and Sn) present in Pb shot were quantified to determine if any of these elements would be useful as a secondary marker of Pb shot exposure. An avian physiologically based extraction test (PBET) was used to determine pellet dissolution rate and bioaccessible concentrations of Pb, Sb, As, and Sn in a simulated gizzard environment. Of the three trace elements, only Sb concentrations (44-302 μg/mL) extracted into the gizzard solution were greater than environmental background levels (US soil average 0.48 μg/g); thus, no natural source likely provides this amount of Sb. Therefore, there is evidence that Sb can be extracted from Pb shot in bird gizzards at detectable concentrations (above natural background). While further studies are needed to delineate the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, this study lends credence to the hypothesis that Sb may be a useful marker of Pb shot exposure in biological tissues, particularly when Pb pellets are not present nor observed in avian tissues."
