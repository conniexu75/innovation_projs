More than 2000 families have been evaluated to date. On average, probands in the current sample exhibit moderate to severe autistic symptoms with relatively little intellectual disability. An interactive database has been created to facilitate correlations between clinical, genetic, and neurobiological data."

We designed multidirectional analyses integrating microarray-based data with biostatistics and bioinformatics to elucidate the signaling and metabolic alterations underlying CRC development in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Methodology/Principal Findings Studies were performed on normal mucosa, adenoma, and carcinoma samples obtained during surgery or colonoscopy. Collections of cryostat sections prepared from the tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist to control the relative cell type content. The measurements were done using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133plus2, and probe set data was generated using two normalization algorithms: MAS5.0 and GCRMA with least-variant set (LVS). The data was evaluated using pair-wise comparisons and data decomposition into singular value decomposition (SVD) modes. The method selected for the functional analysis used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Expressional profiles obtained in 105 samples of whole tissue sections were used to establish oncogenic signaling alterations in progression of CRC, while those representing 40 microdissected specimens were used to select differences in KEGG pathways between epithelium and mucosa. Based on a consensus of the results obtained by two normalization algorithms, and two probe set sorting criteria, we identified 14 and 17 KEGG signaling and metabolic pathways that are significantly altered between normal and tumor samples and between benign and malignant tumors, respectively. Several of them were also selected from the raw microarray data of 2 recently published studies (GSE4183 and GSE8671). Conclusion/Significance Although the proposed strategy is computationally complex and labor–intensive, it may reduce the number of false results."
https://openalex.org/W2053702192,"It has been reported that the miR-106b∼25 cluster, a paralog of the miR-17∼92 cluster, possesses oncogenic activities. However, the precise role of each microRNA (miRNA) in the miR-106b∼25 cluster is not yet known. In this study, we examined the function of miR-93, one of the microRNAs within the miR-106b∼25 cluster, in angiogenesis and tumor formation. We found that miR-93 enhanced cell survival, promoted sphere formation and augmented tumor growth. Most strikingly, when miR-93-overexpressing U87 cells were co-cultured with endothelial cells, they supported endothelial cell spreading, growth, migration and tube formation. In vivo studies revealed that miR-93-expressing cells induced blood vessel formation, allowing blood vessels to extend to tumor tissues in high densities. Angiogenesis promoted by miR-93 in return facilitated cell survival, resulting in enhanced tumor growth. We further showed that integrin-β8 is a target of miR-93. Higher levels of integrin-β8 are associated with cell death in tumor mass and in human glioblastoma. Silencing of integrin-β8 expression using small interfering RNA promoted cell proliferation, whereas ectopic expression of integrin-β8 decreased cell growth. These findings showed that miR-93 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing, at least in part, integrin-β8 expression. Our results suggest that inhibition of miR-93 function may be a feasible approach to suppress angiogenesis and tumor growth."

Here, we investigated microRNAs (miRNAs) in self-limited acute inflammatory exudates and their regulation by resolvin D1 (RvD1). Using real-time PCR analysis, we found in resolving exudates that miR-21, miR-146b, miR-208a, miR-203, miR-142, miR-302d, and miR-219 were selectively regulated (P<0.05) in self-limited murine peritonitis. RvD1 (300 ng/mouse or 15 µgkg-1) reduced zymosan-elicited neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneum 25–50% and shortened the resolution interval (ßi)by ~4 h. In peritonitis at 12 h, RvD1 up-regulated miR-21, miR-146b, and miR-219 and down-regulated miR-208a in vivo. In human macrophages overexpressing recombinant RvD1 receptors ALX/FPR2 or GPR32, these same miRNAs were significantly regulated (P<0.05) by RvD1 at concentrations as low as 10 nM, recapitulating the in vivo circuit. In addition, RvD1-miRNAs identified herein target cytokines and proteins involved in the immune system, e.g., miR-146b targeted NF-κB signaling, and miR-219 targeted 5-lipoxygenase and reduced leukotriene production. RvD1 also reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and SMAD and down-regulated phospho-IκB. Taken together, these results indicate that resolvin-regulated specific miR-NAs target genes involved in resolution and establish a novel resolution circuit involving RvD1 receptor-dependent regulation of specific miRNAs.—Recchiuti, A., Krishnamoorthy, S., Fredman, G., Chiang, N., and Serhan, C.

https://openalex.org/W2150892563,"Little is currently known about the infectious entry process of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) into host cells, which may represent potential anti-viral targeting sites. In this study a targeted small-interfering RNA (siRNA) screening platform assay was established and validated to identify and profile key cellular genes involved in processes of endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics, and endosomal trafficking essential for HEV71 infection. Screen evaluation was conducted via the expression of well characterized dominant-negative mutants, bioimaging studies (double-labeled immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy analysis), secondary siRNA-based dosage dependence studies, and drug inhibition assays. The infectious entry of HEV71 into rhabdomyosarcoma cells was shown to be significantly inhibited by siRNAs targeting genes associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) that include AP2A1, ARRB1, CLTC, CLTCL1, SYNJ1, ARPC5, PAK1, ROCK1, and WASF1. The functional role of CME was verified by the observation of strong co-localization between HEV71 particles and clathrin as well as dose-dependent inhibition of HEV71 infection upon siRNA knockdown of CME-associated genes. HEV71 entry by CME was further confirmed via inhibition by dominant-negative EPS15 mutants and treatment of CME drug inhibitors, with more than 80% inhibition observed at 20 μm chlorpromazine. Furthermore, HEV71 infection was shown to be sensitive to the disruption of human genes in regulating early to late endosomal trafficking as well as endosomal acidic pH. The identification of clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the entry pathway for HEV71 infection of susceptible host cells contributes to a better understanding of HEV71 pathogenesis and enables future development of anti-viral strategies against HEV71 infection.

The identification of clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the entry pathway for HEV71 infection of susceptible host cells contributes to a better understanding of HEV71 pathogenesis and enables future development of anti-viral strategies against HEV71 infection. Numerous animal viruses utilize various endocytic mechanisms available in mammalian cells for productive infection. Host endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-dependent uptake, macropinocytosis and cholesterol-dependent endocytosis, are commonly employed to mediate the infectious entry of virus particles into host cells (1Marsh M. Helenius A. Cell. 2006; 124: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). With the aid of these membrane trafficking processes, internalized viruses are able to fuse with cellular membranes for subsequent genome release as well as localize within the cell for effective replication (2Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Many viruses require the induction of conformational changes by low pH levels (a result of acidification within the endosomal pathway) to drive essential infective steps of viral entry, such as fusion, penetration, and uncoating (3Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In addition, viral transport within host cells may also be mediated by the host cytoskeleton network, particularly the actin filaments (4Radtke K. Döhner K. Sodeik B. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). With viral entry regarded as a major determinant of viral tropism and pathogenesis (5Isaacson M.K. Juckem L.K. Compton T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 325: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar), understanding these initial events will enable future development of anti-viral strategies against HEV71 infection.

Oberste M.S. J. Neurovirol. 2005; 11: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). First identified and characterized in 1969 in California from a stool specimen isolated from an infant with encephalitis (7Schmidt N.J. Lennette E.H. Ho H.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1974; 129: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), ensuing outbreaks of HEV71 have since been reported in various regions of the world, including Australia, Sweden, and Japan. In the past decade, HEV71-induced hand, foot, and, mouth disease outbreaks have mainly affected children within the Asia-Pacific region, including Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Australia (8McMinn P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 91-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The global control of poliovirus has also resulted in HEV71 becoming one of the most clinically significant etiological agents of acute neurological diseases such as polio-like acute flaccid paralysis, cerebellar ataxia, and brainstem encephalitis (9Nolan M.A. Craig M.E.

No antiviral treatment has yet been developed to treat HEV71 infections; similarly, effective vaccines are currently unavailable, although several vaccine trials are being undertaken to develop effective therapeutic strategies to combat severe HEV71 infections. Emphasis is, therefore, being placed on understanding its virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management. human enterovirus 71 rhabdomyosarcoma endosomal antigen 1 lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 Texas Red 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) post-infection. HEV71 infection begins with the attachment of virus particles onto host surface receptors followed by subsequent entry into the cells. Although it has been widely accepted that HEV71 enters permissive cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, only several cell-specific candidate receptors have been identified to date. These cellular receptors include: scavenger receptor B2 (10Yamayoshi S. Yamashita Y. Li J. Hanagata N. Minowa T. Takemura T. Koike S. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (11Nishimura Y. Shimojima M. Tano Y. Miyamura T. Wakita T. Shimizu H. Nat.

J. 2009; 6: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, subsequent steps of HEV71 infection, such as the entry process and the uncoating of its RNA genome as well as the assembly pathway have not been clearly defined. Although previous studies have attempted to decipher the entry processes of related enteroviruses, such as poliovirus (13Bergelson J.M.

With the recent development of small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, high throughput screening surveys of mammalian genes and their functions has been made feasible (20Simpson K.J. Selfors L.M. Bui J. Reynolds A. Leake D. Khvorova A. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this study we assessed an array of siRNA libraries that specifically target human genes important for endocytosis processes, trafficking of membrane vesicles, actin polymerization, and cytoskeleton rearrangement to determine the cellular genes or factors that facilitate the infectious entry pathway of HEV71. Interestingly, we were able to show for the first time that the knockdown of human genes associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis efficiently blocked HEV71 infection. The essential involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in HEV71 entry into cells was confirmed by the expression of dominant-negative mutants and drug inhibitors to perturb this uptake pathway. In addition, we also identified cellular factors responsible for vesicle trafficking and maturation, signal transduction, and actin polymerization that are essential for the infectious entry process of HEV71. Human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC CCL-136) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) and sodium bicarbonate (Merck). HEV71 strain H (VR-1432TM) was obtained from ATCC and propagated in RD cells. The virus titer was quantitated via viral infectious plaque assays using RD cells. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HEV71 were purchased from Chemicon for immunofluorescent detection of HEV71 infection. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to clathrin (CLTC, Chemicon), early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1; Novus Biologicals), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased from Chemicon for immunofluorescence assays. The secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Texas Red (TR) were purchased from Invitrogen. 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescent dye was purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against AP2A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ARPC5 (Novus Biologicals), RAB3A (BD Biosciences), SYNJ1 (Abnova Corp.), and WASF1 (Novus Biologicals) were used for the Western detection of the respective proteins. All drugs used in this study (chlorpromazine, filipin, bafilomycin A1, cytochalasin B, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), concanamycin A, and nystatin) were purchased from Sigma and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions under sterile conditions. The human genome siRNA subset library targeting the endocytic and membrane trafficking genes (Dharmacon, RTF H-005500) was used in this study. A smart pool approach of incorporating four siRNAs targeting each gene was utilized. The advantages of this pooled approach as well as the issues of gene compensation of specific isotype of genes were discussed in Reynolds et al. (21Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The list of 119 targeted human genes and isoforms (excluding the control set) is presented in supplemental Table 1. All transfections were performed in a 384-well plate format. A 1.2% (v/v) stock solution of the transfection reagent (DharmaFECT 1) was prepared in DCCR cell culture buffer (Dharmacon) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. From this stock, 8 μl was added to the lyophilized siRNA in each well of the 384-well plate and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to allow the siRNAs to rehydrate and form siRNA-lipid complexes. Subsequently, 5 × 103 RD cells in 42 μl of complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS were added. The siRNA cell mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h before HEV71 infection. The final concentration of pooled siRNAs was 50 nm per well. Individual siRNA duplexes were used at 6.25 pmol per well. A high throughput platform for the specific detection of HEV71 infection in the 384-well plate format via immunofluorescence staining was employed for the screening assay, as described in Chu and Yang (22Chu J.J. Yang P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3520-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the siRNA-transfected RD cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h to ensure effective gene knockdown by the siRNAs before being subjected to HEV71 infection at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After 12 post-infection (p.i.), the cells were then fixed with cold absolute methanol (Sigma) for 15 min at −20 °C. Subsequent cell washing steps were performed using an automated 384-well format plate washer (EMBLA, Molecular Devices). The cells were then subjected to immunofluorescence staining using primary anti-HEV71 antibodies (Chemicon) followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (100 nm; Invitrogen) before collation of image data by the ArrayScan VTI HCS automated fluorescence microscope Reader system (Cellomics) with appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for FITC (495 and 520 nm, respectively) and DAPI (358 and 461 nm, respectively). Data collection and auto-focusing parameters were pre-determined using Cellomics Target Activation Bioapplication (Cellomics). A generic segmentation tool function was used to identify the two different stains (DAPI and FITC) with intensities above background staining, and data collection was obtained by logging the measurements. Data analysis after image acquisition was carried out using Cellomics Target Activation Bioapplication (Cellomics). DAPI-stained nuclei were counted to determine total cell populations, whereas FITC-stained cytoplasm was scored to determine the number of virus-infected cells. Images with less than 500 cells were excluded from data analysis by the cell sorting module. Three independent screening assays were performed. Controls included in individual sets of experiments were the use of transfection reagent (DharmaFECT 1) alone, a non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon), a green fluorescent nonspecific siRNA (siGLO, Dharmacon), RISC-freeTM siRNA (Dharmacon), and siRNA smart pools targeting cyclophilin B duplex, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lamin A/C (Dharmacon). These siRNAs served as negative controls for nonspecific effects of siRNA and/or transfection reagents on cell viability and virus infection. In addition, cell viability was observed and monitored by visual inspection via the use of phase-contrast microscopy. Plasmid constructs of dominant-negative Eps15 (pEGFP-Eps15Δ95/295, a component of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex; the dominant-negative form inhibits clathrin-coated pit budding) and pEGFP-Eps15DIIIΔ2 (this construct lacks the AP2-binding sites and was used as a control that did not inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis) was kindly provided by A. Benmerah, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France. Briefly, RD cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight until 75% confluency was reached. 0.8 μg of the plasmid construct was then complexed with 50 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to 48 μl of Opti-MEM containing 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen) that had undergone similar incubation conditions. After a further incubation period of 20 min, the DNA-liposome complexes were added to the cells, which had been starved in Opti-MEM medium for 4 h before transfection. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, 1 ml of maintenance medium was added and incubated for a further 48 h before virus infection. To synchronize HEV71 entry, virus binding was first performed at 4 °C for 1 h before the temperature was shifted rapidly to 37 °C for internalization. Infected RD cells were subsequently processed for immunofluorescence assay and microscopic imaging. Supernatants were harvested from transfected cells, and plaque assays were performed. RD cells seeded on coverslips were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were subsequently infected with HEV71 at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 30 min at 4 °C to allow viral attachment to cell surface without entry. The cells were then shifted to 37 °C for a further 10 min to allow the cells to return to their physiological temperature (designated as time 0). Cells were fixed in ice-cold absolute methanol at different time points, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min, followed by three 5-min washes in cold PBS before immunofluorescence processing. Cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (with a 1:500 dilution for anti-HEV71 (Chemicon), a 1:300 dilution for anti-clathrin (Chemicon), a 1:200 dilution for anti-EEA1 (Novus Biologicals), and 1:500 dilution for anti-LAMP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. After three 5-min washes with PBS, cells were further incubated with appropriate FITC- or TR-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) before washing again with PBS. Nuclei staining were performed by incubating the cells with DAPI (Invitrogen) before mounting the processed coverslips onto ethanol-cleaned glass slides using Dabco mountant. The specimens were viewed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81 Olympus) with excitation wavelengths of 480 and 543 nm for FITC and TR, respectively, using oil immersion objectives. To determine the effects of the drugs used to inhibit the entry of HEV71, serum-starved RD cells were pretreated with drugs at different concentrations (Table 2) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by virus infection as described above. At 12 h p.i., HEV71-infected cells were processed for immunofluorescence assay. Three independent experiments were carried out for each set of drugs used. The inhibition of virus entry was determined by the number of virus antigen-positive cells in relation to the total number of cells (virus antigen-positive and -negative) and was expressed as the percentage virus antigen-positive cells.TABLE 2Concentrations and functions of inhibitory drugs used in this studyDrugConcentrations usedFunctionChlorpromazine2, 10, 20, 30 μmInhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosisCytochalasin B0.2, 1, 2, 3, 4 μmInhibitor of actin polymerizationFilipin0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 μg/mlInhibitor of caveolin-dependent endocytosisNystatin5, 10, 20, 40 μmIncreases permeability of cell membrane of sensitive fungi by sterol bindingMethyl cyclodextrin-β-cyclodextrin2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mmInhibitor of lipid raft synthesis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride10, 25, 50, 100 μmSelective blocker of Na+/H+ antiportBafilomycin A10.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 μmInhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPaseConcanamycin A20, 40, 60, 80, 100 nMInhibitor of acidification of organelles and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity Open table in a new tab Cell viability upon siRNA transfection and drug treatments was assessed by employing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Chemicon International), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, RD cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and subsequently treated with individual siRNAs and drugs for 48 and 2 h, respectively, before incubation with AB solution for 4 h at 37 °C. After this, Solution C containing isopropyl alcohol/HCl was added, and the plates were subjected to absorbance reading by an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad) at test wavelength of 570 nm and reference wavelength of 630 nm. siRNA profiling using the human endocytic/membrane trafficking library from Dharmacon was conducted as a preliminary assay to identify key endocytic and membrane trafficking genes essential in HEV71 entry into host cells. The immunofluorescence screening assay was based on the detection of HEV71 capsid (VP1) protein in HEV71-infected RD cell monolayers. To ensure minimal signal variation and consistently high signal-to-background ratio, the Z′ factor of the screening assay (23Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar), a measure of quality of high throughput screening, was determined. An assay with a Z′ factor value of between 0.5 and 1 would be considered to be an excellent assay for screening, with minimal well-well variation in the 384-well plate (23Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar). A Z′ factor of 0.562 was consistently measured (data not shown), demonstrating the reliability and robustness of the assay. With the optimization of the siRNA screening platform for HEV71 infection, it was employed as a tool for rapid discovery of cellular factors essential for mediating the infectious entry process of HEV71 into cells. An array of 119 siRNA smart pool (Dharmacon) targeting genes known to be directly or indirectly involved in regulating the different endocytic pathways (clathrin, caveolae, macropinocytosis, etc.), polymerization of actin, and cytoskeleton rearrangement and vesicle/cargo trafficking was used to identify host genes necessary for the infectious entry of HEV71. A list of the targeted human genes and a brief description of the reported functional role for each of the genes are provided in supplemental Table 1. Effects of siRNA knockdown of different endocytic genes as determined by the decrease in the percentage of viral antigen-positive cells on HEV71 infection are shown in Fig. 1. Employing a 50% reduction in the number of fluorescently stained HEV71-infected cells as the siRNA-induced effect and criterion that suppressed HEV71 infection, the list of human genes that have an inhibitory effect on HEV71 infection were obtained using the screening platform, and the results are shown in Fig. 1 and further classified based on their functional roles (Table 1). A substantial number of genes resulting in the decrease in HEV71 infection have been known to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Table 1); these genes include the subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2A1) and clathrin heavy chains (CLTC and CLTCL1). AP2A1 is a subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 2 that regulates the formation of clathrin-coated pits as well as links clathrin to cellular receptors in endocytic vesicles (24Traub L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 415-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The clathrin heavy and light chains are intricately braided together to form the triskelion coat that facilitates the formation of clathrin coated pits for endocytosis (25Young A. Semin. Cell Dev.

Johannes L. Goud B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) also exhibited inhibitory effects on HEV71 infection. Several of these top-hit genes on HEV71 infection were selected for further analysis. A number of cellular (siGENOMETM Cyclophilin B duplex, Lamin A/C, and GAPDH SMARTpoolTM siRNA; Dharmacon) and transfection (siGENOMETM Non-Targeting siRNA pool, RISC-freeTM siRNA, and siGLO Risc-freeTM siRNA; Dharmacon) controls were included to ensure that the reduction in HEV71 infection was not due to off-target effects as well as to eliminate the possibility of reduction in HEV71 infection by housekeeping genes (Fig. 1). It was generally observed that there was minimal cytotoxicity in the siRNA-transfected cells with HEV71 infection. Cell viability was not affected sufficiently to contribute to the outcome of the screen. To further validate the findings obtained from the primary screen, siRNA smart pool-based deconvolution assays targeting several top-hit genes (Fig. 1) were performed. These genes included AP2A1, ARPC5, CLTC, RAB3A, SYNJ1, and WASF1. siRNA smart pool deconvolution is necessary to confirm true positive phenotype observed in this screen. 30 nm concentrations of each specific individual siRNA of the smart pool (four specific siRNAs) directed against each of the respective genes were transfected into RD cells and subsequently subjected to HEV71 infection. This experimental approach would help to ensure that inhibitory effects on HEV71 infection observed in the primary screen was specific and not due to off-target gene effects. It can be observed that at least one of the four siRNAs directed against each specific gene (AP2A1, ARPC5, CLTC, RAB3A, SYNJ1, and WASF1) can result in more than 50% inhibition of HEV71 infection (Fig. 2). In addition, we have also performed siRNA dosage knockdown of the selected targeted genes (AP2A1, ARPC5, CLTC, RAB3A, SYNJ1, and WASF1) with varying concentrations of siRNAs (0, 5, 25, and 50 nm) on RD cells and subjected to HEV71 infection. The data showed obvious dose-dependent inhibition of HEV71 infection with increasing concentrations of the respective siRNAs targeting AP2A1, ARPC5, CLTC, RAB3A, SYNJ1, and WASF1 upon siRNA transfection into cells (Fig. 3). Western blot detection was also carried out to ensure efficient knockdown of specific protein expression (Fig. 3). Indeed, the transfection of cells with siRNAs targeting AP2A1, ARPC5, CLTC, RAB3A, SYNJ1, and WASF1 showed dose-dependent reductions in the levels of the respective proteins when compared with the levels in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3). At the concentration of 25 nm of the transfected siRNA for the respective proteins, more than 60% reduction (as measured by densitometry) can be observed when compared with the mock-transfected samples (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the different concentrations of siRNA transfected into cells have minimal cellular cytotoxicity as revealed by the cell viability assays (Fig. 3). Indeed, the data obtained from the siRNA pool deconvolution and dose-dependent knockdown experiments may support a functional relationship betwe"

This study sought to determine if KRAS mutant CRC lines could be sensitized to cetuximab using dasatinib (BMS-354825, Sprycel), a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including the Src family kinases (SFKs). We analyzed 16 CRC lines for: (1) KRAS mutation status, (2) dependence on mutant KRAS signaling and (3) expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and SFKs. From these analyses, we selected three KRAS mutant (LS180, LoVo and HCT116) cell lines and two KRAS wild-type cell lines (SW48 and CaCo2). In vitro, using poly-D-lysine/laminin plates, KRAS mutant cell lines were resistant to cetuximab, whereas KRAS wild-type lines showed sensitivity to cetuximab. Treatment with cetuximab and dasatinib showed a greater antiproliferative effect on KRAS mutant lines when compared with either agent alone in vitro and in vivo. To investigate potential mechanisms for this antiproliferative response in the combinatorial therapy, we performed Human Phospho-Kinase Antibody Array analysis, measuring the relative phosphorylation levels of 39 intracellular proteins in untreated, cetuximab, dasatinib or the combinatorial treatment in the KRAS mutant lines LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cells. The results of this experiment showed a decrease in a broad spectrum of kinases centered on the β-catenin pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) when compared with the untreated control or monotherapy treatments. Next, we analyzed tumor growth with cetuximab, dasatinib or their combination in vivo. KRAS mutant xenografts showed resistance to cetuximab therapy, whereas KRAS wild type demonstrated an antitumor response when treated with cetuximab. KRAS mutant tumors exhibited minimal response to dasatinib monotherapy. However, as in vitro, KRAS mutant lines exhibited a response to the combination of cetuximab and dasatinib. Combinatorial treatment of KRAS mutant xenografts resulted in decreased cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67, and higher rates of apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling). The data presented in this study indicate that dasatinib can sensitize KRAS mutant CRC tumors to cetuximab and may do so by altering the activity of several key signaling pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that signaling via EGFR and SFKs may be necessary for cell proliferation and survival of KRAS mutant CRC tumors. These data strengthen the rationale for clinical trials combining cetuximab and dasatinib in the KRAS mutant CRC genetic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2039275665,"MicroRNAs are gene regulators that work through a posttranscriptional repression mechanism. Dysregulation of microRNA expression could lead to a variety of disorders, in particular, human cancer, and has also been implicated in antihormone therapy resistance. However, little is known whether microRNAs have a role in estrogen-independent growth, leading to tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors. In this study, we use an in vivo selection system against a microRNA library using the MCF-7 model and demonstrate that miR-101 promotes estrogen-independent growth and causes the upregulation of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) without impacting the ER level or activity. Importantly, although miR-101 suppresses cell growth in normal estradiol (E2)-containing medium, it promotes cell growth in E2-free medium. Moreover, estrogen deprivation greatly enhances miR-101-mediated Akt activation. Finally, we show that MAGI-2 (membrane-associated guanylate kinase), a scaffold protein required for PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) activity, is a direct target for miR-101; suppression of MAGI-2 by miR-101 reduces PTEN activity, leading to Akt activation. Taken together, these results not only establish a role for miR-101 in estrogen-independent signaling but also provide a mechanistic link between miR-101 and Akt activation."

It has been suggested that the combination of antitumorigenic, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic effects and the ability of CDDO-Me to suppress cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric-oxide synthase, multidrug resistance gene 1, and FLIP is mediated by NF-κB activation through suppression of IκBα kinase (15Shishodia S.

The experimental drugs appear to have little toxic side effects at the doses used. We hypothesized that CDDO-Me may have beneficial action in diabetes and investigated its potential anti-diabetic effects and possible mode of action in mouse models of type 2 diabetes.DISCUSSIONThis study is the first detailed metabolic analysis of T2DM mice treated with CDDO-Me, an agent currently in phase I clinical trials in cancer patients. Our data showed that CDDO-Me treatment greatly attenuates the hyperglycemia of diet-induced T2DM mice. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments indicate that an increased rate of glucose infusion is required to maintain euglycemia in CDDO-Me-treated mice, indicating increased glucose disposal in peripheral tissues (mainly skeletal muscle). Therefore, the improvement of the diabetic state appears to be the result of improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, whereas hepatic glucose production remains relatively unchanged. Interestingly, in Leprdb/db mice, a genetic T2DM model, we found significant reduction in basal glucose production measured by a steady state infusion method in CDDO-Me-liposome-treated as compared with empty liposome-treated mice. We believe that in diet-induced diabetic mice in which the CDDO-Me was administered by gavage, we could have missed a mild to moderate decrease in hepatic glucose production, because for 4 days after jugular vein catheterization, we had to temporarily suspend the gavage for technical reasons. Even then, we observed in these diet-induced diabetic mice that 2 weeks of drug treatment restored euglycemia and reduced plasma insulin levels (random (Fig. 1D) as well as during GTT (Fig. 1F)). Increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Fig. 2E) in the setting of a constant insulin infusion suggests enhanced signaling at a proximal step in the insulin signaling pathway.In addition to reversal of hyperglycemia, CDDO-Me treatment of diet-induced T2DM mice has a beneficial effect on all of these other comorbid conditions, i.e. it reverses obesity and insulin resistance, lowers TG and FFA, whereas it down-regulates the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines (35Yang J. Park Y. Zhang H. Xu X. Laine G.A. Dellsperger K.C. Zhang C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 296: H1850-H1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). CDDO-Me has been reported to act on multiple targets (1Sporn M.B. Suh N. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), including inhibition of NF-κB-mediated gene expression after translocation of activated NF-κB to the nucleus. CDDO was found to abolish NF-κB-dependent resynthesis of IκBα, which suggests that CDDO-Me targets a step downstream of NF-κB translocation into the nucleus (36Stadheim T.A. Xiao H. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1533-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with such an interpretation. In this study we also showed that this drug reduces lipogenesis in T2D mice, which corroborates a recent report by Shin et al. (37Shin S. Wakabayashi J. Yates M.S. Wakabayashi N. Dolan P.M. Aja S. Liby K.T. Sporn M.B. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 620: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).We showed that CDDO-Me action is mediated, at least in part, by AMPK activation. Although AMPK is ubiquitously expressed (38Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), the in vivo effects of CDDO-Me have been primarily associated with increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, which involves AMPK activation (32Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar, 39Fujii N. Aschenbach W.G. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Proc. Nutr.

Science. 2005; 310: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation and activation of AMPK by CDDO-Me would provide a mechanism for the observed improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism. Phosphorylation and inactivation of ACC by AMPK activation would inhibit the proximal and rate-limiting step of lipogenesis. These effects are likely to contribute to the capacity of CDDO-Me to lower triglycerides and FFA in vivo.AMPK activation is implicated as a mechanism for the induction of skeletal muscle glucose uptake; this effect is additive with insulin (41Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed association of increased glucose uptake and AMPK activation in isolated skeletal muscle suggests that the effect of CDDO-Me in augmenting muscle insulin action in vivo may be attributed to AMPK as well. AMPK mediates a decrease in SREBP-1 mRNA. FAS, a known lipogenic target gene for SREBP-1, is also down-regulated in CDDO-Me-treated hepatocytes, further contributing to the effect of CDDO-Me on modulating circulating lipids and reducing hepatic lipogenesis. It should be noted that increased SREBP-1 is postulated as a central mediator of insulin resistance in T2DM and related metabolic disorders (42Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I.

Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).The α subunit of AMPK contains the catalytic site, and phosphorylation of Thr-172 in its activation loop by one or more upstream kinases (AMPK kinase) is required for activation (28Wellen K.E.

LKB1 is a tumor suppressor kinase and can phosphorylate the T-loop of all 12 known members of the human AMPK family (51Lizcano J.M. Göransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A.

It is not clear whether LKB1 phosphorylation is required for AMPK activation and, if so, which site of phosphorylation is involved in AMPK activation. LKB1 is phosphorylated at Ser-325, Thr-366, and Ser-431 by upstream kinases. In addition, LKB1 autophosphorylates at Ser-31, Thr-185, Thr-189, Thr-336, and Ser-404 (52Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K.

Mutation of any of these phosphorylation sites to Ala (to abolish phosphorylation) or Glu (to mimic phosphorylation) does not significantly affect the in vitro catalytic activity of LKB1 or its intracellular localization (53Boudeau J.

Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylation of LKB1 Ser-428 is required for metformin-enhanced AMPK activation. However, the precise mechanism(s) underlying LKB1 activation, the relevant phosphorylation sites, and the upstream activating kinase(s) are still not well understood. Neither the activity of LKB1 itself nor that of AMPK-related kinases is influenced directly by agents known to activate AMPK, e.g. AICAR and metformin (57Davis B.J. Xie Z. Viollet B. Zou M.H.

Our results suggest, however, that phosphorylation of LKB1 is necessary for CDDO-Me-mediated AMPK phosphorylation.It remains unclear how CDDO-Me activates LKB1. Our preliminary data suggest that it could work through activation of ERK1/2, a rate-limiting enzyme in MAPK pathway. A MAPK inhibitor that blocks ERK1/2 phosphorylation also inhibits AMPK phosphorylation, further supporting ERK1/2 as a possible upstream target for CDDO-Me. Much additional work will be needed to clearly define the underlying mechanisms involved.CDDO-Me is undergoing phase I trial for different cancers (61Dezube, B. J., Kurzrock, R., Eder, J.

(2007) Annual Meeting of the AACR-NCI-EORTC, International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics: Discovery, Biology, and Clinical Applications October 22–26, San Francisco, CA.Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the dose of CDDO-Me used in the in vivo studies reported herein (2–3 mg/kg) is about 1 log lower than the doses required to achieve its anti-tumor effects (20–100 mg/kg) (45Ling X.

Therefore, it is likely that, clinically, the use of CDDO-Me as an anti-diabetic agent may require a substantially lower dose than that used in cancer therapy. To date, data from the ongoing phase I trials of CDDO-Me (RTA-402) indicate that toxicity of this agent even at the much higher anti-cancer dose is minimal. Therefore, it is possible that use of CDDO-Me for clinical management of T2DM could be achieved without serious side effects.

However, recent reports have unveiled transcriptional and functional differences between iPSCs and embryonic stem cells that in cases are attributable to imprinting errors.

The resulting iPSCs match all standard criteria of bona fide reprogramming and could be readily differentiated into tissues derived from the three germ layers, including neurons. Moreover, these iPSCs retain a high level of DNA methylation in the imprinting center of the maternal allele and show concomitant reduced expression of the disease-associated small nucleolar RNA HBII-85/SNORD116.

https://openalex.org/W2009630307,"The expression of a variety of cytoprotective genes is regulated by short cis-acting elements in their promoters, called antioxidant response elements (AREs). A central regulator of ARE-mediated gene expression is the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces a strong activation of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes in vitro and in vivo. This is triggered by the HBV-regulatory proteins (HBx and LHBs) via c-Raf and MEK. The Nrf2/ARE-mediated induction of cytoprotective genes by HBV results in a better protection of HBV-positive cells against oxidative damage as compared with control cells. Furthermore, there is a significantly increased expression of the Nrf2/ARE-regulated proteasomal subunit PSMB5 in HBV-positive cells that is associated with a decreased level of the immunoproteasome subunit PSMB5i. In accordance with this finding, HBV-positive cells display a higher constitutive proteasome activity and a decreased activity of the immunoproteasome as compared with control cells even after interferon α/γ treatment. The HBV-dependent induction of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes might ensure survival of the infected cell, shape the immune response to HBV, and thereby promote establishment of the infection."
https://openalex.org/W1998646075,"IFNα exerts potent inhibitory activities against malignant melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanisms by which it generates its antitumor effects remain unknown. We examined the effects of interferon α (IFNα) on the expression of human members of the Schlafen (SLFN) family of genes, a group of cell cycle regulators that mediate growth-inhibitory responses. Using quantitative RT-real time PCR, we found detectable basal expression of all the different human SLFN genes examined (SLFN5, SLFN11, SLFN12, SLFN13, and SLFN14), in malignant melanoma cells and primary normal human melanocytes, but SLFN5 basal expression was suppressed in all analyzed melanoma cell lines. Treatment of melanoma cells with IFNα resulted in induction of expression of SLFN5 in malignant cells, suggesting a potential involvement of this gene in the antitumor effects of IFNα. Importantly, stable knockdown of SLFN5 in malignant melanoma cells resulted in increased anchorage-independent growth, as evidenced by enhanced colony formation in soft agar assays. Moreover, SLFN5 knockdown also resulted in increased invasion in three-dimensional collagen, suggesting a dual role for SLFN5 in the regulation of invasion and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. Altogether, our findings suggest an important role for the SLFN family of proteins in the generation of the anti-melanoma effects of IFNα and for the first time directly implicate a member of the human SLFN family in the regulation of cell invasion."

Here we report that TC14012, a peptidomimetic inverse agonist of CXCR4, is an agonist on CXCR7. The potency of β-arrestin recruitment to CXCR7 by TC14012 is much higher than that of the previously reported CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and differs only by one log from that of the natural ligand CXCL12 (EC50 350 nm for TC14012, as compared with 30 nm for CXCL12 and 140 μm for AMD3100). Moreover, like CXCL12, TC14012 leads to Erk 1/2 activation in U373 glioma cells that express only CXCR7, but not CXCR4. Given that with TC14012 and AMD3100 two structurally unrelated CXCR4 antagonists turn out to be agonists on CXCR7, this likely reflects differences in the activation mechanism of the arrestin pathway by both receptors. To identify the receptor domain responsible for these opposed effects, we investigated CXCR4 and CXCR7 C terminus-swapping chimeras. Using quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we find that the CXCR7 receptor core formed by the seven-transmembrane domains and the connecting loops determines the agonistic activity of both TC14012 and AMD3100.

https://openalex.org/W2106984450,"A decreased clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) by alveolar macrophages (AM) may contribute to inflammation in emphysema. The up-regulation of ceramides in response to cigarette smoking (CS) has been linked to AM accumulation and increased detection of apoptotic alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells in lung parenchyma. We hypothesized that ceramides inhibit the AM phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Release of endogenous ceramides via sphingomyelinase or exogenous ceramide treatments dose-dependently impaired apoptotic Jurkat cell phagocytosis by primary rat or human AM, irrespective of the molecular species of ceramide. Similarly, in vivo augmentation of lung ceramides via intratracheal instillation in rats significantly decreased the engulfment of instilled target apoptotic thymocytes by resident AM. The mechanism of ceramide-induced efferocytosis impairment was dependent on generation of sphingosine via ceramidase. Sphingosine treatment recapitulated the effects of ceramide, dose-dependently inhibiting apoptotic cell clearance. The effect of ceramide on efferocytosis was associated with decreased membrane ruffle formation and attenuated Rac1 plasma membrane recruitment. Constitutively active Rac1 overexpression rescued AM efferocytosis against the effects of ceramide. CS exposure significantly increased AM ceramides and recapitulated the effect of ceramides on Rac1 membrane recruitment in a sphingosine-dependent manner. Importantly, CS profoundly inhibited AM efferocytosis via ceramide-dependent sphingosine production. These results suggest that excessive lung ceramides may amplify lung injury in emphysema by causing both apoptosis of structural cells and inhibition of their clearance by AM."

Sequential blood and lung aspirate samples were collected from CIP. Viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels were determined from the plasma and lung aspirates of the patients. TLR levels were determined by staining and FACS analysis. Gene profiling was done for both cells in the lung aspirates and PBMCs using TaqMan Low Density arrays. Antibody titres and isotyping was done using HA protein based ELISAs.13/15 critically ill patients expired. All plasma samples were negative for the virus irrespective of the patient's category. Sequential lung samples from CIP showed lower viral loads questioning association of viral replication with the severity. Anti-rpH1N1-09-HA-IgG titres were significantly higher in critically ill patients and both categories circulated exclusively IgG1 isotype. Critically ill patients exhibited increase in TLR-3, 4, 7 and decrease in TLR-2 expressions. The disease severity correlated with increased plasma levels of IL1RA, IL2, IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and IL10. Majority of the immune-function genes were down-regulated in the PBMCs and up-regulated in the cells from lung aspirates of critically ill patients. No distinct pattern differentiating fatal and surviving patients was observed when sequential samples were examined for various parameters.Disease severity was associated with pronounced impairment of host immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2059426385,"An elevated DNA-repair capacity in cancer cells leads to radiation resistance and severely limits the efficacy of radiation therapy. Activation of Akt is tightly associated with resistance to radiotherapy, and Mre11 protein has important role during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this report, our results showed that inhibition of Akt activity impaired the repair of DSBs in CNE2 cells, whereas activated Akt promoted the repair of DSBs in HeLa cells. Knockdown of Mre11 also impaired the process of DSB repair in both these two cell lines. More importantly, we found that Akt could regulate Mre11 expression. Inhibition of Akt activity by small interfering RNA or LY294002 efficiently downregulated the Mre11 expression in CNE2 cells, and transfection with myr-Akt plasmid in HeLa cells upregulated the Mre11 expression. In addition, luciferase reporter analysis revealed that Mre11 reporter activity increased after transfection with myr-Akt1 plasmids, and this myr-Akt1-induced transcriptional activity was blocked in the presence of LY294002. Further study showed GSK3β/β-catenin/LEF-1 pathway was involved in this regulation. Knockdown of β-catenin or LEF-1 led to the downregulation of Mre11, whereas overexpression of β-catenin led to upregulation of Mre11. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay assay showed β-catenin/LEF-1 heterodimer could directly bind to the promoter of Mre11 in vivo. And the luciferase activity of the pGL3-Mre11 and pGL3-Lef increased in HeLa cells following β-catenin plasmid co-transfected, but was abolished when the LEF-1-binding conserved sequences of Mre11 promoter were mutated. These results together support Akt can upregulate the expression of Mre11 through GSK3β/ β-catenin/LEF pathway to elevate DSB-repair capacity in cancer cells."

The goal is for gene discovery to lead to improved methods for early risk detection and a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the disorder so that targeted therapeutics can be developed. The availability of large and comprehensive registries that include detailed phenotype and genetic information for individuals affected with an ASD and family members is crucial for the discovery of autism susceptibility genes and the development and application of biologically based approaches to diagnosis and treatment of individuals with ASD. Complex neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism are best approached by collaborative research efforts that pool large samples of affected individuals. Autism Speaks' Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) represents the largest private collection of genetic and phenotype data for families with ASD that is made available to qualified researchers worldwide. The creation of large public resources allows both junior and senior scientists with ambition and ingenuity to accelerate progress. Advocacy organizations such as Autism Speaks have played a crucial role in advancing science by influencing policymakers to recognize the unique challenges faced by their constituents and sharing their sense of urgency and purpose to ensure that policies do not stand in the way of research and treatment. The AGRE program was founded in 1997 by parents, scientists, and clinicians who felt that in order to facilitate more rapid progress in the identification of the genetic underpinnings of ASD, they needed to collect critical phenotypic and genetic information from families with autism and make these data readily available to the scientific community. Jon Shestack and Portia Iversen, founders of the autism advocacy group Cure Autism Now (CAN), emphasized the urgent need for scientific progress and urged parents and scientists alike to be proactive and make it happen. A year earlier, in May 1996, the parents held a think tank where they asked scientists to tell them what they could do to speed progress in autism research. Their answer was to establish a DNA resource that would make biological samples from well-characterized families available to the scientific community at large. This notion of collaboration and data sharing was what piqued the interest of UCLA clinician and researcher Daniel Geschwind, M.D., Ph.D., scientific founder of the program, who felt that the way to attract researchers to the field was to give them the essential tools they needed. In return, scientists would give back by returning their research results to be shared with the research community. It was with this vision in mind that the foundation enlisted the help of key scientists and clinicians who also bought into the notion that science could be hurried to develop a resource that would serve that purpose. Although a daunting proposition for parents who knew little about science and researchers who were skeptical about broad data sharing, the parents knew that if they built it and they built it right, researchers would come. AGRE is the realization of a number of ideals in scientific research. Standardization, collaboration, and data sharing stand out as three key guiding principles that have marked the success of the AGRE program. It is focused on the rapid accumulation of high-quality data from a large number of families, which is critical for molecular genetic research of complex diseases. Both the data and the biomaterials are made available to any and all qualified researchers around the world as soon as the data are processed. The infrastructure for the sharing of data and biomaterials has been carefully developed and has proven to be highly efficient. The program has maintained superb rapport with the families, who appreciate this effort and who then enlist the participation of fellow families, and gladly volunteer their time to re-engage in supplemental phenotyping efforts. The decision-making process for balancing cost with throughput, balancing depth of assessment with sample size, and prioritizing the work plan for fine mapping, resequencing, and refining phenotypic characterization is apolitical and guided by a panel of scientists who welcome input from their peers and who have exhibited longstanding investment in identifying the causes of ASD. To date, there are 335 active researchers from 21 countries who have used the AGRE resource to publish 169 scientific papers, making it one of the most widely accessed resources for genetic studies of any mental disorder. Figure 1 illustrates the increase in the number of peer-reviewed publications that have resulted from analyses of AGRE data since the first paper in 2001. The emphasis on collaboration and data sharing created a paradigm shift among scientists who weren't always motivated to share their data or their findings and influenced larger collaborative programs such as Autism Speaks' Autism Genome Project (AGP), an Autism Speaks-supported international consortium of over 120 scientists from 50 institutions worldwide that pools resources for their genetic analyses. Over the last 2 years, the AGP and its members have been involved in the majority of scientific discoveries in autism genetics. As one of many contributors to the AGP, AGRE continues to sit on the cutting edge of research. The success of AGRE lies in the unrivaled community support provided by advocacy groups such as CAN and now Autism Speaks. Families understand that the solution to complex disorders such as autism lies in the partnership between parents and researchers, and through the AGRE program families are able to become part of the solution. Figure 2 illustrates the nationwide reach of the AGRE program. The majority of the participating families are recruited from areas where Autism Speaks has strong chapter representation reflecting the power of community support. Information about AGRE is provided to families during community events, through the Autism Speaks website, and through Autism Speaks' national walk program. With the advent of social networking, AGRE has been able to take advantage of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Ning to get the word out about the program and alert families about opportunities for research participation. This movement toward web-based recruitment has significantly improved AGRE's ability to reach out to families more broadly. Despite the geographic distribution of AGRE families, the sample is not population-based. Given that AGRE was conceived as a neurogenetic resource, there is a sampling bias toward the recruitment of families with more than one individual affected with an ASD (multiplex) because these families would have an increased genetic load. In addition to the statistical benefits of family-based cohorts, several studies have reported differences between multiplex and simplex families in rates of copy number variations and autism-related traits in otherwise unaffected family members, suggesting that the mechanisms of genetic transmission could have a differential effect on outcome (Constantino et al., 2010Constantino J. Zhang Y. Frazier T. Abbacchi A.M. Law P. Am. J Psychiatry. 2010; (in press. Published online October 1, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09101470Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, Sebat et al., 2007Sebat J. Lakshmi B. Malhotra D. Troge J. Lese-Martin C.

The uniqueness of this collection makes it a very sought-after cohort for family-based studies and other novel approaches for gene discovery. Participants are recruited based on autism diagnosis and all individuals are included as long as they meet diagnostic criteria and have an English-speaking parent. Recruitment priority is given to families with two or more immediate family members affected with an ASD. Because it is not known which types of families will become valuable as new genetic research technologies unfold, AGRE's philosophy is to include a broad range of ASDs, including autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger disorder. The phenotypic characterization of individuals with ASD is incredibly important given the behavioral and genetic complexity of the disorder. In order to recruit the large sample sizes required to identify rare and common genetic variants, some researchers have challenged the notion of “deep phenotyping” in favor of faster, more-scalable mechanisms for data collection, including those that are Internet based (Lee et al., 2010Lee H. Marvin A.R. Watson T. Piggot J. Law J.K. Law P.A. Constantino J.N. Nelson S.F. Am. J. Med. Genet. B. Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 2010; 153B: 1119-1126PubMed Google Scholar). While these “lighter” phenotyping efforts may ultimately prove successful for some studies, the strategy taken at AGRE is to consider that the breadth of the data made available to researchers is as important as the sample size. The availability of a more comprehensive data set may ultimately allow researchers to develop phenotype selection algorithms that will help stratify the sample by symptom clusters or subtypes. The clinical assessment battery is extremely comprehensive and includes an ever-expanding library of diagnostic and cognitive measures (www.agre.org), as well as questionnaires about environmental exposures, medical issues, social communication, sleep habits, and quantitative information about parents and unaffected siblings. Using an expanded phenotype battery, AGRE hopes to meet the emerging needs of science by offering more information on unaffected family members (parents and siblings) to better understand the broader autism phenotype. AGRE's responsibility is to provide the highest quality data to the research community, and by taking family recruitment and data collection out of the hands of the researchers, the onus is on AGRE to balance cost with efficiency and maintain the highest levels of quality control. The AGRE steering committee felt strongly that the best way to maximize family participation and maintain the integrity of the data was to perform all the clinical evaluations and blood draws in the home. This SWAT team approach requires clinical evaluation teams to target families in regional clusters around the country. Funds from Autism Speaks and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) support a phlebotomist, a full-time clinical staff that includes four psychometricians who are all trained and research-reliable on state-of-the-art autism diagnostic and cognitive evaluations, and a full-time clinical psychologist who ensures the quality of these evaluations. These staff members are highly sensitive and compassionate about the needs and burdens experienced by families with children with autism. The goal of these evaluations is to confirm the diagnosis of ASD and provide the data to researchers in real time. Interestingly, less than 7% of individuals with a clinician-reported diagnosis of autism are found to be elsewhere on the autism spectrum (e.g., PDD-NOS), whereas 76% of individuals with a reported diagnosis of PDD-NOS are found to meet criteria for full autism. Similarly, 82% of individuals with reported diagnoses of Asperger also meet full criteria for autism. These latter findings likely reflect trends among community providers to underdiagnose autism because of a lack of knowledge about the disorder or an avoidance of the “autism” label. Since its inception, the program has enrolled 2880 families between the ages of 2 and 51. There are currently 1308 families with clinical data and banked biospecimens that are available for the research user. The median age at time of testing is 7.2 years old and the ratio of boys to girls is 3.8:1, which is consistent with other genetic studies. Prior to 2007, physicians performed medical and neurological evaluations in the home, but given the high volume of families, AGRE now captures medical and developmental history data using OSCR, AGRE's online system for clinical research. AGRE has performed fragile X testing on 99% of the sample and 94% has been genotyped through a partnership with Dr. Daniel Geschwind's NIH-funded ACE network, which relies on AGRE for access to biological samples and phenotype data for their investigations. In 2010, AGRE reached a new milestone with the collection of its 10,000th DNA sample. Over the last 13 years, cell lines and DNA have been established for 10,236 individuals in this collection and as a result, AGRE has become one of the most productive study sites for the NIMH Genetics Initiative. Public-private partnerships offer a unique opportunity for advocacy organizations to advance the shared goals of their stakeholders and to leverage the knowledge, skills, and resources offered by patient groups, industry, academia, and the federal government to advance science and facilitate translational research. AGRE has a long history of collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies that recognized the importance of maintaining AGRE as a viable resource for scientific discovery. Support for AGRE is provided in large part by Autism Speaks, who along with its predecessor, CAN, has invested close to $15 million through private donations to establish, support, and maintain the resource. These funds are currently supplemented by seven federally funded grants that have allowed AGRE to play a major role in key autism research efforts. Over the last 7 years, NIH, specifically the NIMH, has invested close to $10 million to increase the depth and breadth of the AGRE collection, including support for the phenotype data collection, biospecimen collection, and the bioinformatic infrastructure that researchers use to access clinical and genetic data. In 2007, the NIH made an investment of close to $8 million to establish the Center for Genomic and Phenomic Studies of Autism at the University of Southern California, a virtual center designed to promote collaborative autism genetic research. AGRE is the data collection engine for the Center and over the course of 5 years, it will double the size of the resource. The Center also supports proof of concept pilot studies on air pollution, environmental exposure, and craniofacial dysmorphology, and, through a partnership with colleagues at the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis, neuroimaging and studies of immune function. The NIH's investment represents $14 million of leveraged funding from Autism Speaks and its predecessors over the last 7 years. These long-term partnerships have fostered substantially the pace and quality of ASD research. They have also optimally leveraged the investments made by NIH and Autism Speaks in infrastructure and research and continue to inspire new and more sophisticated means for data analysis. This goal supports the joint mission to accelerate the progress of autism research. Over the years, researchers with a willingness to share data have identified significant barriers that have made data sharing difficult and cumbersome. First, access to many of the large-scale resources is limited to a select number of qualified researchers and each of these resources has its own data sharing policies. More clearly defined policies for data and information sharing, such as requiring that funded researchers provide public access to publications through PubMed, will help ensure that researchers make their findings available and also have access to other data that they can use as replication samples or for meta-analyses. In 2008, Autism Speaks pioneered an open-access policy that requires its grantees to make papers resulting from that funding freely accessible in a public database no later than 12 months after publication. Second, researchers find it difficult to make cross-study comparisons given that few studies adhere to an agreed-upon set of common behavioral phenotype measures across a variety of cognitive and behavioral domains. Unfortunately, a lack of uniformity across studies makes it difficult to merge data sets, ensure the comparability of measures, and interpret findings across studies and research groups. Therefore, efforts to identify common core phenotype measures and standards for data collection could serve as guidelines for autism researchers worldwide. The management, availability, and use of data are also of critical concern. Most researchers understand that the management of the information is just as critical to success as the data itself. Data systems that are flexible and sustainable are critical tools that researchers need to manage the complexity of the information. As the field expands, the informatics plan has to be able to grow in size and scope to ultimately serve as a knowledge sphere to pull in high-quality information from other external databases to help identify research gaps in the autism field and point to areas and connections from which the field has benefited. Because of the large amount of information that is being generated daily and because some sources of readily accessible information are not credible (e.g., some Internet sites), mechanisms that serve as clearinghouses of information for key stakeholders (families, clinicians, researchers) are becoming increasingly important. Advances in gene-chip technology, proteomics, neuroimaging, and metabolomics require more sophisticated integrated databases that can support the vast scientific needs of the research community. Due to the high costs of creating and sustaining large-scale databases, leveraging internal and external resources through public-private partnerships is essential. Autism Speaks recently received funding from the NIH through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to expand the bioinformatic infrastructure of AGRE so that it can serve as a data hub for the NIH National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). This project will facilitate collaboration and data sharing on an even broader scale by making AGRE's clinical phenotype data, biological data, and existing genetic information available to an even wider group of researchers through the NDAR portal. This will greatly enhance, in both quantity and scope, the knowledge base available to NDAR users, allowing them to advance their analyses and investigations of the underlying causes of autism. Researchers have used the AGRE resource to identify some of the most important findings in autism research. In 2008, a collaborative of researchers (Weiss et al., 2008Weiss L.A. Shen Y. Korn J.M. Arking D.E. Miller D.T. Fossdal R. Saemundsen E. Stefansson H. Ferreira M.A. Green T. et al.Autism ConsortiumN. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) identified several families in the AGRE sample set with copy number variations at 16p11.2, implicating this region as important in the development of autism in these families and sparking great interest in copy number variations and de novo mutations in autism. In another study, serum samples collected by AGRE were instrumental in the finding of stereotypic behavior and hyperactivity in rhesus monkeys exposed to immunoglobulins from mothers of children with autism (Martin et al., 2008Martin L.A. Ashwood P. Braunschweig D. Cabanlit M. Van de Water J. Amaral D.G. Brain Behav. Immun. 2008; 22: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recently, AGRE has been cited in a Nature paper as part of the AGP that identified new autism susceptibility genes including SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2, and the X-linked DDX53–PTCHD1 locus (Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Nature. 2010; 466: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Some of these genes belong to synapse-related pathways, while others are involved in cellular proliferation, projection and motility, and intracellular signaling, functional targets that may lead to the development of new treatment approaches. Thus, the pioneering vision of a small group of parents and scientists around a kitchen table in 1996 has revolutionized the way people conduct autism science in the 21st century. The influence of advocacy groups has forced a cultural shift among key thought leaders both public and private, which has paved the way for open access to data and fostered a more collaborative environment for innovation. Thinking more strategically rather than reinventing the wheel has leveled the playing field for both young investigators and experienced researchers by creating equal opportunities to test novel ideas within a collaborative environment. The AGRE model has stimulated much interest among other genetic disease and orphan disorder groups who are focused on providing researchers with the biological specimens that will help them fast-track therapeutics through the development pipeline. The model that AGRE has developed has broad application to other complex disorders, and because of the tenacity, generosity, and foresight of families affected by these disorders, we now can envision a better future for their children and those of future generations.

In addition, it mediates cytotoxicity of cisplatin and some other chemotherapeutic drugs. The mechanism of A-SMase activation is still undefined. We now demonstrate that, upon CD95 stimulation, A-SMase is activated through translocation from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane in an exocytic pathway requiring the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4. Indeed, down-regulation of syntaxin 4 inhibits A-SMase translocation and activation induced by CD95 stimulation. This leads to inhibition of the CD95-triggered signaling events, including caspase 3 and 9 activation and apoptosis, activation of the survival pathway involving the protein kinase Akt, and important changes in cell cycle and proliferation.

The enzyme plays important roles in pathophysiology, as it mediates the action of several apoptogenic molecules, cytokines, and neurotrophins, regulating neuronal function, immunity, and infections (1Ng C.G.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of A-SMase activation is of biological relevance and might reveal novel candidate targets for therapy, including cancer therapy.Using U373, a human glioma cell line expressing the death receptor CD95, we have now established that translocation of A-SMase to the plasma membrane is required for its early activation, that this process takes place by exocytosis, and that a key role in it is played by syntaxin 4, an ubiquitously expressed t-SNARE implicated in several regulated exocytic pathways including the translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane, exocytosis of secretory granules, and the calcium-dependent release of lysosomes (11Chieregatti E. Meldolesi J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Nickel W. Rabouille C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the blockade of syntaxin 4-dependent exocytosis inhibits CD95 receptor clustering and internalization, caspase activation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to inhibition of apoptosis and maintenance of the cells in a proliferative state. The identification of syntaxin 4 as responsible for A-SMase activation is therefore of biological relevance and suggests new functional roles for this SNARE protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following reagents were purchased as indicated: anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody (Ab) CH-11, IgM from Upstate Biotechnology; polyclonal Abs against A-SMase from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) and from Areta international s.r.l.

Finally, the cells were filtered to remove aggregates and analyzed for DNA content by quantifying the red fluorescence. The percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, or G2/M phases of cell cycle were determined by analysis of the results using the FlowJo software version 7.5.5 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).LC-MS Analysis of SphingolipidsCells were pelleted, washed in PBS, and transferred to glass vials. Sphingolipid extracts, fortified with internal standards (N-dodecanoylsphingosine, N-dodecanoylglucosylsphingosine, and N-dodecanoylsphingosylphosphorylcholine, 0.2 nmol each), were prepared and analyzed as described (16Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M.C. Allegood J.C. Kelly S. Wang E. Methods. 2005; 36: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The LC-mass spectrometer consisted of a Waters Aquity UPLC system connected to a Waters LCT Premier orthogonal accelerated time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Millford, MA), operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. Full scan spectra from 50 to 1,500 Da were acquired, and individual spectra were summed to produce data points each 0.2 s. Mass accuracy and reproducibility were maintained by using an independent reference spray by the LockSpray interference. The analytical column was a 100-mm ×2.1-mm inner diameter, 1.7-mm C8 Acquity UPLC BEH (Waters). The two mobile phases were: phase A, methanol/water/formic acid (74/25/1 v/v/v); phase B, methanol/formic acid (99/1 v/v), both containing also 5 mm ammonium formate. A linear gradient was programmed as follows: 0.0 min, 80% B; 3 min, 90% B; 6 min, 90% B; 15 min, 99% B; 18 min, 99% B; 20 min, 80% B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The column was held at 308 °C. Quantitation was carried out using the extracted ion chromatogram of each compound, using 50-mDa windows. The linear dynamic range was determined by injecting standard mixtures. Positive identification of compounds was based on the accurate mass measurement with an error <5 ppm and its LC retention time compared with that of a standard (<2%).ImmunofluorescenceFor confocal immunofluorescence studies, cells were seeded at the 70–80% of confluence on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. After treatment, cells were fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, incubated for 5 min with 1% glycine-PBS, and blocked for 30 min with 10% goat serum, 1% BSA-PBS at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with specific Abs against A-SMase, CatD, Lamp-1 syntaxin 3, syntaxin 4, snx1, EEA1, or TfR in 1% BSA, 0.1% saponin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For fluorescent detection appropriate secondary Abs conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), Alexa Fluor 546 (red) or Alexa Fluor 647 (blue) were used. Fluorescence staining was analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. To quantify the degree of co-localization, we used ImageJ software and the JACoP plug-in to determine the Pearson's correlation coefficient as described previously (17Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar). Pearson's coefficient was expressed as the mean ± S.D.A-SMase Exposure on the Cell SurfaceTranslocation of A-SMase from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane was investigated by the following three methods:Cell Surface Biotinylation AssayCells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml CH11 at the indicated times in culture medium at 37 °C. Stimulation was stopped with ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated twice with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in DMEM without serum for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing with serum-free DMEM for 10 min and three times with PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 × g, and streptavidin beads were added to the supernatant to isolate cell membrane proteins. After incubation of the mixture for 16 h at 4 °C, biotin-streptavidin beads complexes were sedimented at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was used as control, and, after two washes with PBS, bead-bound proteins were denatured in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-A-SMase Ab as described (18Bianco F. Perrotta C. Novellino L. Francolini M. Riganti L. Menna E. Saglietti L. Schuchman E.H. Furlan R. Clementi E. Matteoli M. Verderio C. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cell surface exposure of A-SMase was normalized to 25 μg of total lysate for each sample.Flow Cytometry and ImmunofluorescenceCells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium, and stimulated for A-SMase exposure as described above. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated with the anti-A-SMase Ab in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, and then stained with the appropriate secondary Abs conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were divided into two aliquots and analyzed either by flow cytometry or by confocal microscopy after cytospinning at 170 × g (Cytospin 3; Shandon, Cheshire, UK) for 3 min.Cell Fractionation on Density GradientCell fractionation was carried out essentially as described (19Calegari F.

Briefly, cells were homogenized in a homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm Mg CH3COO2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors. The total homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 × g, and the postnuclear supernatant was loaded on the top of a continuous sucrose gradient (0.4–2.2 m) and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 18 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, 24 fractions of 500 μl were collected. Equal amounts of proteins from each fraction were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting.Western BlottingCells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to discard cellular debris. After separation by SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Whatman), and antigens were revealed by the respective primary Abs and the appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Abs (from Cell Signaling, Beverly, CA and Bio-Rad, respectively). Proteins were visualized by ECL.RNA InterferenceSyntaxin 4 and syntaxin 3 siRNA (5′-AAGGAGGAAGCTGATGAGAAC-3′) (5′-AACGTCCGGAACAAACTGAAG-3′) and the scrambled control siRNA (5′-AAGGAGTAAGATGATGCGAAC-3′) were designed according to Fu et al. (20Fu J. Naren A.P. Gao X. Ahmmed G.U. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3178-3184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A-SMase siRNA (5′-AACTCCTTTGGATGGGCCTGG-3′) and its scrambled control siRNA (5′-GCAGTCTCTCGCTGGATGTGA-3′) were designed according to Zeidan and Hannun (9Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11549-11561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).U373 seeded at 40% confluence were transfected when at 60% confluence with the siRNAs using RNAiMAX Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Silencing was assayed after 48 h of incubation by Western blotting with the specific Abs against A-SMase and syntaxin 4.CatD ReleaseCatD was assayed by concentrating culture supernatants by speed vacuum concentration (Christ vacuum concentrator SpeedDry 2–33IR) and analyzing concentrated supernatants and remaining cell extracts by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-CatD Ab. The amount of the fully processed (34 kDa) form of mature CatD present in cells or released into the medium was determined by densitometry. In all experiments, the amount of release was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of CatD secreted into the medium compared with the total amount of CatD secreted into the medium plus that remaining cell-associated.CD95 Receptor Capping and InternalizationAfter transfection, 106 cells/ml were treated with 1 μg/ml CH11 for 45 min on ice. Unbound Ab was removed by washing with medium at 4 °C, and cells were warmed, resuspended in medium, and kept at 37 °C for the indicated time points to trigger CD95 stimulation or were kept on ice (time [t] = 0). Cells were then stained with 1 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM for 45 min on ice and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. CD95 capping was analyzed by confocal microscopy on cells centrifuged on a Cytospin 3 for 3 min on a coverslip. CD95 internalization was analyzed by flow cytometry.Statistical AnalysisThe results are expressed as means ± S.E.; n represents the number of individual experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student's t test for unpaired variables (two-tailed). The asterisks *, **, and *** or crosses +, ++, and +++ in the figure panels refer to statistical probabilities (p) of <0.5, <0.01, and <0.001, respectively, measured for the cells treated in the various experimental conditions as described in details in figure legends.DISCUSSIONIn this study we clarify the pathway of A-SMase activation, identifying its endo/exocytic nature, and the key role in it of syntaxin 4, demonstrating an important link between exocytosis and apoptosis.Previous studies had shown that A-SMase undergoes translocation to the plasma membrane during its activation triggered by a variety of stimuli, including UV and activators of apoptogenic receptors (6Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7070-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 9Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11549-11561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These studies had also shown that A-SMase translocation is required to induce receptor capping and initiate apoptosis (26Grassmé H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). How A-SMase translocates to the plasma membrane and whether this is a consequence or a trigger of its activation were, however, unknown. In addition, this mechanism of activation had been questioned by other studies that suggested an intralysosomal activation of the enzyme (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schütze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 27Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).We now show that A-SMase is localized under resting conditions in (CatD- and Lamp-1-positive) vesicles, as already established, and in (snx-1-, EEA1-, and TfR-positive) early/recycling endosomes, where it co-localizes with syntaxin 4, a protein known to shuttle between these organelles and the plasma membrane (24Band A.M. Ali H. Vartiainen M.K. Welti S. Lappalainen P. Olkkonen V.M. Kuismanen E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using CD95 as the A-SMase-activating receptor, we then demonstrate by independent experimental approaches that A-SMase translocates to the cell surface in the first minutes after receptor activation. Such translocation involves a fraction of the A-SMase contained in CatD- (and Lamp-1)-positive vesicles, is transient, mediated by an exocytic pathway in which syntaxin 4 is required, and leads to release of the soluble lysosomal protease CatD in the medium. In addition, we demonstrate that translocation of A-SMase is required for its activation because both the blockade of exocytosis with NEM and the silencing of syntaxin 4 inhibited A-SMase activation. Syntaxin 4 silencing inhibited also CD95 capping, its internalization, and its ability to induce apoptosis, indicating that the pathway of A-SMase activation we describe here is necessary to full receptor stimulation.The pathways leading to CD95-induced apoptosis are tightly regulated, in view of the pathophysiological relevance of this receptor in a variety of tissues and organs (28Guicciardi M.E. Gores G.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 29Henriques-Pons A. de Oliveira G.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2009; 53: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Poonia B. Pauza C.D. Salvato M.S. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Bouillet P. O'Reilly L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A key pathway regulating CD95 apoptogenic function is the one activated by PI3K/Akt. Once activated by phosphorylation, Akt is recruited at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and prevents the formation of plasma membrane lipid platforms containing CD95, which are fundamental to initiate apoptotic signaling (23Bénéteau M. Pizon M. Chaigne-Delalande B. Daburon S. Moreau P. De Giorgi F. Ichas F. Rebillard A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Legembre P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ceramide inhibits Akt activation through its dephosphorylation in Ser473 by the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, thus potentiating the apoptotic pathway (32Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, ceramide inhibits cell proliferation by reducing the expression levels of PCNA and inhibiting the nuclear transport of key proteins of cell cycle progression (33Faustino R.S. Cheung P. Richard M.N. Dibrov E. Kneesch A.L. Deniset J.F. Chahine M.N. Lee K. Blackwood D. Pierce G.N. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 654-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we show that these functions are critically regulated by syntaxin 4. Silencing of syntaxin 4, with inhibition of A-SMase function, prevents the dephosphorylation of Akt and the decrease of PCNA, restoring the normal condition in terms of survival and proliferation. This confirms the central role of syntaxin 4 in apoptosis induction by CD95.Based on our and previous findings, we propose a model of the trafficking leading to activation of A-SMase that explains the existing information and solves some contradictory aspects. According to this model (Fig. 5) A-SMase under resting condition is contained within lysosomes and exocytic vesicles, possibly secretory lysosomes. Upon stimulation, these vesicles reach the plasma membrane and dock to syntaxin 4 in a pathway of unconventional exocytosis used also by other types of vesicles (11Chieregatti E. Meldolesi J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Nickel W. Rabouille C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). CatD is then released into the extracellular milieu. The localization under resting conditions of A-SMase in vesicles positive for syntaxin 4/snx1 syntaxin 4/TfR and Lamp-1/CatD suggests that the enzyme is sorted back to lysosomes and recycling endosomes, although specific studies are needed to confirm this issue. Of importance, a similar route of internalization had been described for the A-SMase-activating receptors after their stimulation (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schütze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), indicating that the receptor and the enzyme may localize at the end of the activation process together in lysosomes. This model would therefore explain why activation of A-SMase occurs not only in the initial phases of receptor stimulation at the plasma membrane (6Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7070-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 9Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but also at later phases in the lysosomes (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schütze S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether and how these two mechanisms of activation of A-SMase trigger different cell signaling events and/or cooperate to generate complex biological responses, as observed with other signal transduction events (34Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 511-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Previous studies showed that activation of A-SMase by death receptors depends upon recruitment of FADD and stimulation of caspase 8; however, the molecular mechanism through which this is accomplished is unknown (35Wiegmann K. Schwandner R. Krut O. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5267-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Rotolo J.A. Zhang J. Donepudi M. Lee H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26425-26434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it had been reported that CD95 activation induces profound changes in intracellular membrane trafficking, dependent on caspase 8 activation, including also the secretory pathway (37Degli Esposti M. Tour J. Ouasti S. Ivanova S. Matarrese P. Malorni W. Khosravi-Far R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 600-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our identification of a secretory/exocytic pathway of A-SMase activation offers a link between these events.The relationship between syntaxin 4-dependent intracellular trafficking and A-SMase activation is relevant also beyond apoptosis and may provide a molecular basis for other relevant biological processes in which translocation of A-SMase has been suggested to play a role, such as in plasma membrane fusion of cells required to form multinucleated giant cells (38Utermöhlen O. Herz J. Schramm M. Krönke M. Immunobiology. 2008; 213: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), an event occurring in macrophages and cancer cells (39Peraud A. Watanabe K. Schwechheimer K.

https://openalex.org/W1990518931,"During metastasis, invading cells produce various actin-based membrane protrusions that promote directional migration and proteolysis of extracellular matrix (ECM). Observations of actin staining within thin, tubulin-based microtentacle (McTN) protrusions in suspended MDA-MB-231 tumor cells, prompted an investigation of whether McTNs are structural or functional analogs of invadopodia. We show here that MDA-MB-231 cells are capable of producing invadopodia and McTNs, both of which contain F-actin. Invadopodium formation was enhanced by the expression of a constitutively active c-Src kinase, and repressed by the expression of dominant-negative, catalytically inactive form of c-Src. In contrast, expression of inactive c-Src significantly increased McTN formation. Direct inhibition of c-Src with the SU6656 inhibitor compound also significantly enhanced McTN formation, but suppressed invadopodia, including the appearance of F-actin cores and phospho-cortactin foci, as well as completely blocking focal degradation of ECM. In addition, silencing of Tks5 in Src-transformed fibroblasts blocked invadopodia without affecting McTNs. Genetic modification of c-Src activity that promoted McTN formation augmented capillary retention of circulating tumor cells in vivo and rapid re-attachment of suspended cells in vitro, even though invadopodia were strongly suppressed. These results indicate that McTNs are capable of enhancing tumor cell reattachment, even in the absence of Tks5 and active Src, and define separate cytoskeletal mechanisms and functions for McTNs and invadopodia."
https://openalex.org/W2061996779,"Weevils constitute the most species-rich animal group with over 60,000 described species, many of which possess specialized symbiotic organs and harbor bacterial endosymbionts. Among the diverse microbial associates of weevils, Nardonella spp. represent the most ancient and widespread endosymbiont lineage, having co-speciated with the host weevils for over 125 million years. Thus far, however, no empirical work on the role of Nardonella for weevil biology has been reported. Here we investigated the biological role of the Nardonella endosymbiont for the West Indian sweet potato weevil, Euscepes postfasciatus. This insect is an experimentally tractable pest insect that can easily be reared on a natural diet of sweet potato root as well as on an agar-based artificial diet. By larval feeding on an antibiotic-containing artificial diet, Nardonella infection was effectively eliminated from the treated insects. The antibiotic-treated insects exhibited significantly lighter body weight and lower growth rate than the control insects. Then, the antibiotic-treated insects and the control insects were respectively allowed to mate and oviposit on fresh sweet potatoes without the antibiotic. The offspring of the antibiotic-treated insects, which were all Nardonella-negative, exhibited significantly lighter body weight, smaller body size, lower growth rate and paler body color in comparison with the offspring of the control insects, which were all Nardonella-positive. In conclusion, the Nardonella endosymbiont is involved in normal growth and development of the host weevil. The biological role of the endosymbiont probably underlies the long-lasting host-symbiont co-speciation in the evolutionary course of weevils."
https://openalex.org/W2091929881,"The identity of the cell adhesive factors in fetal bovine serum, commonly used to supplement growth media, remains a mystery due to the plethora of serum proteins. In the present analyses, we showed that fetuin-A, whose function in cellular attachment in tissue culture has been debated for many years, is indeed a major serum cell attachment factor particularly for tumor cells. We are able to report this because of a new purification strategy that has for the first time given us a homogeneous protein band in colloidal Coomassie-stained gels that retains biological activity. The tumor cells adhered to immobilized fetuin-A and not α(2)-macroglobulin, its major contaminant. The interaction of cells with fetuin-A was driven mainly by Ca(2+) ions, and cells growing in regular medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum were just as sensitive to loss of extracellular Ca(2+) ions as cells growing in fetuin-A. Fractionation of human serum revealed that cell attachment was confined to the fractions that had fetuin-A. Interestingly, the tumor cells also took up fetuin-A and secreted it back to the medium using an unknown mechanism that can be observed in live cells. The attachment of tumor cells to fetuin-A was accompanied by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation that was down-regulated in cells that lack annexin-A6, one of the cell surface receptors for fetuin-A. Taken together, our data show the significance of fetuin-A in tumor cell growth mechanisms in vitro and open new research vistas for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1975589376,"Hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a critical role in normal cellular processes, in normal mammalian gastrointestinal development and differentiation, and in oncogenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotype in a variety of human cancers. Increasing evidence further implicates the involvement of HH signaling in oncogenesis and metastatic behavior of colon cancers. However, genomic approaches to elucidate the role of HH signaling in cancers in general are lacking, and data derived on HH signaling in colon cancer is extremely limited.To identify unique downstream targets of the GLI genes, the transcriptional regulators of HH signaling, in the context of colon carcinoma, we employed a small molecule inhibitor of both GLI1 and GLI2, GANT61, in two human colon cancer cell lines, HT29 and GC3/c1. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated accumulation of GANT61-treated cells at the G1/S boundary. cDNA microarray gene expression profiling of 18,401 genes identified Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) both common and unique to HT29 and GC3/c1. Analyses using GenomeStudio (statistics), Matlab (heat map), Ingenuity (canonical pathway analysis), or by qRT-PCR, identified p21(Cip1) (CDKN1A) and p15(Ink4b) (CDKN2B), which play a role in the G1/S checkpoint, as up-regulated genes at the G1/S boundary. Genes that determine further cell cycle progression at G1/S including E2F2, CYCLIN E2 (CCNE2), CDC25A and CDK2, and genes that regulate passage of cells through G2/M (CYCLIN A2 [CCNA2], CDC25C, CYCLIN B2 [CCNB2], CDC20 and CDC2 [CDK1], were down-regulated. In addition, novel genes involved in stress response, DNA damage response, DNA replication and DNA repair were identified following inhibition of HH signaling.This study identifies genes that are involved in HH-dependent cellular proliferation in colon cancer cells, and following its inhibition, genes that regulate cell cycle progression and events downstream of the G1/S boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2086013857,"We have recently described the N-terminal RAS association domain family of genes, RASSF7-10. Previously, we cloned the N-terminal RASSF10 gene and demonstrated frequent methylation of the associated 5'-CpG island in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To characterize RASSF10 gene expression, we demonstrate that in developing Xenopus embryos, RASSF10 shows a very striking pattern in the rhombencephalon (hind brain). It is also expressed in other parts of the brain and other organs. Due to the well-defined expression pattern in the brain of Xenopus embryos, we analyzed the methylation status of the RASSF10-associated 5'-CpG island in astrocytic gliomas. RASSF10 was frequently methylated in WHO grade II-III astrocytomas and WHO grade IV primary glioblastomas (67.5%), but was unmethylated in grade I astrocytomas and in DNA from age matched control brain samples. RASSF10 gene expression both at the mRNA and protein levels could be switched back on in methylated glioma cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In secondary glioblastomas (sGBM), RASSF10 methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with worst progression-free survival and overall survival and occurred at an early stage in their development. In cell culture experiments, overexpression of RASSF10 mediated a reduction in the colony forming ability of two RASSF10-methylated glioma cell lines. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF10-stimulated anchorage-independent growth of U87 glioma cells, increased their viability and caused an increase in the cells' proliferative ability. We generated and characterized a RASSF10-specific antibody and demonstrated for the first time that RASSF10 subcellular localization is cell-cycle dependent with RASSF10 colocalizing to centrosomes and associated microtubules during mitosis. This is the first report demonstrating that RASSF10 can act as a tumor suppressor gene and is frequently methylated in gliomas and can potentially be developed into a prognostic marker for sGBM."
https://openalex.org/W2065776685,"Background Under stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a central role in energy balance, and the heat shock response is a protective mechanism for cell survival. The relationship between AMPK activity and heat shock protein (HSP) expression under stress is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that heat stress induced dephosphorylation of AMPKα subunit (AMPKα) in various cell types from human and rodent. In HepG2 cells, the dephosphorylation of AMPKα under heat stress in turn caused dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two downstream targets of AMPK, confirming the inhibition of AMPK activity by heat stress. Treatment of HepG2 cells with phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor okadaic acid or inhibition of PP2A expression by RNA interference efficiently reversed heat stress-induced AMPKα dephosphorylation, suggesting that heat stress inhibited AMPK through activation of PP2A. Heat stress- and other HSP inducer (CdCl2, celastrol, MG132)-induced HSP70 expression could be inhibited by AICAR, an AMPK specific activator. Inhibition of AMPKα expression by RNA interference reversed the inhibitory effect of AICAR on HSP70 expression under heat stress. These results indicate that AMPK inhibition under stress contribute to HSP70 expression. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of AMPK by AICAR had no effect on heat stress-induced HSF1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation and binding with heat response element in the promoter region of HSP70 gene, but significantly decreased HSP70 mRNA stability. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that during heat shock response, PP2A mediated AMPK inhibition upregulates HSP70 expression at least partially through stabilizing its mRNA, which suggests a novel mechanism for HSP induction under stress."

https://openalex.org/W1990507126,"Epithelial cells are dependent on extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment for maintenance of metabolic activity and suppression of apoptosis. Here we show that loss of ECM attachment causes down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and β1 integrin protein and mRNA expression and that ErbB2, which is amplified in 25% of breast tumors, reverses these effects of ECM deprivation. ErbB2 rescue of β1 integrin mRNA and protein in suspended cells is dependent on EGFR, however, the rescue of EGFR expression does not require β1 integrin. We show that there is a significant decrease in the stability of EGFR in ECM-detached cells that is reversed by ErbB2 overexpression. Rescue of both EGFR and β1 integrin protein by ErbB2 is dependent on Erk activity and induction of its downstream target Sprouty2, a protein known to regulate EGFR protein stability. Interestingly, expression of EGFR and β1 integrin protein is more dependent on Erk/Sprouty2 in ECM-detached ErbB2-overexpressing cells when compared with ECM-attached cells. These results provide further insight into the ErbB2-driven anchorage independence of tumor cells and provide a new mechanism for regulation of EGFR and β1 integrin expression in ECM-detached cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009806178,"Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones are crucial for cellular development and maintenance as they assist in protein folding and stabilization of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Prefoldin (PFDN), a ubiquitously expressed heterohexameric co-chaperone, is necessary for proper folding of nascent proteins, in particular, tubulin and actin. Here we show that a genetic disruption in the murine Pfdn5 gene, a subunit of prefoldin, causes a syndrome characterized by photoreceptor degeneration, central nervous system abnormalities, and male infertility. Our data indicate that a missense mutation in Pfdn5, may cause these phenotypes through a reduction in formation of microtubules and microfilaments, which are necessary for the development of cilia and cytoskeletal structures, respectively. The diversity of phenotypes demonstrated by models carrying mutations in different PFDN subunits suggests that each PFDN subunit must confer a distinct substrate specificity to the prefoldin holocomplex."
https://openalex.org/W2134805687,"Centrosomes play a crucial role in the directed migration of developing neurons. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study has identified a novel disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)-interacting protein, named CAMDI after coiled-coil protein associated with myosin II and DISC1, which translocates to the centrosome in a DISC1-dependent manner. Knockdown of CAMDI by shRNA revealed severely impaired radial migration with disoriented centrosomes. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified myosin II as a binding protein of CAMDI. CAMDI interacts preferentially with phosphomyosin II and induces an accumulation of phosphomyosin II at the centrosome in a DISC1-dependent manner. Interestingly, one single nucleotide polymorphism of the CAMDI gene (R828W) is identified, and its gene product was found to reduce the binding ability to phosphomyosin II. Furthermore, mice with overexpression of R828W in neurons exhibit an impaired radial migration. Our findings indicate that CAMDI is required for radial migration probably through DISC1 and myosin II-mediated centrosome positioning during neuronal development."

A rat femoral marrow ablation model was performed and genome-wide microarray data were obtained from samples at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 28, and 56 days post-ablation, with intact bones serving as controls at Day 0. Bayesian model-based clustering produced eight distinct groups amongst 9,062 significant gene probe sets based on similar temporal expression profiles, which were further categorized into three major temporal classes of increased, variable, and decreased expression. Osteoblastic- and osteoclastic-associated genes were found to be significantly expressed within the increased expression groups. Chondrogenesis was not detected histologically. Adipogenic marker genes were found within variable/decreased expression groups, emphasizing that adipogenesis was inhibited during osteogenesis. Differential biological processes and pathways associated with each major temporal group were identified, and significantly expressed genes involved were visually represented by heat maps. It was determined that the increased expression group exclusively contains genes involved in pathways for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Wnt signaling, TGF-β signaling, and inflammatory pathways. Only the variable expression group contains genes associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the notch signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and the B cell receptor signaling pathway. The decreased group exclusively consists of genes involved in heme biosynthesis, the p53 signaling pathway, and the hematopoietic cell lineage. Significant biological pathways and transcription factors expressed at each time point post-ablation were also identified. These data present the first temporal gene expression profiling analysis of the rat genome during intramembranous bone regeneration induced by femoral marrow ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2098224012,"Islet β cell dysfunction resulting from inflammation, ER stress, and oxidative stress is a key determinant in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was recently shown that the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) promotes early cytokine-induced inflammation in the β cell. DHS catalyzes the conversion of lysine to hypusine, an amino acid that is unique to the translational elongation factor eIF5A. Here, we sought to determine whether DHS activity contributes to β cell dysfunction in models of type 2 diabetes in mice and β cell lines. A 2-week treatment of obese diabetic C57BLKS/J-db/db mice with the DHS inhibitor GC7 resulted in improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin release, and enhanced β cell mass. Thapsigargin treatment of β cells in vitro induces a picture of ER stress and apoptosis similar to that seen in db/db mice; in this setting, DHS inhibition led to a block in CHOP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein) production despite >30-fold activation of Chop gene transcription. Blockage of CHOP translation resulted in reduction of downstream caspase-3 cleavage and near-complete protection of cells from apoptotic death. DHS inhibition appeared to prevent the cytoplasmic co-localization of eIF5A with the ER, possibly precluding the participation of eIF5A in translational elongation at ER-based ribosomes. We conclude that hypusination by DHS is required for the ongoing production of proteins, particularly CHOP, in response to ER stress in the β cell."
https://openalex.org/W2030785738,"Steady progress has been made in defining both the viral and cellular determinants of retroviral assembly and release. Although it is widely accepted that targeting of the Gag polypeptide to the plasma membrane is critical for proper assembly of HIV-1, the intracellular interactions and trafficking of Gag to its assembly sites in the infected cell are poorly understood. HIV-1 Gag was shown to interact and co-localize with calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous and highly conserved Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed in all eukaryotic cells, and is implicated in a variety of cellular functions. Binding of HIV-1 Gag to CaM is dependent on calcium and is mediated by the N-terminally myristoylated matrix (myr(+)MA) domain. Herein, we demonstrate that CaM binds to myr(+)MA with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of ∼2 μm and 1:1 stoichiometry. Strikingly, our data revealed that CaM binding to MA induces the extrusion of the myr group. However, in contrast to all known examples of CaM-binding myristoylated proteins, our data show that the myr group is exposed to solvent and not involved in CaM binding. The interactions between CaM and myr(+)MA are endothermic and entropically driven, suggesting that hydrophobic contacts are critical for binding. As revealed by NMR data, both CaM and MA appear to engage substantial regions and/or undergo significant conformational changes upon binding. We believe that our findings will provide new insights on how Gag may interact with CaM during the HIV replication cycle."

Second, what is the realistic value of trying to unravel these interactions, both in terms of understanding disease pathogenesis and as a means of ameliorating disease? Finally, and most importantly, do the technologies and methodologies exist to facilitate an unbiased search for gene-environment interactions?

Using a yeast model of conditional expression of the frataxin homologue YFH1, we analyzed the primary effects of YFH1 depletion. The main conclusion unambiguously points to the up-regulation of iron transport systems as a primary effect of YFH1 down-regulation. We observed that inactivation of aconitase, an iron-sulfur enzyme, occurs long after the iron uptake system has been activated. Decreased aconitase activity should be considered part of a group of secondary events promoted by iron overloading, which includes decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased protein carbonyl formation. Impaired manganese uptake, which contributes to superoxide dismutase deficiency, has also been observed in YFH1-deficient cells. This low manganese content can be attributed to the down-regulation of the metal ion transporter Smf2. Low Smf2 levels were not observed in AFT1/YFH1 double mutants, indicating that high iron levels could be responsible for the Smf2 decline.

Here we investigated the role of Cdc14A in cell cycle control, focusing on the regulation of Cdc25s in human cells. We found that deregulated human Cdc14A phosphatase impairs the timing of mitotic entry by the effect on Cdk1-cyclin B1 activity. Furthermore, Cdc14A inhibited both Cdc25A and Cdc25B catalytic activities at the G2/M transition.

To synchronize cells in early S phase, thymidine was added at 2.5 mm to subconfluent cells; 24 h later the cells were washed with fresh culture medium, followed by a second addition of thymidine 12–15 h later. After 24 h of the second thymidine treatment, cells were released by extensive washing. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h and stained with 8 μg/ml-propidium iodide, 20 μg/ml-RNase A solution for 1 h at 37 °C. For phosphohistone H3 positivity, cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were washed with PBS-0.15% Triton X-100 and subsequently stained with anti-phosphohistone H3 and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit. Then, they were incubated with a 8 μg/ml propidium iodide and 20 μg/ml RNase A solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur device (Becton Dickinson). A plasmid encoding GST-Cdc14A was a gift from Peter Jackson. GST-Cdc14A was purified from bacteria (22Kaiser B.K. Zimmerman Z.A. Charbonneau H. Jackson P.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2289-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cdc14A(PD) is a mutant C278S, which causes a complete loss of phosphatase activity. Full-length, N-terminal (amino acids 1–373) and C-terminal (amino acids 374–566) Cdc25B fragments were amplified by PCR and fused to an N-terminal HA-tag in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). siRNAs (Dharmacon) used were: Cdc25B (5′-AAUCCUCCCUGUCGUCUGAAU-3′), GL2 (control) (5′-AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′), Cdc14A siRNA 2 (5′-GCACAGTAAATACCCACTATT-3′), Luc (control) (5′-ACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAAUU-3′). Cdc14A siRNA 1 (5′-GGGACATTGATAGCCTGTTATGTAA-3′) and its corresponding siRNA control (low GC) were from Invitrogen. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of the siRNA duplex in the culture medium was 60–100 nm. Four extra silent mutations were introduced to Cdc14A cDNA in the area corresponding to siRNA duplex 1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis. The PCR oligos used are: 5′-AGAACAGGGACCCTGATCGCCTGCTATGTAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTACATAGCAGGCGATCAGGGTCCCTGTTCT-3′. The resulting Cdc14A mutant (Cdc14A (R)) was subcloned into pBABE-puro retroviral expression vector. Retroviruses were produced in 293T cells and used to infect U-2-OS cells. After 24 h of infection, cells were grown in medium containing 0.5 μg/ml of puromicine for 48 h and then transfected with the corresponding siRNAs. pBABE-puro-GFP plasmid was used to control the infection efficiency. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript First-Strand kit (Invitrogen). Cdc14A primers were 5′-GTTCCTGAACATCTGTGA-3′ and 5′-GCATGTGTAAACCTGTAG-3′. Cdc14B primers were 5′-GTGCCATTGCAGTACATT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGGCTATCAGAGTG-3′. 18 S rRNA primers, used as internal control, were 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTT-3′. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed according to standard procedures using an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used in this study included mouse monoclonal to Cdc14A (DCS-291, NeoMarkers), Cdc25A (sc-7389, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdc25B (DCS-164, (52Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C.

Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and Cdc25 phosphatase assays were performed as described (52Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuâsen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated N- and C-terminal halves of Cdc25B were phosphorylated by Cdk1-cyclin B1 (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 0.15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with GST-Cdc14A or GST-Cdc14A(PD) (100 ng) in phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3; 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100; 5 mm DTT), or with λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure Cdk1 activity, Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes were immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts using anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. Then, they were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with histone H1 in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting or autoradiography. Cdc25 phosphatase activities were measured as activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes as described previously (52Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuâsen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Briefly, inactive Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes were immunoprecipitated from cells treated with doxorubicin using anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. Cdc25 proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with Cdk1-cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates in phosphatase buffer. Reaction was stopped by addition of kinase assay buffer. Then, to assay the activity of Cdk1, kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min using histone H1 as substrate. Cells were grown on coverslips, induced to express Myc-Cdc14A for 48 h and fixed for 20 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C. Myc-tagged Cdc14A was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody against Myc tag (clone 9E10; Sigma-Aldrich). Centrosomes were detected by co-staining with mouse monoclonal antibody against γ-tubulin (clone GTU-88; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). DNA was counterstained by DAPI. Images were acquired using a ×40 or ×60 objectives under a Leica DM6000B microscope and a digital camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER) and processed with Metamorph program. Human BJ cells were grown in six well plates. Cells were synchronized in G1/S by double thymidine treatment and transfected with Cdc14A, or control siRNAs after the first thymidine arrest. Cells were then released into fresh medium containing the kinesin Eg5 inhibitor, Dimethylenastron (10 μm), to prevent exit from mitosis, and transferred to the microscope. Recording was started right after release from the second thymidine treatment. For rescue of Cdc14A knockdown experiments, U-2-OS cells were first infected with the corresponding retroviruses and then treated as above. Nocodazole (50 nm) was used instead of dimethylenastron. Time-lapse frames were acquired using a ×20 EC Plan-Neofluar objective on an Eclipse TE2000-E microscope (Nikon) controlled by Metamorph software and equipped with a Control Unit of temperature, air, and CO2 (Okolab), and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera. Bright-field frames were recorded every 5 min. Time-lapse data were processed using Metamorph and ImageJ 1.42q software. Using U-2-OS clones expressing Myc-tagged Cdc14A or its phosphatase-dead (PD) mutant form in a tetracycline-repressible manner (34Mailand N. Lukas C. Kaiser B.K. Jackson P.K. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we observed that induction of active Cdc14A, but not the inactive Cdc14A(PD), delayed cells in G2/M (Fig. 1, A and B). This effect was correlated with an inhibitory effect on mitotic Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes (Fig. 1C). In these cells, we also checked the cell cycle-regulated localization of Myc-Cdc14A, which was, as it has been described (22Kaiser B.K. Zimmerman Z.A. Charbonneau H. Jackson P.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2289-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), centrosomal during interphase and cytosolic since early prophase to the end of mitosis (supplemental Fig. S1). Previously reported effects of Cdc14A overexpression, such as lagging and missegregated chromosomes, misshapen nuclei, progressive cell death, and centrosome splitting out of mitosis (34Mailand N. Lukas C. Kaiser B.K. Jackson P.K. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were also observed (supplemental Fig. S2). To define the cell cycle delay caused by Cdc14A overexpression more precisely, cells were synchronized in G1/S by double thymidine treatment, and then released and monitored as they progressed through G2/M. Cdc14A expression was induced as indicated in the experimental setup depicted in Fig. 2A. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ectopic expression of active Cdc14A, led to a higher number of cells with a 4N DNA at all the time points analyzed as compared with non-induced cells or cells overproducing the inactive phosphatase form, indicating that Cdc14A up-regulation slows cells in G2/M. The same effect was observed when Cdc14A expression was induced after the second thymidine treatment (supplemental Fig. S3). Because cyclin A starts to be degraded in prometaphase (37Geley S. Kramer E. Gieffers C. Gannon J. Peters J.M. Hunt T. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 38den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and cyclin B1 in metaphase (39Hagting A. Den Elzen N. Vodermaier H.C. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Pines J. J. Cell. Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we used these two proteins as markers for the characterization of the G2/M delay. As shown in Fig. 2C, while in control cells cyclin A declined 14 h after release, in cells overexpressing Cdc14A the level of cyclin A remained constant, indicating a delay before prometaphase. Consistently, cyclin B1 levels also remained high throughout the experiment in cells overproducing Cdc14A. In parallel, we monitored the phosphorylation shift of Cdk1 by immunoblot. While in control cells the non-phosphorylated form of Cdk1 was significantly increased 14 h after release, indicating Cdk1 activation, in cells overexpressing Cdc14A phosphorylated and inactive Cdk1 persisted up to the last time point (Fig. 2C). This observation was confirmed by in vitro Cdk1 kinase assays (Fig. 2D). These results show that Cdc14A inhibits Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes activity at the G2/M transition. Because chromosome condensation is an early event in mitosis and depends on Cdk1 activity (5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the kinetics of chromosome condensation might be affected by ectopic expression of Cdc14A. As shown in Fig. 2E, in cultures in which Cdc14A was up-regulated chromosome condensation was also consistently delayed. Expression of the Cdc14A(PD) form did not cause, however, any delay at the G2/M transition, as observed by measuring cyclin B1 degradation, Cdk1 activation and chromosome condensation (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these data indicate that the excess of active Cdc14A delays the G2/M transition, suggesting that Cdc14A regulates mitotic entry. To confirm the possible role of Cdc14A in mitotic entry, we down-regulated Cdc14A expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in U-2-OS cells (Fig. 3A). Cells were synchronized in G1/S by double thymidine treatment and transfected with Cdc14A or control siRNAs after the first thymidine arrest. Cells were then released into fresh medium containing nocodazole, to prevent exit from mitosis, and were monitored as they progressed into mitosis. Because the available Cdc14A-specific antibodies did not recognize the endogenous protein, siRNA oligos were validated by RT-PCR, checking the two Cdc14 isoforms, Cdc14A and Cdc14B. As shown in Fig. 3B, Cdc14A siRNAs (siRNA 1) were efficient and specific against this transcript. We found that the kinetics of chromosome condensation was accelerated when Cdc14A was down-regulated as compared with control cultures (Fig. 3C). Consistently, depletion of Cdc14A also accelerated Cdk1 activation and histone H3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that entry into mitosis was faster in Cdc14A siRNA-transfected cells. Because specificity is a major concern for siRNA duplexes, to strengthen the conclusion that Cdc14A slows the entry into mitosis, two types of experiments were performed. First, we down-regulated Cdc14A by an independent siRNA duplex (siRNA 2). Under similar experimental conditions, siRNA 2 also accelerated chromosome condensation (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). Moreover, the effect obtained with siRNA 2 was less marked than with the first siRNA duplex, consistent with a lower Cdc14A depletion (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S5, A and C). These results suggest that Cdc14A is a rate-limiting factor for the entry into mitosis. Second, we performed a siRNA-resistant transgene rescue experiment for siRNA 1, using a Cdc14A cDNA with several silent mutations in the sequence corresponding to siRNA 1 as the rescue construct (Cdc14A(R)) (Fig. 4A). U-2-OS cells were first infected with retroviruses expressing pBABE empty vector or pBABE-Cdc14A(R) and then transfected with siRNA 1 or siRNA control as indicated in Fig. 3A. Entry into mitosis was monitored by time-lapse microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4B, cells infected with empty vector and transfected with siRNA 1 accelerated entry into mitosis as judged by the faster accumulation of mitotic cells. However, in cells infected with retroviruses expressing Cdc14A(R), and then transfected with siRNA 1 the kinetics of mitotic cells accumulation was similar to the observed in the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the faster entry into mitosis caused by siRNA 1 is specific to knockdown of Cdc14A. To know whether or not Cdc14A also regulates the mitotic entry in normal, nontransformed human cells, we analyzed whether Cdc14A depletion in human BJ-TERT fibroblasts would also accelerate the entry into mitosis. Upon transfection with Cdc14A or control siRNAs as described in Fig. 3A, we found that reduction of Cdc14A in these cells also resulted in a faster mitotic entry (Fig. 5, A and B). All together, these data indicate that, in a normal cell cycle, Cdc14A negatively regulates entry into mitosis. We wished next to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Cdc14A negatively regulates entry into mitosis. Because we found no direct effect on Cdk1-Cyclin B1 complexes (data not shown), we speculated that Cdc14A might regulate Cdc25 mitotic activators. The fact that Cdc14A is able to dephosphorylate in vitro and to inhibit in vivo Cdc25 protein in S. pombe cells (35Vázquez-Novelle M.D. Esteban V. Bueno A. Sacristán M.P. J. Biol.

DACH1 repressed gene transcription driven by the DACH1-responsive element (DRE). Recent genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrated DACH1 binding sites co-localized with Forkhead protein (FOX) binding sites.

Proteomic analysis identified transcription elongation regulator 1 (TCERG1) as the transcriptional co-regulator of DACH1 activity. The FF2 domain of TCERG1 was required for DACH1 binding, and the deletion of FF2 abolished DACH1 trans-repression function.

Both the protein and mRNA levels of SelW were increased during C2C12 cell differentiation, particularly during the early stage. Sequence analysis of the SelW promoter revealed four putative E-boxes, E1, E2, E3, and E4, which are known binding sites for MyoD, a myogenic transcriptional factor. Luciferase reporter assay showed that E1 and E4 were crucial for MyoD-dependent promoter activity. Using EMSA analysis, we observed that MyoD bound directly to E1 but not to E4, even though E4 mutation reduced SelW promoter activity in the luciferase reporter assay. Binding of MyoD to E1 was further investigated by ChIP assay.

Only a few selenoproteins, such as deiodinases and selenoprotein N (SelN), are known to lack this common feature (4Flohé L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1389-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was also found that 14-3-3 protein is a SelW-interacting protein with an unusual manner of redox regulation (5Dikiy A. Novoselov S.V. Fomenko D.E. Sengupta A. Carlson B.A. Cerny R.L. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6871-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).

SelW is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, but it is specifically high in the skeletal muscle and brain of mammals (2Loflin J. Lopez N. Whanger P.D. Kioussi C. J. Inorg.

Tissue-specific protein expression implies regulation by a tissue-specific factor that plays a significant role in the tissue. Using Northern blot analysis, SelW expression was found to be regulated during C2C12 cell differentiation (2Loflin J. Lopez N. Whanger P.D. Kioussi C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The expression of most proteins is regulated at the transcriptional level by mechanisms controlling complex transcriptional initiation networks. Therefore, elucidating the regulation of selenoprotein expression at the transcriptional level is vital to understanding how selenoproteins respond to environmental stimuli. Compared with the total number of selenoproteins actually identified, the number of studies focusing on the transcriptional regulation of selenoproteins is very low. Nonetheless, TrxR1, which is abundant in most tissues, is transcriptionally activated via binding of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) to the antioxidant-responsive element in its promoter upon cadmium induction (11Sakurai A.

Examination of point mutations and deletion fragments of FoxO-responsive elements in the promoter of selenoprotein P (SeP), a key selenium supplier produced in the liver, found that promoter activity and expression are enhanced by FoxO1a (forkhead box, class O) transcription factor in hepatoma cells (12Walter P.L.

There are few reports on the transcriptional regulation of SelW. It has been shown that metal-response element (MRE) is present in the SelW promoter, which is activated by exposure to copper and zinc ions but not cadmium (16Amantana A. Vorachek W.R. Butler J.A. Costa N.D. Whanger P.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An in vitro binding assay found that a transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), bound to a consensus Sp1 sequence in the SelW promoter as well as to the MRE sequence (17Amantana A. Vorachek W.R. Butler J.A. Ream W. Whanger P.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, another group observed the induction of the mouse SelW promoter by cadmium in a liver-specific metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) knock-out mouse model (18Wimmer U. Wang Y. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5715-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In that particular study, MTF-1 was identified as a factor playing an important role in the regulation of SelW expression in liver-specific MTF-1 knock-out mice. MTF-1 is a zinc finger protein involved in the response to various stress stimuli, such as heavy metals and oxidative stress, which acts by binding to MRE consensus sequences in the promoters of its target genes. According to a recent publication, MTF-1 targets and represses the mRNA expression of SelH and Txnrd2 by binding to cis-acting MREs present in the coding regions (19Stoytcheva Z.R. Vladimirov V. Douet V. Stoychev I. Berry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together, MTF-1 might act as an activator or repressor of selenoprotein expression via binding to MREs located in the promoters or coding regions of its target genes. To date, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory factors associated with tissue-specific SelW expression. Specifically, there is only limited information on the factors associated with transcriptional regulation of SelW in skeletal muscle, the major expression tissue. Skeletal muscle cells, which are derived from somites during embryogenesis, form precisely orchestrated physiological networks (20Tajbakhsh S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Shi X. Garry D.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1692-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Myogenic precursor cells divide into proliferating myoblasts that then differentiate into multinucleated myotubes during cell elongation, alignment, and fusion. Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) composed of Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 play essential roles in skeletal muscle development. Myf5, MyoD, and MRF4 serve as myogenic determination factors that control the fate of proliferating myoblasts derived from myogenic precursor cells. The activation of myogenin and MRF4 is responsible for the differentiation of myotubes from proliferating myoblasts. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MyoD is a member of the MRF family (22Berkes C.A. Tapscott S.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, MyoD has been characterized as a key regulatory factor that controls the expression of many muscle-specific genes, such as muscle creatine kinase (MCK), myogenin, myosin alkaline light chains (MLC1), and MyoD itself during myogenesis (23Lassar A.B.

Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). MyoD also regulates gene expression through the recognition of a consensus cis-acting element, called an E-box (CANNTG), which is located in the promoters or enhancers of its target genes. As described above, some reports have achieved transcriptional regulation of SelW in C2C12 myoblast cells by using cis-acting elements with corresponding trans-acting factors to control SelW promoter activity. However, these reports are mainly limited to MRE sequences within the SelW promoter region between −40 and −20 bp. In this study, we investigated the tissue-specific regulation of SelW expression at the transcriptional level during skeletal muscle differentiation in mouse C2C12 cells, which are well established in muscle development (27Blau H.M. Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 28Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The results show that SelW expression was up-regulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes. Four putative E-boxes were identified in the SelW promoter, and the SelW promoter was activated by the binding of MyoD to at least one of these putative E-boxes during differentiation. Therefore, MyoD was required for transcriptional activation of SelW via putative E-boxes during skeletal muscle differentiation. Mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 (CRL-1772) myoblast and nonmyogenic mouse fibroblast C3H10T1/2 (CCL-226) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. C2C12 cells were cultured to ∼50% confluence in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). To induce differentiation, the cells were cultured to ∼100% confluence in GM, which is denoted as D0 in this study, followed by exchange with differentiation medium (DM) consisting of DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 2% horse serum (HS). DM was exchanged every day for the 5 days of culturing. To examine the effect of selenium status on SelW mRNA expression, confluent C2C12 cells at D0 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with different serum concentrations or in medium containing various levels of sodium selenite up to the indicated time point. AIM-V (AIM; Invitrogen) was also used as serum-free medium. C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in GM containing Basal Medium Eagle (JBI) supplemented with 10% FBS. For C3H10T1/2 differentiation, cells were transfected at ∼50% confluence with plasmid expressing MyoD, replaced with DM containing Basal Medium Eagle supplemented with 2% HS at ∼100% confluence, and then maintained. All culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen), and the cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. SelW promoter fragments were generated by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from rat muscle, as described previously (16Amantana A. Vorachek W.R. Butler J.A. Costa N.D. Whanger P.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and then cloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to construct SelW promoter luciferase reporter plasmids. The resulting constructs, −973SelW/Luc and −240SelW/Luc, contained SelW promoter regions from −973 and −240 to +32 bp, respectively. Using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), E-box mutants of −973SelW/Luc were constructed in which the conserved E-box sequence CANNTG was converted to CGNNAG, as described previously (29Parker M.H. Perry R.L. Fauteux M.C. Berkes C.A. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Myogenesis-dependent luciferase plasmid MCK-Luc was a kind gift from Prof. Da-Zhi Wang (University of North Carolina) and 4RSV-Luc a kind gift from Prof. Andrew Lassar (Harvard Medical School) and Prof. Makoto Inui (Yamaguchi University School of Medicine), and all pcDNA3 plasmids expressing MRFs and MEF2 family proteins were kindly provided by Prof. Young-Gyu Ko (Korea University). All primers used for the construction of plasmids are represented in Table 1. Enzyme restriction sites for the cloning of SelW promoter plasmids were KpnI for the forward primer and HindIII for the reverse primer, as underlined in the table. The sequences of all DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences for PCR and EMSA used in this studyTarget gene (product size)Primer (5′ → 3′)Cloning for rat SelW promoter −973SelW/Luc, FGCGCGGTACCGCCTTGCGCTTCCTAGGC −240SelW/Luc, FGCGCGGTACCGAAGGGACAGCGAGGGGC +32, RCCGCAAGCTTGCACAAAGCGAGGACCCGSite-directed mutagenesis for rat SelW promoter E1m, FGATTTTTTGTTTTGAGACGACAGCTCTTGTAGCCCAG E1m, RCTGGGCTACAAGAGCTGTCGTCTCAAAACAAAAAATC E2m, FCTTCAGTCTCCTCTTCCCGAAAGCTGGGATTAGAGGC E2m, RGCCTCTAATCCCAGCTTTCGGGAAGAGGAGACTGAAG E3m, FGGCAAGTCCTCTGCGCCGACAGCGCTACAGCCCAAGC E3m, RGCTTGGGCTGTAGCGCTGTCGGCGCAGAGGACTTGCC E4m, FGGAGGAGAGATCCATCCCGATAGTCTCCCGATGCGTG E4m, RCACGCATCGGGAGACTATCGGGATGGATCTCTCCTCCGene amplification SelW, F (232 bp)GTGTATTGTGGAGCTTGAGGC SelW, RCCAAGGCAGCTTTGATGGCGG MyoD, F (482 bp)CATCCGCTACATCGAAGGTC MyoD, RTCGCATTGGGGTTTGAGCC p21, F (295 bp)GTCCAATCCTGGTGATGTCC p21, RCAGGGCAGAGGAAGTACTGG Myogenin, F (430 bp)AGGAGAGAAAGATGGAGTCCAGAG Myogenin, RTAACAAAAGAAGTCACCCCAAGAG MyHC, F (625 bp)AGAAGGAGGAGGCAACTTCTG MyHC, RACATACTCATTGCCGACCTTG TrxR1, F (876 bp)TGGATTTTGTCACACCGACTCC TrxR1, RCGATGGCGTAGATGTAAGGCAC Hprt1, F (225 bp)GCAAACTTTGCTTTCCCTGG Hprt1, RGCTTTGTATTTGGCTTTTCC Gapdh, F (369 bp)CATGACAACTTTGGCATTGTG Gapdh, RGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACEMSA E1GTTTTGAGACAACTGCTCTTG E2CTCTTCCCAAATGCTGGGAT E3CTCTGCGCCAACTGCGCTACAGCC E4GATCCATCCCAATTGTCTCCCGAT MCKCCCCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGAChIP E1, FCCTCGAACCCACAGAGATTTC E1, RGAAGAGGAGACTGAAGGATTG Gapdh, FAGCTACTCGCGGCTTTACG Gapdh, RTCACCTGGCACTGCACAAG Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells at the indicated time points during differentiation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScriptase™ III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) in a 50-μl total reaction volume, followed by PCR. For each exponential amplification, PCR was performed for 20–28 cycles, after which each product was visualized by ethidium bromide staining following 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis or 2% in the case of the SelW, p21, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt1) genes. All specific primers are shown in Table 1. Real time PCR was performed to measure the expression of SelW. One hundred nanograms of SelW cDNA and 150 ng of Hprt1 cDNA were amplified with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Diagnostics). Amplification included a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. To verify amplification specificity, melting curves of the PCR products of each primer set were analyzed. The specific primers used were identical to those used in RT-PCR. Each experiment was prepared in triplicate, and data are represented as means ± S.D. of four independent experiments. C2C12 cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4), and incubated on ice about for 30 min with periodic vortexing. After centrifugation, the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To detect protein expression, 30 μg of total protein was separated by 8–15% SDS-PAGE, except for SelW, in which case 60 μg of total protein was analyzed by 12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Millipore) membranes, blocked for 1–2 h with 5% skim milk, and then probed overnight with primary antibodies as follows: anti-MyoD, anti-p21, and anti-myogenin from Pharmingen; anti-MyHC from Sigma; anti-phosphohistone H3 from Upstate; anti-tubulin from AbFrontier; and rabbit anti-TrxR1 kindly provided by Prof. Seung-Rock Lee (Chonnam National University Medical School). To observe SelW expression, we used rabbit polyclonal anti-SelW raised against the peptide HSKKKGDGYVDTESK (synthesized and purified by Invitrogen). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse from Calbiochem and anti-rabbit from Invitrogen) were incubated with the membranes for 1 h, followed by visualization using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). To estimate the activity of the SelW promoter, C2C12 cells were seeded onto a 60-mm total area at ∼30% confluence, followed by transfection with 1 μg of SelW firefly luciferase plasmids and 0.15 μg of control Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following 6 h of transfection, C2C12 cells were cultured in GM for 1 day and then harvested for the measurement of SelW promoter activity in proliferating myoblasts. To measure SelW promoter activity in differentiating myotubes, cells were cultured in GM up to ∼100% confluence, followed by transfer into DM for 1 day to induce differentiation. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of SelW luciferase plasmids, the same amount of MRFs or MEF2 family of transcription factors, as well as 0.15 μg of pRL-TK. The cells were cultured in GM and then harvested for Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. To observe further the effect of MyoD on SelW promoter activity during muscle differentiation, MyoD-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in GM up to ∼100% confluence, switched to DM, and then harvested after 1 day of culture. SelW firefly luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with a Junior LB 9509 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modification. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Ten microliters of cell lysates was added to 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent II, followed by measurement of firefly activity for 10 s. Fifty microliters of Stop and Glo reagent was also added to quench firefly activity, after which Renilla activity was measured for 10 s. To control transfection efficiency, firefly activity was normalized to Renilla activity. Each experiment was prepared in triplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three to four separate experiments. MyoD siRNA duplexes against mouse MyoD, designated as siMyoD in this study, were designed and synthesized by Invitrogen (Stealth RNAi). Two target sequences for siMyoD were as follows: siMyoD 1, 5′-GACGACTTCTATGATGATCCGTGTT-3′, siMyoD 2, 5′-CCAATGCGATTTATCAGGTGCTTTG-3′. Stealth RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen) served as a negative control. To determine the most effective target sequence for the two siMyoDs, C2C12 myoblasts cultured in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 50 nm of each siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. After 6 h of transfection, the cells were maintained in GM up to ∼90% confluence and then transferred into DM for 1 day to induce differentiation. The expression levels of MyoD protein and mRNA were analyzed in C2C12 cells by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared from C2C12 myotubes cultured in DM for 1 day. Briefly, C2C12 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 40 min with periodic vortexing, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were used as nuclear extracts for DNA binding assays. Sequences of the oligonucleotide sense strands used in the EMSA are listed in Table 1 (E-box is underlined). To construct radiolabeled probes, oligonucleotides were annealed, end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara), and then purified with MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). A total of 30 μg of nuclear proteins along with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) were incubated in 1× binding buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. After incubation for 20 min, the samples were resolved by 5% nondenaturing PAGE with 0.5× TBE (1× TBE is 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) run at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were developed using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorimager (Fujifilm Corp.). For supershift assays, reaction mixtures were incubated with 5 μg of anti-MyoD prior to the addition of labeled probes. For competition experiments, various amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were added (10-, 50-, and 100-fold excess) to the reaction mixtures before incubation with the labeled probes. For ChIP assay, C3H10T1/2 cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were co-transfected with the expression plasmids HA-MyoD and SelW promoter −973SelW/Luc. Following transfection, the cells were maintained in GM up to ∼100% confluence and then transferred into DM for 1 day, after which ChIP assay was performed. To isolate cross-linked protein-DNA complexes, a ChIP assay kit (Upstate) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modification. Briefly, transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were cross-linked by the direct addition of 1% formaldehyde to the culture medium, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 125 mm glycine. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, collected, and then resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Sonication was then performed to shear 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. Precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) per sample. For input DNA, 1% of the sample was removed prior to immunoprecipitation (IP). Following IP and vigorous washing, reverse cross-linking and DNA purification were performed according to the kit protocol. Immunoprecipitated fragments were analyzed by PCR, and the primers used are presented in Table 1. Using the mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12, we analyzed the expression of SelW during myogenic differentiation. The C2C12 cell line is a well established in vitro model of muscle development. Fig. 1A represents the morphological changes C2C12 cells undergo during differentiation under culture conditions. To induce differentiation, proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were grown up to ∼50% confluence in GM, after which they were maintained in the same medium up to ∼100% confluence (D0). Myogenic differentiation was then induced in confluent cells upon exchange of GM with DM (D1). Multinucleated C2C12 myotubes were observed 3 days after initial differentiation (D3), after which the cells were further cultured for 5 days to obtain full differentiation (D5). At each indicated time point, we measured the expression of SelW mRNA by RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the low level of SelW mRNA in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts increased from D0 and reached a maximum at D1. Thereafter, the level of mRNA expression was maintained with only a slight reduction. The level of SelW protein was also examined by Western blot analysis using polyclonal SelW peptide antibody. The pattern of SelW protein expression was consistent with that of mRNA expression (Fig. 1, D and E). Specificity of the polyclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis using C2C12 cells transfected with wild-type SelW plasmid and Sec mutant SelW-Cys plasmid (data not shown). Myogenic differentiation was monitored by measuring the mRNA and protein expression levels of well known muscle-specific markers such as MyoD, p21, myogenin, and MyHC. Phosphohistone H3 (Pho-H3), a cell proliferation marker, was detected in C2C12 myoblasts cultured in GM, but its expression disappeared at D0. Therefore, confluent C2C12 cells at D0 had already begun the process of cell cycle arrest and differentiation. It is known that the expression of TrxR1 mRNA decreases upon the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes (30Catani M.V. Savini I. Duranti G. Caporossi D. Ceci R. Sabatini S. Avigliano L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1024-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed that the mRNA and protein expression of TrxR1 slightly and gradually reduced during the differentiation process (Fig. 1, B and D). The expression of SelW mRNA was further analyzed quantitatively by real time PCR (Fig. 1C). Similar to the results obtained by RT-PCR, the expression of SelW mRNA was rapidly elevated at the early stage of differentiation, after which it was maintained at a constant level. Taken together, SelW was expressed both in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and differentiating C2C12 myotubes, although it was specifically up-regulated at the early stage of differentiation and thereafter constantly maintained. These results allow us to speculate that the up-regulation of SelW expression in the early stage of C2C12 cell differentiation may have been due to transcriptional activation of SelW early in myogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2003290963,"The mechanism underlying the interaction of the Escherichia coli signal recognition particle receptor FtsY with the cytoplasmic membrane has been studied in detail. Recently, we proposed that FtsY requires functional interaction with inner membrane lipids at a late stage of the signal recognition particle pathway. In addition, an essential lipid-binding α-helix was identified in FtsY of various origins. Theoretical considerations and in vitro studies have suggested that it interacts with acidic lipids, but this notion is not yet fully supported by in vivo experimental evidence. Here, we present an unbiased genetic clue, obtained by serendipity, supporting the involvement of acidic lipids. Utilizing a dominant negative mutant of FtsY (termed NG), which is defective in its functional interaction with lipids, we screened for E. coli genes that suppress the negative dominant phenotype. In addition to several unrelated phenotype-suppressor genes, we identified pgsA, which encodes the enzyme phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (PgsA). PgsA is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the committed step to acidic phospholipid synthesis, and we show that its overexpression increases the contents of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol. Remarkably, expression of PgsA also stabilizes NG and restores its biological function. Collectively, our results strongly support the notion that FtsY functionally interacts with acidic lipids.

In addition to convincing evidence for FtsY-membrane protein interaction(s), other studies demonstrated unequivocally that the receptor also interacts with lipids (9Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol.

Through the following in vivo studies, we obtained genetic evidence that lends support to this notion. Antibodies to FtsY were described previously (6Herskovits A.A. Shimoni E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). India HisProbe-horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Pierce. Arabinose and isopropyl β-thiogalactoside (IPTG) were purchased from Sigma. n-Dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside was from Anatrace. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were from Qiagen. E. coli Top10 (Invitrogen) was used for the propagation and preparation of various plasmid constructs as well as screening for genes suppressing the NG effect. E. coli K12 BW25113 (Δ(araD-araB)567, ΔlacZ4787(::rrnB-3), λ−, rph-1, Δ(rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514) and Top10 were used for in vivo suppression assays. For complementation assays, we used E. coli IY28 (BW25113-Kan-araCFUP-FtsY), in which the endogenous promoter of FtsY was replaced by the arabinose promoter. 4I. Yosef and E. Bibi, unpublished data. E. coli MG1655 was used for the construction of genomic library. The PgsA mutant T60P and insertion of a 6-histidine (His6) tag into PgsA were constructed by PCR. Genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 was partially digested with Sau3AI. Following size selection (2–4 kb), the digested DNA was ligated into BamHI-digested plasmids pCV3 or pT7-5. E. coli Top10 harboring either pT7-5-tacP-NG or pCV3-araP-NG was transformed with the genomic library and plated on LB plates containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml), in the absence (as a control) or presence of a lethal concentration of the NG inducer (0.1 mm IPTG or 0.5% arabinose). Viable colonies from plates with the NG inducer were further analyzed. For growth experiments with NG and FtsY, cells were co-transformed with the compatible plasmids pCV3-araP-NG and pT7-5-tacP-FtsY. For growth experiments with NG and PgsA and for purification of NG, cells were co-transformed with pT75-tacP-NG and either pCV3, pCV3-pgsA (+tRNAs, see under “Results”), or pCV3-pgsA(T60P)(+tRNAs). For growth experiments with NG and PgsA cloned under the regulation of the lac promoter (lacP His6-pgsA) (Aska clone JW1897) (17Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), cells were co-transformed with pCV3-araP-NG and either pCA24N or pCA24N-His6-pgsA. Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium and supplemented with either ampicillin (200 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Cells were diluted to A600 0.015 induced at A600 0.03 with either 0.2–0.5 mm IPTG or 1% arabinose. Cultures were then grown for 5 or 2 h for protein expression or purification studies, respectively. For FtsY complementation experiments in broth, cells harboring pT7-5-tacP-NG and either pCV3 or pCV3-pgsA(+tRNAs) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB, supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), and arabinose (0.2%), the inducer of the chromosomal ftsY. Cells were washed four times and diluted in LB broth to A600 0.0005 without arabinose, with or without IPTG (10 μm) and grown for 10 h. Harvested cultures were washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in the same buffer. The cell suspensions were sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g). Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (45 min at 150,000 × g) and resuspended in the same buffer. The supernatant was also collected and used for analysis of soluble proteins. Cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl (buffer S), supplemented with 8% sucrose and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g). Membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation (45 min at 150,000 × g). Membranes were solubilized by 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside in buffer S, and insoluble materials were removed by ultracentrifugation. For the purification of membrane-bound NG, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside was added to all the buffers. Cytosolic proteins and solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads in buffer S supplemented with 5 mm imidazole for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. The beads were washed once with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl (buffer B) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole and two more times with 10 column volumes of buffer B supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted using 1 column volume of buffer S containing 150 mm imidazole. Flotation experiments were performed as described previously (14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified NG and NG+1 proteins (20 μg) were incubated with large unilamellar vesicles of different composition in assay buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. Details of the individual lipid composition are given in the legend to Fig. 6D. To analyze changes in the content of various phospholipids, cells were grown in LB medium containing 1 μCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid for 3 h at 37 °C. For pCA24N (empty vector) and pCA24N-His6-PgsA, 50 μm IPTG was included in the incubation media. The cultures (25 ml) were harvested by a 15-min centrifugation at 5000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS, after which 2 ml of methanol and 1 ml of chloroform were added with thorough mixing. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, PBS and chloroform (1 ml each) were added and mixed thoroughly. Following a brief, low speed centrifugation, the resulting chloroform phase was analyzed by thin layer chromatography with Silica Gel 60 (20 × 20 cm) (Merck), utilizing chloroform, methanol, water, 25% NH4OH (120:75:5.6:2.4, v/v) as the developing solvent. Phospholipids were identified on the chromatogram by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA7000), and the resulting bands were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov). Phospholipid identities were confirmed by comparison with known reference lipids: dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), and tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL) (Avanti Polar Lipids), which were visualized by 20% phosphomolybdic acid solution. Purified NG proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and sequenced by Protein Sequencer Procise 491 (Applied Biosystems). Membrane or cytosolic fractions (10–15 μg of protein) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with rabbit anti-FtsY antibodies or HisProbe-HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies. Previous studies have shown that the biological activity of E. coli FtsY is mediated through its C-terminal domain (termed NG+1) (18Eitan A. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When NG+1 is truncated by one amino acid in its N terminus (NG), it loses activity and becomes highly toxic upon overexpression (13Bahari L. Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bochkareva E.S. Sinning I. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32168-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 5A. M. Zelazny and E. Bibi, unpublished data. To test the possibility that NG confers a dominant negative effect, we co-expressed wild-type FtsY and NG. The results show that FtsY expression in trans relieves the toxicity of NG (Fig. 1), suggesting that the nonfunctional NG mutant might compete with the wild-type receptor for binding to an unknown site. To search for proteins that functionally interact with NG (and FtsY), we utilized a genetic screen that is based on NG toxicity. Briefly, we anticipated that overexpression of any protein that interacts with NG might dilute the amount of free NG and thus relieve its toxicity. E. coli harboring a plasmid encoding NG under a strong promoter (either tacP or araP) was transformed with a chromosomal library, and the transformants were plated on LB agar containing the NG inducer, IPTG, or arabinose. In the absence of phenotype suppressors, no colonies were formed under conditions of IPTG induction (Fig. 1). In contrast, in plates with the library-transformed cells, several colonies appeared under these conditions. Following re-evaluation of the results by plasmid preparation and retransformation, the positive clones were sequenced, and the results are shown in Table 1. Not surprisingly, clones harboring putative sugar efflux transporters were identified. Although this assumption was not fully validated by deletion analysis, it is plausible that these transporters would rescue the cells by extruding the NG inducer IPTG, which is a sugar analog (e.g. 19Bohn C. Bouloc P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6072-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or arabinose. In sharp distinction to the efflux transporters that one would have expected to identify, the fourth suppressor clone was both surprising and potentially relevant and informative. This clone harbored the pgsA gene, which encodes the enzyme phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (PgsA) (Fig. 2A, GS100-3). PgsA is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of acidic phospholipids (20Gopalakrishnan A.S. Chen Y.C. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of PgsA and consequently of acidic lipids in recruiting and regulating the activity of peripheral membrane enzymes has been investigated extensively by Dowhan and co-workers (20Gopalakrishnan A.S.

B, plasmids harboring the deletion constructs shown in A, containing 6 histidine tags at the C terminus of PgsA, were transformed into E. coli Top10/pT7-5-tacP-NG and examined for their ability to suppress the NG toxicity. C, overnight cultures of cells co-expressing NG and either plain vector (NG) or PgsA (NG+pgsA(+tRNAs)) were diluted and grown in LB broth. At A600 (OD600) of 0.03, the cultures were induced with 0.2 mm IPTG and grown for additional 5 h. Growth was followed by measuring the optical density of the cultures. D, Aska clone JW1897 (25Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31020-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) harboring the His6-pgsA gene under the lac promoter (lacP) (without the tRNAs operon) was transformed into E. coli Top10/pCV-5-araP-NG and plated on LB agar plates with 0.5% arabinose and without IPTG, the PgsA inducer. E, E. coli cells co-expressing NG and either plain vector (vec), PgsA-His6, PgsA-His6 (+tRNAs), or lacP-His6-PgsA (Aska clone JW1897) were grown in LB broth. Membrane fractions were isolated, and protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting using India HisProbe-HRP (for His6-tagged PgsA identification). His6-PgsA expressed under the regulation of lacP is larger than PgsA-His6 expressed under its endogenous promoter due to addition of 15 amino acids derived from insertion of SfiI restriction sites (25Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31020-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in anionic phospholipids in cells overexpressing PgsA raised the possibility that the NG toxicity is alleviated by an excess of acidic lipids. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, induction of NG expression alone abolished growth, whereas cells co-expressing NG and various constructs harboring pgsA grew relatively well. It is interesting that cells tolerated PgsA expression only when the pgsA gene was followed by the flanking 3′ region (Fig. 2, pCV3-pgsA(+tRNAs)). A similar observation was made in the past where cells tolerated plasmid-borne pgsA only with an unrelated insert at its 3′ end that differs from the tRNAs sequences found here (20Gopalakrishnan A.S. Chen Y.C. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohta A. Waggoner K. Radominska-Pyrek A. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a nonspecific polar effect of 3′ sequences on the expression of the pgsA gene. To examine further if the 3′ tRNA sequences are functionally essential, we repeated the experiments with a plasmid encoding His6-PgsA under the regulation of the lac promoter (lacP) (lacP His6-PgsA) (Aska clone JW1897) (17Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This clone does not contain the 3′ tRNA region. Fig. 2D shows that NG-overexpressing cells that simultaneously express His6-PgsA under the regulation of lacP did restore growth, although not as well as the chromosomal clone (compare the right plates in Fig. 2, B and D). To investigate why the expression of His6-PgsA from the lac promoter seems to impose toxicity (Fig. 2D, right plate) we examined the PgsA expression level in cells transformed with plasmids encoding either of the three tested constructs as follows: PgsA-His6 under its endogenous promoter, with and without the flanking tRNAs 3′ region, and PgsA-His6 under the lac promoter (Fig. 2E). The results suggest that only moderate expression of PgsA (from pgsA-His6+tRNAs) can fully restore the NG toxicity, whereas low expression (from pgsA-His6) could not suppress NG toxicity, and very high expression (from lacP His6-pgsA) seems to be toxic, as observed in the past with other PgsA-encoding high copy number plasmids (see below) (23Ohta A. Waggoner K. Radominska-Pyrek A. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the PgsA-His6 protein migrated slowly on the gel (Fig. 2E) because it harbors additional 15 amino acids encoded by the insertion of SfiI restriction sites (17Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that PgsA alone is sufficient for suppressing the NG toxicity. The 3′ gene sequences in our studies (tRNAs) and others (20Gopalakrishnan A.S. Chen Y.C. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohta A. Waggoner K. Radominska-Pyrek A. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) probably affect the level of expression by an uncharacterized mechanism (such as mRNA stability or translation regulation). For consistency, we used the PgsA clone with the flanking 3′ tRNAs region throughout most of the experiments. Of special relevance to our studies are previous reports on the importance of acidic lipids that participate in the regulation of pathways that involve peripheral membrane proteins such as MinD (16Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It was shown that overexpression of PgsA alters cellular phospholipid composition, as manifested by an increase of about 10% in the concentrations of the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (23Ohta A. Waggoner K. Radominska-Pyrek A. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31020-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To verify that overexpression of PgsA indeed increased the concentration of acidic phospholipids in our expression systems, we examined the phospholipid compositions of E. coli harboring empty vectors or plasmids encoding various PgsA constructs. Fig. 3C clearly shows that all the tested active PgsA constructs increased the amount of acidic phospholipids in the cells compared with cells harboring empty vectors or the inactive mutant PgsA(T60P) (see below). It is likely that the toxicity observed with His6-PgsA (Fig. 2D) is caused by the dramatic increase in the content of anionic phospholipids, in addition to problems associated with PgsA overexpression in cells harboring pCA24N-lacP-His6-pgsA (Fig. 3C). Hence, this construct could only partially restore the growth of NG-overexpressing cells. PgsA may affect the toxic phenotype of NG through its enzymatic activity by elevating the level of acidic lipids (Fig. 3) or by direct or indirect physical interaction with NG. To distinguish between these possibilities, we mutated PgsA and examined how the inactive PgsA mutant (PgsA(T60P)) (26Usui M. Sembongi H. Matsuzaki H. Matsumoto K. Shibuya I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3389-3392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) affects the NG toxicity. As shown in Fig. 4A, cells expressing NG did not grow when co-transformed with a plasmid expressing PgsA(T60P). By utilizing a 6-histidine tag, we confirmed that the mutant is expressed (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the enzymatic activity of PgsA is required for the rescue of NG-expressing cells. Taken together, the results strongly support the notion that NG toxicity can be relieved by increasing the abundance of acidic lipids. How do elevated levels of anionic phospholipids suppress the toxicity of NG? One possible explanation is that acidic lipids bind and sequester NG, leaving a crucial membrane-attachment site free to accommodate the functional wild-type FtsY. Alternatively, it is also possible that an excess of acidic lipids might restore the function of the lipid-binding element at the N terminus of NG and thereby revive its biological activity. To examine the latter, we used cells depleted of FtsY, which co-expressed NG and PgsA. In the absence of FtsY, such cells would grow only if NG functions properly as an SRP receptor. Fig. 5A shows that in the presence of the FtsY inducer (arabinose), all the transformants formed colonies on agar plates. However, in the absence of arabinose, only cells co-expressing NG and PgsA were able to grow. This phenomenon was also observed when cells were grown in liquid media (Fig. 5B). The results indicate that the nonfunctional NG is activated by elevated amounts of anionic phospholipids. What is the mechanism underlying the restoration effect of acidic lipids on NG activity? It was previously shown that the addition of one amino acid to NG at its N terminus abolished its toxicity and restored its function (18Eitan A. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the active mutant (NG+1) (14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) revealed that it has an ordered N terminus that folds as an amphipathic helix. In contrast, the N terminus of NG is disordered (27Montoya G. Svensson C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amphipathic helix of NG+1 was found to be essential for the lipid-stimulated GTPase activity of the receptor in the context of its complex with the SRP (13Bahari L. Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bochkareva E.S. Sinning I. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32168-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the purified NG protein revealed that it is further processed in vivo and consequently lacks its first methionine (Met-195) (14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, the so-called toxic NG protein actually lacks two amino acids at its N terminus compared with NG+1 and is consequently unable to form an amphipathic helix. We hypothesized that if acidic lipids protect the N-terminal Met-195 residue of NG, the protein would be able to partially re-establish the formation of a helix in its N terminus and consequently its biological activity. To test this, NG was expressed alone or in the presence of PgsA and purified from the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified NG proteins were determined. The results of this experiment rule out the suggestion that the NG N terminus is protected by access of acidic lipids because even when NG was expressed in the presence of PgsA, it lacks Met-195, indicating that Met-195 processing was not prevented by anionic phospholipids (data not shown). During our studies, we noted that NG is usually better expressed in cells co-expressing PgsA (Fig. 6A). Similarly, previous studies showed that when expressed under identical conditions, the amount of NG was substantially lower than that of the active mutant NG+1, suggesting that, in addition to its functional role, the N-terminal helix of NG+1 may also have a stabilizing effect. To test the possibility that an excess of acidic lipids (in cells expressing PgsA) stabilizes NG, we performed the following experiment. E. coli cultures harboring plasmid-borne NG, alone or together with a constitutively expressed PgsA, were induced for NG expression, rinsed several times to remove the inducer, and grown again. Samples were taken at different time points, and cells were fractionated. Fig. 6, B and C, shows that the level of NG fell in time when expressed alone. However, when NG was co-expressed with PgsA, its amount remained constant throughout the experiment. Importantly, in the absence of PgsA, NG is unable to complement FtsY-depletion even when highly induced. 6E. Erez and E. Bibi, unpublished data. Because in the presence of PgsA, the amount of NG at the membrane remained constant, we tested the ability of NG and NG+1 to associate with membranes containing different amounts of anionic phospholipids in an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 6D, upper panel) (14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The association of NG with large unilamellar vesicles increases with increasing amounts of phosphatidylglycerol. Interaction was not observed with zwitterionic phospholipids. Therefore, our data support a crucial role of anionic phospholipids in functional membrane localization of NG. Importantly, when NG+1 containing an intact lipid-binding α-helix was tested in this experiment (Fig. 6D, lower panel), the efficiency of lipid association was significantly higher, as described previously (14Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results presented here imply that anionic phospholipid-enriched membranes can induce structural changes in NG that not only restore its biological function at the membrane but also stabilize the protein. In light of these results, it is surprising that pgsA null mutants of E. coli are viable in the absence of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (28Shiba Y. Yokoyama Y. Aono Y. Kiuchi T. Kusaka J. Matsumoto K. Hara H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6526-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, offered a likely explanation as they showed that other acidic species accumulate in membranes of pgsA-deleted cells (29Kikuchi S. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Mileykovskaya E. Ryan A.C. Mo X. Lin C.C. Khalaf K.I. Dowhan W. Garrett T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2990-3000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations indirectly suggest that the functional interaction of FtsY with acidic lipids is probably not specific for a certain lipid. In summary, our studies offer strong genetic support for the notion that acidic lipids play a crucial role in the function of the E. coli SRP receptor in vivo, probably at a defined step during the SRP pathway that requires GTP hydrolysis by the SR-SRP complex, when ribosomes translating membrane proteins should be transferred to and assembled on the translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2026332325,"Myeloperoxidase-derived HOCl targets tissue- and lipoprotein-associated plasmalogens to generate α-chlorinated fatty aldehydes, including 2-chlorohexadecanal. Under physiological conditions, 2-chlorohexadecanal is oxidized to 2-chlorohexadecanoic acid (2-ClHA). This study demonstrates the catabolism of 2-ClHA by ω-oxidation and subsequent β-oxidation from the ω-end. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that 2-ClHA is ω-oxidized in the presence of liver microsomes with initial ω-hydroxylation of 2-ClHA. Subsequent oxidation steps were examined in a human hepatocellular cell line (HepG2). Three different α-chlorinated dicarboxylic acids, 2-chlorohexadecane-(1,16)-dioic acid, 2-chlorotetradecane-(1,14)-dioic acid, and 2-chloroadipic acid (2-ClAdA), were identified. Levels of 2-chlorohexadecane-(1,16)-dioic acid, 2-chlorotetradecane-(1,14)-dioic acid, and 2-ClAdA produced by HepG2 cells were dependent on the concentration of 2-ClHA and the incubation time. Synthetic stable isotope-labeled 2-ClHA was used to demonstrate a precursor-product relationship between 2-ClHA and the α-chlorinated dicarboxylic acids. We also report the identification of endogenous 2-ClAdA in human and rat urine and elevations in stable isotope-labeled urinary 2-ClAdA in rats subjected to intraperitoneal administration of stable isotope-labeled 2-ClHA. Furthermore, urinary 2-ClAdA and plasma 2-ClHA levels are increased in LPS-treated rats. Taken together, these data show that 2-ClHA is ω-oxidized to generate α-chlorinated dicarboxylic acids, which include α-chloroadipic acid that is excreted in the urine."

To characterize the receptor domains involved in this function, we analyzed a panel of TRβ1 mutants for their ability to interfere with ras-driven cyclin D1 activation, formation of transformation foci and tumor growth in nude mice. Our results show that the domains and mechanisms responsible for the anti-transforming and anti-tumorigenic actions of the receptor are divergent from those operating in classical T3-dependent transcriptional activation. TRβ1 mutants that do not bind coactivators and do not transactivate retained the capacity of suppressing cellular transformation and tumor growth, whereas selective mutations in the hinge region affecting corepressors recruitment abolished these actions, while preserving ligand-dependent transcription. There was a strict parallelism between anti-transforming activity of the various mutants and their ability to antagonize cyclin D1 stimulation by ras, indicating that transrepression mechanisms may have an important function in suppression of the transforming effects of the oncogene by TRβ1. The inhibitory action of T3 on transformation was further enhanced after over-expression of corepressors, while corepressor depletion by means of small-interference RNA reversed significantly hormonal action. This shows an important functional role of endogenous corepressors in suppression of ras-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis by TRβ1"

IntroductionMoorella thermoacetica is a strictly anaerobic Gram-positive acetogenic bacterium. Acetogens are commonly found in the soil, animal gastrointestinal tract, and the rumen and grow heterotrophically or autotrophically on many different electron donors. Electrons from these substrates are used to reduce CO2 to acetate by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. During growth by this pathway, acetate and cell mass are the only growth products, and electron-rich growth substrates like glucose are converted stoichiometrically to acetate; therefore, M. thermoacetica is called a homoacetogen. M. thermoacetica can use other electron acceptors (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, thiosulfate, and dimethyl sulfoxide). Under most conditions, nitrate reduction occurs preferentially to CO2 reduction, and nitrate has been shown to repress autotrophic growth (1Fröstl J.M. Seifritz C. Drake H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4597-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Arendsen A.F. Soliman M.Q. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, oxalate is unique in its properties as an electron donor by M. thermoacetica for acetogenic growth. When both nitrate and CO2 are provided to cells growing on oxalate, CO2 is reduced to acetate during exponential growth phase, and nitrate is only used as the electron acceptor during stationary phase (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oxalate is the only substrate with which M. thermoacetica has been shown to reduce CO2 instead of nitrate when both are present.Oxalate (C2O42−) is the most oxidized two-carbon compound. It is made in high concentrations by some plants and fungi and can reach high micromolar concentrations in soil (4Strobel B.W. Geoderma. 2001; 99: 169-198Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Oxalate is toxic to mammals but is metabolized by many bacteria and plants by various pathways. In Oxalobacter formigenes, oxalate is first activated to oxalyl-CoA and then decarboxylated, giving formyl-CoA and CO2. Formyl-CoA transferase then exchanges the formyl group for an oxalyl-group on CoA, thus producing formate and regenerating oxalyl-CoA. Energy for growth on oxalate in O. formigenes results from a formate-oxalate antiporter, which generates an electrochemical transmembrane gradient for ATP synthesis (5Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so most formate produced is excreted rather than oxidized (7Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Other organisms, such as Cupriavidus oxalaticus, also use oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase to metabolize oxalate but use formate dehydrogenase to generate NADH with the electrons derived from oxalate (8Quayle J.R. Keech D.B. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase is a TPP-dependent enzyme with distant homology to yeast pyruvate decarboxylases (10Costelloe S.J. Ward J.M. Dalby P.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 66: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The M. thermoacetica genome has sequences with low homology to oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase but no homolog of formyl-CoA transferase. In fungi and in some bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, oxalate can also be metabolized by oxalate decarboxylase, a manganese-containing cupin family protein, to generate formate and CO2 (11Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This reaction requires O2. Another Mn2+-cupin called germin that is found in plants catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of oxalate in the reaction C2O42− + 2H+ + O2 → 2CO2 + H2O2 (12Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). No enzyme that catalyzes anaerobic oxalate oxidation has been reported previously.This paper describes the characterization of the oxalate-induced enzyme, oxalate oxidoreductase (OOR) 2The abbreviations used are: OORoxalate oxidoreductaseOFOR2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductaseFdferredoxinPFORpyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductaseCODHCO dehydrogenaseTPPthiamine pyrophosphateACSacetyl-CoA synthaseBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and demonstrates that it, unlike all previously characterized members of the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase family, does not require coenzyme A. Coupling OOR to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway allows anaerobic bacteria to generate energy by converting oxalate to acetyl-CoA.DISCUSSIONOxalate is an important metabolite that is produced in the soil and in the animal gastrointestinal tract, with elevated levels causing kidney stones. Many bacteria that use oxalate as an energy source also use oxalate as a carbon source by reduction to glyoxylate, which is incorporated into the central metabolite 3-phosphoglycerate (39Cornick N.A. Allison M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3011-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cornick N.A. Yan B. Bank S. Allison M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 1219-1224Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but enzymes involved in glyoxylate incorporation have not been detected in oxalate-grown cultures of M. thermoacetica (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 170: 399-405Crossref Google Scholar). We have shown that M. thermoacetica metabolizes oxalate very simply by a novel CoA-independent OFOR that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of oxalate to 2 mol of CO2, coupled to the reduction of ferredoxin (or other electron acceptors). The apparent reaction is C2O42− + Fdox ↔ 2 CO2 + Fdredi, 3The ferredoxin that we have used with OOR is an 8-Fe ferredoxin that contains two [Fe4S4] clusters and accepts two electrons. although we have not yet shown whether CO2 or bicarbonate is the product that is released from OOR. Our results are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that incorporation of oxalate into cell material requires conversion to CO2 (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, M. thermoacetica can grow on oxalate even in CO2-free medium; however, when cells are grown on oxalate and CO2, very little radioactivity from 14C-oxalate is incorporated into biomass (14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, OOR enables growth on oxalate by linking the production of CO2 and reducing equivalents to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of autotrophic anaerobic acetyl-CoA formation (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Oxalate induces the expression of three proteins (36, 43, and 32 kDa) in M. thermoacetica that can be resolved by two-dimensional PAGE. Earlier studies described the induction of two protein bands (one of the bands apparently was not resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE) when M. thermoacetica was grown on oxalate, relative to growth on CO, formate, or glyoxylate (14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genome-enabled mass spectrometric results reveal that the oxalate-induced proteins belong to the OFOR family and are encoded within an operon that includes a homolog of O. formigenes oxalate-formate antiporter, a permease and a gene encoding a transcriptional regulatory protein, for which we propose the name OorR. OorR contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and is likely to regulate expression of OOR and coordinate its expression with expression of the enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Oxalate is a unique substrate for M. thermoacetica, which uses nitrate instead of CO2 as an electron acceptor when grown on other multiple-carbon growth substrates in the presence of nitrate and CO2. However, CO2 is used preferentially over nitrate when it is growing on oxalate (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nitrate appears to inhibit autotrophic growth by repressing the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway at the transcriptional level (1Fröstl J.M. Seifritz C. Drake H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4597-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Arendsen A.F. Soliman M.Q. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that interactions between oxalate, OorR, and the promoters of the oor and acs operons are able to induce the oor operon and prevent the nitrate-dependent repression of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. M. thermoacetica does not produce formate from oxalate, but acetate, the end product of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, could be exchanged with oxalate by the antiporter.OOR is the first protein shown to catalyze anaerobic oxalate oxidation, unlike previously described anaerobic enzymes that produce CO2 and formyl-CoA (6Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although several features (e.g. Fe4S4 clusters and TPP content) of OOR are similar to other members of the OFOR family, OOR is unique among family members in its lack of requirement for CoA. Fig. 7 shows a proposed mechanism of OOR, based on the results described here and on analogy with conserved features of other OFORs, such as PFOR, whose mechanism has been extensively studied (24Furdui C. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9921-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Pieulle L. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Dole F. Bernadac A. Hatchikian E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Proposed OOR mechanism. Oxalate binds to OOR (step 1) and undergoes nucleophilic attack by the TPP ylide (step 2), generating oxalyl-TPP, which could be stabilized by protonation from a general base (step 3). Decarboxylation (step 4) leaves an anionic intermediate that would release two electrons to the [Fe4S4] clusters (step 5). The carboxyl-TPP that remains could be decarboxylated to release a second CO2 molecule (step 6) or hydrolyzed to release bicarbonate (not shown), regenerating the starting form of the enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Steps 1 and 2: Binding of TPP, Mg2+, and OxalateThe early steps of the reaction would resemble those of all TPP-dependent enzymes, reviewed recently (43Ragsdale S.W. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2333-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After binding oxalate (step 1), step 2 of the proposed OOR mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of the anionic ylide of OOR-bound TPP on oxalate to generate an oxalyl-TPP adduct. The purified OOR contains Mg2+ and TPP, which were added during purification because in some OFORs, like PFOR from M. thermoacetica, TPP dissociates rather easily, resulting in loss of activity in buffer lacking TPP. However, TPP remains tightly bound to OOR even after extensive buffer exchange and over several months' storage. Based on sequence homology between OOR and the D. africanus PFOR, whose structure is known (25Chabrière E. Charon M.H. Volbeda A. Pieulle L. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we find that most of the key residues in PFOR that are involved in binding and activating TPP to generate the deprotonated ylide are conserved in OOR. These include β subunit residues Cys130 and Asn143 (Cys840 and Asn996 in D. africanus PFOR), which interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP. Conserved residues that interact with the Mg2+ ion include a G109DGX32N motif (G962DGX32N in PFOR). Another key conserved residue is Asp59 (Asp64 in PFOR), which interacts with the N1′ pyrimidine group of TPP and plays a key role in deprotonation of the C-2 of the thiazole ring to generate the active ylide. Conserved residue Asn996 in PFOR (Asn143) forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with the thiazolium sulfur of TPP, and a large hydrophobic residue, Phe869 of PFOR (Ile159 in the β subunit of OOR), interacts with TPP to promote formation of a V-conformation between the pyrimidine and thiazolium ring, which is conserved in all TPP-dependent enzymes so far studied. Different residues can stabilize the V-conformation in TPP-dependent enzymes; Ile is also found in this position in pyruvate decarboxylase (44Guo F. Zhang D. Kahyaoglu A. Farid R.S. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13379-13391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Met and Leu are found in pyruvate oxidase and transketolase, and other OFOR enzymes have His and Tyr.Of the 2-oxoacid substrates we tested, oxalate was oxidized most quickly. Furthermore, the low Km for oxalate (∼60 μm) and the fact that the enzyme is induced in the presence of oxalate are consistent with oxalate being the physiological substrate for the enzyme. Although OOR can oxidize glyoxylate, the enzyme is not induced in cells grown on glyoxylate (14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we think it unlikely that OOR would be involved in glyoxylate metabolism in M. thermoacetica. OOR contains conserved residues that interact with the carboxyl and carbonyl groups of pyruvate in PFOR but contains substitutions that we propose are important for binding the carboxyl group of oxalate that replaces the acetyl group of pyruvate.Several residues involved in pyruvate binding in PFOR are conserved in OOR, including Arg109 (Arg114 in PFOR, which binds the carboxyl group of pyruvate) and Asn143 (Asn996 in PFOR forms hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of pyruvate). Substitution of the Arg in Sulfolobus tokodaii that corresponds to Arg114 abolished activity (45Fukuda E. Wakagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, Ile123 and Ile843, which interact with the methyl group of PFOR, are not conserved in OOR. Thr31 in PFOR is a highly conserved residue among the OFORs and is part of a YPITP motif that is important for catalysis. Substitutions of the end residues of this motif in an Aeropyrum pernix OFOR destroy activity, and separate mutations of the three middle residues have varying effects that are in general larger for kcat than for Km, which suggests that the motif is important during reaction turnover (26Fukuda E. Kino H. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5639-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, Thr31 is replaced with Arg31 in the OOR. Inclusion of a second Arg in the active site may help to stabilize the additional negative charge on oxalate. Because Arg in this position is found in only those few sequences in the NCBI protein data base that have high identity to that of OOR, we propose that a YPIRP motif replaces the usual conserved YPITP motif to promote interactions that may be characteristic of OORs.Decarboxylation and Electron TransferIn analogy to the mechanism of PFOR (24Furdui C. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9921-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a general base would be expected to stabilize the negative charge on the oxalyl-TPP intermediate in step 3, followed by decarboxylation of the oxalyl-TPP adduct in step 4 to yield a reactive anionic carboxy-TPP intermediate that, in step 5, would release two electrons into the internal electron transfer pathway consisting of three [Fe4S4]2+/1+ clusters. OOR contains sufficient iron to accommodate these three clusters. In addition, all 12 Cys residues that bind the three clusters of PFOR are conserved in the sequence of OOR. Furthermore, EPR and UV-visible experiments clearly showed that OOR contains three [Fe4S4]2+/1+ and that oxalate can reduce all of these clusters. Because oxalate is a two-electron donor, full reduction of all of the clusters would require 2 mol of oxalate.Because [Fe4S4] clusters accept one electron at a time, there is likely to be a transient intermediate in which one of the clusters is reduced by the anionic carboxy-TPP anion to generate a carboxy-TPP radical (not shown); transient kinetic experiments are under way to test this hypothesis.In this step of the PFOR reaction, binding of CoA accelerates the electron transfer reaction by 105-fold. However, OOR is a unique member of this family in having no requirement for CoA; therefore, step 6 would involve a second decarboxylation to regenerate the active ylide for the next round of catalysis. Although it seems less likely, it is possible that this carboxy-TPP adduct undergoes hydrolysis to release bicarbonate instead of CO2. One of the proposed roles of CoA in PFOR and other OFORs is to generate a highly reducing anionic intermediate that could transfer electrons to the clusters (24Furdui C. Ragsdale S.W.

Perhaps the negative charge on the OOR carboxy-TPP adduct is sufficiently reducing to make CoA unnecessary.In the final steps of the reaction, the two-electron-reduced state of OOR transfers its reducing equivalents from the internal electron transfer wire of [Fe4S4] clusters to an external electron acceptor. Like PFOR, OOR can use a wide range of acceptors and is unable to transfer electrons to pyridine nucleotides. Ferredoxin is one of these and is a likely physiological electron acceptor that could carry electrons to enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The rates were similar among all electron acceptors that were found to work. This suggests that the rate of catalysis is limited by some step other than electron transfer from the enzyme to the acceptor. Interestingly, like PFOR, OOR can transfer electrons directly to CODH to generate CO. This could be a physiologically relevant reaction in vivo because electrons from oxalate are used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and because M. thermoacetica can be cultured on oxalate even in CO2-free medium (14Daniel S.L. Drake H.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3062-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that under CO2-limiting conditions, CO2 as well as electrons could be channeled directly from OOR to CODH. This would be an extremely interesting three-component channeling machine because it is clear that CO is channeled from CODH to ACS (41Doukov T.I. Blasiak L.C. Seravalli J. Ragsdale S.W. Drennan C.L.

IntroductionMoorella thermoacetica is a strictly anaerobic Gram-positive acetogenic bacterium. Acetogens are commonly found in the soil, animal gastrointestinal tract, and the rumen and grow heterotrophically or autotrophically on many different electron donors. Electrons from these substrates are used to reduce CO2 to acetate by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. During growth by this pathway, acetate and cell mass are the only growth products, and electron-rich growth substrates like glucose are converted stoichiometrically to acetate; therefore, M. thermoacetica is called a homoacetogen. M. thermoacetica can use other electron acceptors (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, thiosulfate, and dimethyl sulfoxide). Under most conditions, nitrate reduction occurs preferentially to CO2 reduction, and nitrate has been shown to repress autotrophic growth (1Fröstl J.M. Seifritz C. Drake H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4597-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Arendsen A.F. Soliman M.Q. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, oxalate is unique in its properties as an electron donor by M. thermoacetica for acetogenic growth. When both nitrate and CO2 are provided to cells growing on oxalate, CO2 is reduced to acetate during exponential growth phase, and nitrate is only used as the electron acceptor during stationary phase (3Seifritz C. Fröstl J.M. Drake H.L. Daniel S.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oxalate is the only substrate with which M. thermoacetica has been shown to reduce CO2 instead of nitrate when both are present.Oxalate (C2O42−) is the most oxidized two-carbon compound. It is made in high concentrations by some plants and fungi and can reach high micromolar concentrations in soil (4Strobel B.W. Geoderma. 2001; 99: 169-198Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Oxalate is toxic to mammals but is metabolized by many bacteria and plants by various pathways. In Oxalobacter formigenes, oxalate is first activated to oxalyl-CoA and then decarboxylated, giving formyl-CoA and CO2. Formyl-CoA transferase then exchanges the formyl group for an oxalyl-group on CoA, thus producing formate and regenerating oxalyl-CoA. Energy for growth on oxalate in O. formigenes results from a formate-oxalate antiporter, which generates an electrochemical transmembrane gradient for ATP synthesis (5Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so most formate produced is excreted rather than oxidized (7Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Other organisms, such as Cupriavidus oxalaticus, also use oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase to metabolize oxalate but use formate dehydrogenase to generate NADH with the electrons derived from oxalate (8Quayle J.R. Keech D.B. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase is a TPP-dependent enzyme with distant homology to yeast pyruvate decarboxylases (10Costelloe S.J. Ward J.M. Dalby P.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 66: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The M. thermoacetica genome has sequences with low homology to oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase but no homolog of formyl-CoA transferase. In fungi and in some bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, oxalate can also be metabolized by oxalate decarboxylase, a manganese-containing cupin family protein, to generate formate and CO2 (11Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This reaction requires O2. Another Mn2+-cupin called germin that is found in plants catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of oxalate in the reaction C2O42− + 2H+ + O2 → 2CO2 + H2O2 (12Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). No enzyme that catalyzes anaerobic oxalate oxidation has been reported previously.This paper describes the characterization of the oxalate-induced enzyme, oxalate oxidoreductase (OOR) 2The abbreviations used are: OORoxalate oxidoreductaseOFOR2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductaseFdferredoxinPFORpyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductaseCODHCO dehydrogenaseTPPthiamine pyrophosphateACSacetyl-CoA synthaseBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and demonstrates that it, unlike all previously characterized members of the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase family, does not require coenzyme A. Coupling OOR to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway allows anaerobic bacteria to generate energy by converting oxalate to acetyl-CoA.

https://openalex.org/W2022728491,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is present on the cell surface of endothelial cells, or as a soluble truncated variant. Membrane NRP-1 is proposed to enhance angiogenesis by promoting the formation of a signaling complex between vascular endothelial growth factor-A(165) (VEGF-A(165)), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and heparan sulfate, whereas the soluble NRP-1 is thought to act as an antagonist of signaling complex formation. We have analyzed the angiogenic potential of a chimera comprising the entire extracellular NRP-1 region dimerized through an Fc IgG domain and a monomeric truncated NRP-1 variant. Both NRP-1 proteins stimulated tubular morphogenesis and cell migration in HDMECs and HUVECs. Fc rNRP-1 was able to induce VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and expression of the VEGFR-2 specific target, regulator of calcineurin-1 (RCAN1.4). siRNA mediated gene silencing of VEGFR-2 revealed that VEGFR-2 was required for Fc rNRP-1 mediated activation of the intracellular signaling proteins PLC-γ, AKT, and MAPK and tubular morphogenesis. The stimulatory activity was independent of VEGF-A(165). This was evidenced by depleting the cell culture of exogenous VEGF-A(165), and using instead for routine culture VEGF-A(121), which does not interact with NRP-1, and by the inability of VEGF-A sequestering antibodies to inhibit the angiogenic activity of the NRP proteins. Analysis of angiogenesis over a period of 6 days in an in vitro fibroblast/endothelial co-culture model revealed that Fc rNRP-1 could induce endothelial cell tubular morphogenesis. Thus, we conclude that soluble Fc rNRP-1 is a VEGF-A(165)-independent agonist of VEGFR-2 and stimulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1963702661,"The human SnoN is an oncoprotein that interacts with several transcription-regulatory proteins such as the histone-deacetylase, N-CoR containing co-repressor complex and Smad proteins. This study presents the crystal structure of the Dachshund homology domain of human SnoN. The structure reveals a groove composed of conserved residues with characteristic properties of a protein-interaction surface. A comparison of the 12 monomers in the asymmetric unit reveals the presence of two major conformations: an open conformation with a well accessible groove and a tight conformation with a less accessible groove. The variability in the backbone between the open and the tight conformations matches the differences seen in previously determined structures of individual Dachshund homology domains, suggesting a general plasticity within this fold family. The flexibility observed in the putative protein binding groove may enable SnoN to recognize multiple interaction partners.

https://openalex.org/W2047217591,"The WTX, Wilms tumor-associated tumor-suppressor gene, is present on the X chromosome and a single WTX mutation may be sufficient to promote carcinogenesis. Unlike the WT1 tumor suppressor, a transcription factor, WTX lacks conserved functional protein domains. To study the function of WTX, we constructed inducible cell lines expressing WTX and tumor-associated WTX mutants. Induction of WTX inhibited cell growth and caused G1/G0 arrest. In contrast, a short, tumor-associated truncation mutant of WTX358 only slightly inhibited cell growth without a significant cell-cycle arrest, although expression of a longer truncation mutant WTX565 led to the growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest to a similar extent as wild-type WTX. Like WT1, WTX slowed growth and caused cell-cycle arrest through p21 induction. Gene expression profiling showed that these two tumor-suppressors regulated genes in similar pathways, including those implicated in control of the cellular growth, cell cycle, cell death, cancer and cardiovascular system development. When gene expression changes mediated by wild-type WTX were compared with those affected by mutant forms, WTX565 showed a 55% overlap (228 genes) in differentially regulated genes, whereas WTX358 regulated only two genes affected by wild-type WTX, implying that amino-acid residues 358–561 are critical for WTX function."
https://openalex.org/W1984031173,"The four residues at the amino-terminus of mature Smac/DIABLO are an IAP binding motif (IBM). Upon exit from mitochondria, mature Smac interacts with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), abrogating caspase inhibition. We used the ubiquitin fusion model to express mature Smac in the cytosol. Transiently expressed mature Smac56-239 (called Smac56) and Smac60-239 (called Smac60), which lacks the IBM, interacted with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). However, stable expression produced wild type Smac56 that failed to homodimerize, interact with XIAP, and potentiate caspase activation. Cytosolic Smac60 retained these functions. Cytosolic Smac56 apparently becomes posttranslationally modified at the dimer interface region, which obliterated the epitope for a monoclonal antibody. Cytosolic Smacδ, which has the IBM but lacks amino acids 62–105, homodimerized and weakly interacted with XIAP, but failed to potentiate apoptosis. These findings suggest that the IBM of Smac is a recognition point for a posttranslational modification(s) that blocks homodimerization and IAP interaction, and that amino acids 62–105 are required for the proapoptotic function of Smac."
