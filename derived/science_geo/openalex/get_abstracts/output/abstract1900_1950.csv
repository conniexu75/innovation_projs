https://openalex.org/W1974203601,"Rabbit aortic medial cells were grown on purified elastin membranes, which were then subjected to repeated elongation and relaxation or to agitation without stretching. Cells remained attached to the membranes, and cyclic stretching resulted in a two- to fourfold increase in rates of collagen, hyaluronate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate synthesis over those in agitated or stationary preparations. Synthesis of types I and III collagen was increased to the same degree. Stretching did not increase rates of chondroitin 4-sulfate or dermatan sulfate synthesis. Differences were not attributable to differences in cell number, for DNA synthetic rates were not increased by stretching. The model system devised to demonstrate these effects provides a means for relating various modes of mechanical stimulation to cell metabolism."

Moreover, in animals that have recuperated from the labyrinthine lesion, 3-acetylpyridine produces a reversal of the symptoms within 2 hours of administration. These results indicate that the integrity of the olivo-cerebellar system is necessary for the acquisition and retention of this form of motor learning, but that the cerebellum itself is not the seat of such learning."
https://openalex.org/W1498434056,"Beef heart mitochondrial ATPase (F1) contained 2 mol of ADP and 1 mol of ATP/mol of enzyme, which resisted removal by Sephadex chromatography with dilute buffers or repeated precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The native enzyme also contained two apparently equivalent binding sites, which participated in readily reversible binding of adenyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P), with a Kd of 1.3 mum. The failure of AMP-P(NH)P to compete effectively with ADP for binding sites on F1 may be related to the failure of the analog to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Virtually complete removal of all adenine nucleotides from F1 occurred when the enzyme was chromatographed on columns of Sephadex equilibrated with 50% glycerol. No loss in ATPase activity was observed following removal of nucleotides from the enzyme, which was then capable of binding more than 4 mol of ADP and almost 5 mol of AMP-P(NH)P/mol of protein. Subsequent chromatography on columns of Sephadex equilibrated with dilute buffers containing Mg2+ removed only 1.5 mol of ADP and no AMP-P(NH)P from the enzyme. Reconstitution of F1 with ADP or with almost 5 mol of AMP-P(NH)P resulted in preparations that exhibited an undiminished capacity to restore oxidative phosphorylation in F1-deficient submitochondrial particles."
https://openalex.org/W1504121383,"The passive Ca2+ permeability of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes is 10(4) to 10(61 times greater than that of liposomes prepared from natural or synthetic phospholipids. The contribution of membrane proteins to the Ca2+ permeability was studied by incorporating the purified [Ca2+ + Mg2+]-activated ATPase into bilayer membranes prepared from different phospholipids. The incorporation of the Ca2+ transport ATPase into the lipid phase increased its Ca2+ permeability to levels approaching that of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The permeability change may arise from a reordering of the structure of the lipid phase in the environment of the protein or could represent a specific property of the protein itself. The calcium-binding protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum did not produce a similar effect. The increased rate of Ca2+ release from reconstituted ATPase vesicles is not a carrier-mediated process as indicated by the linear dependence of the Ca2+ efflux upon the gradient of Ca2+ concentration and by the absence of competition and countertransport between Ca2+ and other divalent metal ions. The increased Ca2+ permeability upon incorporation of the transport ATPase into the lipid phase is accompanied by similar increase in the permeability of the vesicles for sucrose, Na+, choline, and SO42- indicating that the transport ATPase does not act as a specific Ca2+ channel. Native sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes are asymmetric structures and the 75-A particles seen by freeze-etch electron microscopy are located primarily in the outer fracture face. In reconstituted ATPase vesicles the distribution of the particles between the two fracture faces is even, indicating that complete structural reconstitution was not achieved. The Ca2+ transport activity of reconstituted ATPase vesicles is also much less than that of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum. The density of the 40-A surface particles visible after negative staining of native or reconstituted vesicles is greater than that of the intramembranous particles and the relationship between these two structures remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1595820999,"Ca2+ binding sites located on the Ca2+-dependent ATPase purified from the fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ikemoto, N (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 649) have been further studied. At 0 degrees there are three classes of binding sites denoted as alpha (K congruent to 3 times 10(61 M-1), beta(K congruent to 5 times 10(4) M-1), and gamma (K congruent to 1 times 10(3) M-1) sites. At 22 degrees there is no beta site but there are about two alpha sites per 10(5) daltons, while at 0 degrees there is one alpha and one beta site. The change is reversible. The parallelism between the temperature-induced changes in the alpha site and the reported (Sumida, M., and Tonomura, Y. (1974) J. Biochem. 75, 283) temperature dependence of the ratio of Ca2+ transport and ATP cleavage (deltaCa2+/deltaATP is 2 at 22 degrees and 1 at 0 degrees) suggests the involvement of the alpha site in transport. Studies at a low ATP to enzyme ratio (0.5 to 2.5 mol of ATP/10(5) g of ATPase unit) permitting the separate investigation of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation process show that concomitantly with the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme (E approximately P) bound calcium is released from, and concomitantly with the dephosphorylation it is rebound to, the alpha site. Binding of Ca2+ to the E approximately P moiety inhibits the liberation of Pi. Analysis by use of a Hill plot of the Ca2+ dependence of the inhibition suggests the involvement of two sites with an average affinity of approximately 10(3) M-1. These have tentatively been identified as alpha (low affinity form) and gamma sites."
https://openalex.org/W1583567125,"Sodium and potassium ion-activated adenosine triphosphatase is the enzyme responsible for the active transport of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. Strophanthidin, from the external surface of the membrane, and an antibody, from the cytoplasmic surface, bind simultaneously to the large polypeptide subunit of the enzyme. These results demonstrate that this polypeptide chain must span the plasma membrane, having different surfaces exposed on each side. When (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is incubated in the presence of cupric phenanthroline, a reagent which catalyzes the oxidation of cysteine residues to form intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds, a covalent dimer of the larger chains is formed. Several characteristics of this dimerization reaction are consistent with the proposal that at least a noncovalent dimer of large chains exists in the native enzyme. These conclusions are discussed in the context of a specific description for the molecular mechanism of active transport."
https://openalex.org/W1537939456,"Mitochondrial ATPases from rat liver and beef heart were used to study the effects of guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) and adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P) on the kinetics of MgATP, MgITP, and MgGTP hydrolysis. AMP-P(NH)P was a noncompetitive inhibitor of hydrolysis of all substrates with the rat liver enzyme, whether activating anions were present or not. Also with the liver enzyme, AMP-P(NH)P caused only MgATP hydrolysis to appear to have positive cooperativity. With the beef heart enzyme, AMP-P(NH)P was a competitive inhibitor of ATPase activity and caused positive cooperativity; it gave noncompetitive patterns with GTP or ITP as substrates. In both enzyme systems, GMP-P(NH)P gave complex inhibition patterns with MgATP as the substrate, but was a competitive inhibitor of MgITP and MgGTP hydrolysis. These results are interpreted as indicating the existence of two types of nucleotide binding sites, with varying degrees of specificity and interaction on the ATPase molecules from both sources. It is postulated that MgATP and AMP-P(NH)P bind to regulatory site while MgATP, MgGTP, Mgitp, and GMP-P(NH)P bind to the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1499131945,"Exposure of sarcoplasmic reticulum to trypsin in the presence of 1 M sucrose results in degradation of the Mr = 102,000 ATPase enzyme to two fragments of Mr = 55,000 and 45,000 with subsequent appearance of fragments of Mr = 30,000 and 20,000. These fragments were purified by column chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Antibodies were raised against the ATPase and the Mr = 55,000, 45,000, and 20,000 fragments. There was no antigenic cross-reactivity between the Mr = 55,000 and 45,000 fragments, indicating that they were derived from a single linear cleavage of the larger enzyme. There was antigenic cross-reactivity between the Mr = 20,000 and 55,000 fragments, indicating an origin of the Mr = 20,000 fragment in the Mr = 55,000 fragment. None of the antibodies inhibited (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent ATPase or Ca2+ transport. The Mr = 20,000 fragment and the Mr = 55,000 fragment were active in Ca2+ ionophore assays. The active site of ATP hydrolysis was labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP and the site of ATP binding was labeled with tritiated N-ethylmaleimide. In both cases radioactivity was found in the intact ATPase and in the Mr = 55,000 and 30,000 fragments, indicating that the Mr = 30,000 fragment was also derived from the Mr = 55,000 fragment. Amino acid composition data showed that the Mr = 45,000 fragment contained about 60% nonpolar and 40% polar amino acids, while the Mr = 55,000 fragment and the Mr = 20,0000 fragment contained about equal amounts of polar and nonpolar amino acids. Studies of the reaction of various antibodies at the external surface of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles showed that the ATPase was exposed, whereas calsequestrin and the high affinity Ca2+-binding protein were not. The use of antibodies against the various fragments indicated that the Mr = 55,000 fragment was in large part exposed, whereas the Mr = 20,000 and the 45,000 fragments were only poorly exposed. It is probable that the site of ATP hydrolysis in the Mr = 55,000 fragment is external, whereas the ionophore site is only partially exposed and the Mr = 45,000 fragment is largely buried within the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1495836825,"Vesicles containing a purified shark rectal gland (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase-(NaK ATPase) were prepared by dialyzing for 2 days egg lecithin, cholate, and the NaK ATPase purified from the rectal gland of Squalus acanthias. These vesicles were capable of both Na+ and K+ transport. Studies of K+ transport were made by measuring the ATP-stimulated transport outward of 42K+ or 86Rb+. Vesicles were preloaded with isotope by equilibration at 4 degrees for 1 to 3 days. Transport of 42K+ or 86Rb+ was initiated by addition of MgATP to the vesicles. The ATP-dependent exit of either isotope was the same. Experiments are presented which show that this loss of isotope was not due to changes in ion binding but rather due to a loss in the amount of ion trapped in the vesicular volume. The transport of K+ was dependent on external Mg2+. CTP was almost as effective as ATP in stimulating K+ transport, while UTP was relatively ineffective. These effects of nucleotides parallel their effects on Na+ accumulation and their effectiveness as substrates for the enzyme. Potassium transport was inhibited by ouabain and required the presence of Na+. The following asymmetries were seen: (a) addition of external Mg2+ supported K+ transport; (b) ouabain inhibited K+ transport only if it was present inside the vesicles; (c) addition of external Na+ to the vesicles stimulated K+ transport. External Li+ was ineffective as a Na+ substitute. The specific requirement of external Na+ for K+ transport indicates that K+ exit is coupled to Na+ entry. Changes in the internal vesicular ion concentrations were studied with vesicles prepared in 20 mM NaCl and 50 mM KCl. After 1 hour of transport at 25 degrees, a typical Na+ concentration in the vesicles in the presence of ATP was 72 mM. A typical K+ concentration in the vesicles was 10 mM as measured with 42K+ or 6 mM as measured with 86Rb+. The following relationships have been calculated for Na+ transport, K+ transport and ATP hydrolysis: Na+/ATP = 1.42, K+/ATP =1.04, and Na+/K+ = 1.43. The ratio of 2.8 Na+ transported in to 2 K+ transported out is very close to the value reported for the red cell membrane. Potassium-potassium exchange similar to that observed in the red cell membrane and attributed to the Na+-K+ pump (stimulated by ATP and orthophosphate and inhibited by ouabain) was observed when vesicles were prepared in the absence of Na+. The results reported in this paper prove that the shark rectal gland NaK ATPase, which is 90 to 95% pure, is the isolated pump for the coupled transports of Na+ and K+."
https://openalex.org/W1600849029,"The protein encoded by the gam gene of bacteriophage lambda (gamma protein) is a specific inhibitor of the recBC enzyme of Escherichia coli. The lambda protein has been purified approximately 2,000-fold, and its structure and inhibitory activity have been characterized. It appears to be composed of two identical subunits of 16,500 daltons, inhibits all of the catalytic activities of the recBC enzyme with apparently equal efficiency, but has no effect upon any other E. coli or lambda-DNase tested. Inhibition does not occur unless recBC enzyme is exposed to gamma protein prior to reaction of the enzyme with DNA. The inhibitory activity is independent of temperature, and no catalytic activity has been detected that might fulfill the inhibitory function. It appears instead that the inhibition involves a stoichiometric, rather than a catalytic interaction between gamma protein and the enzyme. Reaction kinetics for the recBC enzyme inhibited by gamma protein show no anomalous protein--only a depressed rate. Inhibition is not competitive and does not appear to affect the enzyme's affinity for DNA. The enzyme remains inhibited after it is separated from excess gamma protein by gel filtration or sedimentation in a glycerol gradient, and inhibited enzyme has a reduced electrophoretic mobility compared to that of uninhibited enzyme. Gamma Protein inhibits recBC enzyme which has been reconstituted from cell-free extracts by complementation in vitro, but at least one of the complementing factors present in extracts from recB- cells does not by itself form a complex with gamma protein. The mechanism of inhibition and the implications of these results from gamma replication and recombination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563655502,"1. During purification of the Ca2+ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit muscle, different fractions with similar Ca2+ATPase activity were found to vary greatly in their ability to catalyze 45Ca2+ translocation in reconstituted liposomal systems. 2. A heat-stable fraction isolated from the fraction most active in Ca2+ translocation enhanced several-fold the Ca2+ translocation rate of the least active fraction. It also increased the ratio of Ca2+ translocation to ATP hydrolysis over 5-fold. The properties of the coupling factor resemble those of the proteolipid previously described by MacLennan et al. (MACLENNAN, D.H., YIP, C. C., ILES, G. H., and SEAMAN, P. (1972) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 37, 469-478). 3. When the heat-stable factor was added to either sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments or to liposomes after, rather than before, reconstitution, it acted as an ionophore abolishing Ca2+ translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1862041427,"An improved electron density map of lobster holo-D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been computed to 2.9 A resolution based on two heavy atom isomorphous derivatives. This has been averaged only over the Q molecular 2-fold axis, which is known to be exact in the human holoenzyme. The map showed possible asymmetry between the subunits in which the active centers are closely related across the R axis (that is, between the red and green or between the yellow and blue subunits). A difference map between the electron density of citrate and sulfate-soaked crystals gave further evidence for possible asymmetry. The major differences of electron density between R axis-related subunits appear around the active center and suggest the following interpretations. 1. The conformation of the adenine about the glycosidic bond is the more frequently observed anti with a C-2' endo conformation for the ribose ring in the red and yellow subunits, but is probably syn with a C-3' endo conformation in the green and blue subunits.2. The adenine ribose has its 3'-hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonded to a main chain carbonyl group in the red and yellow subunits but not in the green and blue subunits, as a consequence of the differing ribose conformations. 3. Cysteine-149 is more closely associated with histidine-176 in the green and blue subunits, and appears nearer the nicotinamide in the red and yellow subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1526850873,"The glycerophospholipids of cultures of Neurospora crassa were extracted, deacylated, and analyzed. In addition to a wild-type strain, several auxotrophic mutant strains were examined: chol-1 (defective S-adenosylmethionine: phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase), chol-2 (defective S-adenosyl methionine:phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (dimethylethanolamine) methyltransferase), and inos (defective myoinositol-1-phosphate phosphatase). In addition, a double mutant strain, chol-1;chol-2, was constructed. Cultures of the mutant strains grown with concentrations of supplement(s) just adequate to support growth had bizarre phospholipid compositions. By appropriate choice of mutant and supplement(s), it was possible to vary the relative level of every phospholipid of the organism, with the exception of cardiolipin. The maximum ranges encountered for the zwitterionic species, expressed as per cent of total phospholipid phosphorus, were lecithin (0.9 to 53.1%), phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (0.0 to 55.5%), phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (0.0 to 53.9%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (9.8 to 43.3%). For the anionic species, the ranges were phosphatidylserine (1.7 to 10.4%) and phosphatidylinositol (3.6 to 25.1%). Despite the wide variation of the relative proportions of the individual phospholipid species, five quantities remained constant: the cardiolipin content, the total phospholipid content, the total content of the zwitterionic species, the total content of the anionic species, and the ratio of the zwitterionic to anionic totals. The data suggest the existence of an internal compensation mechanism, the net effect of which is maintenance of a fairly constant contribution by the phospholipid components to the over-all membrane charge."

https://openalex.org/W1506527554,"Three Fragment D species (D1, D2, D3) were isolated with time from a plasmin digest of fibrinogen and had molecular weights of 92,999, 86,000 and 82,000 by summation of subunit molecular weights from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their molecular weights by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation were 94,000 t87,000, 88,000 to 82, 000, and 76,000 to 70,000 depending on the values calculated for the partial specific volumes. Each of the Fragment D species contained three disulfide-linked subunits derived from the Aalpha, Bbeta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen and differed only in the extent of COOH-terminal degradation of their gamma chain derivatives. Plasmin cleaved Fragment D1 to release the cross-link sites from its gamma' subunit of 38,000 molecular weight; however, the beta'' subunit of 42,000 molecular weight and the alpha'' subunit of 12,000 molecular weight were resistant to further digestion by plasmin. Fragment D isolated from highly cross-linked fibrin had a dimeric structure due to cross-link formation between the gamma' subunits of two fibrinogen Fragment D species. The molecular weight of fibrin Fragment D was 184,000 by summation of subunit molecular weights and 190,000 to 175,000 by sedimentation equilibrium. Cross-linking the gamma chain, as well as incorporating the site-specific fluorescent label monodansyl cadaverine into the gamma chain cross-link acceptor site, prevented its COOH-terminal degradation by plasmin. Therefore, only one species of fibrin Fragment D, as well as only one species of monodansyl cadaverine-labeled fibrin Fragment D monomer, was generated during plasmin digestion. These results show unequivocally that each fibrinogen Fragment D contains only three subunit chains and therefore the digestion of fibrinogen by plasmin must result in the production of two Fragment D molecules from each fibrinogen molecule. The recently proposed model of fibrinogen cleavage that postulates the generation of a single Fragment D with three pairs of subunit chains from each fibrinogen molecule is incorrect. Incorporation of monodansyl cadaverine into the cross-link acceptor sites of the alpha chain did not alter its cleavage by plasmin detectably. A series of monodansyl cadaverine-labeled peptides, which ranged in molecular weight from 40,000 to 23,000, were cleaved from the alpha chain of monodansyl cadaverine-labeled fibrin monomer during the early stages of plasmin digestion. These peptides were degraded progressively to a brightly fluorescent plasmin-resistant peptide of 21,000 molecular weight and a weakly fluorescent peptide of 2,500 molecular weight. Thus both alpha chain cross-link acceptor sites are contained within a peptide segment of 23,000 molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1488268757,"Alanine and glutamine formation and release were studied using the intact epitrochlaris preparation of rat skeletal muscle. Alanine release from skeletal muscle was increased by fasting (65%), cortisone (145%), thyroxine (200%), and diabetes (185%). Glutamine release was decreased by cortisone (37%) and diabetes (23%) but not significantly affected by fasting or thyroxine. Tissue levels of alanine were unchanged but tissue glutamine levels were markedly reduced (30 to 60%) in all treatment groups. Insulin added in vitro did not affect amino acid release even with preparations obtained from diabetic animals. Inhibition of glycolysis with 0.2 mM iodoacetate had no effect on the rate of alanine and glutamine formation in any treatment group. Pyruvate generation was increased by all treatments even in the presence of the inhibitor. Total skeletal muscle alanine, aspartate, and branched chain aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme activities were not significantly altered in any treatment groups. The addition of 10 mM aspartate, cysteine, branched chain amino acids, and serine significantly increased alanine formation, whereas the maximal rate of glutamine formation in the presence of stimulating amino acids was reduced in each treatment groups--the most marked effects were noted with cortisone and diabetic preparations. Although accelerated muscle proteolysis is an important factor regulating alanine formation in skeletal muscle, the redirection of carbon flow from glutamine toward alanine formation observed in fasting, cortisone, thyroxine-treated, and diabetic rats, indicates that factors other than proteolysis also participate in the control of amino acid release from muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1521172867,"Investigation of phosphofructokinase in normal and regenerating livers led to the discovery of an inactivating factor in the extracts of these livers. The inactivating factor was found to be a mixture of free fatty acids. The fatty acid compositions of the normal and regenerating livers are the same, but the concentrations of most of the fatty acids are at least 3 to 4 times higher in the latter. Inactivation of phosphofructokinase by palmitate and oleate was investigated using purified rabbit muscle enzyme. Incubation of the enzyme with palmitate (250 muM) or oleate (50 muM) resulted in rapid inactivation of the enzyme with biphasic curves. The concentrations of oleate and palmitate required to produce 50% inactivation of the enzyme were 35 muM and 75 muM, respectively. Fructose-6-P (0.5 mM), MgATP, (1 mM), fructose-1,6-P2 (1 mM), AMP (1 mM), and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (20 muM) protected the enzyme against inactivation when these metabolites were incubated with the enzyme before the addition of fatty acid. Bovine serum albumin (100 muM) and beta-cyclodextrin (0.25 mM) also protected the enzyme against the inactivation. However, if the enzyme was inactivated by fatty acid, subsequent addition of the above metabolites or bovine serum albumin did not reactivate the enzyme. Binding studies with [3H]oleate revealed at least three types of binding sites. The first site binds 2 to 4 mol of oleate/mol of enzyme. Oleate binding to this site did not seem to affect the enzyme activity. The second binding site binds 5 to 15 mol of oleate/mol of enzyme resulting in complete loss of the activity. This is followed by an increase in oleate binding to the third site of the enzyme. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of oleate-inactivated enzyme indicated that the enzyme dissociated to the dimeric form. Similarly, centrifugation of [3H]oleate-treated enzyme revealed that all polymeric forms of phosphofructokinase bound approximately 6 to 8 mol of oleate/mol of enzyme. In the presence of fructose-6-P, oleate is bound to the polymers to a lesser degree and therefore protects against the fatty acid inactivation. Various polymers which are cross-linked with dimethylsuberimidate are also inhibited by oleate."
https://openalex.org/W1607505040,"The interaction of several inhibitors with muscle phosphofructokinase has been studied by both equilibrium binding measurements and kinetic analysis. At low concentrations of citrate a maximum of 1 mol is bound per mol of enzyme protomer. Tight binding requires MgATP and very weak binding is observed in the absence of either magnesium ion or ATP. ITP at low concentrations cannot replace ATP. In the presence of MgATP and at pH 7.0, the dissociation constant for the enzyme-citrate complex is 20 muM. At 50 muM citrate and excess magnesium ion, the concentration of ATP required to give half-maximal binding of citrate is approximately 3 muM . Both P-enolpyruvate and 3-P-glycerate compete for the binding of citrate and the estimated Ki values are 480 and 52 muM, respectively. Creatine-P, another inhibitor of muscle phosphofructokinase, does not compete with the binding of citrate. Measurement of the equilibrium binding of ATP shows that citrate, 3-P-glycerate, P-enolpyruvate, and creatine-P all increase the affinity of enzyme for MgATP with the concentration required to give an effect increasing in the order given. In kinetic studies, citrate, 3-P-glycerate and P-enolpyruvate each act synergistically with ATP to inhibit the phosphofructokinase reaction. This is indicated by the observation that the three metabolites do not inhibit the enzyme with ITP as the phosphoryl donor and that they inhibit at ATP concentrations that are not themselves inhibitory. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the inhibitors increases with increasing ATP concentrations. Striking differences in the extent of inhibition can be seen by varying the order of addition of assay components. Preincubation of the enzyme with ATP and citrate, 3-P-glycerate, or P-enolpyruvate results in greater inhibition than when the inhibitor is added after the reaction is started with fructose-6-P. Furthermore, the inhibition is reversed partially 10 to 15 min after the addition of fructose-6-P. This phenomenon is particularly striking with creatine-P as the inhibitor. Very high concentrations of this inhibitor are required to show any effect if the inhibitor is added after fructose-6-P. These effects are interpreted as reflecting slow conformational changes between an active form with high affinity for fructose-6-P and an inactive, or less active, conformation that binds the inhibitors. Citrate, 3-P-glycerate, P-enolpyruvate, and creatine-P increase the rate of the phosphofructokinase at subsaturating concentrations of MgITP. The results indicate a common binding site on the enzyme for citrate, 3-P-glycerate, and P-enolpyruvate that is distinct from the ATP inhibitory site. An additional site (or sites) for creatine-P is indicated. All four inhibitors act synergistically with ATP by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for MgATP at an inhibitory site. The inhibitors appear also to increase the affinity of the catalytic nucleoside triphosphate site for substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1605165598,"The Neurospora crassa assimilatory nitrite reductase (EC 1.6.6.4) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of nitrite to ammonia, a 6-electron transfer reaction. Highly purified preparations of this enzyme exhibit absorption spectra which suggest the presence of a heme component (wavelength maxima for oxidized senzyme: 390 and 578 nm). There is a close correspondence between nitrite reductase activity and absorbance at 400 nm when partially purified nitrite reductase preparations are subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. In addition, a role for an iron component in the formation of active nitrite reductase is indicated by the fact that nitrate-induced production of nitrite reductase activity in Neurospora mycelia in vivo requires the presence of iron in the induction medium. The heme chromophore present in Neurospora nitrite reductase preparations is reducible by NADPH. Complete reduction, however, requires the presence of added FAD. The NADPH-nitrite reductase activity of the enzyme is also dependent upon addition of FAD. A spectrally unique complex is formed between the heme chromophore and nitrite (or a reduction product thereof) when nitrite is added to NADPH-reducted enzyme. Carbon monoxide forms a complex with the heme chromophore of nitrite reductase with an intense alpha-band maximum at 590 nm and a beta-band of lower intensity at 550 nm. CO is an inhibitor of NADPH-nitrite reductase activity. Spectrophotometrically detectable CO complex formation and Co inhibition of enzyme activity share the following properties..."
https://openalex.org/W1611026652,"Yeast cells almost completely deficient in all cytochromes were obtained by introducing two defective nuclear genes, cyd1 and cyc4, into the same haploid strain. The action of the two mutant genes is synergistic, since either gene acting singly results in only partial cytochrome deficiency. Normal synthesis of all cytochromes can be restored in the double mutant by adding delta-aminolevulinic acid to the growth medium. The optimum concentration of delta-aminolevulinate for restoration of cytochrome synthesis is about 40 muM; when higher concentrations are used, synthesis of cytochromes is partially suppressed, particularly that of cytochrome a.a3. Growth yield of the double mutant is stimulated by ergosterol and Tween 80, a source of unsaturated fatty acid. Methionine stimulates further. None of these nutrients is required for growth when sufficient delta-aminolevulinic acid is present in the growth medium. With respect to nutritional responses, the single-gene, cytochrome-deficient mutant, ole3, behaves like the double mutant. The frequency of the p-mutation in the double mutant grown in the absence of ergosterol, Tween 80, and delta-aminolevulinic acid is at least 15%. The frequency can be reduced to less than 1% by either delta-aminolevulinic acid or Tween 80. Ergosterol alone does not decrease the p- frequency. The ole3 mutant does not exhibit increased p-frequency under similar conditions of unsaturated fatty acid deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2005298247,"There exist a calcium-dependent resistance to stretch in resting mammalian smooth muscle that is not caused by depolarization of the cell membrane or release of calcium from intracellulr sites. The similarity of the resistance to stretch in the resting state to that in rigor suggests that most, if not all, crossbridges are attached and thus able to resist stretch in noncontracting smooth muscles. When the muscle is stretched the breaking and subsequent reformation of links in nonstrained positions accounts for most of the so-called viscoelasticity, except at extreme lengths."

https://openalex.org/W1562759410,"A pronounced effect of concanavalin A (Con A) upon activity of ecto-5'-nucleotidase of intact C6 glioma cells in culture has been demonstrated. A near linear rate of decrease in 5'-nucleotidase activity was observed upon treatment with concentrations of Con A up to 0.25 muM. Nonspecific phosphatase activity and Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity were not inhibited by Con A treatment of the cells. Of the total 5'-nucleotidase activity of C6 cells (Vmax = 5.0 mumol of Pi liberated/mg of cell protein/hour), approximately 20% still remained after treatment with high concentrations of Con A. The inhibitory effect of Con A operated to reduce substantially Vmax for ecto-5'-nucleotidase. Inhibition was reversed by briefly incubating the Con A-treated cells with alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, or alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, the later being more effective. These findings suggest that a relatively specific, reversible, inhibition of ecto-5'-nucleotidase results from Con A binding to the surface of the intact cultured mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602348761,"An improved method for purifying the tryptic fragment (Fragment A) of flagellar ATPase (dynein) from sea urchin spermatozoa is described. The preparation appears homogeneous as judged by ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, and immunological techniques. The molecular of undenatured Fragment A was determined to be 400,000 and 370,000 by the two methods of disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and sedimentation equilibrium, respectively. The fragment dissociated into two principal polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 190,000 and 135,000 when heated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Antiserum against dynein was prepared in rabbits using purified Fragment A from the sea urchin Anthocidaris crassispina as an antigen. The specificity of this serum toward Fragment A and toward dynein was determined by double diffusion in agarose, by inhibition of ATPase activity, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis of the antigen-antibody complex. This antiserum also reacted with the enzymes from two other species of sea urchin, Pseudocentrotus depressus and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Analysis of the precipitated antigen-antibody complex showed that the antiserum reacted specifically with the high molecular weight polypeptide seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude dynein fractions. This finding supports previous reports that this band derives from dynein ATPase. In our preparations, this high molecular weight dynein band appeared single."
https://openalex.org/W1554820641,"Some effects of salts on the adenylate cyclase of partially purified plasma membranes from rat liver have been studied. Under conditions where cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate formation was linear with respect to time and protein concentration, the enzyme was stimulated 3- to 6-fold by 10 mM NaF, 10- to 30-fold by 1 muM glucagon, 4- to 5-fold by 0.1 mM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and in the presence of 3 muM GTP, 2-fold by 10 mug/ml of prostaglandin E1. Various salts were found to stimulate basal activity slightly, but enhanced the response to NaF 3- to 4-fold, to glucagon 1.5- to 2-fold, to 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate 2- to 3-fold, and to prostaglandin E1 1.5-fold. This enhancement was observed at maximally effective concentrations of each of the respective activators. Of the salts tested, NaN3 and the Na- or K-halides were most effective. Their action appeared to be due to the respective anions. Stimulation was detectable with 1.5 mM NaN3 or 3 mM NaCl and was maximal with 30 mM NaN3 or 60 mM NaCl. The stimulatory effect of NaN3 was not due to ATP-sparing, nor to an altered cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate recovery. It was independent of the chromatography and assay methods used, and was therefore not due to procedural artifact. Fluoride-stimulated cyclase activity was enhanced by salts to a greater degree than were 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate-, glucagon-, or (prostaglandin E1 + GTP)-stimulated activities. The effects of NaN3 were not the result of significant changes in the enzyme's responses to GTP, which increased basal and glucagon-stimulated activities but inhibited F--stimulated activity. The effects of NaN3 were greater when cyclase was assayed with Mn2+ than with Mg2+. The facilitatory effect of NaN3 or NaCl on fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was partially reversible as was the stimulatory effect of fluoride in the presence of NaN3. Enhancement of hormonal stimulation by NaN3 was also demonstrable with cardiac and adipose tissue adenylate cyclase. However, NaN3 did not stimulate detergent-dispersed adenylate cyclases from either liver plasma membranes or brain. The data suggest that stimulation of adenylate cyclase by salts may require the added presence of other stimulatory agents and an intact membrane structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545434248,"The membrane-bound coupling factor from Mycobacterium phlei was solubilized from membrane vesicles by washing with low ionic strength buffer or 0.25 M sucrose. The solubilized enzyme exhibited coupling factor, latent ATPase, and succinate oxidation-stimulating activity. Purification by affinity chromatography using Sepharose coupled to ADP yielded a homogeneous preparation of latent ATPase which was purified about 200-fold with an 84% yield in a single step. Purified latent ATPase exhibited coupling factor activity but no succinate oxidation-stimulating activity. The molecular weight of latent ATPase was determined to be 250,000 +/- 10,000 by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. The ATPase was unmasked by trypsin treatment and activated by Mg2+ ion. However, trypsin treatment inactivated the coupling factor activity in the purified enzyme, indicating that the catalytic sites for ATPase and coupling activity are different. Unlike mitochondrial ATPase, latent ATPase from M. phlei was not cold-labile. Of the nucleoside triphosphates, UTP, ITP, and epsilon-ATP (1-N6-ethenoadenosine triphosphate) were hydrolyzed to a lesser extent compared to ATP. Kinetic data showed that ADP acted as a competitive inhibitor of latent ATPase activity with a Ki of 5 x 10(-3) M. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory inhibitors did not affect the latent ATPase activity, while sodium azide (0.1 mM) inhibited the latent ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488555922,"The three major components of bovine cardiac troponin were separated by successive chromatography on sulfopropyl-Sephadex and DEAE-Sephadex columns in the presence of 6 M urea. All three of the bovine cardiac troponin subunits were necessary to restore full troponin activity in both skeletal and cardiac actomyosin ATPase assay systems. The 38,000-dalton subunit bound tropomyosin, and the 20,000-dalton subunit bound calcium, like skeletal TN-T and TN-C, respectively. The 28,000 component, although presumably analogous to skeletal TN-I, gave very little inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. Differences between cardiac and skeletal troponin subunits were also found in the elution patterns from ion exchange columns and in amino acid composition, thus demonstrating a significant muscle-type specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1519411552,"The diazido derivative of ethidium bromide has been synthesized as a potential photoaffinity label and shown to be at least as effective as a mitochondrial mutagen as the parent compound, with a similar mode of action. Exposure of mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the compound, followed by ultraviolet-irradiation, which converts it to the highly reactive dinitrene, results in its specific binding to a single component which has been tentatively identified as the smallest polypeptide (subunit 9) of the membrane-bound ATPase. An analogus reaction is also obtained with the soluble, oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex but not with the F1-ATPase itself. The reaction with the ATPase complex can also be monitored by fluorescence enhancement and by this attribute, as well as by other criteria, diazido-ethidium bromide, ethidium bromide itself, euflavine, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 2-azido-4-nitrophenol all appear to compete for the same, lipophilic, binding site. A mitochondrial mutation (73/1) (see Flury, U., Feldman, F., and Mahler, H.R. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6630-6637) produces a photoaffinity product with an altered electrophoretic mobility and molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1576287778,"Antisera to purified (Na+, K+)-ATPase raised in rabbits and in sheep were purified by an absorption procedure employing purified canine kidney (Na+, K+)-ATPase. The antibodies were fractionated into two components, one which inhibited catalytic activity, and a second which inhibited ouabain binding. Under certain conditions, the fraction that inhibited ouabain binding also inhibited catalytic activity, and the effectiveness of both was dependent to some extent on the ligands present in the incubation medium. Thus, both antibody fractions appeared to detect conformations of the enzyme that depended upon ligand-induced perturbations. When the antibody raised against catalytic activity was incubated with erythrocyte membrane fragments, an inhibition of the (Na+, K+)-ATPase occurred, but only minimal or no effect on potassium influx or on digoxin-induced inhibition of potassium flux in intact erythrocytes was noted. In a similar experiment, however, the antibody against ouabain binding significantly inhibited potassium influx, suggesting specificity in terms of the macromolecular surfaces of the pump which were exposed to the external medium. We concluded that there may be organ and species differences among (Na+, K+)-ATPase preparations. Antibodies prepared in rabbits and sheep were fractionated by absorption to dog brain enzyme. Both the antibody fraction which bound to the brain enzyme and that which did not bind inhibited the dog kidney (Na+, K+)-ATPase, but only the former inhibited dog brain (Na+, K+)-ATPase. When the two fractions were recombined, inhibition was restored to the extent of the unfractionated antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1603748131,"3-Deoxyheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate was obtained by a one-step chemical synthesis through condensation of oxalacetate with erythrose 4-phosphate. This reaction occurs at measurable rates only in the presence of a metal ion; Co2+ and Ni2+ are the most effective catalysts. The Co2+ catalyzed condensation of oxalacetate and erythrose 4-phosphate proceeds at room temperature and neutral pH. Since erythrose 4-phosphate can be replaced by any free aldehyde tested thus far, this type of a homogeneous catalysis opens new synthetic routes to alpha-keto-gamma-hydroxy-fatty acids and their derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1579656860,"Freshly purified preparations of anthranilate synthetase complex from Neurospora crassa appeared to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide disc gels and were composed of two distinct subunits, 94,000 and 70,000 daltons, respectively, as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Carboxymethylation of the complex or treatment with guanidine hydrochloride and urea before sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment did not alter the subunit pattern. When the purified complex was iodinated with 125I- or methylated with [14C]dimethylsulfate, no labeled components other than the two subunits stained with Coomassie blue were detected after electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Although some purified preparations were stable, most were unstable upon storage. Analysis of the unstable preparations on nondenaturing and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gels revealed that the complex in these preparations was progressively fragmented to smaller components and subunits upon repeated freeze-thaw treatment or prolonged incubation at or above 4 degrees. Distinct fragments were generated ranging in size down to 25,000 daltons, and some fragments retained some of the activities associated with the anthranilate synthetase complex. On the basis of these and earlier studies, we conclude that anthranilate synthetase from Neurospora crassa is composed of two distinct subunits in an alpha2beta2 structure; one subunit is a trifunctional peptide which contains the catalytic sites for the phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase and indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase reactions, and associates with the second subunit to form glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthetase. The smaller subunits and components previously reported for this complex are apparently due to protease activity present in purified preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1981328432,"Human peripheral blood leukocyte cultures containing varying numbers of washed fresh sperm were cultured for 4 days. [3H] Thymidine incorporation was used as a measure of lymphocyte transformation. Human sperm cells induce a 4- to 250-fold increase in [3H] thymidine incorporation in allogeneic leuocyte cultures, but no increase was demonstrated in autologous leukocyte cultures. The response was dose-dependent with maximum stimulation obtained at 2 x 10(6) sperm per milliliter of culture. Seminal plasma was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion and as little as 0.2 microliter per 200 microliters of culture was inhibitory. The data indicate that tissues other than leukocytes can express the portion of the major histocompatibility complex responsibile for allospecific lymphocyte transformation, and thus have application in transplantation and reproductive biology."

https://openalex.org/W1575520110,"Inverted membrane vesicles from strain 7, a wild type Escherichia coli K12 strain, actively transport calcium with energy supplied either by respiration or by ATP. These vesicles also have energy-linked quenching of quinacrine fluorescence. Membranes of strain 7, depleted of Mg2+ATPase by EDTA treatment, lack both activities. Membrane vesicles from strain NR70, a mutant lacking the Mg2+ATPase, show neither calcium transport nor energy-linked fluorescence quenching. Neither EDTA treatment nor genetic loss of the Mg2+atpase causes a reduction in respiration. Purified Mg2+ATPase from strain 7 can bind to EDTA-treated membrane vesicles from either strain 7 or NR70. This binding restored both calcium transport and fluorescence quenching, driven either by respiration or by ATP. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide treatment mimics the effect of the Mg2+ATPase in the case of respiration-driven reactions. Treatment with EDTA, while not essential for the binding of the Mg2+ATPase to membrane vesicles of NR70, produced better restoration of both activities. The rate of restoration of fluorescence quenching showed a time lag which may indicate that binding of the Mg2+ATPase is a relatively slow process. Antiserum prepared against the Mg2+ATPase inhibited the quenching of quinacrine fluorescence when driven by ATP but not when driven by respiration. Addition of antiserum prior to addition of Mg2+ATPase prevented the restoration of fluorescence quenching, whether driven by respiration or ATP. These results clearly show that MG2+ATPase has an important role not only in catalyzing ATP synthesis and hydrolysis but also in maintaining the energized membrane state."
https://openalex.org/W1588733626,"Recent genetic analyses of the membrane components involved in energy transduction in Escherichia coli have concentrated on the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase complex (EC 3.6.1.3). Many mutants have been described with altered biochemical properties and defects in energy-requiring processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, transhydrogenase activity, and active transport of several solutes. This report describes the isolation of a mutant strain of E. coli that is defective in several energy-requiring processes. The strain BG-31 was obtained by localized mutagenesis using phage P1c1. The mutation maps at approximately 73.5 min on the E. coli chromosome. Reversion and suppression analyses indicate that the defect is the result of a single amber mutation. This strain is unable to utilize succinate, D-lactate, or malate for growth. Mutant cells are unable to couple the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to the active transport of proline, although coupling of energy derived from electron transport to solute transport appears normal when examined in both cells and isolated membrane vesicles. Isolated membranes of the mutant are unable to couple the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to transhydrogenase activity while they can utilize the energy generated from electron transport to drive transhydrogenase activity. Extracts of strain BG-31 have normal levels of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase activity. The ATPase portion of the complex, bacterial F1 (BF1), is poorly attached to the membrane portion of the complex. In vitro reconstitution of transhydrogenase activity with stripped membrane fractions and crude preparations of BF1 localize the defect in strain BG-31 to the membrane portion of the complex. Analysis of membranes of the strain BG-31 by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrate the absence of a single polypeptide of molecular weight about 54,000 and the appearance of a new polypeptide of lower molecular weight, about 25,000. Analysis of a spontaneous revertant of BG-31 shows complete restoration of the parental phenotype including the gel patterns. The characterization of this mutant provides the first demonstration of the consequences of a structural gene mutation on a polypeptide in the membrane portion of the complex and represents the initial stages in what we hope will be the biochemical definition and functional characterization of this important energy-transducing system."

https://openalex.org/W1595043423,"Abstract The effect of F-actin upon the binding of ADP to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, heavy meromyosin, and subfragment 1 was studied by equilibrium dialysis, ultracentrifuge transport, and light scattering techniques. Both myosin and H-meromyosin (HMM) bind a maximum of approximately 1.6 mol of ADP/mol of protein, while S-1 binds approximately 0.9 mol of ADP/mol of protein. The affinity for ADP of all three preparations was similar at a given ionic strength (approximately 10(6) M-1 at 0.05 M KCl) and decreased with increasing ionic strength. Under conditions similar to those used for the measurement of ADP binding, the binding sites of myosin, HMM, and subfragment 1 (S-1) are saturated with actin at molar ratios of 2, 2, and 1 mol of actin monomer/mol of protein, respectively, as determined by light scattering, ultracentrifuge transport, and in the case of myosin by ATPase measurements. F-actin was found to inhibit ADP binding, but even at an actin concentration at least twice that required for saturation of myosin, HMM, or S-1, significant ADP binding remained. This ADP binding was inhibited by 10(-4) M pyrophosphate. The observations are consistent with the formation of an actomyosin-ADP complex in which actin and ADP are bound to myosin at distinct but interacting sites."

Bacteriophages were chosen because much of their ultrastructure is beyond the resolution of the conventional scanning electron microscope. The new instrument permits examination of bulk samples with a resolution that exceeds, by at least a factor of 2.5, the resolution obtained in the best secondary electron scanning electron microscopes using high brightness guns, and exceeds by an order of magnitude the resolution of standard scanning electron microscopes using tungsten filament guns.

Furthermore, ruthenium red alone acts as an anion-selective ionophore in lipid bilayers with the the following selectivity sequence for anions: l- greater than Cl-, Br- greater than F- greater than NO3-. The PCl-/PNa+ ratio was approximately 4/l. The presence of ruthenium red in excess of Ca2+ ionophore in lipid bilayer experiments converts the cation selectivity of the bilayer due to Ca2+ ionophore into anion selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1583653647,Cartilage proteoglycan aggregates are separated from collagen and other non-proteoglycan protein by preparative rate zonal sedimentation under associative conditions. Dissociative rate zonal sedimentation produces sedimented proteoglycan of lower protein content with a corresponding increase in the amount of less sedimentable protein-rich proteoglycan. An extensive number of sequential rate zonal sedimentations discloses that the proceess of disaggregation involves the separation of proteoglycans varying continuously in composition with no apparent discontinuities in distribution to indicate the presence of distinctively different macromolecules. The variations encompass proteoglycans of low protein content containing less than 2% keratan sulfate and proteoglycans with keratan sulfate as the predominant polysaccharide (present in concentrations greater than 2-fold that of the chondroitin sulfate) and more than a 10-fold increase in protein content.
https://openalex.org/W1523387290,"Several cardiotonic steroids have been modified by reduction of the unsaturated lactone and their interactions with the sodium- and potassium-activated ATPase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) have been investigated. Reduction of the unsaturated lactone results in a decrease in binding affinity due primarily to an increase in the dissociation rate constant concomitant with a decrease in the activation free energy of dissociation. This decrease in activation free energy is about 2 to 4 kcal, which is approximately equal to the energy of one hydrogen bond. It is suggested that the increase in dissociation rate due to reduction of the unsaturated lactone may make possible the use of these compounds as affinity ligands for purification of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase or an ouabain-binding fragment."

Urinary protein-stimulated incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA was found after 1 day of culture. Increased levels of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and lysozyme were demonstrable at 3 and 5 days, respectively, with urinary protein-supplemented cultures. The incorporation of 3H-labeled deoxynucleosides into DNA was higher in the presence of urinary proteins after 2 days of culture. The rate of incorporation of [3H]deoxyuridine into DNA was strongly inhibited by 10(-5) M Methotrexate and 10(-6) M 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, however, the effect of urinary proteins on incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA and lysozyme accumulation were not inhibited. Urinary proteins also stimulated the formation of colonies (groups of at least 30 cells) in media containing methylcellulose. This latter phenomenon was also not inhibited by 10(-5) M Methotrexate or 10(-6) M 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. The results of these studies are consistent with the postulate that in the presence of human urinary proteins, mouse bone marrow cells in culture proceed to a phenotype characteristic of circulating peripheral white cells."
