https://openalex.org/W4283718372,"The human cerebral cortex has tremendous cellular diversity. How different cell types are organized in the human cortex and how cellular organization varies across species remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatially resolved single-cell profiling of 4000 genes using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), identified more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, and generated a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the human middle and superior temporal gyrus. We further explored cell-cell interactions arising from soma contact or proximity in a cell type-specific manner. Comparison of the human and mouse cortices showed conservation in the laminar organization of cells and differences in somatic interactions across species. Our data revealed human-specific cell-cell proximity patterns and a markedly increased enrichment for interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the human cortex."

Local cooling represents an attractive means for on-demand elimination of pain signals, but traditional technologies are limited by rigid, bulky form factors; imprecise cooling; and requirements for extraction surgeries. Here, we introduce soft, bioresorbable, microfluidic devices that enable delivery of focused, minimally invasive cooling power at arbitrary depths in living tissues with real-time temperature feedback control. Construction with water-soluble, biocompatible materials leads to dissolution and bioresorption as a mechanism to eliminate unnecessary device load and risk to the patient without additional surgeries. Multiweek in vivo trials demonstrate the ability to rapidly and precisely cool peripheral nerves to provide local, on-demand analgesia in rat models for neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W4283736479,"In mice, social defeat stress (SDS), an ethological model for psychosocial stress, induces sleep. Such sleep could enable resilience, but how stress promotes sleep is unclear. Activity-dependent tagging revealed a subset of ventral tegmental area γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–somatostatin (VTA Vgat-Sst ) cells that sense stress and drive non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep through the lateral hypothalamus and also inhibit corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release in the paraventricular hypothalamus. Transient stress enhances the activity of VTA Vgat-Sst cells for several hours, allowing them to exert their sleep effects persistently. Lesioning of VTA Vgat-Sst cells abolished SDS-induced sleep; without it, anxiety and corticosterone concentrations remained increased after stress. Thus, a specific circuit allows animals to restore mental and body functions by sleeping, potentially providing a refined route for treating anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4283730706,"Protein domains of low sequence complexity do not fold into stable, three-dimensional structures. Nevertheless, proteins with these sequences assist in many aspects of cell organization, including assembly of nuclear and cytoplasmic structures not surrounded by membranes. The dynamic nature of these cellular assemblies is caused by the ability of low-complexity domains (LCDs) to transiently self-associate through labile, cross-β structures. Mechanistic studies useful for the study of LCD self-association have evolved over the past decade in the form of simple assays of phase separation. Here, we have used such assays to demonstrate that the interactions responsible for LCD self-association can be dictated by labile protein structures poised close to equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states. Furthermore, missense mutations causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease manifest their pathophysiology in vitro and in cultured cell systems by enhancing the stability of otherwise labile molecular structures formed upon LCD self-association."
https://openalex.org/W4283717418,"The Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) from ~17 to 14 million years ago (Ma) represents an enigmatic reversal in Cenozoic cooling. A synthesis of marine paleotemperature records shows that the MCO was a local maximum in global sea surface temperature superimposed on a period from at least 19 Ma to 10 Ma, during which global temperatures were on the order of 10°C warmer than at present. Our high-resolution global reconstruction of ocean crustal production, a proxy for tectonic degassing of carbon, suggests that crustal production rates were ~35% higher than modern rates until ~14 Ma, when production began to decline steeply along with global temperatures. The magnitude and timing of the inferred changes in tectonic degassing can account for the majority of long-term ice sheet and global temperature evolution since 20 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W4283731821,"Variation in gene expression arises from cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, which contribute differentially to expression divergence. We compare the impacts on gene expression and fitness resulting from cis- and trans-regulatory mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , with a focus on the TDH3 gene. We use the effects of cis-regulatory mutations to infer effects of trans-regulatory mutations attributable to impacts beyond the focal gene, revealing a distribution of pleiotropic effects. Cis- and trans-regulatory mutations had different effects on gene expression with pleiotropic effects of trans-regulatory mutants affecting expression of genes both in parallel to and downstream of the focal gene. The more widespread and deleterious effects of trans-regulatory mutations we observed are consistent with their decreasing relative contribution to expression differences over evolutionary time."
https://openalex.org/W4283721919,"Precise Hox gene expression is crucial for embryonic patterning. Intra-Hox transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modules controlling Hox gene expression. However, quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here, we introduce ""synthetic regulatory reconstitution,"" a conceptual framework for studying gene regulation, and apply it to the HoxA cluster. We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130 to 170 kilobases) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We found that a minimal HoxA cluster recapitulated correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, whereas the addition of distal enhancers was needed for full transcriptional output. Synthetic regulatory reconstitution could provide a generalizable strategy for deciphering the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes."
https://openalex.org/W4283728447,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase controls growth in response to nutrients, including the amino acid leucine. In cultured cells, mTORC1 senses leucine through the leucine-binding Sestrin proteins, but the physiological functions and distribution of Sestrin-mediated leucine sensing in mammals are unknown. We find that mice lacking Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 cannot inhibit mTORC1 upon dietary leucine deprivation and suffer a rapid loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle. The WAT loss is driven by aberrant mTORC1 activity and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production in the liver. Sestrin expression in the liver lobule is zonated, accounting for zone-specific regulation of mTORC1 activity and FGF21 induction by leucine. These results establish the mammalian Sestrins as physiological leucine sensors and reveal a spatial organization to nutrient sensing by the mTORC1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4283729581,"There is anecdotal evidence for beneficial effects of music therapy in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, there is a lack of rigorous research investigating this issue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of music therapy and physical activity on brain plasticity, mood, and cognition in a population with AD and at risk for AD.One-hundred and thirty-five participants with memory complaints will be recruited for a parallel, three-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mild (early) AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or memory complaints without other neuropsychiatric pathology. Participants are randomised into either a music therapy intervention (singing lessons), an active control group (physical activity) or a passive control group (no intervention) for 12 months. The primary outcomes are the brain age gap, measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include cognitive performance, activities of daily living, brain structure (voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging), and brain function (resting-state functional MRI).Screening of participants began in April 2018. A total of 84 participants have been recruited and started intervention, out of which 48 participants have completed 12 months of intervention and post-intervention assessment.Addressing the need for rigorous longitudinal data for the effectiveness of music therapy in people with and at risk for developing AD, this trial aims to enhance knowledge regarding cost-effective interventions with potentially high clinical applicability.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03444181, registered on February 23, 2018."
https://openalex.org/W4283716981,"The gas emanating from human skin is known to vary depending on one's physical condition and diet. Thus, skin gas has been gaining substantial scholarly attention as an effective noninvasive biomarker for understanding different physical conditions. This study focuses on the relationship between psychological stress and skin gas, which has remained unclear to date. It has been deduced that when participants were subjected to interviews confirmed as stressful by physiological indicators, their skin emitted an odor similar to stir-fried leeks containing allyl mercaptan and dimethyl trisulfide. This characteristic, recognizable odor appeared reproducibly during the stress-inducing situations. Furthermore, the study deduced that individuals who perceive this stress odor experience subjective tension, confusion, and fatigue (Profile of Mood States scale). Thus, the study findings indicate the possibility of human nonverbal communication through odor, which could enhance our understanding of human interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4283724200,"Staphylococcus aureus , especially methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA), is an important bacterium that causes community and healthcare-related infections throughout the world. However, the current conventional detection methods are time-consuming. We therefore developed and evaluated a recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow strip (RPA-LF) approach for detection of MRSA in positive blood-culture samples. Sixty positive blood-cultures from a hospital were tested directly without DNA extraction and purification before the amplification reaction. RPA primers and probes were designed for nuc (encoding thermonuclease) and mecA (encoding penicillin-binding protein 2a) genes to diagnose S . aureus and its methicillin-resistance status. The RPA reaction occurred under isothermal conditions (45°C) within 20 min and a result was provided by the LF strip in a further 5 min at room temperature. The evaluation of RPA-LF using blood-culture samples showed 93.3% (14/15) sensitivity for identifying S . aureus , and no cross-amplification was seen [100% (45/45) specificity]. For detection of methicillin resistance, the RPA-LF test provided 100% (16/16) sensitivity and 97.7% (43/44) specificity. The RPA-LF is rapid, highly sensitive, robust and easy to use. It can be used for direct detection of MRSA with no requirement for special equipment."
https://openalex.org/W4283717987,"This research investigates whether thinking about the consequences of a problem being resolved can improve social problem-solving in clinical depression. We also explore whether impaired social problem solving is related to inhibitory control. Thirty-six depressed and 43 non-depressed participants were presented with six social problems and were asked to generate consequences for the problems being resolved or remaining unresolved. Participants were then asked to solve the problems and recall all the consequences initially generated. Participants also completed the Emotional Stroop and Flanker tasks. We found that whilst depressed participants were impaired at social problem-solving after generating unresolved consequences, they were successful at generating solutions for problems for which they previously generated resolved consequences. Depressed participants were also impaired on the Stroop task, providing support for an impaired inhibitory control account of social problem-solving. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning social problem-solving in depression and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions to improve social-problem solving in depression."
https://openalex.org/W4283722937,"Chronic inflammation is considered a major driving force for clonal expansion and evolution in the Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, which include essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis (MPNs). One of the key mutation drivers is the JAK2V617F mutation, which has been shown to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using whole blood gene expression profiling, deregulation of several oxidative stress and anti-oxidative defense genes has been identified in MPNs, including significant downregulation of TP53 , the NFE2L2 or NRF2 genes. These genes have a major role for maintaining genomic stability, regulation of the oxidative stress response and in modulating migration or retention of hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, their deregulation might give rise to increasing genomic instability, increased chronic inflammation and disease progression with egress of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to seed in the spleen, liver and elsewhere. Interferon-alpha2 (rIFNα) is increasingly being recognized as the drug of choice for the treatment of patients with MPNs. Herein, we report the first gene expression profiling study on the impact of rIFNα upon oxidative stress and antioxidative defense genes in patients with MPNs (n = 33), showing that rIFNα downregulates several upregulated oxidative stress genes and upregulates downregulated antioxidative defense genes. Treatment with rIFNα induced upregulation of 19 genes in ET and 29 genes in PV including CXCR4 and TP53 . In conclusion, this rIFNα- mediated dampening of genotoxic damage to hematopoietic cells may ultimately diminish the risk of additional mutations and accordingly clonal evolution and disease progression towards myelofibrotic and leukemic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W4283730428,"The decline in European eel (Anguilla anguilla) recruitment over the past half-century is partly due to river infrastructure that delays or blocks upstream migration to rearing habitat. Stimuli, such as electricity, can be used to modify the behaviour of downstream moving fish and guide them to preferred routes of passage at river infrastructure; but research on upstream migrating juvenile eel remains limited. The response of upstream migrating juvenile eel exposed to pulsed direct current (PDC) electric fields was investigated using a recirculatory flume. Eel were presented a choice of two routes upstream under either: (1) a treatment condition, in which the selection of one route resulted in exposure to High Electric Field (HEF) strength that was between 1.5-2 times stronger than the Low Electric Field (LEF) strength encountered in the alternative route; or (2) a control in which the electric field was absent in both routes. Under the treatment, five different mean HEF strengths (0.53, 0.77, 1.22, 2.17 and 3.74 Vcm-1) were tested at one of two frequencies (2 and 10 Hz). Route choice, distance downstream of the first set of electrodes at which an initial response was observed and avoidance behaviours (acceleration, retraction, switching and rejection) were compared among treatments. For the 1.22, 2.17 and 3.74 Vcm-1 and under 2 Hz, eel preferred to pass the LEF route. Avoidance was greater in the HEF route and positively related to field strength. The distance of the initial response did not differ between routes, field strengths or frequency. Upstream migrating eel avoided electric fields indicating potential to develop this approach for fish guidance. Further work is needed to test prototypes in field settings, particularly in combination with traditional physical screens to water intakes as part of a process of applying the concept of marginal gains to advance environmental impact mitigation technology."
https://openalex.org/W4283715638,"Background In populations at high risk of HIV infection, rates of depression can be elevated with far-reaching effects on overall well-being. There is limited research on depression among young women engaged in high-risk sexual behaviour in low and middle-income settings. We investigated the prevalence, correlates and factors associated with mean HSCL depression score among young women at high risk (aged 15–24 years old) in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a baseline analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Probable depression was measured using the 15-item Hopkins Symptoms Checklist for depression (HSCL). This checklist has been validated in Ugandan populations, and our reliability test gave a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.89. The test was administered to all the participants. Participants whose HSCL mean score was greater than 1.75 were categorized as having probable depression. Socio-demographics and behaviour data were collected and factors associated with mean HSCL depression score were analysed using multiple linear regression. Results Data was available for 600 participants, mean age 20.4 (SD±2.44) years. The prevalence of probable depression was 56% (95% CI, 52%-60%). Probable depression symptoms were most prevalent among those who reported ever-experiencing violence from a sexual partner (64.7%), those aged between 20–24 years (58.2%) and those who reported more than 10 sexual exposures in the month prior to the interview (56.8%). At the adjusted analysis level, condom use during their last sexual intercourse prior to the survey decreased probable depression symptoms by 0.147 units compared to those who never used condoms (β = -0.147, 95% CI -0.266–0.027). Having experienced physical violence by a sexual partners increased mean HSCL depression score by 0.183 units compared to those who have never experienced violence (β = 0.183, 95% CI 0.068–0.300). Participants who reported ever using drugs of addiction had their mean HSCL depression scoreincrease by 0.20 units compared to those who have never used (β = 0.20,95% CI 0.083–0.317). Conclusions Probable depression is high in this population and increased mean HSCL depression score is related to violence. Periodic screening for depression and interventions targeting depression, partner violence and risky sexual behaviours are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4283718441,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether individualized low-intensity exercise (ILIE) within the recovery domain before lactate threshold 1 (LT 1) improves energetic recovery and general endurance capacity in professional soccer players. Twenty-four professional soccer players (age: 24.53 ± 4.85 years, height: 180 ± 6.30 cm, body mass: 75.86 ± 8.01 kg, body fat: 12.19 ± 2.69%) participated in the study (n = 24). The 1-h ILIE intervention involved 27 jogging sessions spanning nine weeks and jogging speed corresponding to 72% of LT 1 (7.15 ± 0.95 km∙h-1). Pre-ILIE and post-ILIE LT testing variables measured within 9 weeks included blood lactate concentrations (La-) and heart rate (HR) at specific exercise intensities during ILIE LT test. The jogging/running speeds (S), delta (Δ) S, HR, and ΔHR were measured at 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mmol∙L-1 La-, respectively. Values of La- and HR at the same exercise intensities (5.4-16.2 km∙h-1) in the post-ILIE LT test compared with pre-ILIE LT test were significantly decreased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, S at all specific La- levels (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0) were significantly increased, while HR at 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 La- decreased significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Low to moderate positive correlations were observed between ΔS and ΔHR at 1.5 and 2.0 La- (r = 0.52 and r = 0.40, respectively). The nine-week ILIE improved energy recovery and general endurance of professional soccer players. This relates to repeated high-intensity intermittent sprints during the 90-min soccer game."
https://openalex.org/W4283722681,"The COVID-19 pandemic influenced individuals' anxiety and depression across the United States over a short period, and some Americans relied on drugs for coping. This study examines American adults' drug use trajectories in response to changing anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating role of substance use disorder (SUD) services provided by non-profit facilities in anxiety/depression-induced drug use. Heterogeneity in such relationships is further explored based on race/ethnicity. This study used a nationally representative sample of 1,176 American adults who reported drug use between May 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Using individual-fixed effects Poisson estimators, the current study empirically modeled drug use changes according to changing anxiety/depression levels. Interaction terms between anxiety/depression levels and per capita spending by non-profit SUD facilities were used to explore the moderating effect of SUD service expenditures. Racial/ethnic disparities were explored in subgroup analyses on non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian samples. We found more frequent drug use in response to elevated anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater spending on SUD service by non-profit facilities at the county level was associated with reduced drug consumption associated with anxiety and depression, with greater benefits for racial/ethnic minorities. Findings provide important policy implications for distributing public funds for non-profit SUD facilities for mitigating SUD risks, especially among racial/ethnic minorities."
https://openalex.org/W4283724856,"Psychiatric comorbidity, the presence of two or more mental health disorders, has been associated with suboptimal HIV treatment outcomes. Little is known about the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity among people with HIV (PWH) in sub-Saharan Africa.We conducted interviews with PWH initiating HIV care in Cameroon between June 2019 and March 2020. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and harmful drinking were dichotomized to represent those with and without symptoms of each. Psychiatric comorbidity was defined as having symptoms of two or more disorders assessed. Moderate or severe household hunger, high anticipatory HIV-related stigma, low social support, and high number of potentially traumatic events were hypothesized as correlates of psychiatric comorbidity. Bivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate unadjusted associations between psychosocial stressors and psychiatric comorbidity.Among 424 participants interviewed, the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity was 16%. Among those with symptoms of at least one mental health or substance use disorder (n = 161), the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity was 42%. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity was 33%, 67%, 76%, and 81% among those with symptoms of harmful drinking, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, respectively. Among individuals with symptoms of a mental health or substance use disorder, a high number of potentially traumatic events (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.71 [95% CI 1.21, 2.42]) and high anticipatory HIV-related stigma (PR 1.45 [95% CI 1.01, 2.09]) were associated with greater prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity.Psychiatric comorbidity was common among this group of PWH in Cameroon. The effectiveness and implementation of transdiagnostic or multi-focus mental health treatment approaches in HIV care settings should be examined."
https://openalex.org/W4283728875,"Lentil is an important food legume throughout the world and Pakistan stands at 18 th position with 8,610 tons production from 17,457 hectares. It is rich in protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and minerals that can potentially meet food security and malnutrition issues, particularly in South Asia. Two hundred and twenty lentil genotypes representing Pakistan (178), Syria (14), and the USA (22) including 6 from unknown origins were studied for yield, yield contributing traits, and cooking time (CT). Genotype 6122 (Pakistan) performed the best during both years with seed yield per plant (SY) 68±1.7 g, biological yield per plant (BY) 264±2.8 g, pod size (PS) 0.61±0.01 cm, number of seeds per pod (NSP) 2, cooking time (CT) 11 minutes, with no hard seed (HS). The genotypes 6122 (Pakistan) and 6042 (Syria) produced the highest BY, hence these have the potential to be an efficient source of fodder, particularly during extreme winter months. The genotypes 5698 (Pakistan) and 6015 (USA) were late in maturity during 2018–19 while 24783 and 5561 matured early in 2019. A minimum CT of 10 minutes was taken by the genotypes 6074 and 5745 of Pakistani origin. The lowest CT saves energy, time, and resources, keeps flavor, texture, and improves protein digestibility, hence the genotypes with minimum CT are recommended for developing better lentil cultivars. Pearson correlation matrix revealed significant association among several traits, especially SY with BY, PS, and NSP which suggests their use for the future crop improvement program. The PCA revealed a considerable reduction in components for the selection of suitable genotypes with desired traits that could be utilized for future lentil breeding. Structural Equational Model (SEM) for SY based on covariance studies indicated the perfect relationship among variables. Further, hierarchical cluster analysis establishes four clusters for 2017–18, whereas seven clusters for 2018–19. Cluster 4 of 2017–18 and cluster 5 of 2018–19 exhibited the genotypes with the best performance for most of the traits (SY, BY, PS, NSP, CT, and HS). Based on heritability; HSW, SY, BY, NSP were highly heritable, hence these traits are expected for selecting genotypes with genes of interest and for future lentil cultivars. In conclusion, 10 genotypes (5664, 5687, 6084, 6062, 6122, 6058, 6087, 5689, 6042 and 6074) have been suggested to evaluate under multi-location environments for selection of the best one/s or could be utilized in hybridization in future lentil breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W4283734692,"Background Models that forecast non-communicable disease rates are poorly designed to predict future changes in trend because they are based on exogenous measures of disease rates. We introduce microPRIME, which forecasts myocardial infarction (MI) incidence, events and prevalence in England to 2035. microPRIME can forecast changes in trend as all MI rates emerge from competing trends in risk factors and treatment. Materials and methods microPRIME is a microsimulation of MI events within a sample of 114,000 agents representative of England. We simulate 37 annual time points from 1998 to 2035, where agents can have an MI event, die from an MI, or die from an unrelated cause. The probability of each event is a function of age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, diabetes and previous MI. This function does not change over time. Instead population-level changes in MI rates are due to competing trends in risk factors and treatment. Uncertainty estimates are based on 450 model runs that use parameters calibrated against external measures of MI rates between 1999 and 2011. Findings Forecasted MI incidence rates fall for men and women of different age groups before plateauing in the mid 2020s. Age-standardised event rates show a similar pattern, with a non-significant upturn by 2035, larger for men than women. Prevalence in men decreases for the oldest age groups, with peaks of prevalence rates in 2019 for 85 and older at 25.8% (23.3–28.3). For women, prevalence rates are more stable. Prevalence in over 85s is estimated as 14.5% (12.6–16.5) in 2019, and then plateaus thereafter. Conclusion We may see an increase in event rates from MI in England for men before 2035 but increases for women are unlikely. Prevalence rates may fall in older men, and are likely to remain stable in women over the next decade and a half."
https://openalex.org/W4283747045,"Micropeptides, encoded from small open reading frames of 300 nucleotides or less, are hidden throughout mammalian genomes, though few functional studies of micropeptides in the brain are published. Here, we describe a micropeptide known as the Plasticity-Associated Neural Transcript Short (Pants), located in the 22q11.2 region of the human genome, the microdeletion of which conveys a high risk for schizophrenia. Our data show that Pants is upregulated in early adulthood in the mossy fiber circuit of the hippocampus, where it exerts a powerful negative effect on long-term potentiation (LTP). Further, we find that Pants is secreted from neurons, where it associates with synapses but is rapidly degraded with stimulation. Pants dynamically interacts with Rtn4/Nogo-A, a well-studied regulator of adult plasticity. Pants interaction with Nogo-A augments its influence over postsynaptic AMPA receptor clustering, thus gating plasticity at adult synapses. This work shows that neural micropeptides can act as architectural modules that increase the functional diversity of the known proteome."
https://openalex.org/W4283757884,"Deeply investigating the relationship between governance, financial development, and outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) is beneficial to formulating effective policies to accelerate Chinese firms’ pace of overseas expansion. Based on the theoretical mechanism analysis, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of Asian governance and financial development on China’s OFDI using the panel data of 37 Asian countries from 2003 to 2017. The results show that the host country governance has a negative and statistically significant impact on China’s direct investment in Asia. The conclusion remains valid even after overcoming the interference of endogenous and economic cycle fluctuations. Moreover, using the mediating effect model, we find that financial development is an important channel through which host country governance affects China’s OFDI. In further discussion, the findings suggest that with the scale of OFDI expanding, the role of governance takes an inverted ""U"" shape, and the ""Belt and Road"" initiative (BRI) weakens the negative impact of governance quality on China’s OFDI. Furthermore, governance has shown more remarkable restraint on China’s OFDI in neighboring, coastal, and low-income countries in the heterogeneity test. ​From the perspective of host country governance, this paper provides more specific guidance to formulate China’s direct investment policy in Asia."
https://openalex.org/W4283762398,"Suicides and opioid overdose deaths are among the most pressing public health concerns in the US. However direct evidence for the association between opioid use and suicidal behavior is limited. The objective of this article is to examine the association between frequency and dose of prescription opioid use and subsequent suicide attempts.This retrospective cohort study analyzed 4 years of statewide medical claims data from the Connecticut All-Payer Claims Database. Commercially insured adult patients in Connecticut (n = 842,773) who had any medical claims beginning in January 2012 were followed through December 2015. The primary outcome was suicide attempt identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD 9) diagnosis codes. Primary predictor variables included frequency of opioid use, which was defined as the number of months with claims for prescription opioids per year, and strength of opioid dose, which was standardized using morphine milligram equivalent (MME) units. We also controlled for psychiatric and medical comorbidities using ICD 9 codes. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between frequency, dose, and suicide attempts, adjusting for medical and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Interactions among measures of opioid use and comorbid conditions were analyzed. In this cohort study with follow-up time up to 4 years (range = 2-48 months, median = 46 months), the hazard ratios (HR) from the time-to-event analysis indicated that patients prescribed opioid medications for at least 6 months during the past year and at 20-50 MME levels or higher had 4.44 (95% CI: [3.71, 5.32]) to 7.23 (95% CI: [6.22, 8.41]) times the risk of attempted suicide compared to those not prescribed opioids. Risk of suicide attempt was sharply elevated among patients with psychiatric conditions other than anxiety who were prescribed more frequent and higher opioid doses. In contrast, more frequent and higher doses of prescription opioids were associated with lower risk of suicide attempts among patients with medical conditions necessitating pain management. This study is limited by its exclusive focus on commercially insured patients and does not include patients covered by public insurance. It is also limited to patients' receipt of prescription opioids and does not take into account opioids obtained through other means, nor does it include measures of actual patient opioid use.This analysis provides evidence of a complex relationship among prescription opioids, mental health, pain and other medical comorbidities, and suicide risk. Findings indicate the need for proactive suicide surveillance among individuals diagnosed with affective or psychotic disorders who are receiving frequent and high doses of opioids. However, appropriate opioid treatment may have significant value in reducing suicide risk for those without psychiatric comorbidities."

https://openalex.org/W4283724348,"Evidence suggests that neighbourhood street connectivity is positively associated with physical activity, yet few studies have estimated its associations with sedentary behaviour. We estimated the associations between space syntax derived street integration , a novel measure of street connectivity, and sedentary behaviours among Canadian adults. Data were sourced from a population-based study–Alberta’s Tomorrow Project (n = 14,758). Items from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire captured sedentary behaviour, including sitting and motor vehicle travel time and walking. Street integration was measured within a 1600m radius of participants’ homes. Covariate-adjusted linear regression models estimated the associations between street integration and sedentary behaviour. Street integration was significantly positively associated with daily minutes of sitting on week (b 6.44; 95CI 3.60, 9.29) and weekend (b 4.39; 95CI 1.81, 6.96) days, and for week and weekend days combined (b 5.86; 95CI 3.30, 8.41) and negatively associated with daily minutes of motor vehicle travel (b -3.72; 95CI -3.86, -1.55). These associations remained significant after further adjustment for daily walking participation and duration. More research is needed to understand the pathways by which street integration positively and or negatively affects sedentary behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4283725459,"Computational modeling of electrophysiological properties of the rabbit heart is a commonly used way to enhance and/or complement findings from classic lab work on single cell or tissue levels. Yet, thus far, there was no possibility to extend the scope to include the resulting body surface potentials as a way of validation or to investigate the effect of certain pathologies. Based on CT imaging, we developed the first openly available computational geometrical model not only of the whole heart but also the complete torso of the rabbit. Additionally, we fabricated a 32-lead ECG-vest to record body surface potential signals of the aforementioned rabbit. Based on the developed geometrical model and the measured signals, we then optimized the activation sequence of the ventricles, recreating the functionality of the Purkinje network, and we investigated different apico-basal and transmural gradients in action potential duration. Optimization of the activation sequence resulted in an average root mean square error between measured and simulated signal of 0.074 mV/ms for all leads. The best-fit T-Wave, compared to measured data (0.038 mV/ms), resulted from incorporating an action potential duration gradient from base to apex with a respective shortening of 20 ms and a transmural gradient with a shortening of 15 ms from endocardium to epicardium. By making our model and measured data openly available, we hope to give other researchers the opportunity to verify their research, as well as to create the possibility to investigate the impact of electrophysiological alterations on body surface signals for translational research."
https://openalex.org/W4283726940,"Background In some situations it is necessary to use biometry from the fellow eye for lens power calculation prior to cataract surgery. The purpose of this study was to analyse the lateral differences in biometric measurements and their impact on the lens power calculation. Methods The analysis was based on a large dataset of 19,472 measurements of 9736 patients prior to cataract surgery with complete biometric data of both left and right eyes extracted from the IOLMaster 700. After randomly indexing the left or right eye as primary (P) and secondary (S), the differences between S and P eye were recorded and analysed (Keratometry (RSEQ), total keratometry (TRSEQ) and back surface power (BRSEQ)), axial length AL, corneal thickness CCT, anterior chamber depth ACD, lens thickness LT). Lens power was calculated with the Castrop formula for all P and S eyes, and the refraction was predicted using both the P and S eye biometry for the lens power calculation. Results Lateral differences (S-P, 90% confidence interval) ranged between -0.64 to 0.63 dpt / -0.67 to 0.66 dpt / -0.12 to 0.12 dpt for RSEQ / TRSEQ / BRSEQ. The respective difference in AL / CCT / ACD / LT ranged between -0.46 to 0.43 mm / -0.01 to 0.01 mm / -0.20 to 0.20 mm / -0.13 to 0.14 mm. The resulting difference in lens power and predicted refraction ranged between -2.02 to 2.00 dpt and -1.36 to 1.30 dpt where the biometry of the S eye is used instead of the P eye. The AL and RSEQ were identified as the most critical parameters where the biometry of the fellow eye is used. Conclusion Despite a strong similarity of both eyes, intraocular lens power calculation with fellow eye biometry could yield different results for the lens power and finally for the predicted refraction. In 10% of cases, the lens power derived from the S eye deviates by 2 dpt or more, resulting in a refraction deviation of 1.36 dpt or more."

Based on the panel data of 31 provinces in mainland China, this paper empirically analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of UTT levels from 2011 to 2019 and estimates the influencing factors using the spatial Durbin model (SDM) with an economic spatial weighting matrix from the perspective of innovation ecosystems. The results are presented as follows: (1) Although the overall level of UTT in China is low, it shows an upward trend in most provinces. In addition, the interprovincial gap is obvious, forming a ladder distribution of UTT levels increasing from west to east. (2) There is a significant spatial autocorrelation between UTT levels in the provinces. (3) Industry, economy, and informatization play significant roles in promoting UTT, while financial institutes and openness have significant inhibitory effects. The economy has a significant spatial spillover effect on UTT, while government, industry and informatization have a significant inhibitory effect on UTT in neighboring regions. (4) The direct and indirect effects of influencing factors in the Eastern Region and other regions show significant spatial heterogeneity."

This study aims to deepen knowledge on the topic by measuring the behavioral effects of notification badges on a large sample of smartphone users. More precisely, the goal of the study is to observe if the presence of notification badges increases the frequency of clicks on apps. More than 1000 participants were involved in a remote between-subjects experiment, allocated into fifteen equinumerous groups of comparison. Each participant was presented with a smartphone screen displaying fifteen app icons and just one badge notification. Participants were asked to perform a remote user test called First Impression Click Test: a methodology that indicates where they would click first to accomplish a given task (i.e., Where would you click first on this screen ?). Our results show a large increase in the number of clicks on apps with notification badges compared to those without notification badges and suggest the important ability of these small affordances to attract attention and stimulate action. Based on the evidence provided, our findings have practical implications for user experience design."
https://openalex.org/W4283732595,"Patients with colorectal cancer have a high risk of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) due to chronic tumour induced blood loss, a reduced dietary iron intake from poor nutrition or gastrointestinal malabsorption. This pilot, double blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) examined the effect and feasibility of using preoperative iron isomaltoside for treating iron deficiency anaemia.Forty eligible adults with IDA were randomised to receive either intravenous iron isomaltoside (20 mg.kg-1 up to 1000 mg over 30 minutes) or usual preoperative care (control) three weeks before scheduled colorectal surgery. The primary outcomes were perioperative changes in haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations.The recruitment rate was 78% of all eligible referred patients (1.9 patients/month). The haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations were higher in the iron isomaltoside group than the control group over the perioperative period (group*time interaction P = 0.042 and P < 0.001 respectively). Mean haemoglobin change from baseline to before surgery was higher in the iron isomaltoside group (7.8, 95% CI: 3.2 to 12.3 g.l-1) than the control group (1.7, 95% CI: -1.9 to 5.3 g.l-1) [mean difference 6.1, 95% CI: 0.3 to 11.8 g.l-1; P = 0.040]. The ferritin change from baseline to before surgery between groups was large in favour of the iron isomaltoside group (mean difference 296.9, 95% CI: 200.6 to 393.2 μg.l-1; P < 0.001]. There were no differences between groups in packed red blood cell transfusions needed, surgical complications, quality of recovery and days (alive and) at home within 30 days after surgery.Iron isomaltoside therapy was safe and had a minimal effect on perioperative changes in haemoglobin concentration. Given the slow recruitment and new evidence emerging during the conduct of this study, conducting a multi-centre RCT based on the current pilot trial protocol is unlikely to be feasible.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03565354."
https://openalex.org/W4283733334,"How women are cared for while having a baby can have lasting effects on their lives. Women value relational care with continuity-when caregivers get to know them as individuals. Despite evidence of benefit and global policy support, few maternity care systems across the world routinely offer relational continuity. Women experiencing socioeconomic adversity have least access to good quality maternity care. Community-based doula support programs offer complementary care for these women and are known to, on average, have positive outcomes. Less understood is how, when, and why these programs work. A realist evaluation of an Australian volunteer doula program explored these questions. The program provides free social, emotional, and practical support by trained doulas during pregnancy, birth, and early parenting. This paper reports the testing and refinement of one program theory from the larger study. The theory, previously developed from key informant interviews and rapid realist review of literature, hypothesised that support increased a woman's confidence via two possible pathways-by being with her and enabling her to see her own strength and value; and by praising her, and her feeling validated as a mother. This study aimed to test the theory in realist interviews with clients, focus groups with doulas, and with routinely collected pre-post data. Seven English-speaking and six Arabic-speaking clients were interviewed, and two focus groups with a total of eight doulas were conducted, in January-February 2020. Qualitative data were analysed in relation to the hypothesised program theory. Quantitative data were analysed for differential outcomes. Formal theories of Recognition and Relational reflexivity supported explanatory understanding. The refined program theory, Recognition, explains how and when a doula's recognition of a woman, increases confidence, or not. Five context-mechanism-outcome configurations lead to five outcomes that differ by nature and longevity, including absence of felt confidence."
https://openalex.org/W4283736729,"There are several effective self-report instruments used by Chinese researchers to retrospectively assess exposure to childhood maltreatment. However, these measures do not assess the timing of exposure, restricting efforts to identify periods of development when childhood maltreatment maximally increases vulnerability to psychopathology and health outcomes. In the current study we created a Chinese version of the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale, which assesses multiplicity (number of types of maltreatment experienced) and severity of maltreatment as well as when it occurred during childhood and adolescence. Rasch modeling was used for scale development in a sample of 812 undergraduate students. Item reduction analysis of the original 75 items produced a 58-item Chinese version with ten subdimensions. The new scale showed good three-week test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the revised Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACEQ-R). Variance decomposition analyses found that compared to the CTQ and ACE, the MACE Severity and Multiplicity scores explained higher variance in self-reported depression and anxiety symptom ratings on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The results of the present study confirmed that the Chinese version of the MACE has sound psychometric properties in the Chinese cultural context. This new instrument will be a valuable tool for Chinese researchers, psychiatrists and psychologists to ascertain the type and timing of exposure to maltreatment."

This study aimed to identify factors associated with well-being in young people with psychiatric disorders, during early phase of COVID-19 lockdown in France.A national cross-sectional online study started on the 8th day of COVID-19 lockdown in France (during March 25-30, 2020). We included young people aged from 16 to 29 who responded to the questionnaire, living and being confined in France, with past or current psychiatric treatment. The questionnaire was accessible online and explored demographics and clinical factors, well-being, stress, situation during lockdown. Well-being was measured by the Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were carried out.439 individuals were included with 262 (59.7%) previously treated and 177 (40.3%) currently treated. WEMWBS total score were 42.48 (9.05). Feeling of useful was the most affected dimension. Well-being was positively correlated with: currently working on site, physical activity, abilities to cope with difficulties, family and social supports (p<0.05). It was negatively correlated with: elevated stress level, anxious ruminations, dissatisfaction with information, difficulties to sleep or reorganize daily life, feeling supported by medicines (p<0.05). No individual factor was correlated with well-being. The stepwise linear multivariate model had simple R2 coefficient of determination of 0.535.In the specific population of young people with psychiatric disorders, factors associated with well-being at early stage of lockdown were mainly psychosocial and related to brutal disorganisation of daily life."
https://openalex.org/W4283750667,"Within the last decade, archaeogenetic analysis has revolutionized archaeological research and enabled novel insights into mobility, relatedness and health of past societies. Now, it is possible to develop these results further and integrate archaeogenetic insights into biological relatedness with radiocarbon dates as means of chronologically sequenced information. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of combining relative chronological information with absolute radiocarbon dates by Bayesian interpretation in order to improve age determinations. Using artificial pedigrees with four sets of simulated radiocarbon dates we show that the combination of relationship information with radiocarbon dates improves the age determination in many cases at least between 20 to 50%. Calibrated age ranges are more constrained than simply calibrating radiocarbon ages independently from each other. Thereby, the precision of modelled ages depends on the precision of the single radiocarbon dates, the number of modelled generations, the shape of the calibration curve and the availability of samples that can be precisely fixed in time due to specific patterns in the calibration curve (“anchor points”). Ambiguous calibrated radiocarbon dates, which are caused by inversions of the calibration curve, can be partly or almost entirely resolved through Bayesian modelling based upon information from pedigrees. Finally, we discuss selected case studies of biological pedigrees achieved for Early Bronze Age Southern Germany by recent archaeogenetic analysis, whereby the sites and pedigrees differ with regard to the quality of information, which can be used for a Bayesian model of the radiocarbon dates. In accordance with the abstract models, radiocarbon dates can again be better constrained and are therefore more applicable for archaeological interpretation and chronological placement of the dated individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4283752458,"Election forecasting has been traditionally dominated by subjective surveys and polls or methods centered upon them. We have developed a novel platform for forecasting elections based on agent-based modeling (ABM), which is entirely independent from surveys and polls. The platform uses statistical results from objective data along with simulation models to capture how voters have voted in past elections and how they are likely to vote in an upcoming election. We screen for models that can reproduce results that are very close to the actual results of historical elections and then deploy these selected models to forecast an upcoming election with simulations by combining extrapolated data from historical demographic record and more updated data on economic growth, employment, shock events, and other factors. Here, we report the results of two recent experiments of real-time election forecasting: the 2020 general election in Taiwan and six states in the 2020 general election in the United States. Our mostly objective method using ABM may transform how elections are forecasted and studied."
https://openalex.org/W4283715425,"Objectives This study aimed to examine the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death according to blood pressure levels and systolic and/or diastolic hypertension. Methods From 20,636 cohort participants, 14,375 patients were enrolled after patients with prior hypertension on antihypertensive drugs were excluded. For the combination analysis, participants were divided into four groups (systolic/diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension only, diastolic hypertension only, and non-hypertension). The risk of CV death was calculated using the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in a Cox regression model. Results The risk of CVD death increased in systolic hypertension (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.26–2.00) and systolic/diastolic hypertension (HR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.51–2.25). The highest risks of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were observed in the diastolic hypertension (HR = 4.11, 95% CI 1.40–12.06) and systolic/diastolic hypertension groups (HR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.92–3.50), respectively. The risk of CVD death was drastically increased in those with SBP≥120 mmHg/DBP≥80 mmHg. The highest risk was observed in those with SBP of 130–131 mmHg and 134–137 mmHg. Conclusion The combined analysis of systolic and/or diastolic hypertension appears to be a good predictor of CVD death. The risk of CVD death in the prehypertensive group could be carefully monitored as well as in the hypertensive group, presumably due to less attention and the lack of antihypertensive treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4283718593,"A motivational downturn in mathematics during secondary school has been well documented for many students. As a way to address this, creating personally relevant tasks is supposed to increase students’ motivation for mathematical tasks. According to recent research, topics relating to affiliation, achievement, and power are personally relevant for young people. Prior research showed that motive imagery in school tasks increases students’ task-related intrinsic value and success expectancies. The present study examined the effect of motive topics in word problems on students’ task performance. We contextualized mathematical tasks either with affiliation, achievement, and power topics or with neutral topics not related to motive topics. The tasks were comparable regarding their mean word count, text, and mathematical complexity. In three experimental studies ( N 1 = 56, N 2 = 63, N 3 = 62), the students solved four tasks for each motive topic and neutral tasks, respectively. The dependent variables were task performance, intrinsic values, and expectancies of success. Repeated measures analyses of variance with the four-level, within-subjects factor motive imagery revealed positive effects of motive imagery in word problems on students’ task performance. This was particularly true for achievement-related tasks compared with neutral tasks. The results also indicated slightly positive effects for affiliation-related word problems on students’ performance. In addition, the intrinsic value for affiliation-related (Experiment 1) and achievement-related tasks (Experiment 3) was higher than for neutral tasks. Power imagery did not affect students’ task performance; it negatively affected students’ intrinsic value compared with neutral tasks. Task-related success expectancies were not influenced by motive imagery. The present study replicates and extends previous findings that indicate that tasks referring to affiliation and achievement imagery are more appealing to students and can benefit their performance."
https://openalex.org/W4283718854,"Introduction Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of about 18.0% among malignant tumors worldwide, and chemotherapy is the main treatment. 80% of patients receiving chemotherapy suffers from cancer-related fatigue, which is the most severe symptom, with a large effect on quality of life as well as prognosis. Oral Chinese medicine, a kind of complementary and alternative medicine, has been proved to benefit lung cancer patients. However, no studies have reviewed whether it can reduce fatigue in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy, which is the purpose of our study. Methods Two reviewers will systematically and independently retrieve papers, select studies for inclusion, extract data, and assess risk of bias. The following nine databases will be searched: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Chinese biomedical literature service system, PubMed, Web of Science, OVID, Scopus, and EMBASE from inception to February, 2022. Included studies will only be randomized controlled trials. Primary outcome is cancer-related fatigue. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, immunologic function, and the incidence of adverse events. We will use RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias and RevMan to analyze data. Risk ratios will be calculated for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data. Random-effect model will be used to integrate statistical effects. Meta-regression, subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be carried out. We will evaluate the strength and overall quality of evidence with four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Results The review of current evidence of oral Chinese medicine on cancer-related fatigue for lung cancer patients after chemotherapy will be narratively summarized and quantitatively analyzed. Conclusion The definitive conclusion will help physicians to determine whether oral Chinese medicine is an effective treatment for reducing fatigue in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy in clinical settings.

While high attrition and mortality account for some of the shortcomings in identifying HIV-infected infants early and putting them on life-saving treatment, fragmented and challenging laboratory systems are an added barrier. We sought to determine the accuracy of using HIV viral load assays for infant diagnosis of HIV.We enrolled 866 Ugandan infants between March-April 2018 for this study after initial laboratory diagnosis. The median age was seven months, while 33% of infants were less than three months of age. Study testing was done using either the Roche or Abbott molecular technologies at the Central Public Health Laboratory. Dried blood spot samples were prepared according to manufacturer-recommended protocols for both the qualitative and quantitative assays. Viral load test samples for the Roche assay were processed using two different buffers: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: free virus elution viral load protocol [FVE]) and Sample Pre-Extraction Reagent (SPEX: qualitative buffer). Dried blood spot samples were processed for both assays on the Abbott using the manufacturer's standard infant diagnosis protocol. All infants received a qualitative test for clinical management and additional paired quantitative tests.858 infants were included in the analysis, of which 50% were female. Over 75% of mothers received antiretroviral therapy, while approximately 65% of infants received infant prophylaxis. The Roche SPEX and Abbott technologies had high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>98%). The Roche FVE had lower sensitivity (85%) and viral load values.To simplify and streamline laboratory practices, HIV viral load may be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants, particularly using the Roche SPEX and Abbott technologies."

https://openalex.org/W4283733239,"Background China established the Tiered-network Healthcare Delivery System (THDS) in 2015 to address the disproportionate number of patients attending tertiary hospitals relative to primary- or secondary-care institutions. Although the reported number of outpatients visiting tertiary hospitals is slowly decreasing, numerous patients choose to visit them regardless of their disease’s severity. To effectively implement the THDS, this article explored the relationship between patients’ sociodemographic and belief characteristics and their healthcare-seeking behavioral decision-making in China. Methods Data obtained through questionnaires were analyzed using decision tree and logistic regression models to explore outpatients’ characteristics and medical decision-making using comprehensive feature data. Moreover, further statistical analyses were conducted on the outpatient data obtained from the regional population health platform in Jiaxing, China. Results The decision tree model revealed that whether outpatients have medical insurance is the primary factor guiding their healthcare-seeking behaviors, with those without medical insurance more likely to choose primary or secondary hospitals to treat minor diseases. For those with medical insurance, profession is the main factor, with industrial workers more inclined to choose primary or secondary hospitals for minor diseases. The logistic regression analyses revealed that outpatients without insurance and who were not freelancers or individual owners were more likely to choose primary or secondary hospitals for minor diseases. Further statistical analysis of the data from the Jiaxing population health platform showed that, for minor or general diseases, outpatients without medical insurance and employed as farmers tended to choose primary and secondary hospitals over tertiary hospitals. Conclusion The three analyses yielded consistent results: in China, medical insurance and patients’ profession are the most important factors guiding outpatients’ healthcare-seeking behaviors. Accordingly, we propose that the government should focus on economic reforms to increase outpatients’ visits to primary and secondary hospitals and diagnosis-related groups’ payment of medical insurance to decrease the admittance of patients with minor diseases in large tertiary hospitals. Meanwhile, the government should correct patients’ belief prejudice about selecting hospitals through corresponding publicity."

Three hundred and fifty hypertensive patients participated in this study through a structured questionnaire and EQ 5D 5L. 211(60.28%) participants had stage 1, and 139 (39.7%) had stage 2 hypertension. No participants reported severe problems in any domain on EQ 5D 5L. Generalize Linear Model (GLM) was used to assess the association between HRQoL and SDECVs. The mean utility and VAS score was 0.64 (±0.15) and 63.17 (±11.01) respectively. The participants of the stage 1 hypertension group had a significantly better score on each domain of EQ 5D 5L as compared to stage 1 (0.027, 0.010, 0.00, 0.00, 0.048). No participant in either group reported extreme problems in any domain. Among socio-demographic factors, the males, non-smokers, income sharing, and healthy normal hypertensive patients had better HRQoL (0.009, 0.016, 0.019, and 0.003). A lower cost of treatment was also associated with better HRQoL (0.017). Among clinical variables, stage 1 hypertension had better HRQoL than stage 2(0.035). The number of prescribed antihypertensive drugs had no effect on the quality of life (0.253), however, the non-pharmacologic interventions such as reduction in salt and oil consumption (0.035), reduction in beverages consumption (0.0014) and increased water intake (0.010) had resulted in better QoL. The patients who reported dizziness had poor HRQoL while patients who had cardiac problems and diabetes reported a significantly lower EQ-VAS score. The effect of gender on the HRQoL of hypertensive patients who had comorbid conditions was significant in the case of renal, respiratory, visual problems, and dizziness where females had a lesser utility score than males. The study reports on significant determinants which should be taken into account in an attempt to improve the health-related quality of life of hypertensive patients."

Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted to assess the KAP of the community. Results In total, 186 responses were received. Among the respondents, 130 (69·9%) were men, and the mean age was 51.1 (14·3). Nine (4·8%) respondents reported having experienced tick bites. Of the respondents, 44 (23.7%) knew about both scrub typhus and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, while 156 (83·9%) and 71 (38·2%) recognized limiting skin exposure and use of insect repellents as preventive measures, respectively. The attitudes towards TBDs: being worried about tick bites (p = 0·018) and interested in preventing TBDs (p = 0·001), were significantly higher among women than men. About 75% of the respondents reported taking preventive measures against tick bites, and limiting skin exposure was the most frequently applied method (69·9%). Insect repellents were used by 58 (31·2%) respondents. Age (p = 0·049), being worried about tick bites (p = 0·046), and knowledge of ticks score (p = 0·024) were the significant independent predictors of practicing countermeasures. Conclusion We identified gaps in knowledge and practices regarding TBDs. Public health interventions should be implemented to improve public awareness of TBDs."
https://openalex.org/W4283753597,"Background Unmarried women who report less recent sexual intercourse (&gt;30 days from survey enumeration) are largely excluded from global health monitoring and evaluation efforts. This study investigated level and contextual factors in modern contraceptive utilization and unmet need within this overlooked female subpopulation in Kenya from 2014 to 2019. Methods This study analyzed data from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) survey in Kenya, a nationally representative survey of female respondents, to understand the level and contextual factors for family planning utilization and unmet need within female subgroups including married, unmarried sexually active (defined as sexual intercourse within 30 days of survey enumeration), and unmarried with less recent sexual intercourse (defined as sexual intercourse 1–12 months prior to survey enumeration). The analysis included multilevel regression modeling to assess correlates on outcomes of modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), unmet need, and recent emergency contractive pill (ECP) use, which is a unique PMA question: “ Have you used emergency contraception at any time in the last 12 months ?”. Results Cumulatively, the surveys enumerated 19,161 women and this weighted analysis included 12,574 women aged 15–49 from three female subgroups: 9,860 married women (78.4%), 1,020 unmarried sexually active women (8.1%), and 1,694 unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse (13.5%). In 2019, while controlling for covariates, unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse exhibited statistically significant differences (p-value&lt;0.02) in current mCPR, mCPR at last sexual intercourse, unmet need for modern contraceptives, and recent ECP use. As compared to an unmarried woman with less recent sexual intercourse (i.e., reported sex 1–12 months prior to survey), the odds of an unmarried sexually active woman (i.e., reported sex within last 30 days of survey) currently using modern contraceptives was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.64, 3.18), using modern contraceptives at last sexual intercourse was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.95), and having an unmet need for modern contraceptives was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.13) while controlling for covariates. The odds of a married woman using ECP during the last 12 months was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.82) as compared to an unmarried woman with less recent sexual intercourse. In 2019, unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse reported the highest rate of ECP use during the last 12 months at 13.5%, which was similar for unmarried sexually active women at 13.3%. Since 2014, summary measures of unmet need and total demand for modern contraceptives increased for unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse, but declined for the other female subgroups. Conclusion In Kenya, unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse exhibited significantly different contraceptive utilization, unmet need, and recent emergency contraceptive use. Moreover, changes over time in key family planning indicators were asymmetrical by female subgroup. This study identifies an important monitoring gap regarding unmarried women with less recent sexual intercourse. Evidence dissemination by the global measurement community for these unmarried women is exceedingly scarce; therefore, developing an inclusive research agenda and actionable information about these marginalized women is needed to enable targeted planning and equitable service delivery."

In this study, three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (g.-1293C>G located in the 5'-flanking region, g.56T>C in exon I, and g.7017C>T in exon XII) of the C3 gene were detected using created restriction site polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and DNA sequencing in 952 cattle from three Chinese breeds. The genotypes and haplotypes were analyzed to investigate the polymorphisms and their possible implications, with particular investigative focus on their associations with serum C3 level, complement hemolytic activity (CH50 and ACH50), and milk production traits. The g.56T>C SNP in exon I affected the serum ACH50 (P<0.01) and the milk somatic cell score (SCS) (P<0.05), and the g.7017C>T SNP in exon XII significantly affected the serum ACH50 values (P<0.01). Moreover, statistical analyses revealed that individuals with genotypic combination CCC/GCC showed significantly lower SCS and the lowest C3 concentration in serum compared with cows with CCC/GTT (P = 0.0007) and CTT/CTT (P = 0.0021); the individuals with CCC/CCT had significantly higher ACH50 values than those with CCC/CTC (P = 0.0008) and CTC/GTC (P = 0.001); cows with CCT/CTT had higher values of CH50 and 305-day milk yield (P>0.05). The C3 expression levels were significantly increased in lung and mammary tissues (P<0.05), while significantly decreased in heart, spleen, liver, and kidney tissues in mastitis cows compared with those in healthy animals (P<0.01), respectively. Bacterial counts of serum antibacterial activities were also completed to verify the effect of SNPs on resistance to mastitis pathogens. Genetically resistant cows (CCC/GCC) had serum with noticeably higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli in vitro than the genetically susceptible CCC/GTT cows (P<0.05). Results from this study imply that the C3 gene plays a role in resistance to bacterial infection and that it can be used as a molecular marker for complement activity and traits related to milk production."
https://openalex.org/W4283766595,"Suicide has a wide reaching and devastating impact on society. This article presents a study protocol for a systematic review of the literature on community and bystander interventions to reduce the incidence of suicide. These interventions are focused on people other than the person at-risk and are designed to increase awareness of warning signs and knowledge of how to most effectively respond. While there have been many studies undertaken on community and bystander intervention programs, we lack a synthesis of evidence regarding how an effective program is created and implemented. The proposed systematic review will address this gap by presenting the first comprehensive review on this topic. The specific aims of the review are to: (1) determine whether community and bystander interventions effectively increase bystander action to prevent suicide and, if so; (2) to understand what creates an effective community suicide intervention. The insights gathered will inform policy and guide investment in better evidence-based suicide interventions for the future."
