https://openalex.org/W3011483298,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3026418408,"Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited. In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously1,2,3. Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21–68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness."

https://openalex.org/W3019281170,"Engaging the nucleosome Cell identity is defined by gene expression patterns that are established through the binding of specific transcription factors. However, nucleosomal units limit access of transcription factors to specific DNA motifs within the mammalian genome. To study how transcription factors bind such chromatinized, nucleosome-embedded motifs, Michael et al. focused on the pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2. They systematically quantified the relative affinities of these factors at different motif positions throughout the nucleosome, enabling structure determination of OCT4-SOX2–bound nucleosomes by cryo–electron microscopy. OCT4 and SOX2 bound cooperatively to strengthen DNA-binding affinity and resulted in DNA distortions that destabilized the nucleosome. This analysis reveals position-dependent binding modes that were validated in vivo, providing insights on how transcription factors read out chromatinized motifs. Science , this issue p. 1460"

Because these “hedgehog”-like textures are robust, can be manipulated, and can interact, there is an interest in pursuing them for memory and logic applications. Skyrmions can also be generated in thin metal layers under optical excitation, but detailed information about the vectorial dynamics of these surface plasmon polariton skyrmions is so far lacking. Davis et al. used a time-resolved photoelectron vector microscope to image their spatiotemporal dynamics, piecing together movies as the skyrmions propagated across the surface of a perfect gold crystal. Access to dynamics with such high spatial and temporal resolution could help in controlling other nanophotonic systems. Science , this issue p. eaba6415"
https://openalex.org/W3020785484,"Some calcium is required for binding The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) coordinates food intake and energy expenditure and is a target for treating obesity. MC4R is an unusual G protein–coupled receptor, in part because it binds either an endogenous agonist or an endogenous antagonist, leading to reduced appetite or increased food intake, respectively. Yu et al. determined the structure of MC4R bound to an antagonist (see the Perspective by Chaturvedi and Shukla). This structure revealed a calcium ion coordinated by the receptor and the antagonist. Biochemical studies showed that the calcium ion also increased the affinity for endogenous agonist, which translated into increased potency. The authors also confirm a previous finding that MC4R directly couples to the ion channel Kir7.1 and regulates channel gating. Science , this issue p. 428 ; see also p. 369"
https://openalex.org/W3018232557,"Across time, but also across space Fossils, especially those from marine systems, have long been used to estimate changes in patterns of diversity over time. However, fossils are patchy in their occurrence, so such temporal estimates generally have not included variations due to space. Such a singular examination has the potential to simplify, or even misrepresent, patterns. Close et al. used a spatially explicit approach to measure diversity changes in marine fossils across time and space. They found that, like modern systems, diversity varies considerably across space, with reefs increasing diversity levels. Accounting for this spatial-environmental variation will shed new light on the study of diversity over time. Science , this issue p. 420"

The major components of the cell wall include complex heteropolysaccharides that are synthesized in the periplasmic space. Zhang et al. determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of two transmembrane glycosyltransferase enzyme complexes that use a lipid-anchored sugar donor to append arabinose units to the cell wall polysaccharides. They also captured the anti-TB drug ethambutol bound within these complexes and observed that it binds in a site overlapping both donor and acceptor sugars. Mapping of resistance mutants provides a structural understanding of how resistance emerges while preserving function of the enzyme and may help to guide the development of next-generation anti-TB drugs that target these enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W3020490292,"One guanosine determines transcript fate Transcripts of the HIV-1 RNA genome can be either spliced and translated into viral proteins or packaged into new virions as a progeny genome. The path taken depends on whether the transcript contains one guanosine at the 5′ terminus (1G) rather than two or three (2G or 3G). Brown et al. used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that 1G transcripts adopt a dimeric structure that sequesters a terminal cap required for translation and splicing but exposes sites that bind to the HIV-1 Gag protein, which recruits the genome during viral assembly. Conversely, 2G or 3G transcripts have the cap accessible, but Gag-binding sites are sequestered. Therefore, a single guanosine acts as a conformational switch to determine the fate of HIV-1 transcripts. Science , this issue p. 413"
https://openalex.org/W3020539984,"Background The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), works to ensure accessible, quality, health care for the nation’s underserved populations, especially those who are medically, economically, or geographically vulnerable. HRSA-designated primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (pcHPSAs) provide a vital measure by which to identify underserved populations and prioritize locations and populations lacking access to adequate primary and preventive health care–the foundation for advancing health equity and maintaining health and wellness for individuals and populations. However, access to care is a complex, multifactorial issue that involves more than just the number of health care providers available, and pcHPSAs alone cannot fully characterize the distribution of medically, economically, and geographically vulnerable populations. Methods and findings In this county-level analysis, we used descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis to assess how HRSA’s pcHPSA designations align geographically with other established markers of medical, economic, and geographic vulnerability. Reflecting recognized social determinants of health (SDOH), markers included demographic characteristics, race and ethnicity, rates of low birth weight births, median household income, poverty, educational attainment, and rurality. Nationally, 96 percent of U.S. counties were either classified as whole county or partial county pcHPSAs or had one or more established markers of medical, economic, or geographic vulnerability in 2017, suggesting that at-risk populations were nearly ubiquitous throughout the nation. Primary care HPSA counties in HHS Regions 4 and 6 (largely lying within the southeastern and south central United States) had the most pervasive and complex patterns in population risk. Conclusion HHS Regions displayed unique signatures with respect to SDOH markers. Descriptive and analytic findings from our work may help inform health workforce and health care planning at all levels, and, by illustrating both the complexity of and differences in county-level population characteristics in pcHPSA counties, our findings may have relevance for strengthening the delivery of primary care and addressing social determinants of health in areas beset by provider shortages."

This phenomenon, known as super-rotation, requires a continuous input of angular momentum, from an unknown source, to overcome friction with the surface. Horinouchi et al. mapped the planet's winds using ultraviolet observations of Venus' clouds from the orbiting Akatsuki spacecraft (see the Perspective by Lebonnois). They incorporated these data into a global model of angular momentum transport in the atmosphere, finding that the super-rotation is maintained through thermal tides driven by solar heating.

https://openalex.org/W3020339374,"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by various actinomycetes or fungi. The disease is characterized by the formation of tumor like-swellings and grains. Senegal is an endemic country where mycetoma cases are under-or misdiagnosed due to the lack of capacities and knowledge among health workers and the community; and where the management of eumycetoma, burdened by a high amputation rate, is currently inadequate. This study aimed to update data on the epidemiology of mycetoma cases diagnosed in three hospital centres in Senegal over a 10 years-period. A total of 193 patients, diagnosed from 2008 to 2018, were included in the study. The most frequent presentation was eumycetoma (47.2%); followed by actinomycetoma (36.8%); it remained undetermined in 16.1% of the patients. The mean age was 38.3 years (68.4% of the patients were between 15 and 45 years-old); the male: female ratio was a 2.94; and most were farmers. One hundred fifty-six (80.8%) patients had used phytotherapy before attending the hospital. Mycetoma was mainly located to the lower limbs (91.2%). Grains were observed in 85% of the patients; including white (25.6%) and yellow (4.3%) grains. The etiological diagnosis was complex, resulting in negative direct microscopy, culture and/or histopathology findings, which explains that 16.1% remained uncharacterized. In most of cases, actinomycetoma were treated with a combination of cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and streptomycin; whereas eumycetoma cases were treated with terbinafine. The surgery was done in 100 (51.8%) of the patients including 9 in actinomycetoma, 78 in eumycetoma and 13 in undetermined form. The high number of uncharacterized mycetoma in this study, the delay in attending a qualified health-care facility, and the lack of available adequate antifungal drug, point out the need to strengthen mycetoma management capacities in Senegal."
https://openalex.org/W2951610934,"Background This study aimed to determine the costs and distribution of healthcare spending of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at stages 3 and 4 and on dialysis both at the individual and population level in Germany. Methods The study took the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) system and analyzed claims data on 3,687,015 insurees from the year 2014. To extrapolate costs to the whole SHI population, a literature search on the prevalence of CKD was conducted. Results Average costs per person per year in an age- and gender-matched control group of the normal population were €2,876 (95% confidence interval [CI], €2,798 to €2,955) and ≥2.8-fold higher in CKD patients (€8,030 [95% CI, €7,848 to €8,212] at CKD stage 3, €9,760 [95% CI, €9,266 to €10,255] at CKD stage 4, and €44,374 [95% CI, €43,608 to €45,139] on dialysis). At CKD stages 3 and 4 the major cost driver was hospitalizations, contributing to more than 50% of total expenditures. Among dialysis patients, hospitalizations and dialysis-treatment costs contributed to 23% and 53% of total healthcare spending, respectively. At CKD stages 3 and 4, patients with the highest 20% of healthcare spending showed a considerable increase in per-patient costs over the reference population, while the bottom 80% of patients generated only moderately higher per-patient costs (p < 0.001). Comparing total CKD costs to total SHI expenditures yields that 10.2% of SHI expenditures was driven by patients at CKD stages 3 and 4 and 1.6% by dialysis patients. Conclusions Healthcare spending of patients with CKD at stages 3 and 4 and on dialysis is concentrated among a small number of high-need patients. As hospitalizations and dialysis treatment are key drivers of total expenditures, strategies that lead to a reduction in hospitalizations, delay in dialysis onset, or increase in the availability of kidney donors should become important considerations by policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W3017511212,"COPD is a prevalent lung disease with significant impacts on public health. Affected airways exhibit pulmonary neutrophilia and consequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases, which result in lung emphysema. Probiotics act as nonspecific modulators of the innate immune system that improve several inflammatory responses. To investigate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (Lr) on cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD C57Bl/6 mice were treated with Lr during the week before COPD induction and three times/week until euthanasia. For in vitro assays, murine bronchial epithelial cells as well as human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract during 24 hours were treated with Lr 1 hour before CSE addition. Lr treatment attenuated the inflammatory response both in the airways and lung parenchyma, reducing inflammatory cells infiltration and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Also, Lr-treated mice presented with lower metalloproteases in lung tissue and lung remodeling. In parallel to the reduction in the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, STAT3, and NF-κB in lung tissue, Lr increased the levels of IL-10 as well as SOCS3 and TIMP1/2, indicating the induction of an anti-inflammatory environment. Similarly, murine bronchial epithelial cells as well as human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS) exposed to CSE produced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which were inhibited by Lr treatment in association with the production of anti-inflammatory molecules. Moreover, the presence of Lr also modulated the expression of COPD-associated transcription found into BALF of COPD mice group, i.e., Lr downregulated expression of NF-κB and STAT3, and inversely upregulated increased expression of SOCS3. Thus, our findings indicate that Lr modulates the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human bronchial epithelial cells upon CS exposure and it can be a useful tool to improve the lung inflammatory response associated with COPD."

https://openalex.org/W3019541949,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage accompanied by the new bone formation and, often, a synovial proliferation that culminates in pain, loss of joint function, and disability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of OA progression and the relative contributions of cartilage, bone, and synovium remain unclear. We recently found that the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein periostin (Postn, or osteoblast-specific factor, OSF-2) is expressed at high levels in human OA cartilage. Multiple groups have also reported elevated expression of Postn in several rodent models of OA. We have previously reported that in vitro Postn promotes collagen and proteoglycan degradation in human chondrocytes through AKT/β-catenin signaling and downstream activation of MMP-13 and ADAMTS4 expression. Here we show that Postn induces collagen and proteoglycan degradation in cartilage by signaling through discoidin domain receptor-1 (DDR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase. The genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 in mouse chondrocytes blocks Postn-induced MMP-13 expression. These data show that Postn is signaling though DDR1 is mechanistically involved in OA pathophysiology. Specific inhibitors of DDR1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to treat OA."
https://openalex.org/W3019629204,"Ruminant methane production is a significant energy loss to the animal and major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, it also seems necessary for effective rumen function, so studies of anti-methanogenic treatments must also consider implications for feed efficiency. Between-animal variation in feed efficiency represents an alternative approach to reducing overall methane emissions intensity. Here we assess the effects of dietary additives designed to reduce methane emissions on the rumen microbiota, and explore relationships with feed efficiency within dietary treatment groups. Seventy-nine finishing steers were offered one of four diets (a forage/concentrate mixture supplemented with nitrate (NIT), lipid (MDDG) or a combination (COMB) compared to the control (CTL)). Rumen fluid samples were collected at the end of a 56 d feed efficiency measurement period. DNA was extracted, multiplexed 16s rRNA libraries sequenced (Illumina MiSeq) and taxonomic profiles were generated. The effect of dietary treatments and feed efficiency (within treatment groups) was conducted both overall (using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and diversity indexes) and for individual taxa. Diet affected overall microbial populations but no overall difference in beta-diversity was observed. The relative abundance of Methanobacteriales (Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera) increased in MDDG relative to CTL, whilst VadinCA11 (Methanomassiliicoccales) was decreased. Trimethylamine precursors from rapeseed meal (only present in CTL) probably explain the differences in relative abundance of Methanomassiliicoccales. There were no differences in Shannon indexes between nominal low or high feed efficiency groups (expressed as feed conversion ratio or residual feed intake) within treatment groups. Relationships between the relative abundance of individual taxa and feed efficiency measures were observed, but were not consistent across dietary treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3020481705,"Quantifying the presence and environmental impact of invasive species is the starting point for research on management and nature conservation. North American beavers (Castor canadensis) were introduced to Argentina from Canada in 1946, and the species has been identified as a major agent of environmental change in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago in the Anthropocene. We studied the invasion status (distribution and density) of beavers through analyses of the dam densities in the Tierra del Fuego landscapes. We identified beaver dams with a GIS using visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery from Microsoft Bing, Google Earth and HERE and related them to natural environmental gradients. These factors comprised geographic (vegetation zones and distance to streams), climatic (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and net primary productivity) and topographic (elevation and slope) data. The datasets (dams and factors) were combined, and the data from the different zonation classes were subsequently compared using ANOVAs and Tukey's mean comparison tests. Deviations from the mean density (x mean density-x total mean density) were calculated to visualize the deviations for the studied factors. The datasets were also evaluated using principal component analyses (PCA). Our results showed a total of 206,203 beaver dams (100,951 in Argentina and 105,252 in Chile) in the study area (73,000 km2). The main island of Tierra del Fuego presented a greater degree of invasion (73.6% of the total study area) than the rest of the archipelago, especially in areas covered by mixed-evergreen and deciduous forests. The studied geographic, climatic and topographic factors showed positive trends (higher beaver preference) with beaver spread, which were all significant (p <0.05) when compared across the landscape. Although beavers are flexible in their habitat use, our empirical records showed that they had marked preferences and were positively influenced by the most productive forests. Here, we describe a scientific panorama that identified the drivers of species invasion based on satellite data and the available ecological datasets. The identification of such drivers could be useful for developing new tools for management and/or control strategies of the beavers in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W3018326882,"The circadian rhythm plays a central role in immune function, and its disruption has been closely linked to the etiology of depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between depression and circadian rhythm remain unclear. We found that mice deficient of Per2, a central clock component of circadian output, were resilient to neuroinflammation-induced depressive behavior. After repeated central lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections, MCP-1, MIP-1β, and RANTES increased in wild type (WT) but not in Per2-deficient mice. In addition, intracerebroventricular injection of RANTES resulted in depression-like behavior, and Met-RANTES, a CCR5 antagonist, could reverse depression-like behavior induced by LPS treatments. These results indicated that the Per2 gene contributes to depression via chemokines, especially RANTES. Furthermore, BMAL1 expression decreased in LPS-treated Per2-deficient mice and BMAL1 could bind to the promoter of Rantes, indicating clock gene can act as a regulator for neuroinflammation. In conclusion, Rantes, a clock-controlled gene (CCG), is involved in clock-immunological mechanisms underlying the effects of Per2 on neuroinflammation-induced depression-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3018863332,"Robust cellular models are key in determining pathological mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity in Huntington's disease (HD) and for high throughput pre-clinical screening of potential therapeutic compounds. Such models exist but mostly comprise non-human or non-neuronal cells that may not recapitulate the correct biochemical milieu involved in pathology. We have developed a new human neuronal cell model of HD, using neural stem cells (ReNcell VM NSCs) stably transduced to express exon 1 huntingtin (HTT) fragments with variable length polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts. Using a system with matched expression levels of exon 1 HTT fragments, we investigated the effect of increasing polyQ repeat length on HTT inclusion formation, location, neuronal survival, and mitochondrial function with a view to creating an in vitro screening platform for therapeutic screening. We found that expression of exon 1 HTT fragments with longer polyQ tracts led to the formation of intra-nuclear inclusions in a polyQ length-dependent manner during neurogenesis. There was no overt effect on neuronal viability, but defects of mitochondrial function were found in the pathogenic lines. Thus, we have a human neuronal cell model of HD that may recapitulate some of the earliest stages of HD pathogenesis, namely inclusion formation and mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3018368212,"Melanized fungi have been shown to thrive in environments with high radionuclide concentrations, which led to the association of the pigment melanin with the protection against ionizing radiation. Several hypotheses regarding the function of melanin have been proposed. Yet, the exact mechanism behind the protective property of melanin is unclear and poorly explored. A better understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in increasing the tolerance of the organisms to ionizing radiation could lead to technology transfer to human-related applications. Effective protection from radiation is essential for human space flight in general and human missions beyond Low Earth Orbit specifically. In this paper, we follow a biomimetic approach: we test two of current hypotheses and discuss how they could be applied to radiation shield designs. First we focus on the interaction of melanin with high energy electrons, which has been suspected to reduce the kinetic energy of the electrons through a cascade of collisions, thus providing physical shielding. Second, we investigate if the spatial arrangement of melanin, organized as a thin film or a collection of hollow micro-spheres, affects its shielding properties. To this end, we measured experimentally and by numerical simulations the attenuation of β-radiation as pass through solutions and suspensions of melanin and contrasted the values to the ones of cellulose, a substance with similar elemental composition. Further, we investigate the spatial arrangement hypothesis using Monte Carlo simulations. In agreement with the simulations, our experiments indicated that melanin does not provide improved shielding in comparison to cellulose from β-radiation. However, our simulations suggest a substantial effect of the spatial arrangement on the shielding performance of melanin, a pathway that could be transferred to the design of composite radiation shields."
https://openalex.org/W3019542242,"In 1972, Robert May showed that diversity is detrimental to an ecosystem since, as the number of species increases, the ecosystem is less stable. This is the so-called diversity-stability paradox, which has been derived by considering a mathematical model with linear interactions between the species. Despite being in contradiction with empirical evidence, the diversity-stability paradox has survived the test of time for over 40+ years. In this paper we first show that this paradox is a conclusion driven solely by the linearity of the model employed in its derivation which allows for the neglection of the fixed point solution in the stability analysis. The linear model leads to an ill-posed solution and along with it, its paradoxical stability predictions. We then consider a model ecosystem with nonlinear interactions between species, which leads to a stable ecosystem when the number of species is increased. The saturating non linear term in the species interaction is analogous to a Hill function appearing in systems like gene regulation, neurons, diffusion of information and ecosystems The exact fixed point solution of this model is based on k-core percolation and shows that the paradox disappears. This theoretical result, which is exact and non-perturbative, shows that diversity is beneficial to the ecosystem in agreement with analyzed experimental evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3020776929,"Background Adherence to the 2011 Japanese guidelines for treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in real-life practice is unknown. Methods In this retrospective longitudinal observational study, we examined patterns and trends in anti-PD drug prescriptions in 20,936 patients (≥30 years of age with newly diagnosed PD [International Classification of Diseases–Tenth code G20 or PD Hoehn and Yahr scale 1–5] and one or more prescriptions) using nationwide registry data between 2008 and 2016. Data are presented as descriptive statistics. Results Half (49.6%) of the patients received levodopa (L-dopa) monotherapy, followed by non-ergot dopamine agonists (DA) prescribed as monotherapy (8.3%) or with L-dopa (8.1%). Consistent with the guidelines, 75% of patients were prescribed within 13 days of initial diagnosis; L-dopa monotherapy was the most prescribed drug in patients ≥70 years of age, whereas non-ergot DA monotherapy was more likely to be prescribed than L-dopa in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Inconsistent with the guidelines, L-dopa monotherapy was the most prescribed drug in patients between 51 and 69 years of age. Over the course of 4 years of treatment, the prescription rate of L-dopa monotherapy and non-ergot DA monotherapy decreased by 63.7% and 44.1%, respectively, whereas that of L-dopa and non-ergot DA combination therapy increased by 103.7%. Combination therapy with L-dopa, non-ergot DA, and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors was gradually increased at a later stage. Conclusion These results highlight that the state of PD treatment in Japan adheres to most of the recommendations in the 2011 national guidelines, but also precedes the 2018 guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3018113478,"The threat of arsenic contamination to public health, particularly in developing countries, has become a serious problem. Millions of people in their daily lives are still highly dependent on groundwater containing high levels of arsenic, which causes excessive exposure to this toxic element, due to the high cost and lack of water-treatment infrastructures. Therefore, a technique for large-scale treatment of water in rural areas to remove arsenic is needed and should be low-cost, be easily customized, and not rely on electrical power. In this study, in an effort to fulfill those requirements, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D), printed water-filtration system for arsenic removal. Three-dimensional printing can provide a compact, customized filtration system that can fulfill the above-mentioned requirements and that can be made from plastic materials, which are abundant. Armed with the versatility of 3D printing, we were able to design the internal surface areas of filters, after which we modified the surfaces of the 3D, printed filters by using iron (III) oxide as an adsorbent for arsenite. We investigated the effects of the controlled surface area on the flow rate and the deposition of the adsorbent, which are directly related to the adsorption of arsenic. We conducted isotherm studies to quantify the adsorption of arsenic on our 3D, printed filtration system."
https://openalex.org/W3020085656,"Beijing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (lineage 2) have been associated with drug-resistance and transmission of tuberculosis worldwide. Most of the Beijing strains identified in the Colombian Pacific coast have exhibited a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. We sought to evaluate the clonality and sublineage of Beijing strains circulating in Southwestern Colombia. Thirty-seven Beijing strains were identified through spoligotyping out of 311 clinical isolates collected in 9 years from 2002-2010. Further analysis by MIRU-VNTR 24 loci was conducted for the Beijing strains. For sublineage classification, deletions of RD105, RD207, and RD131 and point mutations at fbpB, mutT2, and acs were evaluated. Drug-resistance associated mutations to first- and second-line anti-TB drugs were also evaluated. Additionally, two Beijing strains were Illumina-whole genome sequenced (one MDR and one drug-susceptible). Among the 37 Beijing strains characterized, 36 belonged to the SIT190 type from which 28 were MDR, four pre-extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB, and four XDR-TB. The remaining strain was SIT1 and drug susceptible. MIRU-VNTR analysis allowed the identification of three Beijing clusters and two unique strains. Beijing strains were confirmed as modern sublineage. The mutations rpoB S531L and katG S315T were the most common among MDR strains. Moreover, the two strains evaluated by whole genome sequencing (WGS) shared most of the genetic features with the sublineage 2.2.1 modern Beijing previously characterized from Asian strains. WGS analysis of the MDR strain revealed the presence of eight SNPs previously reported in other MDR Beijing-like strains from Colombia. The presence of modern Beijing strains in Southwestern Colombia, most of them with MDR phenotype, suggests a different origin of this M. tuberculosis sublineage compared to other Beijing strains found in neighboring South American countries. This work may serve as a genetic baseline to study the evolution and spread of M. tuberculosis Beijing strains in Colombia, which play an important role in the propagation of MDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W3018031752,"The effectiveness of liver regeneration limits surgical therapies of hepatic disorders and determines patient outcome. Here, we investigated the role of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for liver regeneration after acute or chronic injury. Mice deficient for the CGRP receptor component receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) were subjected to a 70% partial hepatectomy or repeated intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride. RAMP1 deficiency severely impaired recovery of organ mass and hepatocyte proliferation after both acute and chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, protein expression of the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was decreased in regenerating livers of RAMP1-deficient mice. Lack of RAMP1 was associated with hyperphosphorylation of YAP on Ser127 and Ser397, which regulates YAP functional activity and protein levels. Consequently, expression of various YAP-controlled cell cycle regulators and hepatocyte proliferation were severely reduced in the absence of RAMP1. In vitro, CGRP treatment caused increased YAP protein expression and a concomitant decline of YAP phosphorylation in liver tissue slice cultures of mouse and human origin and in primary human hepatocytes. Thus, our results indicate that sensory nerves represent a crucial control element of liver regeneration after acute and chronic injury acting through the CGRP-RAMP1 pathway, which stimulates YAP/TAZ expression and activity."
https://openalex.org/W3020098618,"Background Rubella virus infection mainly causes illness with mild fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy in children; however, the clinical characteristics of adult rubella are not well-known. Methods An observational study was conducted to compare the characteristics between adult rubella and adult non-rubella among participants aged ≥18 years, with suspected symptomatic rubella. Participants were screened for rubella-specific IgM expression using an enzyme immune assay kit, at a tertiary care hospital in Japan during two outbreaks (January 2012–December 2013 and January 2018–March 2019). Adult rubella diagnosis followed strong positive or paired rubella-specific IgM expression or positive rubella-specific reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Patients aged <18 years or with clinically suspected rubella with weak or negative IgM expression were excluded. Results Overall, 82 adult rubella and 139 adult non-rubella, with a median age (interquartile range) of 31 (25–41) years and 34 (27–42) years, respectively, were included. Multivariate analysis showed that conjunctivitis (odds ratio 80.6; 95% confidence interval 13.4–486.3; P <0.001) and male sex (odds ratio 7.1; 95% confidence interval 1.8–28.1; P = 0.005) were significantly associated with adult rubella. Among men born from 1962 to 1979 (high-risk population, n = 68), conjunctivitis also showed a significant association with adult rubella in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio 24.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1–553.7; P = 0.046) as these patients were not included in the national vaccination program. There was no difference in the clinical characteristics between one-time vaccination (n = 11) and no vaccination (n = 8) patient in the adult rubella group. Conclusions Conjunctivitis was the key clinical symptom associated with adult rubella. For the early diagnosis of adult rubella, clinicians should focus on assessing conjunctivitis in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3020271738,"The emergence of phenotypic diversity in a population of cells and their arrangement in space and time is one of the most fascinating features of living systems. In fact, understanding multicellularity is unthinkable without explaining the proximate and the ultimate causes of cell differentiation in time and space. Simpler forms of cell differentiation can be found in unicellular organisms, such as bacterial biofilm, where reversible cell differentiation results in phenotypically diverse populations. In this manuscript, we attempt to start with the simple case of reversible nongenetic phenotypic to construct a model of differentiation and pattern formation. Our model, which we refer to as noise-driven differentiation (NDD) model, is an attempt to consider the prevalence of noise in biological systems, alongside what is known about genetic switches and signaling, to create a simple model which generates spatiotemporal patterns from bottom-up. Our simulations indicate that the presence of noise in cells can lead to reversible differentiation and the addition of signaling can create spatiotemporal pattern."
https://openalex.org/W3018294864,"Guilt is a complex emotion with a potentially important social function of stimulating cooperative behaviours towards and from others, but whether the feeling of guilt is associated with a recognisable pattern of nonverbal behaviour is unknown. We examined the production and perception of guilt in two different studies, with a total of 238 participants with various places of origin. Guilt was induced experimentally, eliciting patterns of movement that were associated with both the participants' self-reported feelings of guilt and judges' impressions of their guilt. Guilt was most closely associated with frowning and neck touching. While there were differences between self-reported guilt and perception of guilt the findings suggest that there are consistent patterns that could be considered a non-verbal signal of guilt in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3018326598,"Cancer affects millions of individuals worldwide. One shortcoming of traditional cancer classification systems is that, even for tumors affecting a single organ, there is significant molecular heterogeneity. Precise molecular classification of tumors could be beneficial in personalizing patients' therapy and predicting prognosis. To this end, here we propose to use molecular signatures to further refine cancer classification. Molecular signatures are collections of genes characterizing particular cell types, tissues or disease. Signatures can be used to interpret expression profiles from heterogeneous samples. Large collections of gene signatures have previously been cataloged in the MSigDB database. We have developed a web-based Signature Visualization Tool (SaVanT) to display signature scores in user-generated expression data. Here we have undertaken a systematic analysis of correlations between inflammatory signatures and cancer samples, to test whether inflammation can differentiate cancer types. Inflammatory response signatures were obtained from MsigDB and SaVanT and a signature score was computed for samples associated with 7 different cancer types. We first identified types of cancers that had high inflammation levels as measured by these signatures. The correlation between signature scores and metadata of these patients (sex, age at initial cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, and vital status) was then computed. We sought to evaluate correlations between inflammation with other clinical parameters and identified four cancer types that had statistically significant association (p-value < 0.05) with at least one clinical characteristic: pancreas adenocarcinoma (PAAD), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and uveal melanoma (UVM). These results may allow future studies to use these approaches to further refine cancer subtyping and ultimately treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3018836813,"Spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is an invasive economic pest of soft-skinned and stone fruit across the globe. Our study establishes both a predictive generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), and a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) of the dynamic seasonal phenology of D. suzukii based on four years of adult monitoring trap data in Wisconsin tart cherry orchards collected throughout the growing season. The models incorporate year, field site, relative humidity, and degree days (DD); and relate these factors to trap catch. The GLMM estimated a coefficient of 2.21 for DD/1000, meaning for every increment of 1000 DD, trap catch increases by roughly 9 flies. The GAMM generated a curve based on a cubic regression smoothing function of DD which approximates critical DD points of first adult D. suzukii detection at 1276 DD, above average field populations beginning at 2019 DD, and peak activity at 3180 DD. By incorporating four years of comprehensive seasonal phenology data from the same locations, we introduce robust models capable of using DD to forecast changing adult D. suzukii populations in the field leading to the application of more timely and effective management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3020494136,"Astrocytes (AC) are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system. In the retina, astrocytes play important roles in the development and integrity of the retinal neurovasculature. Astrocytes dysfunction contributes to pathogenesis of a variety of neurovascular diseases including diabetic retinopathy. Recent studies have demonstrated the expression of Cyp1b1 in the neurovascular cells of the central nervous system including AC. We recently showed retinal AC constitutively express Cyp1b1, and global Cyp1b1-deficiency (Cyp1b1-/-) attenuates retinal ischemia-mediated neovascularization in vivo and the pro-angiogenic activity of retinal vascular cells in vitro. We also demonstrated that Cyp1b1 expression is a key regulator of retinal AC function. However, the underlying mechanisms involved need further investigation. Here we determined changes in the transcriptome profiles of Cyp1b1+/+ and Cyp1b1-/- retinal AC by RNA sequencing. We identified 585 differentially expressed genes, whose pathway enrichment analysis revealed the most significant pathways impacted in Cyp1b1-/- AC. These genes included those of axon guidance, extracellular matrix proteins and their receptors, cancer, cell adhesion molecules, TGF-β signaling, and the focal adhesion modulation. The expression of a selected set of differentially expressed genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of RNAseq investigation of the retinal AC transcriptome and the molecular pathways impacted by Cyp1b1 expression. These results demonstrated an important role for Cyp1b1 expression in the regulation of various retinal AC functions, which are important in neurovascular development and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3018606974,"In European regulations for the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMO), the objective of General Surveillance in Post-Market Environmental Monitoring is defined as the identification of the occurrence of adverse effects of the GMO or its use which were not anticipated in the environmental risk assessment (ERA). Accompanying the commercial cultivation in the EU of maize event MON 810, General Surveillance was implemented by Monsanto, the authorization holder, on a voluntary basis. We carried out a statistical analysis on the pooled results of ten years of farmer questionnaires, which were a part of this General Surveillance, amounting to 2,627 farmer fields in eight European countries in the period 2006–2015. This analysis did not reveal any unexpected adverse effects associated with the cultivation of MON 810. Results from farmer questionnaires confirmed that the cultivation of MON 810 resulted in a significant reduction in the use of pesticides, efficient protection against the target pests, and healthier, higher yielding crops compared to conventional maize. MON 810 also had reduced susceptibility to disease and pests when compared to conventional maize. Monitoring characteristics related to environment and wildlife revealed no significant differences between MON 810 and conventional maize. Literature searches, that were also conducted as part of General Surveillance, identified a comprehensive set of publications addressing environmental safety as well as food and feed safety aspects of MON 810. None of the publications indicated any adverse effect of MON 810 that was not anticipated in the initial ERA, nor did they lead to a change in the conclusions of the initial risk assessment that demonstrated the safety of MON 810. The development of resistance by the target pests (Ostrinia nubilalis, ECB and Sesamia nonagrioides, MCB) was the only potential adverse effect identified in the ERA of MON 810 cultivation in the EU. The extensive safety data package for MON 810, the robust weight of evidence demonstrating both its safety and benefits, and the history of safe use of MON 810 for 15 years in the EU, indicates that focussing the General Surveillance of MON 810 on literature searches and farmer complaint systems would be appropriately protective. This will allow the identification of potential adverse effect not anticipated in the initial ERA without the intensive effort and organizational challenges of farmer questionnaires."
https://openalex.org/W3018127250,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1) and 5 (BoHV5) are genetically and antigenically related alphaherpesviruses. Infection with one virus induces protective immunity against the other. However, disease associated with BoHV1 and BoHV5 varies significantly; whereas BoHV1 infection is usually associated with rhinotracheitis and abortion, BoHV5 causes encephalitis in cattle. BoHV5 outbreaks are sporadic and mainly restricted to the South American countries. We report BoHV5 infection for the first time from aborted cattle in India. Based on the characteristic cytopathic effects in MDBK cells, amplification of the viral genome by PCR, differential PCR for BoHV1/BoHV5, nucleotide sequencing and restriction endonuclease patterns, identity of the virus was confirmed as BoHV5 subtype A. Serum samples from the aborted cattle strongly neutralized both BoHV1 and BoHV5 suggesting an active viral infection in the herd. Upon UL27, UL44 and UL54 gene-based sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the isolated virus clustered with BoHV5 strains and showed highest similarity with the Brazilian BoHV5 strains."
https://openalex.org/W3019073093,"The functional efficiency of the expression cassettes integrated into a plasmid and a PCR- amplified fragment was comparatively analyzed after transient transfection in vitro or introduction into the developing embryo of Danio rerio. The cassettes contained the reporter genes, luciferase of Photinus pyralis (luc) or enhanced green fluorescent protein, under the control of the promoter of human cytomegalovirus immediate-early genes. In the in vitro system, the efficiency of the circular plasmid was 2.5 times higher than that of the PCR- amplified fragment. The effect of mutations in the expression cassette on the efficiency of the transgene expression in the PCR- amplified fragment was quantitatively evaluated. The mutations generated after 25 amplification cycles with Taq DNA polymerase decreased luciferase activity in transfected cells by 65-85%. Thus, mutations are the key factor of decreased functional efficiency of the PCR- amplified fragment relative to the circular plasmid in this experimental model, while other factors apparently have a lesser impact. At the organism level, no significant difference in the expression efficiency of the plasmid and PCR- amplified fragment has been revealed. Comparison of the vector efficiencies in in vivo and in vitro systems demonstrates that the level of luciferase in the D. rerio cell lysate, normalized to the molar concentration of the vector, is by three orders of magnitude higher than that after the cell transfection in vitro, which indicates that the quantitative data obtained for in vitro systems should not be directly extrapolated to the organism level."
https://openalex.org/W3018872325,"We conduct laboratory experiments to study peer effects on compliance with extortive requests. To this aim, we use an “extortion game” with multiple victims. In agreement with our hypothesis, our results show that when the information on peers’ behavior is available, compliance with appropriative requests is triggered by conformism among victims rather than by punishment. Moreover, we find that extorted sums are rather small, requests are proportional to the victim’s earnings, similar across victims, and are significantly lower when the extorter self-selects into this role. Punishment is rare, but effective. Finally, our results indicate that fairness concerns matter even in a context of extra-legal taxation, shaping both extorters’ requests and victims’ compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3018655977,"Radish (Raphanus sativus L.), is an important root vegetable crop grown worldwide, and it contains phyto-anthocyanins. However, only limited studies have been conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis in the different color variants of the radish fleshy root. In this study, Illumina paired-end RNA-sequencing was employed to characterize the transcriptomic changes in seven different types of radish fleshy roots. Approximately, 126 co-modulated differentially expressed genes were obtained, and most DEGs were more likely to participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis, including two transcription factors RsMYB_9 and RsERF070, and four functional genes RsBRICK1, RsBRI1-like2, RsCOX1, and RsCRK10. In addition, some related genes such as RsCHS, RsCHI, RsANS, RsMT2-4, RsUF3GT, glutathione S-transferase F12, RsUFGT78D2-like and RsUDGT-75C1-like significantly contributed to the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the radish cultivars. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis revealed that the anthocyanin-containing compound biosynthetic process, anthocyanin-containing compound metabolic process, and significantly enriched pathways of the co-modulated DEGs were overrepresented in these cultivars. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular mechanism underlying anthocyanin synthesis-related genes in radish."
https://openalex.org/W3018689321,"In deep underground engineering, in a large spatial, high-stress environment, rapid excavation is likely to affect the loading rate of the fault structure and to cause stick-slip. In this study, an experiment was conducted to explore the stick-slip characteristics at different loading rates. A double-sided shear experiment and the digital speckle correlation method were used to analyze the evolution of the displacement field, the slip displacement, and the slip rate of the fault's stick-slip activity at different loading rates as well as their correlation with the loading rate. The loading rate, moment magnitude, and stress drop of the fault's stick-slip and their corresponding relationships were studied. The results show that the occurrence of stick-slip is inversely proportional to the loading rate. The evolution of the fault-slip displacement field at different loading rates is similar. At a given loading rate, the magnitude is positively correlated with the stress drop. The magnitude and stress drop are inversely related to the loading rate."
https://openalex.org/W3018699056,"Our visual system extracts the emotional meaning of human facial expressions rapidly and automatically. Novel paradigms using fast periodic stimulations have provided insights into the electrophysiological processes underlying emotional content extraction: the regular occurrence of specific identities and/or emotional expressions alone can drive diagnostic brain responses. Consistent with a processing advantage for social cues of threat, we expected angry facial expressions to drive larger responses than neutral expressions. In a series of four EEG experiments, we studied the potential boundary conditions of such an effect: (i) we piloted emotional cue extraction using 9 facial identities and a fast presentation rate of 15 Hz (N = 16); (ii) we reduced the facial identities from 9 to 2, to assess whether (low or high) variability across emotional expressions would modulate brain responses (N = 16); (iii) we slowed the presentation rate from 15 Hz to 6 Hz (N = 31), the optimal presentation rate for facial feature extraction; (iv) we tested whether passive viewing instead of a concurrent task at fixation would play a role (N = 30). We consistently observed neural responses reflecting the rate of regularly presented emotional expressions (5 Hz and 2 Hz at presentation rates of 15 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively). Intriguingly, neutral expressions consistently produced stronger responses than angry expressions, contrary to the predicted processing advantage for threat-related stimuli. Our findings highlight the influence of physical differences across facial identities and emotional expressions."
https://openalex.org/W3018715724,"Object permanence has been investigated with a variety of paradigms and measures, yielding heterogeneous findings. The current study employed a novel Violation-of-Expectation paradigm measuring pupil dilation as indicator of cognitive effort and surprise. Across repeated trials, infants watched videos of animated toys either stopping in an open door frame or moving across the open door frame off screen. The door then closed and opened up again to reveal either the toy, or an empty space. In Experiment 1, 18-month-olds's pupils dilated in response to the unexpected empty outcome more than to the expected empty outcome, establishing the paradigm as a suitable measure of violation of object expectation. Using the same paradigm, Experiment 2 revealed an absence of this object expectation effect for 10-month-olds. Results are discussed with regard to paradigmatic aspects and developmental differences. It is suggested that young infants do not automatically represent occluded objects upon perceiving occlusion events, and that occlusion events may initially require relevance in terms of individual activity or social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3019077374,"Chromosome segregation errors in mammalian embryos are common and jeopardize embryo health. Here, we perform for the first time 4-Dimensional imaging and tracking of chromosomes and centromeres through each preimplantation mitotic cell division in mouse embryos to define the normal dynamics of chromosome segregation. We show that a microtubule (MT)-dependent inward movement of chromosomes occurs at the time of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), particularly in the earliest cell divisions, to position chromosomes prior to spindle assembly. Establishment of a rudimentary metaphase plate occurs immediately after NEBD, and is followed by a progressive alignment and biorientation of mitotic chromosomes. Stable end-on kinetochore-MT attachments form rapidly and attachment errors are uncommon. Altogether our data describe a rapid and efficient spindle assembly pathway that apparently minimizes the need for canonical MT attachment error correction in normally dividing embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3020310234,"Dynamic solar shading has the potential to dramatically reduce the energy consumption in buildings while at the same time improving the thermal and visual comfort of its occupants. Many new typologies of shading systems that have appeared recently, but it is difficult to compare those new systems to existing typologies due to control algorithm being rule-based as opposed to performance driven. Since solar shading is a design problem, there is no single right answer. What is the metric to determine if a system has reached its optimal kinematic design? Shading solutions should come from a thorough iterative and comparative process. This paper provides an original and flexible framework for the design and performance optimization of dynamic shading systems based on interpolation of simulations and global minimization. The methodology departs from existing rule-based strategies and applies to existing and to complex shading systems with multiple degree-of-freedom mobility. The strategy for control is centered on meeting comfort targets for work plane illuminance while minimizing the energy needed to operate space. The energy demand for thermal comfort and work plane daylight quantity (illuminance) are evaluated with Radiance and EnergyPlus based on local weather data. Applied to a case study of three typologies of dynamic shading, the results of the methodology inform the usefulness and quality of each degree-of-freedom of the kinematic systems. The case study exemplifies the iterative benefits of the methodology by providing detailed analytics on the behavior of the shades. Designers of shading systems can use this framework to evaluate their design and compare them to existing shading systems. This allows creativity to be guided so that eventually building occupants benefit from the innovation in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3020659643,"Background and purpose Patients with acute stroke and mild or rapidly improving symptoms frequently show progression. The role of reperfusion treatment in such patients is not clear. We hypothesized that progression was most likely in patients with cortical localization and such patients may benefit from thrombolysis. Material and methods We interrogated Hamad Stroke Database to evaluate 90-days outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted within 4 hours and a NIHSS score of ≤6. Evaluation was based on localization (lacunar or cortical), multi-model imaging abnormalities and whether they received rt-PA. The 90-day mRS was used to determine outcome. Results During study period 6381 patients were admitted with acute stroke. Mild stroke within 4 hours was diagnosed in 506 [no thrombolysis: 381(lacunar: 213; cortical: 168), thrombolysis: 125 (lacunar: 45; cortical: 80)]. The rt-PA treated patients had significantly higher NIHSS (2.94±3.9 versus 1.28±2.46, p<0.0001), increased rates of complications (16.0% versus 3.9%, p<0.0001) and longer hospital stay (6.05±8.1 versus 3.78±3.6 days; p<0.001). In patients with cortical stroke, intracranial arterial occlusions (11.6% vs 3.9%, p<0.0001) and CTP mismatch (22.2% vs 4.4%, p<0.0001) were more frequent in rt-PA treated patients. Discharge mRS (33.6% versus 13.9%, p<0.001) and 90-days mRS (23.2% versus 11.8%, p = 0.002) was significantly worse in patients with cortical stroke (rt-PA-treated and untreated patients). Conclusions The outcome in patients with mild stroke depends on lesion location (lacunar versus cortical) and severity of symptoms. Patients who receive rt-PA have significantly larger deficits, increased imaging abnormalities and higher rates of hospital complication, explaining the poor outcome in such subjects."

The PIA and the SAL classes had poorer performance on non-executive functioning relative to the UA class. Both types of functioning mediated the relationship of class to school service use and grade retention.Neuropsychological impairment characterizes children and adolescents with inattention problems. Problems in executive functioning characterize the subset whose inattention persists through adolescence. Subsequent research can examine the potential for remediating these deficits to address academic and social problems."
