https://openalex.org/W2009217296,"The lac operon of Escherichia coli is the paradigm for gene regulation. Its key component is the lac repressor, a product of the lacI gene. The three-dimensional structures of the intact lac repressor, the lac repressor bound to the gratuitous inducer isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and the lac repressor complexed with a 21-base pair symmetric operator DNA have been determined. These three structures show the conformation of the molecule in both the induced and repressed states and provide a framework for understanding a wealth of biochemical and genetic information. The DNA sequence of the lac operon has three lac repressor recognition sites in a stretch of 500 base pairs. The crystallographic structure of the complex with DNA suggests that the tetrameric repressor functions synergistically with catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and participates in the quaternary formation of repression loops in which one tetrameric repressor interacts simultaneously with two sites on the genomic DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2036510457,"T cells activated by antigen receptor stimulation in the absence of accessory cell-derived costimulatory signals lose the capacity to synthesize the growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2), a state called clonal anergy. An analysis of CD3- and CD28-induced signal transduction revealed reduced ERK and JNK enzyme activities in murine anergic T cells. The amounts of ERK and JNK proteins were unchanged, and the kinases could be fully activated in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Dephosphorylation of the calcineurin substrate NFATp (preexisting nuclear factor of activated T cells) also remained inducible. These results suggest that a specific block in the activation of ERK and JNK contributes to defective IL-2 production in clonal anergy."
https://openalex.org/W1989997867,"In mice deficient in either lymphotoxin-α (LT-α) or the type I tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, but not the type II TNF receptor, germinal centers failed to develop in peripheral lymphoid organs. Germinal center formation was restored in LT-α-deficient mice by transplantation of normal bone marrow, indicating that the LT-α-expressing cells required to establish this lymphoid structure are derived from bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2066331485,"T cell anergy is a state of functional unresponsiveness characterized by the inability to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) upon T cell receptor stimulation. The mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 and the guanosine triphosphate-binding protein p21ras were found to remain unactivated upon stimulation of anergic murine T helper cell 1 clones. The inability to activate the Ras pathway did not result from a defect in association among Shc, Grb-2, and murine Son of Sevenless, nor from a defect in their tyrosine phosphorylation. This block in Ras activation may lead to defective transactivation at activator protein 1 sites in anergic cells and may enable T cells to shut down IL-2 production selectively during anergy."
https://openalex.org/W2025476985,"The high-resolution x-ray crystal structures of the murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule, I-E(k), occupied by either of two antigenic peptides were determined. They reveal the structural basis for the I-E(k) peptide binding motif and suggest general principles for additional alleles. A buried cluster of acidic amino acids in the binding groove predicted to be conserved among all murine I-E and human DR MHC class II molecules suggests how pH may influence MHC binding or exchange of peptides. These structures also complement mutational studies on the importance of individual peptide residues to T cell receptor recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2017854107,"Monotherapy with (-)2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) leads to the appearance of a drug-resistant variant of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) with the methionine-184 --> valine (M184V) substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT). Despite resulting drug resistance, treatment for more than 48 weeks is associated with a lower plasma viral burden than that at baseline. Studies to investigate this apparent contradiction revealed the following. (i) Titers of HIV-neutralizing antibodies remained stable in 3TC-treated individuals in contrast to rapid declines in those treated with azidothymidine (AZT). (ii) Unlike wild-type HIV, growth of M184V HIV in cell culture in the presence of d4T, AZT, Nevirapine, Delavirdine, or Saquinavir did not select for variants displaying drug resistance. (iii) There was an increase in fidelity of nucleotide insertion by the M184V mutant compared with wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2083756044,"HLA-DM (DM) facilitates peptide loading of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in human cell lines. Mice lacking functional H2-M, the mouse equivalent of DM, have normal amounts of class II molecules at the cell surface, but most of these are associated with invariant chain-derived CLIP peptides. These mice contain large numbers of CD4+ T cells, which is indicative of positive selection in the thymus. Their CD4+ cells were unresponsive to self H2-M-deficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) but were hyperreactive to wild-type APCs. H2-M-deficient APCs failed to elicit proliferative responses from wild-type T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2057637786,"Analysis of strontium-induced asynchronous release of quanta from stimulated synapses revealed that long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the CA1 region of the mammalian hippocampus are associated with an increase and a decrease, respectively, in quantal size. At a single set of synapses, the increase in quantal size seen with long-term potentiation was completely reversed by depotentiating stimuli. Long-term potentiation and depression are also associated with an increase and decrease, respectively, in the frequency of quantal events, consistent with an all-or-none regulation (up or down) of clusters of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, a change in the release of transmitter, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1996726991,"Nuclei isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at various times during the G1 phase of the cell cycle were stimulated to enter S phase by incubation in Xenopus egg cytosol. Replication of DNA initiated within the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin locus in nuclei isolated late in G1, but at random sites in nuclei isolated early in G1. A discrete transition point occurred 3 to 4 hours after metaphase. Neither replication licensing nor nuclear assembly was sufficient for origin recognition. Thus, a distinct cell cycle-regulated event in the nucleus restricts the initiation of replication to specific sites downstream of the DHFR gene."

https://openalex.org/W2046626881,"The molecular mechanism behind affinity maturation is the introduction of point mutations in immunoglobulin (Ig) V genes, followed by the selective proliferation of B cells expressing mutants with increased affinity for antigen. An in vitro culture system was developed in which somatic hypermutation of Ig V genes was sustained in primed B cells. Cognate T cell help and cross-linking of the surface Ig were required, whereas the addition of lipopolysaccharide or a CD40 ligand to drive proliferation was insufficient. This system should facilitate understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate somatic mutation and B cell selection."

https://openalex.org/W2063971860,"The coat protomer complex I (COPI) family of coat proteins are involved in the assembly of membrane-associated coats thought to mediate vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, between adjacent Golgi cisternae, and possibly in the endocytic pathway. We investigated whether this heterogeneity in the sites of COPI action might be reflected in biochemical heterogeneity of one or more COPI subunits. A simplified method was devised to purify the cytosolic COPI precursor complex, coatomer, from rat liver cytosol. The individual subunits were analyzed by high resolution two dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides. Considerable charge heterogeneity was observed, particularly for the β-COP and δ-COP subunits. The multiple species detected, however, did not appear to reflect the presence of distinct translation products but rather a significant degree of protein phosphorylation. The observed pI of β-COP was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase digestion. Moreover, isolation of coatomer from metabolically labeled tissue culture cells demonstrated directly that both β-COP and δ-COP, but no other coatomer subunits, were serine-phosphorylated. COPI phosphorylation may regulate coatomer assembly, membrane recruitment, or the specificity of coatomer-organelle interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1577265635,"Purification of a material immunoreactive to an antiserum against the C-terminal part of the oxytocin (Pro-Leu-Gly-amide) and present in the central nervous system of the Pharyngobdellid leech Erpobdella octoculata was performed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography combined with both enzyme-linked immunosorbent and dot immunobinding assays for oxytocin. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide (Ile-Pro-Glu-Pro-Tyr-Val-Trp-Asp) was established by Edman degradation and confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry measurement. When injected in leeches, purified or synthetic peptides exert an anti-diuretic effect, the most effective ranged between 10 pmol and 1 nmol. They provoked an uptake of water 1-2 h post-injection. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments conducted in the leech Hirudo medicinalis revealed an inhibition of the potency of Na+ conductances of leech skin by this peptide. Immunocytochemical studies with an antiserum against synthetic oxytocin-like molecule provided the cytological basis for existence of a neuropeptide, since large amounts of immunoreactive neurons were detected in the central nervous systems of E. octoculata. The purified molecule is both different to peptides of the oxytocin/vasopressin family and is a novel neuropeptide in the animal kingdom. It was named the leech osmoregulator factor (LORF).An identification of the proteins immunoreactive to an antiserum against oxytocin performed at the level of both central nervous systems extracts and in vitro central nervous system-translated RNA products indicated that in the two cases, a single protein was detected. These proteins with a molecular masses of, respectively, ~34 kDa (homodimer of 17 kDa) for the central nervous systems extracts and ~19 kDa for in vitro central nervous system-translated RNA products were not recognized by the antiserum against MSEL- and VLDV-neurophysin (proteins associated to oxytocin and vasopressin), confirming that LORF did not belong to the oxytocin/vasopressin family.
