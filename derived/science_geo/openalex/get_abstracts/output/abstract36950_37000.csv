https://openalex.org/W2056557043,"Previous studies involving platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) have been based on the premise that a single cell-surface receptor binds all three isoforms of PDGF (AA, BB, and AB). It is now shown that two populations of PDGF receptor exist and can be distinguished by their ligand binding specificity. The B receptor binds only the BB dimer, whereas the A/B receptor binds AA, BB, and AB dimers. Human dermal fibroblasts appear to express seven times as much B receptor as A/B receptor. The B receptor is responsible for most PDGF receptor phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1912249044,"The major class of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors was isolated from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, and a partial amino acid sequence was obtained. This allowed the isolation of cDNA clones from which the entire amino acid sequence was established. The smooth muscle cell ANP receptor appears to be synthesized as a 537-amino acid precursor with an N-terminal membrane translocation signal. The mature form consists of 496 amino acids with a single potential transmembrane domain predicting a 37-amino acid cytoplasmic domain and a large, acidic, extracellular domain low in cysteine and probably containing attached carbohydrate. The receptor is therefore similar in structure to the growth factor receptors but notably lacks repetitive cysteine-rich domains and has a relatively small intracellular domain. Expression of the cloned receptor in Xenopus oocytes elicited high affinity, membrane-associated binding sites for ANP and for truncated and internally deleted analogs of ANP. These results reflect the ligand binding specificity found for the major class of ANP receptors on smooth muscle cells and thus provide additional evidence that two distinct ANP receptors exist since ANP receptor-coupled guanylate cyclase activity exhibits a very different ANP analog specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1505843239,"Complementary DNAs for two isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase from rat brain have been isolated. The cDNAs were identified using an oligonucleotide probe derived from a conserved amino acid sequence of the ATP binding site of the aspartylphosphate family of transport ATPases. The complete nucleotide sequences have been determined, and the primary structures for both isoforms have been deduced. The Mr of isoform 1, which has 1,176 amino acids, is 129,500 and that of isoform 2, which has 1,198 amino acids, is 132,605. region of isoform 1 exhibits perfect amino acid identity with a fragment consisting of 17 amino acids from the phosphorylation domain of the human erythrocyte calmodulin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase (James, P., Zvaritch, E.I., Shakhparonov, M.I., Penniston, J.T., and Carafoli, E. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149, 7-12). comparison of transport ATPases from diverse species has allowed the identification of a sequence that may form part of a second ATP binding site. Amino acid similarity and hydropathy profile comparisons suggest that the transmembrane organization of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is the same as that of the Na+,K+-ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; the data indicate that each of these enzymes has an even number of transmembrane domains and that their C termini are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. An arginine-rich sequence that is highly characteristic of the A domain of a calmodulin binding site is located near the C termini of both isoforms. This putative domain is identical in isoforms 1 and 2 but their domains, and the remaining C-terminal sequences, are very different. However, 3'-untranslated sequences of the isoform 1 transcript have the potential to encode a calmodulin binding B domain and a C terminus that is very similar to that of isoform 2. This suggests the possibility that additional diversity may occur via alternative processing of the primary transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1974509082,"DNA from the E. coli replicative origin binds with high affinity to outer membrane preparations. Specific binding regions are contained within a 463 bp stretch of origin DNA between positions -46 and +417 on the oriC map. This region of DNA contains an unusually high number of GATC sites, the recognition sequence for the E. coli DNA adenine methylase. We show here that oriC DNA binds to membrane only when it is hemimethylated. The E. coli chromosomal origin is hemimethylated for 8-10 min after initiation of replication, and origin DNA binds to membranes only during this time period. Based on these results, we propose a speculative model for chromosome segregation in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2090478937,"The genetic transformation of mitochondria and chloroplasts has been an intractable problem. The newly developed ""biolistic"" (biological ballistic) process was used to deliver DNA into yeast cells to stably transform their mitochondria. A nonreverting strain, which is respiratory deficient because of a deletion in the mitochondrial oxi3 gene, was bombarded with tungsten microprojectiles coated with DNA bearing sequences that could correct the oxi3 deletion. Respiratory-competent transformants were obtained in which the introduced oxi3 DNA is integrated at the homologous site in the mitochondrial genome. Organelle genomes can now be manipulated by molecular genetic techniques in the same way as nuclear genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1559810631,"Steroid hormones modulate adrenergic receptor responsiveness and receptor number. To investigate the regulation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene by glucocorticoids we examined the effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid agonist triamcinolone acetonide on the expression of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in DDT1MF-2 hamster smooth muscle cells. Glucocorticoid treatment (1 X 10(-7) M) produced a 2.2 +/- 0.4-fold (n = 8) increase in beta 2-adrenergic receptor number (maximum) between 6 and 12 h) as determined by radioligand binding and a similar increase in catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Steady-state levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA, analyzed by Northern blot hybridization, were increased 2.4 +/- 0.4-fold (n = 6) within 1 h, while actin mRNA levels were unchanged throughout the experiment. These steroid-induced increases in beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA returned to control levels by 24 h and were followed by a much slower decline in beta 2-adrenergic receptor in plasma membranes. The rate of beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene transcription, assessed by nuclear run-off transcription assays, increased 3.1 +/- 0.1-fold (n = 2) in cells treated for 30 min with 1 X 10(-7) M triamcinolone acetonide. These studies indicate that glucocorticoids regulate the beta 2-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system by controlling the rate of transcription of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene and hence the responsiveness of the enzyme to catecholamine stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1577776424,"[Tyr36]human adenylate cyclase stimulating peptide (1-36)-NH2, an amino-terminal analog of a tumor peptide which is associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy, and [Nle8, Nle18, Tyr34]bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH)-(1-34)-NH2 both bind with similar affinities to receptors on rat osteosarcoma cells, ROS 17/2.8, when either of the peptides is used as the radioligand. Pretreatment of the cells with either peptide down-regulates available binding sites for either radioligand and desensitizes the cAMP accumulation stimulated by either peptide. Prior exposure of the cells to dexamethasone increases these responses to both peptides. Photoderivatized radioiodinated [Tyr36]human adenylate cyclase-stimulating peptide (1-36)-NH2 and [Nle8, Nle18, Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)-NH2 both specifically label a Mr = 80,000 membrane protein on ROS 17/2.8 cells. The intensity of labeling this receptor band by either photoprobe is reduced by co-incubation with either peptide over the same dose range. Equivalent dose-dependent down-regulation of receptors which bind both photoprobes is also found when ROS 17/2.8 cells are preincubated with either peptide. Dexamethasone increases the intensity of receptor labeling. Our findings strongly indicate that both peptides recognize the same plasma membrane receptor on ROS 17/2.8 cells. Although the physiological function(s) of human adenylate cyclase-stimulating peptide is unknown, these results could explain why its biological actions on mineral ion metabolism so closely simulate those of PTH and raise interesting questions about the general biological and evolutionary significance of the use of the same receptor by chemically distinct peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2167023677,"A gene has been cloned from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 that encodes a 56-residue peptide precursor for the 32-residue peptide antibiotic, subtilin. The precursor contains serines, threonines, and cysteines at positions that permit them to undergo a series of dehydration and cross-linking steps to give the mature antibiotic peptide which contains the unusual amino acids lanthionine, beta-methyllanthionine, D-alanine, dehydroalanine, and dehydrobutyrine. The precursor peptide contains a leader region that has an unusual hydropathic character for an exported protein. The subtilin gene is expressed from a monocistronic transcriptional unit as identified by S1 mapping of the gene transcript. The (-35) region of the promoter is not typical of Bacillus subtilis vegetatively-expressed genes. The subtilin transcript was present in very low amounts during exponential growth, but in large amounts during stationary phase; at which time mature subtilin peptide and antibiotic activity were also observed. The subtilin transcript contains a cleavage-sensitive region that overlaps the ribosome binding site. The primary transcript has an unusually long half-life of about 45 min. These observations confirm that subtilin is derived from a small protein that is synthesized on ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2048481264,Unequal crossing-over within a head-to-tail tandem array of the homologous red and green visual pigment genes has been proposed to explain the observed variation in green-pigment gene number among individuals and the prevalence of red-green fusion genes among color-blind subjects. This model was tested by probing the structure of the red and green pigment loci with long-range physical mapping techniques. The loci were found to constitute a gene array with an approximately 39-kilobase repeat length. The position of the red pigment gene at the 5' edge of the array explains its lack of variation in copy number. Restriction maps of the array in four individuals who differ in gene number are consistent with a head-to-tail configuration of the genes. These results provide physical evidence in support of the model and help to explain the high incidence of color blindness in the human population.

https://openalex.org/W1549634562,"We have previously shown that a mutant human insulin receptor with a COOH-terminal 43-amino acid deletion (HIR delta CT), when expressed in Rat 1 fibroblasts, binds insulin normally, autophosphorylates, and undergoes endocytosis after insulin binding in a manner comparable to the normal human insulin receptor (HIRc). In this paper we have examined the biologic activity of the truncated and normal insulin receptors. In vitro, the HIR delta CT receptors caused a 1.8-fold greater phosphorylation of a Glu4/Tyr1 polypeptide than did the HIRc receptors, but the two receptor types were nearly equivalent in their ability to phosphorylate a src-derived peptide. Furthermore, insulin preactivation of HIRc and HIR delta CT receptors in intact cells led to equivalent stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity as subsequently determined for histone in vitro. Expression of HIRc receptors in cells led to enhanced sensitivity to insulin of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and glycogen synthase activation. This increased sensitivity was proportional to receptor number at low (Ro = 6400) but not at high (Ro = 1.25 X 10(6] levels of receptor expression. However, expression of HIR delta CT receptors (Ro = 2.5 X 10(5] led to little, if any, increase in insulin sensitivity of either 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake or glycogen synthase activation. Furthermore, compared with HIRc cells, HIR delta CT cells respond poorly to an agonistic monoclonal antibody specific for the human insulin receptor. In conclusion, the HIR delta CT receptor retains intact protein kinase activity in vitro. Despite this, however, the receptor displays low activity in mediating the metabolic effects of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1976664034,"Intracellular signals that trigger long-term (24-hour) changes in membrane currents in identified neurons of Aplysia have been examined in order to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying long-term sensitization. Adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) was directly injected into individual sensory neurons to mimic the effects of sensitization training at the single cell level. Potassium currents of these cells were reduced 24 hours after injection of cAMP; these currents were similar to those reduced 24 hours after behavioral sensitization. These results suggest that cAMP is part of the intracellular signal that induces long-term sensitization in Aplysia."
https://openalex.org/W1530460707,"The mechanism by which alpha 2-adrenergic agonists inhibit exocytosis was investigated in electrically permeabilized insulin secreting RINm5F cells. In this preparation alpha 2-adrenoceptors remain coupled to adenylate cyclase, since basal- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production was lowered by epinephrine and clonidine by 30-50%. Cyclic AMP levels did not correlate with the rate of insulin secretion. Thus, at low Ca2+, forskolin enhanced cyclic AMP levels 5-fold without eliciting secretion, and Ca2+-stimulated secretion was associated with decreased cyclic AMP accumulation. Epinephrine (plus propranolol) inhibited Ca2+-induced insulin secretion in a GTP-dependent manner. The maximal inhibition (43%) occurred at 500 microM GTP. Clonidine also inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Replacement of GTP by GDP or by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate as well as treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin prior to permeabilization abolished epinephrine inhibition of insulin secretion. Pertussis toxin did not affect Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Insulin release stimulated by 1,2-didecanoyl glycerol was also lowered by epinephrine suggesting an effect distal to the activation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). These results taken together with the ability of epinephrine to inhibit ionomycin-induced insulin secretion in intact cells suggest that alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition is distal to the generation of second messengers. A model is proposed for alpha 2-adrenoceptor coupling to two effector systems, namely the adenylate cyclase and the exocytotic site in insulin-secreting cells."
https://openalex.org/W1677366327,"The use of different myeloid leukemic cell lines (WEHI-3B D+ and M1) and different sources of factors has led to discrepancies concerning the identity of factors capable of inducing differentiation in leukemic cells. We have biochemically fractionated medium conditioned by one such source (Krebs II ascites cells) and assayed fractions for their bone marrow colony-stimulating activity as well as their differentiation-inducing activity for WEHI-3B D+ and M1 cells. This resulted in the resolution of four distinct molecular species with differentiation-inducing activity. One activity was purified to homogeneity and shown by a variety of biochemical, biological, and receptor-binding criteria to be authentic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A second activity was identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Two other activities termed LIF-A and LIF-B (leukemia inhibitory factor) were shown to probably be different glycosylation variants of the same protein and one of these (LIF-A) was purified 12,000-fold to homogeneity. G-CSF induced differentiation in both WEHI-3B D+ and at higher concentrations M1 cells while GM-CSF weakly induced differentiation in WEHI-3B D+ cells. LIF-A had no colony-stimulating activity and induced differentiation in and inhibited the proliferation of only M1 cells. Each factor bound to a unique cell surface receptor with no evidence of direct cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2062223607,"The specificity of complex formation between cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) and cytochrome c (cyt c) is believed to involve the formation of salt linkages between specific carboxylic acid residues of cyt b5 with lysine residues on cyt c. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the specified acidic residues of cyt b5 to the corresponding amide analogues, which resulted in a lower affinity for complex formation with cyt c. The dissociation of the complex under high pressure resulted in specific volume changes, the magnitude of which reflected the degree of solvation of the acidic residues in the proposed protein-protein interface."
https://openalex.org/W2054997145,"The factor-dependent myeloid precursor cell line D35 mutates spontaneously at a frequency greater than 2.4 x 10(-7) to growth factor autonomy. This frequency could be increased at least 20-fold by retrovirus insertional mutagenesis. The isolation and characterization of factor-independent mutants allowed the identification of genes involved in growth autonomy. Mutants could be subdivided into two sets: those that secreted a stimulating factor (10/11) and those that did not (1/11). In one case, the factor released was distinct from previously characterized growth factors. In most mutants (6/9), the activation of a growth factor gene was associated with rearrangement that could be attributed to the insertion of a transposable-like element either 5' or 3' of the factor coding region in all cases examined, excluding oncogene involvement. All factor-independent mutants were tumorigenic, consistent with the hypothesis that growth-factor independence initiated by aberrant growth factor gene activation is an important and early step in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001192348,"A new isolate of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2, designated HIV-2UC1, was recovered from an Ivory Coast patient with normal lymphocyte numbers who died with neurologic symptoms. Like some HIV-1 isolates, HIV-2UC1 grows rapidly to high titers in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages and has a differential ability to productively infect established human cell lines of lymphocytic and monocytic origin. Moreover, infection with this isolate also appears to involve the CD4 antigen. However, unlike other HIV isolates, HIV-2UC1 does not cause cytopathic effects in susceptible T cells nor does it lead to loss of CD4 antigen expression on the cell surface. These results indicate that HIV-2 may be found in individuals with neurologic symptoms and that the biological characteristics of this heterogeneous subgroup can differ from those typical of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1486949053,"We have developed a quantitative and relatively model-independent measure of lipid fluidity using EPR and have applied this method to compare the temperature dependence of lipid hydrocarbon chain fluidity, overall protein rotational mobility, and the calcium-dependent enzymatic activity of the Ca-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum. We define membrane lipid fluidity to be T/eta, where eta is the viscosity of a long chain hydrocarbon reference solvent in which a fatty acid spin label gives the same EPR spectrum (quantitated by the order parameter S) as observed for the same probe in the membrane. This measure is independent of the reference solvent used as long as the spectral line shapes in the membrane and the solvent match precisely, indicating that the same type of anisotropic probe motion occurs in the two systems. We argue that this empirical measurement of fluidity, defined in analogy to the macroscopic fluidity (T/eta) of a bulk solvent, should be more directly related to protein rotational mobility (and thus to protein function) than are more conventional measures of fluidity, such as the rate or amplitude of rotational motion of the lipid hydrocarbon chains themselves. This new definition thus offers a fluidity measure that is more directly relevant to the protein's behavior. The direct relationship between this measure of membrane fluidity and protein rotational mobility is supported by measurements in sarcoplasmic reticulum. The overall rotational motion of the spin-labeled Ca-ATPase protein was measured by saturation-transfer EPR. The Arrhenius activation energy for protein rotational mobility (11-12 kcal/mol/degree) agrees well with the activation energy for lipid fluidity, if defined as in this study, but not if more conventional definitions of lipid fluidity are used. This agreement, which extends over the entire temperature range from 0 to 40 degrees C, suggests that protein mobility depends directly on lipid fluidity in this system, as predicted from hydrodynamic theory. The same activation energy is observed for the calcium-dependent ATPase activity under physiological conditions, suggesting that protein rotational mobility (dependent on lipid fluidity) is involved in the rate-limiting step of active calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1532457173,"In order to test the contribution of the insulin receptor COOH terminus to insulin action, a truncation of 43 COOH-terminal amino acids was engineered by cDNA-based deletion mutagenesis. This cDNA (HIR delta CT), as well as cDNA encoding the complete receptor (HIRc) was transfected into Rat 1 fibroblasts. Cells expressing 6.4 X 10(3) and 1.25 X 10(6) normal receptors and 2.5 X 10(5) HIR delta CT receptors, as well as control Rat 1 fibroblasts were selected for further analysis. All cell lines exhibited insulin binding of similar affinity. Partial tryptic digestion and immunoprecipitation by region-specific antibodies verified that the HIR delta CT receptors were truncated at the COOH terminus. Purified HIRc and HIR delta CT receptors underwent autophosphorylation with similar insulin and ATP sensitivity, although the HIR delta CT receptors were slightly more active in the absence of insulin. Transfected HIRc and HIR delta CT receptors undergo endocytosis in a normal fashion. Insulin internalization and degradation in both HIRc and HIR delta CT cells is increased in proportion to receptor number. Intracellular insulin processing, degradation, and release were qualitatively comparable among the transfected cell lines. Complete and truncated receptors internalize, recycle, and down-regulate normally. We conclude the following: 1) the COOH-terminal portion of the insulin receptor is not necessary for partial autophosphorylation or endocytosis; 2) following internalization the intracellular itinerary of the receptor and ligand appear normal with the truncated receptor; and 3) truncation of the COOH terminus does not impair recycling of the receptor or retroendocytosis of internalized ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1560105986,"This report describes the purification and partial characterization of a novel retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP-II) from neonatal rat pups. The isolation procedure included gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a DEAE 5PW column. Two retinoic acid-binding peaks were resolved at the DEAE-cellulose step, with CRABP-I in the major peak and CRABP-II in the minor peak. Apparent homogeneity was achieved for both binding proteins after the HPLC step. CRABP-II consists of a single polypeptide, migrating with an apparent Mr of 15,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. It has an isoelectric point of 5.0. The dissociation constant for CRABP-II of retinoic acid was estimated to be 65 nM by fluorescence titration. Amino-terminal sequence analysis showed that CRABP-II has a distinct sequence, while the CRABP-I sequence is exactly identical to that of the rat testis CRABP. Despite the extensive sequence homology between CRABP-I and CRABP-II, antibodies directed against CRABP-I did not cross-react with CRABP-II."
https://openalex.org/W1567245831,"The yeast ribosome contains three acidic proteins, L44, L44', and L45, closely related from a structural point of view, that seem to play a functional role similar to that of proteins L7 and L12 in the bacterial ribosome. By screening a cDNA bank in lambda gt11 with specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, recombinant phages expressing each one of the acidic proteins have been cloned. A unique copy of each gene is detected using the phage cDNA inserts as probes in nitrocellulose blots of yeast DNA digested with different restriction enzymes. The inserts were subcloned in the plasmid pUC19, and their physical maps and nucleotide sequences were determined. By using the cDNA inserts as probes in genomic DNA banks, DNA fragments carrying the acidic protein genes have been cloned, characterized, and sequenced. The results conclusively show that the three yeast acidic proteins are coded by independent genes and are not the result of a post-translational modification of the product of a unique gene, as in bacteria. Like most ribosomal protein genes, the gene for protein L44' has an intron and two upstream stimulatory boxes (UASrpg) fitting closely to the consensus sequence. The genes coding for proteins L44 and L45 lack introns and seem also exceptional in other characteristics of their sequences. Proteins L44 and L45 have amino acid sequences with about 80% similarity. Protein L44' is only 63% similar to the other two polypeptides. The three proteins have highly conserved carboxyl termini comprising the last 30 amino acids, and the first 10 amino acids of L44 and L45 are identical. The results cast doubts about the possibility of a similar role for the different acidic ribosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1575883584,"Photoreceptor metabolism of cGMP and its regulation were characterized in isolated toad retinas by determining the intensity and time dependence of light-induced changes in the following metabolic parameters: cGMP hydrolytic flux determined by the rate of 18O incorporation from 18O-water into retinal guanine nucleotide alpha-phosphoryls; changes in the total (protein-bound and unbound) concentrations of the guanine nucleotide metabolic intermediates; and changes in the concentration of metabolic (unbound) GDP calculated from the fraction of the alpha-GDP that undergoes labeling with 18O. The latter is interpreted to reflect the state of the equilibrium between GDP- and GTP-complexed forms of G-protein. With narrow band 500 nm light that preferentially stimulates red rod photoreceptors, a range of intensities covering approximately 5 log units produced increases of over 10-fold in cGMP metabolic flux. However, the characteristics of the cGMP metabolic response over the first 2.5 log units of intensity are readily distinguishable from those at higher intensities which exhibit progressive attenuation by an intensity- and time-dependent process. Over the range of low intensities (0.6-3 log photons.micron-2.s-1) the metabolic response is characterized by 1) increases in cGMP hydrolytic flux of up to 8-fold as a logarithmic function of intensity of photic stimulation that are sustained for at least 200 s; 2) small increases or no change in the concentration of total cGMP; 3) large increases of up to 10-fold in the concentration of metabolically active GDP as a linear function of intensity with no significant change in the tissue concentrations of total GDP or GTP; and 4) amplification of the photosignal by the metabolism of approximately 10,000 molecules of cGMP per photoisomerization with the major site of amplification at the level of the interaction of bleached rhodopsin with G-protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2071963234,"A combination of metabolic labeling and chemical or enzymatic modification was employed to isolate and biochemically characterize a set of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (gly-PI) molecules synthesized by T lymphocytes. Gly-PI displayed unique patterns of synthesis following mitogen activation relative to the phosphoinositides and major structural lipids. The increase with time in gly-PI was paralleled by the appearance of insulin receptors. Gly-PI molecules were sensitive to hydrolysis by a PI-specific phospholipase C and were rapidly (15 sec) degraded in response to insulin binding. The product of this hydrolysis is believed to be a novel inositol phosphate-glycan (IP-gly) that was shown to inhibit the activity of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results demonstrate that T cells contain a structurally related set of gly-PI molecules, at least one of which is sensitive to insulin and may function as a second messenger of hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1558482181,"Deletion and site-directed point mutants of the polycistronic P/C mRNA of Sendai virus revealed that one of the nonstructural proteins of this virus, the C' protein, initiates from an ACG codon. This ACG codon occurs in an optimum sequence context and precedes the first AUG of the P/C mRNA. The results presented in this communication are consistent with the concept that the ribosomes scan the P/C mRNA to initiate several proteins from its different initiator codons. The arrangement of several weak initiator codons in tandem in an mRNA, i.e. non-AUG in optimum sequence context and AUG in suboptimum sequence context, may represent an alternate means to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes and their viruses."

The ability of CHO cells expressing the human receptor complementary DNA (CHO-HR5) to interact with different recombinant forms of PDGF (AA and BB homodimers) was tested. Both forms of PDGF bind to the transfected receptor, stimulate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and elicit a mitogenic response in a manner that was indistinguishable from the responses of Balb/c 3T3 cells to AA and BB forms of PDGF can be attributed to a single type of receptor and show that the AA form, like the BB form, is a true mitogen."
https://openalex.org/W1534226793,"A long form salivary thiol protease inhibitor, designated cystatin SA-I, was purified to homogeneity from human submandibular-sublingual saliva by sequential gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Automated peptide sequencing data revealed that cystatin SA-I shares sequence homologies with salivary cystatin SN, except that it contains an additional octapeptide at its NH2 terminus. To further characterize the molecular basis of salivary cystatin diversity, a mixed-base oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a region within the NH2-terminal sequence of the salivary cystatins was synthesized. This probe was used to screen a portion of a human submandibular gland cDNA library. The cDNA insert of a clone, designated pBR HSMSF 10G5.1, carried the entire peptide coding sequence of cystatin SA-I. The secretory peptide signal coding sequence was immediately followed by a sequence encoding the eight amino acid residues found at the NH2 terminus of purified cystatin SA-I. To estimate the number of genes encoding cystatins in the human genome, fragments of the pBR HSMSF 10G5.1 insert were used as probes in Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA. These analyses revealed that the human genome carries 4-7 homologous cystatin genes. Collectively, our data suggest that some of the diversity in salivary cystatins could be generated by expression of different members of a multigene family and by posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of NH2-terminal regions (cystatin SA-I to cystatin SN)."
https://openalex.org/W1609540268,"Gel shift assays have been employed to examine the association of the thyroid hormone receptor with specific DNA sequences in the 5′-flanking DNA of the rat growth hormone (rGH) gene. This DNA is known to have structure(s) that mediate thyroid hormone effects on the rGH promoter. The receptors used were obtained from preparations purified 300-500-fold from rat liver nuclear extracts and contained about 1% pure receptors. Thyroid hormone receptor binding to DNA was assessed by monitoring protein-bound 32P-labeled restriction endonuclease fragments in parallel with L-tri[125I]iodothyronine-labeled protein-DNA complexes. The receptors were found to bind specifically to four different regions of the rGH 5′-flanking DNA (nucleotides -1730 to -1230, -530 to -230, -181 to -149, and -149 to +12) numbered with respect to the transcriptional start site. The specificity of the binding was documented by the finding that the receptor did not bind to other rGH 5′-flanking DNA sequences or to several other DNAs and by the fact that only the DNAs exhibiting specific binding could block the binding of radiolabeled DNA. The binding was also detected in NaCl concentrations up to 140 mM, reduced by Mg2+ concentrations up to 5 mM, and inhibited by 1 mM zinc. The DNA sequence-specific binding of the receptor was found to require occupancy of the receptor by the hormone (L-triiodothyronine) and could also be observed when the receptor was occupied by the thyroid hormone antagonist amiodarone. These results indicate that thyroid hormone receptors interact specifically with several sites on the 5′-flanking DNA of the rGH gene and that hormone occupancy is not required for the binding. Thus, thyroid hormone may act by stimulating a transcriptional activation function of the receptor rather than by stimulating DNA binding per se."
https://openalex.org/W1606873232,"Polyclonal antibodies reactive against the guanine nucleotide binding stimulatory protein, Gs, were affinity-purified from two rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 28-42 in the alpha-subunit, alpha s. On immunoblots, these antibodies recognized alpha s, but not alpha-subunits from two other guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins, Gi and Go. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed in which inhibition of antibody binding to peptide-coated microtiter plates was used to quantitate purified Gs or Gs in cholate extracts of cell membranes. Plasma membranes derived from wild type S49 lymphoma cells contained 18.9 +/- 2.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein of alpha s. The same membranes bound 169 +/- 12 fmol/mg of protein of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to beta-adrenergic receptors, indicating that the amount of Gs is far in excess of the amount of beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus, even if every beta-adrenergic receptor molecule were to activate 10 Gs molecules, in order for Gs to be limiting for the receptors to reach their high affinity state, it is likely that compartmentation exists for target cell membrane receptors and Gs. Moreover, a comparison of beta-adrenergic receptor number and Gs levels in several different S49 lymphoma cell mutants having lesions in receptors or Gs argues against a coordinate regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1937918158,"An antibody (AS/7) prepared against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of the alpha subunit of transducin (alpha T) has been used in various reconstitution studies aimed at characterizing the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain in the different functional activities of transducin. The peptide-specific antibody is a potent inhibitor of the rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase activity in phospholipid vesicle systems containing pure rhodopsin and pure holo-transducin, or rhodopsin and the purified alpha T and beta/gamma (beta gamma T) subunit components, with the highest levels of inhibition (80-95%) occurring under conditions where the molar ratio of holo-transducin (or alpha T) to AS/7 approximately equal to 1. The inhibition of the receptor-stimulated GTPase does not represent an interference in the interactions between the alpha T subunit and the beta gamma T complex, since essentially identical levels of inhibition are observed when AS/7 is preincubated with either free alpha T, holo-transducin, or alpha T in the presence of excess beta gamma T, prior to assay. The AS/7-induced inhibition also does not appear to reflect an alteration in the ability of alpha T to bind or hydrolyze GTP and, in fact, the incubation of alpha T with AS/7 results in a stimulation of the intrinsic GTPase activity for alpha T alone (i.e. in the absence of rhodopsin). Thus, we conclude that the inhibition of the rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase activity by AS/7 is due to the direct blocking (by the antibody) of rhodopsin-alpha T interactions. While AS/7 is capable of uncoupling rhodopsin-transducin interactions, it appears to promote the stimulation of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by an activated alpha T subunit. Specifically, when the pure alpha T-guanosine 5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (alpha TGTP gamma S) species is preincubated with AS/7 prior to its addition to an assay solution containing PDE, there is at least a 4-fold increase in the resultant cyclic GMP hydrolysis relative to the activities measured with alpha TGTP gamma S, alone, or with alpha TGTP gamma S preincubated with nonimmune (control) rabbit IgG. The AS/7-induced promotion is specific for the active form of alpha T; the inactive alpha TGDP species does not stimulate PDE activity either in the presence or absence of the antibody. The different effects by AS/7 on the various activities of the alpha T subunit highlight the existence of distinct functional domains on alpha T.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1548907165,"A quinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1 complex) has been purified from plasma membranes of a thermophilic Bacillus, PS3, by ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100. The purified enzyme shows absorption bands at 561-562 nm and 553 nm at room temperature, and 560, 551, and 547 nm at 80 K upon reduction, and gives an ESR signal similar to that of a Rieske-type iron sulfur center. Its contents of protohemes, heme c, and non-heme iron are about 23, 10, and 21 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. The enzyme consists of four polypeptides with molecular masses of 29, 23, 21, and 14 kDa judging from their electrophoretic mobilities in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate. Since the staining intensities of the respective bands are almost proportional to their molecular masses, the monomer complex (87 kDa) of the subunits probably consists of a cytochrome b having two protohemes, a cytochrome c1 and an Fe2-S2-type iron sulfur center. The 29 and 21 kDa subunits were identified as cytochromes c1 and b, respectively, and the 23-kDa subunit is probably an iron-sulfur protein, since the 14-kDa polypeptide can be removed with 3 M urea without reducing the content of non-heme iron. Several characteristics of the subunits and chromophores indicate that the PS3 enzyme is rather similar to cytochrome b6f (a bc1 complex equivalent) of chloroplasts and Cyanobacteria. The PS3 complex catalyzes reduction of cytochrome c with various quinol compounds in the presence of P-lipids and menaquinone. The turnover number at pH 6.8 was about 5 s-1 at 40 degrees C and 50 s-1 at 60 degrees C. The enzyme is heat-stable up to 65 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1508277854,"Abstract Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has been purified 10,148-fold to a specific activity of 2.7 mumol/mg/min from bovine uteri. This purification was accomplished by detergent extraction of an acetone powder, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on MonoQ, S-Sepharose, MonoP, and hydroxylapatite columns. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 55 kDa and appears to be monomeric. Kinetic analyses of the enzymatic activity demonstrated apparent Km values of 18 microM and 22 micrograms/ml (approximately 26 microM) for ATP and phosphatidylinositol, respectively, optimal activity in the pH range of 6.0-7.0, and a sigmoidal dependence of enzymatic activity on [Mg2+]. Ca2+ inhibited the enzyme at nonphysiological concentrations with 50% inhibition observed at a free [Ca2+] of approximately 300 microM. The purified enzyme efficiently utilized both ATP and 2'-deoxy-ATP as phosphoryl donors and specifically phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol on the fourth position. No phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity was observed in the purified enzyme preparations. To our knowledge, this is the first reported purification of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1576680004,"A431 cells incubated with tunicamycin (0.15 micrograms/ml) for 40 h under conditions where incorporation of [3H] leucine into protein was inhibited less than 10% expressed mainly a beta-receptor species of about Mr 40,000 which was ascribed to the nonglycosylated form of the beta-receptor of about Mr 75,000 found in normal A431 cells by photoaffinity labeling. However, the tunicamycin-treated cells expressed the same number of specific beta 2-receptor-binding sites as untreated cells. Moreover, the aglycoreceptors had the same ligand binding properties as beta-adrenoceptors from control cells; but, functional tests of the receptor from tunicamycin-treated cells in reconstituted lipid vesicles showed that receptors from tunicamycin-treated cells had lost coupling efficiency. The coupling defect was at the receptor level since control experiments indicated that the other components of the signal transmission chain from beta-adrenoceptor to adenylate cyclase, the stimulatory regulatory GTP-binding protein of adenylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase, were fully functional. Homologous desensitization in tunicamycin-treated cells was characterized by export from the cell surface and sequestration of about the same number of beta-adrenoceptors as in normal desensitized cells but without further reduction of hormonally stimulated adenylate cyclase below the low level already attained in nondesensitized tunicamycin-treated cells. This was explained by assuming that the receptors removed in the course of homologous desensitization from the surface of tunicamycin-treated cells were already nonfunctional. Thus, beta-adrenergic desensitization in tunicamycin-treated cells is characterized by the functional disengagement of receptor removal and loss of adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1604268538,"Abstract The role for intracellular Ca2+ in modulating activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger was studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Na+/H+ exchange was activated by four distinct stimuli: 1) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 2) thrombin, 3) cell shrinkage, and 4) intracellular acid loading. [Ca2+]i was independently varied between 40 and 200 nM by varying the bathing Ca2+ from 10 nM to 5.0 mM. Thrombin-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients were blocked with bis(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (MAPTAM). In the absence of stimulators of Na+/H+ exchange, varying [Ca2+]i above or below the basal level of 140 nM did not activate Na+/H+ exchange spontaneously. However, varying [Ca2+]i did affect stimulus-induced activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Activation of the exchanger by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was blunted by reduced intracellular Ca2+ (half-maximal activity at 50-90 nM [Ca2+]i), consistent with a Ca2+ requirement for protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). Activation of the exchanger by thrombin in protein kinase C-depleted cells was also sensitive to reduced intracellular Ca2+ (half-maximal activity at 90-140 nM [Ca2+]i) and was increased 40% by raising [Ca2+]i to 200 nM. Activation of the exchanger by cell shrinkage or intracellular acid loads was not significantly affected over the range of [Ca2+]i tested. Thus, altered [Ca2+]i does not itself affect Na+/H+ exchange activity in vascular smooth muscle but instead modulates activation of the transporter by particular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1590876544,"We have varied the degree of protein-protein interactions among Ca-ATPase polypeptide chains in sarcoplasmic reticulum using the cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate and have measured both the rotational mobility and calcium-dependent ATPase activity of the Ca-ATPase in order to assess 1) the nature of the microsecond rotational motion measured by saturation transfer EPR (ST-EPR) of the spin-labeled Ca-ATPase and 2) the functional significance of this rotational motion. The Ca-ATPase was labeled specifically and covalently with a maleimide spin label, with full preservation of enzymatic activity. ST-EPR experiments show that cross-linking increases the enzyme's effective rotational correlation time (tau r), thus decreasing its rotational mobility (tau r-1). As the degree of cross-linking is varied, tau r is proportional to the mean molecular weight of the cross-linked aggregate, as predicted by theory, adding to the evidence that ST-EPR measures the overall rotational mobility of the Ca-ATPase with respect to the membrane normal. Furthermore, enzymatic activity correlates with overall protein rotational mobility, suggesting that this motion is functionally important. The second-order inactivation profile resulting from the use of either cross-linking or chemical modification with fluorescein isothiocyanate as modes of inactivation indicates that protein-protein interactions are critical to the reaction mechanism. However, the pattern of cross-linking observed on polyacrylamide gels demonstrates that cross-linking occurs in a random manner, indicating that no specific and stable oligomeric complexes exist. In order to rationalize both the functional need for protein mobility and the evidence that protein-protein interactions are critical and random, we propose that the enzymatic cycle of the Ca-ATPase involves the making and breaking of functionally important protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1580214060,"We have investigated the human CaCo-2 enterocyte model for secretion of the plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein, LTP-I. CaCo-2 cells secrete a cholesteryl ester transfer protein which possesses molecular identity with plasma LTP-I, demonstrated by anti-LTP-I immunoblot analysis and immunoinhibition of all cell-secreted cholesteryl ester transfer activity. When CaCo-2 are cultured on permeable membranes, cholesteryl ester transfer activity is detected only in the lower culture compartment. Thus, CaCo-2 vectorially sort and secrete LTP-I, as well as the intestinal apolipoproteins, from the basolateral cellular domain. Over a 24-h period, CaCo-2 secrete cholesteryl ester transfer activity in a time-dependent manner, at approximately twice the rate of HepG2. Furthermore, CaCo-2 enterocytes, but not HepG2 hepatocytes, regulate LTP-I secretion in response to fatty acid concentration in the culture medium. Based on these observations, we speculate that the intestine may be the principal regulated source of human plasma LTP-I."
https://openalex.org/W1607399614,"We have investigated the role of large-scale protein rotational mobility in the reaction mechanism of the Ca-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum using conditions that have previously been found to inhibit selectively phosphoenzyme decomposition, i.e. 1) partial delipidation (by detergent extraction or phospholipase treatment) and 2) the addition of nonaqueous solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, and sucrose). Using saturation-transfer electron paramagnetic resonance to probe the microsecond rotational motion of the spin-labeled Ca-ATPase, we find that both calcium-dependent ATPase activity and protein rotational mobility decrease in parallel, suggesting that protein mobility is important to the enzymatic step(s) involving phosphoenzyme decomposition. Using conventional EPR to measure the nanosecond rotational dynamics of spin-labeled lipid hydrocarbon chains, we find that neither the removal of lipid nor the addition of nonaqueous solvents significantly affects the lipid dynamics. We propose that the physical mode of inactivation under these conditions is the reduction in protein mobility through enforced protein-protein interactions, the result of which is a reduction in a motion essential for Ca-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1482876010,"It has been suggested that an intracellular alkalinization, resulting from stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange, is a necessary step and perhaps the signal leading to cellular proliferation in cells stimulated by mitogens. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the early stages of the proliferative cascade in cells where antiport activity was precluded by omission of Na+ or by the addition of potent amiloride analogs. To circumvent possible nonspecific effects due to long incubations under these conditions, an early response to mitogens, the increased level of c-fos mRNA, was monitored. In rat thymic lymphocytes, the increase in the level of c-fos RNA induced by the combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and ionomycin was unaffected by inhibition of the antiport with 5-(N-ethyl-N-propyl)amiloride. Increased c-fos RNA was also observed in the absence of Na+ and when alkalinization was prevented by means of nigericin. Similar results were obtained with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T lymphocytes. Moreover, although the lectin stimulated the antiport in these cells, an alkalinization was not observed, due to the concomitant occurrence of an acidifying process. It was concluded that the stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport that accompanies the addition of mitogens is neither sufficient nor necessary for the initiation of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1537919456,"We have purified two distinct isoforms of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 from beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF)-induced rat liver to greater than 85% homogeneity and characterized their molecular and catalytic properties. One of these isoforms showing an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa is termed P-450mt1 and the second isoform with 54-kDa molecular mass is termed P-450mt2. Cytochrome P-450mt2 comigrates with similarly induced microsomal P-450c (the major beta-NF-inducible form) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and cross-reacts with polyclonal antibody monospecific for cytochrome P-450c. Cytochrome P-450mt2, however, represents a distinct molecular species since it failed to react with a monoclonal antibody to P-450c and produced V8 protease fingerprints different from P-450c. Cytochrome P-450mt1, on the other hand, did not show any immunochemical homology with P-450c or P-450mt2 as well as partially purified P-450 from control mitochondria. Electrophoretic comparisons and Western blot analysis show that both P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 are induced forms not present in detectable levels in control liver mitochondria. A distinctive property of mitochondrial P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 was that their catalytic activities could be reconstituted with both NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase as well as mitochondrial specific ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase electron transfer systems, while P-450c showed exclusive requirement for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Cytochromes P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 were able to metabolize xenobiotics like benzo(a)pyrene and dimethyl benzanthracene at rates only one-tenth with cytochrome P-450c. Furthermore, P-450mt1, P-450mt2, as well as partially purified P-450 from control liver, but not P-450c, showed varying activities for 25- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3. These results provide evidence for the presence of at least two distinct forms of beta-NF-inducible cytochrome P-450 in rat hepatic mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1551544857,"The mechanism of expression of the overlapping genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of aspartokinase II of Bacillus subtilis was studied by specific mutagenesis of the cloned coding sequence. Escherichia coli or B. subtilis VB31 (aspartokinase II-deficient), transformed with plasmids carrying either a deletion of the translation start site and about one-half of the coding region for the larger alpha subunit or a frameshift mutation early in the alpha subunit coding region, produced the smaller beta subunit in the absence of alpha subunit synthesis, indicating that beta subunit is not derived from alpha subunit and that its synthesis does not depend on the alpha subunit translation initiation site. The beta subunit translation start site was identified by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the putative translation start codon. Modification of the nucleotide sequence encoding methionine residue 247 of the alpha subunit from ATG to either TTA or AAT (but not GTG) abolished beta subunit synthesis but had no effect on the production of alpha subunit. This observation is consistent with peptide chain initiation by N-formylmethionine, which specifically requires an ATG or GTG sequence, and indicates that translation of the beta subunit starts at a site corresponding to Met247 of the alpha subunit. Initial studies on the function of the aspartokinase II subunits, using E. coli as a heterologous host, showed that beta subunit was not essential for the expression of the catalytic function of aspartokinase, measured in vitro and in vivo, nor for its allosteric regulation by L-lysine. Whether the beta subunit has a function specific to B. subtilis needs to be explored in a homologous expression system."
https://openalex.org/W1575096331,"Fructose-6-P,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase has been purified to homogeneity from beef heart. The enzyme was bifunctional and the specific activities of the kinase and the phosphatase of the pure enzyme were 60 and 30 milliunits/mg, respectively. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 118,000, consisting of two subunits of 58,000. In some preparations of the enzyme a minor protein with a subunit Mr of 54,000 was present. This minor protein (54,000) was also bifunctional and showed the same immunoreactivity as the major protein. The specific activity of fructose-6-P,2-kinase of the minor component was three times higher than that of the major enzyme (58,000), but fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity was the same. These two forms have been separated by phosphocellulose chromatography. The tryptic peptide maps of these enzymes were very similar. The 58,000 enzyme was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase but the 54,000 enzyme was not. These results indicated that the minor 54,000 protein might be a proteolytically digested form of the 58,000 enzyme. The Km of the kinase for fructose-6-P and ATP was 70 microM and 260 microM, respectively for both the 58,000 and the 54,000 enzymes. Km for fructose-2,6-P2 and Ki for fructose-6-P of the phosphatase was approximately 40 and 11 microM, respectively. The enzyme was phosphorylated by fructose-2,6-P2 but the stoichiometry of the phosphate incorporation was 0.05 mol/mol subunit, while 0.4 mol/mol was incorporated in rat liver enzyme under the same conditions."

A double mutant carrying an additional lesion in the nuclear localization signal was also localized in the cytoplasm, but regained the ability to transform rat2 cells and no longer affected the nuclear localization of fiber protein.

https://openalex.org/W1491019605,"The interactions of nitrous oxide with cytochrome c oxidase isolated from bovine heart muscle have been investigated in search of an explanation for the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by the inhalation anesthetic. Oxidase activity of the isolated enzyme is partially and reversibly reduced by nitrous oxide. N2O molecules are shown by infrared spectroscopy to occupy sites within the oxidase. Occupancy of sites within the protein by N2O has no observed effects on visible Soret spectra or on the O2 reaction site; no evidence is found for N2O serving as a ligand to a metal. The anesthetic does not substitute for O2 as an oxygen atom donor in either the cytochrome c oxidase or carbon monoxide dioxygenase reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. N2O appears to affect oxidase activity by reducing the rate of electron transfer from cytochrome c to the O2 reaction site rather than by interfering directly with the reduction of O2 to water. Cytochrome c oxidase represents a target site for nitrous oxide and possibly other anesthetics, and the inhibition of oxidase activity may contribute significantly to the anesthetic and/or toxic effects of these substances."
https://openalex.org/W1573369251,"Reciprocal hybrids were constructed between human and mouse interferons (IFNs), and their antiviral activity was examined on different target cells and compared to the activity of the parental molecules. In addition, we used a number of predictive algorithms on a data base of the available alpha-interferon sequences to propose a working model for the overall conformation of the alpha-interferon molecule that is consistent with the structural predictions. Remarkable conservation within the predicted alpha-helical segments of the interferon molecule was observed. We propose that the observed changes in the activity and specificity of the hybrids obtained are largely due to the sequences present in the loops at the ends of the major helical structures; these are less conserved, contain beta-bends, and are generally hydrophilic and flexible. The data on the constructed mouse-human hybrids have shown that the activity on human cells is contributed by determinants present in the N-terminal 122 amino acids of human IFN, thus implicating one or more loops within this region (e.g. loops 1-12, 25-38, 70-74, and 103-113). The activity on bovine cells appears to be localized mainly in sequence 60-121, implicating the role of loops 70-74 and/or 103-113 of the human IFN molecule. The specificity of mouse IFN for mouse cells is in some or all of the loops (70-74, 103-113, 134-139, and 163-166) in the C-terminal sequence. The proposed working model should provide guidelines for the study of the specificity of action in molecular terms."
https://openalex.org/W1580989767,"The interaction of AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate with rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase has been investigated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). The temperature dependence of the line widths of the proton resonances of AMP as a function of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase concentration indicates that the nucleotide C2 proton is in fast exchange on the NMR time scale while the C8 proton is exchange limit. The exchange rate constant, koff, has been calculated for the adenine C8 proton and is 1900 s-1. Binding of fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate, or the regulatory inhibitor, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, results in a decrease in the dissociation rate constant for AMP from fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, as indicated by the sharpened AMP signals. A temperature dependence experiment indicates that the AMP protons are in slow exchange when AMP dissociates from the ternary complex. The rate constant for dissociation of AMP from the enzyme.AMP.fructose 2,6-bisphosphate complex is 70 s-1, 27-fold lower than that of AMP from the binary complex. These results are sufficient to explain the enhanced binding of AMP in the presence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and, therefore, the synergistic inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase observed with these two regulatory ligands. Binding of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to the enzyme results in broadening of the ligand proton signals. The effect of AMP on the binding of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to the enzyme has also been investigated. An additional line width broadening of all the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate protons has been observed in the presence of AMP. The assignment of these signals to the sugar was accomplished by two-dimensional proton-proton correlated spectra (two-dimensional COSY) NMR. From these data, it is concluded that AMP can also affect fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binding to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2120940739,"Recent evidence suggests that the function of receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins may be controlled by highly specific protein kinases, e.g. rhodopsin kinase and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase. In order to investigate the nature of the phosphatases which might be involved in controlling the state of receptor phosphorylation we studied the ability of four highly purified well characterized protein phosphatases to dephosphorylate preparations of rhodopsin or beta 2-adrenergic receptor which had been highly phosphorylated by beta-adrenergic receptor kinase. These included: type 1 phosphatase, calcineurin phosphatase, type 2A phosphatase, and the high molecular weight latent phosphatase 2. Under conditions in which all the phosphatases could dephosphorylate such common substrates as [32P]phosphorylase a and [32P]myelin basic protein at similar rates only the latent phosphatase 2 was active on the phosphorylated receptors. Moreover, a latent phosphatase activity was found predominantly in a sequestered membrane fraction of frog erythrocytes. This parallels the distribution of a beta-adrenergic receptor phosphatase activity recently described in these cells (Sibley, D. R., Strasser, R. H., Benovic, J. L., Daniel, K., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 9408-9412). These data suggest a potential role for the latent phosphatase 2 as a specific receptor phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1499378420,"In the preceding paper, we have identified a protein of Mr = 118,000 which is induced by stress conditions that lead to cessation of DNA synthesis and cell division (Verma, R., Iida, H., and Pardee, A.B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8569-8575). In the current study, we have investigated the possible role this protein may play in cellular proliferation by studying p118 expression in mutants of the cAMP metabolic pathway. The cyr 1-2 mutant gene encodes a thermolabile adenylate cyclase whose activity is only 7% of wild type even at permissive temperatures (23 degrees C). We have found that at 23 degrees C, the G1 period was 5-fold longer in cyr 1-2 than in CYR1+ cells and that p118 was constitutively expressed in these slow cycling mutants. Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to cyr 1-2 mutants restored growth at both the restrictive and permissive temperatures and resulted in a shut-off in the synthesis of p118. The effect of the analog on p118 expression was rapid, preceding the increase in cell number and percentage-budded cells. In contrast to wild type cells, p118 synthesis was not induced by sulfur starvation in RAS2val19 mutants possessing high levels of adenylate cyclase activity and bcy1 mutants defective in the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. A large body of evidence exists supporting a role of cAMP in positive control of cell proliferation. It is therefore possible that conditions which decrease cAMP arrest growth through a chain of events that include p118 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1573100964,"Tyrosine countertransport was used to demonstrate the hormonal stimulation of neutral amino acid transport across the lysosomal membrane of FRTL-5 cells. Cells grown with thyrotropin (1 X 10(-10) M) had 7-fold (+/- S.E.) higher tyrosine countertransport activity in their lysosomes than cells grown without thyrotropin. Thyrotropin also stimulated the uptake into tyrosine-loaded lysosomes of other neutral amino acids recognized by the tyrosine carrier, namely, phenylalanine (3-fold) and leucine (6-fold). In contrast lysosomal cystine countertransport was not affected by thyrotropin. Addition of thyrotropin to cells grown without thyrotropin showed that the stimulation of tyrosine counter-transport (a) required at least 48 h to reach the level of the thyrotropin-supplemented cells, (b) depended upon protein synthesis, since cycloheximide (20 microM) was inhibitory, and (c) depended upon RNA synthesis, since actinomycin D (1 nM) was inhibitory. Cells grown without thyrotropin but with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) or cholera toxin (1 nM) exhibited enhanced lysosomal countertransport of tyrosine, suggesting that cyclic AMP may act as a messenger. This represents the first demonstration of hormonal responsiveness in a lysosomal transport system and may reflect the importance of salvage and reutilization of lysosomal degradation products for the thyroid epithelial cell."
https://openalex.org/W2017864579,"Abstract We have previously published that bilateral adrenalectomy in the rat reduces the Ca2+-mediated alpha-adrenergic activation of hepatic glycogenolysis, while it increases the cellular calcium content of hepatocytes. In the experiments presented here, the concentration of cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) at rest and in response to epinephrine was measured in aequorin-loaded hepatocytes isolated from sham and adrenalectomized male rats. We found that in adrenalectomized rats the resting Ca2+i was elevated, the rise in Ca2+i evoked by epinephrine was reduced, and the rise in 45Ca efflux that follows such stimulation was depressed. Furthermore, the slope of the relationship between Ca2+i and calcium efflux was decreased 60% in adrenalectomized. Adrenalectomy did not change Ca2+ release from intracellular calcium pools in response to IP3 in saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes. The EC50 for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and the maximal Ca2+ released were similar in both sham and adrenalectomized animals. Finally, the liver calmodulin content determined by radioimmunoassay was not significantly different between sham and adrenalectomized rats. These results suggest that 1) adrenalectomy reduces calcium efflux from the hepatocyte, probably by an effect on the plasma membrane (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase-dependent Ca2+ pump and thus alters cellular calcium homeostasis; 2) adrenalectomy decreases the rise in Ca2+i in response to epinephrine; 3) this decreased rise in Ca2+i is not due to defects in the intracellular Ca2+ storage and mobilization processes; and 4) the effects of adrenalectomy on cellular calcium metabolism and on alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis are not caused by a reduction in soluble calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1502141321,"Abstract An assay that employs nucleoside 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphates) was used to detect initiation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA chains in preparations of isolated nuclei from cultured rat hepatoma cells containing stably integrated proviruses. RNA chains initiated with adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate), guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate), or uridine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) were separated from the remaining RNA by mercury-Sepharose column chromatography and analyzed for correctly initiated RNA chains with a T1 nuclease protection assay. Combined use of the thionucleotide transcription reaction with the T1 nuclease assay allowed precise localization of the transcription start sites. The majority of MMTV RNA chains were initiated with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) at a template site 133 nucleotides upstream from a PvuII site that coincides with the right end of the long terminal repeat. However, some RNA chains were also initiated with adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) and uridine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) at template sites within three nucleotides of the primary guanosine start site. When Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+ in the transcription reaction, MMTV RNA chains were initiated with approximately the same efficiency, but the start site was shifted to a position approximately 40 nucleotides downstream from the physiological start site; in the presence of Mn2+, MMTV RNA chains were initiated only with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate). When the nuclei were exposed to both Mn2+ and Mg2+, transcription initiated at the manganese-dependent site. Mn2+ also caused the transcription start site for 45 S pre-rRNA to shift about 10 nucleotides upstream from the physiologically correct start site."
