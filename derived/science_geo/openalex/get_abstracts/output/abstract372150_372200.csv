https://openalex.org/W2040125628,"Photosynthetic diatoms are exposed to rapid and unpredictable changes in irradiance and spectral quality, and must be able to acclimate their light harvesting systems to varying light conditions. Molecular mechanisms behind light acclimation in diatoms are largely unknown. We set out to investigate the mechanisms of high light acclimation in Phaeodactylum tricornutum using an integrated approach involving global transcriptional profiling, metabolite profiling and variable fluorescence technique. Algae cultures were acclimated to low light (LL), after which the cultures were transferred to high light (HL). Molecular, metabolic and physiological responses were studied at time points 0.5 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after transfer to HL conditions. The integrated results indicate that the acclimation mechanisms in diatoms can be divided into an initial response phase (0–0.5 h), an intermediate acclimation phase (3–12 h) and a late acclimation phase (12–48 h). The initial phase is recognized by strong and rapid regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis, pigment metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems. A significant increase in light protecting metabolites occur together with the induction of transcriptional processes involved in protection of cellular structures at this early phase. During the following phases, the metabolite profiling display a pronounced decrease in light harvesting pigments, whereas the variable fluorescence measurements show that the photosynthetic capacity increases strongly during the late acclimation phase. We show that P. tricornutum is capable of swift and efficient execution of photoprotective mechanisms, followed by changes in the composition of the photosynthetic machinery that enable the diatoms to utilize the excess energy available in HL. Central molecular players in light protection and acclimation to high irradiance have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2026982395,"Background Drought is one of the major constraints for plant productivity worldwide. Different mechanisms of drought-tolerance have been reported for several plant species including maize. However, the differences in global gene expression between drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes and their relationship to physiological adaptations to drought are largely unknown. The study of the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and susceptible genotypes could provide important information to design more efficient breeding programs to produce maize varieties better adapted to water limiting conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Changes in physiological responses and gene expression patterns were studied under drought stress and recovery in three Mexican maize landraces which included two drought tolerant (Cajete criollo and Michoacán 21) and one susceptible (85-2) genotypes. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, soil and leaf water potentials were monitored throughout the experiment and microarray analysis was carried out on transcripts obtained at 10 and 17 days following application of stress and after recovery irrigation. The two tolerant genotypes show more drastic changes in global gene expression which correlate with different physiological mechanisms of adaptation to drought. Differences in the kinetics and number of up- and down-regulated genes were observed between the tolerant and susceptible maize genotypes, as well as differences between the two tolerant genotypes. Interestingly, the most dramatic differences between the tolerant and susceptible genotypes were observed during recovery irrigation, suggesting that the tolerant genotypes activate mechanisms that allow more efficient recovery after a severe drought. Conclusions/Significance A correlation between levels of photosynthesis and transcription under stress was observed and differences in the number, type and expression levels of transcription factor families were also identified under drought and recovery between the three maize landraces. Gene expression analysis suggests that the drought tolerant landraces have a greater capacity to rapidly modulate more genes under drought and recovery in comparison to the susceptible landrace. Modulation of a greater number of differentially expressed genes of different TF gene families is an important characteristic of the tolerant genotypes. Finally, important differences were also noted between the tolerant landraces that underlie different mechanisms of achieving tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2073464835,"The effect of blocking VEGF activity in solid tumors extends beyond inhibition of angiogenesis. However, no studies have compared the effectiveness of mechanistically different anti-VEGF inhibitors with respect to changes in tumor growth and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. In this study we use three distinct breast cancer models, a MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, a 4T1 syngenic model, and a transgenic model using MMTV-PyMT mice, to explore the effects of various anti-VEGF therapies on tumor vasculature, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine levels. Tumor vasculature and immune cell infiltration were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA and electrochemiluminescence. We found that blocking the activation of VEGF receptor resulted in changes in intra-tumoral cytokine levels, specifically IL-1β, IL-6 and CXCL1. Modulation of the level these cytokines is important for controlling immune cell infiltration and ultimately tumor growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 with r84 is more effective at controlling tumor growth and inhibiting the infiltration of suppressive immune cells (MDSC, Treg, macrophages) while increasing the mature dendritic cell fraction than other anti-VEGF strategies. In addition, we found that changes in serum IL-1β and IL-6 levels correlated with response to therapy, identifying two possible biomarkers for assessing the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1989571789,"Dramatic declines in amphibian populations have been described all over the world since the 1980s. The evidence that the sensitivity to environmental threats is greater in amphibians than in mammals has been generally linked to the observation that amphibians are characterized by a rather permeable skin. Nevertheless, a numerical comparison of data of percutaneous (through the skin) passage between amphibians and mammals is lacking. Therefore, in this investigation we have measured the percutaneous passage of two test molecules (mannitol and antipyrine) and three heavily used herbicides (atrazine, paraquat and glyphosate) in the skin of the frog Rana esculenta (amphibians) and of the pig ear (mammals), by using the same experimental protocol and a simple apparatus which minimizes the edge effect, occurring when the tissue is clamped in the usually used experimental device. The percutaneous passage (P) of each substance is much greater in frog than in pig. LogP is linearly related to logKow (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient). The measured P value of atrazine was about 134 times larger than that of glyphosate in frog skin, but only 12 times in pig ear skin. The FoD value (Pfrog/Ppig) was 302 for atrazine, 120 for antipyrine, 66 for mannitol, 29 for paraquat, and 26 for glyphosate. The differences in structure and composition of the skin between amphibians and mammals are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2051181165,"Background Enterococcus faecalis plays a dual role in human ecology, predominantly existing as a commensal in the alimentary canal, but also as an opportunistic pathogen that frequently causes nosocomial infections like bacteremia. A number of virulence factors that contribute to the pathogenic potential of E. faecalis have been established. However, the process in which E. faecalis gains access to the bloodstream and establishes a persistent infection is not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To enhance our understanding of how this commensal bacterium adapts during a bloodstream infection and to examine the interplay between genes we designed an in vitro experiment using genome-wide microarrays to investigate what effects the presence of and growth in blood have on the transcriptome of E. faecalis strain V583. We showed that growth in both 2xYT supplemented with 10% blood and in 100% blood had a great impact on the transcription of many genes in the V583 genome. We identified several immediate changes signifying cellular processes that might contribute to adaptation and growth in blood. These include modulation of membrane fatty acid composition, oxidative and lytic stress protection, acquisition of new available substrates, transport functions including heme/iron transporters and genes associated with virulence in E. faecalis. Conclusions/Significance The results presented here reveal that cultivation of E. faecalis in blood in vitro has a profound impact on its transcriptome, which includes a number of virulence traits. Observed regulation of genes and pathways revealed new insight into physiological features and metabolic capacities which enable E. faecalis to adapt and grow in blood. A number of the regulated genes might potentially be useful candidates for development of new therapeutic approaches for treatment of E. faecalis infections."
https://openalex.org/W1995594381,"Background Testing for tumor specific mutations on routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues may predict response to treatment in Medical Oncology and has already entered diagnostics, with KRAS mutation assessment as a paradigm. The highly sensitive real time PCR (Q-PCR) methods developed for this purpose are usually standardized under optimal template conditions. In routine diagnostics, however, suboptimal templates pose the challenge. Herein, we addressed the applicability of sequencing and two Q-PCR methods on prospectively assessed diagnostic cases for KRAS mutations. Methodology/Principal Findings Tumor FFPE-DNA from 135 diagnostic and 75 low-quality control samples was obtained upon macrodissection, tested for fragmentation and assessed for KRAS mutations with dideoxy-sequencing and with two Q-PCR methods (Taqman-minor-groove-binder [TMGB] probes and DxS-KRAS-IVD). Samples with relatively well preserved DNA could be accurately analyzed with sequencing, while Q-PCR methods yielded informative results even in cases with very fragmented DNA (p<0.0001) with 100% sensitivity and specificity vs each other. However, Q-PCR efficiency (Ct values) also depended on DNA-fragmentation (p<0.0001). Q-PCR methods were sensitive to detect ≤1% mutant cells, provided that samples yielded cycle thresholds (Ct) <29, but this condition was met in only 38.5% of diagnostic samples. In comparison, FFPE samples (>99%) could accurately be analyzed at a sensitivity level of 10% (external validation of TMGB results). DNA quality and tumor cell content were the main reasons for discrepant sequencing/Q-PCR results (1.5%). Conclusions/Significance Diagnostic targeted mutation assessment on FFPE-DNA is very efficient with Q-PCR methods in comparison to dideoxy-sequencing. However, DNA fragmentation/amplification capacity and tumor DNA content must be considered for the interpretation of Q-PCR results in order to provide accurate information for clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2041703219,"The repressor element-1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) is a master transcriptional regulator that binds to numerous genomic RE1 sites where it acts as a molecular scaffold for dynamic recruitment of modulatory and epigenetic cofactors, including corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST). CoREST also acts as a hub for various cofactors that play important roles in epigenetic remodeling and transcriptional regulation. While REST can recruit CoREST to its macromolecular complex, CoREST complexes also function at genomic sites independently of REST. REST and CoREST perform a broad array of context-specific functions, which include repression of neuronal differentiation genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) and other non-neuronal cells as well as promotion of neurogenesis. Despite their involvement in multiple aspects of neuronal development, REST and CoREST are not believed to have any direct modulatory roles in glial cell maturation.We challenged this view by performing the first study of REST and CoREST in NSC-mediated glial lineage specification and differentiation. Utilizing ChIP on chip (ChIP-chip) assays, we identified distinct but overlapping developmental stage-specific profiles for REST and CoREST target genes during astrocyte (AS) and oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage specification and OL lineage maturation and myelination, including many genes not previously implicated in glial cell biology or linked to REST and CoREST regulation. Amongst these factors are those implicated in macroglial (AS and OL) cell identity, maturation, and maintenance, such as members of key developmental signaling pathways and combinatorial transcription factor codes.Our results imply that REST and CoREST modulate not only neuronal but also glial lineage elaboration. These factors may therefore mediate critical developmental processes including the coupling of neurogenesis and gliogenesis and neuronal-glial interactions that underlie synaptic and neural network plasticity and homeostasis in health and in specific neurological disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2073763849,"Uganda has one of the highest total fertility rates (TFR) worldwide. We compared the effects of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) to that of existing family planning (FP) use and estimated the burden of pediatric HIV disease due to unwanted fertility.Using the demographic software Spectrum, a baseline mathematical projection to estimate the current pediatric HIV burden in Uganda was compared to three hypothetical projections: 1) without ARV-PMTCT (to estimate the effect of ARV-PMTCT), 2) without contraception (effect of existing FP use), 3) without unwanted fertility (effect of unmet FP needs). Key input parameters included HIV prevalence, ARV-PMTCT uptake, MTCT probabilities, and TFR. We estimate that in 2007, an estimated 25,000 vertical infections and 17,000 pediatric AIDS deaths occurred (baseline projection). Existing ARV-PMTCT likely averted 8.1% of infections and 8.5% of deaths. FP use likely averted 19.7% of infections and 13.1% of deaths. Unwanted fertility accounted for 21.3% of infections and 13.4% of deaths. During 2008-2012, an estimated 131,000 vertical infections and 71,000 pediatric AIDS deaths will occur. The projected scale up of ARV-PMTCT (from 39%-57%) may avert 18.1% of infections and 24.5% of deaths. Projected FP use may avert 21.6% of infections and 18.5% of deaths. Unwanted fertility will account for 24.5% of infections and 19.8% of deaths.Existing FP use contributes as much or more than ARV-PMTCT in mitigating pediatric HIV in Uganda. Expanding FP services can substantially contribute towards PMTCT."
https://openalex.org/W2051790918,"Background The objective of this study was to establish a culture system and elucidate the unique characteristics of a bovine mammary epithelial cell line in vitro. Methodology Mammary tissue from a three year old lactating dairy cow (ca. 100 d relative to parturition) was used as a source of the epithelial cell line, which was cultured in collagen-coated tissue culture dishes. Fibroblasts and epithelial cells successively grew and extended from the culturing mammary tissue at the third day. Pure epithelial cells were obtained by passages culture. Principal Findings The strong positive immunostaining to cytokeratin 18 suggested that the resulting cell line exhibited the specific character of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells cultured in the presence of 10% FBS, supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin, and hydrocortisone maintained a normal diploid chromosome modal number of 2n = 60. Furthermore, they were capable of synthesizing β-casein (CSN2), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACACA) and butyrophilin (BTN1A1). An important finding was that frozen preservation in a mixture of 90% FBS and 10% DMSO did not influence the growth characteristics, chromosome number, or protein secretion of the isolated epithelial cell line. Conclusions The obtained mammary epithelial cell line had normal morphology, growth characteristics, cytogenetic and secretory characteristics, thus, it might represent an useful tool for studying the function of Chinese Holstein dairy cows mammary epithelial cell (CMECs)."
https://openalex.org/W2059015755,"Background Chimeras are organisms containing tissues or cells of two or more genetically distinct individuals, and are known to exist in at least nine phyla of protists, plants, and animals. Although widespread and common in marine invertebrates, the extent of chimerism in wild populations of reef corals is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings The extent of chimerism was explored within two populations of a common coral, Acropora millepora, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, by using up to 12 polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. At least 2% and 5% of Magnetic Island and Pelorus Island populations of A. millepora, respectively, were found to be chimeras (3% overall), based on conservative estimates. A slightly less conservative estimate indicated that 5% of colonies in each population were chimeras. These values are likely to be vast underestimates of the true extent of chimerism, as our sampling protocol was restricted to a maximum of eight branches per colony, while most colonies consist of hundreds of branches. Genotypes within chimeric corals showed high relatedness, indicating that genetic similarity is a prerequisite for long-term acceptance of non-self genotypes within coral colonies. Conclusions/Significance While some brooding corals have been shown to form genetic chimeras in their early life history stages under experimental conditions, this study provides the first genetic evidence of the occurrence of coral chimeras in the wild and of chimerism in a broadcast spawning species. We hypothesize that chimerism is more widespread in corals than previously thought, and suggest that this has important implications for their resilience, potentially enhancing their capacity to compete for space and respond to stressors such as pathogen infection."
https://openalex.org/W2154559315,"The JNK pathway is a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway involved in the regulation of numerous physiological processes during development and in response to environmental stress. JNK activity is controlled by two MAPK kinases (MAPKK), Mkk4 and Mkk7. Mkk7 plays a prominent role upon Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) stimulation. Eiger, the unique TNF-superfamily ligand in Drosophila, potently activates JNK signaling through the activation of the MAPKKK Tak1.In a dominant suppressor screen for new components of the Eiger/JNK-pathway in Drosophila, we have identified an allelic series of the Mkk4 gene. Our genetic and biochemical results demonstrate that Mkk4 is dispensable for normal development and host resistance to systemic bacterial infection but plays a non-redundant role as a MAPKK acting in parallel to Hemipterous/Mkk7 in dTAK1-mediated JNK activation upon Eiger and Imd pathway activation.In contrast to mammals, it seems that in Drosophila both MAPKKs, Hep/Mkk7 and Mkk4, are required to induce JNK upon TNF or pro-inflammatory stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2000872571,"Proteasome activity is regulated by sequestration of its proteolytic centers in a barrel-shaped structure that limits substrate access. Substrates enter the proteasome by means of activator complexes that bind to the end rings of proteasome α subunits and induce opening of an axial entrance/exit pore. The PA26 activator binds in a pocket on the proteasome surface using main chain contacts of its C-terminal residues and uses an internal activation loop to trigger gate opening by repositioning the proteasome Pro-17 reverse turn. Subunits of the unrelated PAN/19S activators bind with their C termini in the same pockets but can induce proteasome gate opening entirely from interactions of their C-terminal peptides, which are reported to cause gate opening by inducing a rocking motion of proteasome α subunits rather than by directly contacting the Pro-17 turn. Here we report crystal structures and binding studies of proteasome complexes with PA26 constructs that display modified C-terminal residues, including those corresponding to PAN. These findings suggest that PA26 and PAN/19S C-terminal residues bind superimposably and that both classes of activator induce gate opening by using direct contacts to residues of the proteasome Pro-17 reverse turn. In the case of the PAN and 19S activators, a penultimate tyrosine/phenylalanine residue contacts the proteasome Gly-19 carbonyl oxygen to stabilize the open conformation.

Trans. 2007; 35: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), also known as 20S proteasome/CP/core particle, is a proteolytic complex that is abundant in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotes, where it performs most of the housekeeping and regulatory proteolysis. Substrate proteins are typically targeted for proteasomal degradation by the posttranslational attachment of polyubiquitin chains. Proteasomes degrade numerous and diverse substrate proteins, which is a necessary function for many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and antigen presentation. Proteasomes are also found in archaea and some eubacteria. Proteasomes avoid indiscriminate degradation by virtue of their multimeric architecture, which sequesters the active sites inside a barrel-like assembly of four coaxially stacked heptameric rings, with two outer α rings surrounding two inner β rings (4Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 5Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Archaeal proteasomes, such as that of Thermoplasma acidophilum, comprise one type of α subunit and one type of β subunit and therefore possess an exact seven-fold axis of symmetry (4Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In contrast, eukaryotic proteasomes contain seven distinct α subunits (α1–α7) and seven distinct β subunits (β1–β7) that occupy unique positions in their respective rings (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The various α and β subunits are structurally related and typically share 15–30% sequence identity, with α subunits distinguished by an N-terminal extension of ∼35 residues that functions in activator binding and entrance/exit pore gating. Despite the differences in subunit composition, proteasome structure is highly conserved between archaea, yeast, and mammals (4Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

Biol. 2003; 327: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Substrate access to the proteasome interior is restricted to proteins that are largely unfolded by a constricted entrance pore through the α subunit ring (4Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Access is further restricted by α subunit N-terminal residues, which in eukaryotic proteasomes adopt an ordered asymmetric structure that seals the pore (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). These residues are flexible in the symmetric archaeal proteasomes but nevertheless provide an effective barrier to passage of protein substrates (9Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemüller E. Baumeister W.

Thus, a critical step in proteasome activation is stabilization of the entrance gate in an open conformation that allows substrates passage into the catalytic chamber. Gate opening is achieved when activator complexes bind to the α subunit rings, and three distinct activator complexes have been identified to date: 19S/PA700/RP/PAN 2The abbreviations used are: PANproteasome-activating nucleotidasePA26proteasome activator 26 kDa.

Biochemical and electron microscopic studies suggest that C-terminal residues of PAN/19 activators bind to proteasome in the same manner as PA26 (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H.

Instead these activators can induce gate opening using only interactions from their C-terminal residues, which include a critical penultimate tyrosine (33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D.

In an effort to better understand how C-terminal residues of PAN/19S can provide both binding and gate-opening functions in the absence of an internal activation loop, we have determined proteasome complex crystal structures with a series of PA26 constructs that display modified C-terminal residues and performed associated binding studies. These data indicate a role for the penultimate PAN/19S side chain in both binding and stabilizing the proteasome Pro-17 residues in an open conformation. See the supplemental material for a more complete description of the experimental procedures. Briefly, PA26 variants were constructed using standard methods, and the PA26 proteins and T. acidophilum and S. cerevisiae proteasomes were prepared by modifications of the published procedures (5Seemüller E.

Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Structures were isomorphous to the parent PA26-proteasome complex (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and were refined to Rfree values of 22.5%-24.1% against 2.9–3.2 Åresolution data (supplemental Table S1). Human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was immobilized on all six flow cells of a GLM sensor chip in the ProteOn XPR36 system (Bio-Rad) using standard amine coupling chemistry. Two g of pulverized yeast extract was dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The clarified lysate was captured on the IgG surface at five different densities (100–1000 response units). Resulting surfaces were washed with a 10-min injection of running buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 190 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing first 500 mm NaCl and then 1 m NaCl. PA26 proteins were tested in a 3-fold dilution series using the highest concentration for each sample as follows: PA26 (1 μm), C7PAN (333 nm), C7PAN Y230A (1 μm), V230F (111 nm), and V230Y (111 nm). Data were collected at 25 °C. Sensor data were processed using ScrubberPro6 (BioLogic Software Pty. Ltd., Campbell, Australia) and globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model. To obtain atomic resolution models of interactions between PAN/19S C-terminal residues and the proteasome, we constructed PA26 variants that displayed altered C termini. This effort was guided by the previously reported crystal structure complexes of PA26 with S. cerevisiae and T. acidophilum proteasomes (10Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P.

Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These structures demonstrated that the 8 C-terminal residues project away from the body of PA26, with the first 5 of these residues being loosely structured and the 3 C-terminal residues forming main chain hydrogen bonds with the proteasome α subunit residues 80–82 and with the PA26 C-terminal carboxylate binding the invariant proteasome α subunit Lys-66 side chain (T. acidophilum proteasome residue numbering is used throughout) (Fig. 1, A and B). Because biochemical and electron microscopic data suggest that PAN/19S C-terminal residues bind in the same manner as PA26 (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we predicted that substitution of the C-terminal residues of PA26 for those of PAN would reveal how the penultimate tyrosine side chain interacts with α subunits and contributes to gate opening (33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We crystallized three chimeric PA26 constructs in complex with the T. acidophilum proteasome. One of the constructs displayed the 7 C-terminal residues of M. jannaschii PAN (C7PAN), and two displayed changes only in the penultimate residue (V230Y, V230F) (Fig. 1C). We also attempted to generate PA26 variants with altered activation loop residues that would bind to the proteasome but would fail to induce the ordered open gate conformation. Unfortunately, these constructs either failed to bind the proteasome or bound to an ordered open conformation (data not shown). We utilized one of these activation loop mutations, E102A, in one of the crystallized complexes, V230Y. This mutation does not have structural consequences but in this case gave higher quality crystals. The chimeric PA26-proteasome complex structures were isomorphous to the published PA26-proteasome structure (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), with one PA26 activator and one half-proteasome in the asymmetric unit, and a complete complex generated by applying two-fold crystallographic symmetry. The three new structures and the parent PA26-proteasome structure are all similar to each other, and in all cases, the proteasome α subunit N-terminal residues adopt the open conformation. The 3 C-terminal residues of the PA26 constructs exhibit well defined electron density, and their main chain binding interactions are closely superimposable in all four of the PA26-proteasome complex structures (Fig. 1C). Protein Data Bank codes associated with each complex are 3JTL (C7PAN), 3JSE (V230F), and 3JRM (V230Y). Our V230Y and C7PAN structures provide a model supporting a critical structural role for the penultimate tyrosine residue of PAN/19S activators. In addition to forming main chain interactions with one of the α subunits that forms the binding pocket, the side chain extends toward Pro-17 of the preceding α subunit to form a hydrogen bond with the Gly-19-O (Fig. 1, D and E). This interaction stabilizes Gly-19, and hence the rest of the Pro-17 reverse turn, in the open conformation. Our previous structural studies have demonstrated that this displacement of the Pro-17 reverse turn triggers gate opening (10Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, simple modeling indicates that the tyrosine side chain would be incompatible with the closed conformation due to steric clash with Gly-19-O (Fig. 1D). Because the displacement of Pro-17/Gly-19 needed to trigger gate opening is modest (∼1.0 Å), it is necessary that the penultimate tyrosine side chain be constrained to its activating conformation and not allowed to relax away from this position. The structures reveal that this is achieved by the tight fit of the tyrosine and the preceding large hydrophobic residue into the binding pocket. As shown in Fig. 1E, the penultimate tyrosine aromatic ring lies against Leu-81 and is sandwiched between the preceding activator residue (Met in V230Y, Leu in C7PAN) and proteasome helix 0 (Fig. 1, H0), where it contacts Ala-30. Moreover, the preceding hydrophobic residue is buttressed by interactions with the hydrophobic Leu-21, Val-24, and Ala-154 proteasome residues. Notably, these proteasome residues are conserved, Leu-81 is known to be important for gate opening by PAN, and activating peptides require a large hydrophobic side chain at the position preceding the penultimate tyrosine (33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although attention has focused on the penultimate tyrosine residue of PAN, it is striking that this residue is not invariant but is highly conserved as tyrosine or phenylalanine in an alignment of 55 closely related archaeal sequences (23 Tyr, 26 Phe, 6 others; data not shown). Because PAN homologs in archaea are thought to function as homomeric assemblies, this suggests that a penultimate phenylalanine might be functionally equivalent to tyrosine. We therefore visualized the conformation and interactions of a penultimate phenylalanine by determining the structure of the V230F-proteasome complex. As shown in Fig. 1, C and F, the phenylalanine adopts the same conformation as observed for the tyrosine and also contacts the Gly-19-O, with the difference being that the interaction is a van der Waals contact rather than a hydrogen bond. Like the tyrosine, the phenylalanine side chain conformation is tightly restrained by interactions with binding pocket residues, and modeling indicates that a penultimate phenylalanine would clash with the closed conformation and thereby promote the open conformation by repositioning Gly-19-O and hence the rest of the Pro-17 turn. We developed a surface plasmon resonance assay to quantify the importance of C-terminal residues for binding the S. cerevisiae proteasome (Fig. 2). Proteasome displaying a protein-A domain at the C terminus of the β4 subunit (35Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) was captured from yeast lysate on an IgG-coated biosensor chip. Binding sensorgrams were recorded under a variety of conditions and found to be consistent and to agree well with a 1:1 interaction model. Data were recorded for binding of PA26, C7PAN, and variants of these constructs with altered penultimate residues. The PA26 heptamer bound with a dissociation constant of 800 ± 2 pm and C7PAN bound with a dissociation constant of 7.78 ± 0.02 pm (Fig. 2, A and B). The penultimate tyrosine plays a dominant role in stabilizing this interaction because the C7PAN Y230A variant displayed a dissociation constant of 59 ± 1 nm (Fig. 2C). Similarly, introduction of the penultimate tyrosine/phenylalanine substitutions into the PA26 context increased binding affinity to 1.056 ± 0.004 and 3.303 ± 0.009 pm, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). Using the well characterized PA26-proteasome complex, we have developed a model system to visualize interactions between C-terminal residues of different proteasome activators and proteasome subunits. Advantages of this approach include the ease of making PA26 constructs and the ability to visualize interactions at atomic resolution by crystallization of complexes with the T. acidophilum proteasome. In principle, other proteasomes could be used in these structural studies, including the S. cerevisiae proteasome, which has been crystallized in complex with PA26 (28Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), although we have not pursued that possibility at this time because the S. cerevisiae complex crystals are highly irreproducible and diffract only to modest resolution. One limitation of our model system is that only the C-terminal residues of the target binding partner can be explored, although this concern is balanced by structural and biochemical data indicating that these residues of PAN/19S are especially important both for binding and for defining the proteasome gate conformation (33Smith D.M.

Our approach allows visualization of interactions corresponding to the binding and gate-opening residues of the ATP-dependent PAN/19S activator. Models of proteasome binding by the ATP-dependent activators PAN/19S have been somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, biochemical (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) data indicate that both PA26 and PAN C termini bind in a similar manner. On the other hand, PA26 induces gate opening using its internal activation loop, which directly repositions the Pro-17 reverse turn (10Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas C-terminal residues of PAN and 19S subunits can activate the proteasome without involvement of an internal loop, and C-terminal PAN peptides are reported to induce gate opening without contacting the Pro-17 reverse turn (34Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). At least some of these findings are resolved by our proteasome complex structure of C7PAN, which shows that the sequence corresponding to the last 7 residues of PAN can bind superimposably with PA26 to place the critical penultimate tyrosine side chain in a position that stabilizes the Pro-17 turn in the open conformation. This reconciles the earlier implications of equivalent binding among activator C termini with the ability of sequences containing a penultimate tyrosine to autonomously induce gate opening. Our structures also explain the importance of the preceding residue, which is favored to be large and hydrophobic (34Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), because this residue and the penultimate tyrosine fit snuggly in a pocket that is lined by conserved hydrophobic residues, thereby restricting the tyrosine side chain to an orientation that repositions Gly-19. Still unresolved is the relevance of proteasome α subunit rocking. On the basis of 6.8 Åresolution electron microscopy reconstructions of peptide complexes (34Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that PAN/19S induce gate opening by causing the α subunits to rotate (twist) by ∼5° about a line that is close to and parallel with the seven-fold axis of symmetry of the proteasome. Motions of this sort are not seen in the proteasome crystal structures, although some of the S. cerevisiae α subunits and to a lesser extent the T. acidophilum α subunits undergo an outward displacement upon gate opening by PA26 that can be approximated as rocking of up to 5° about an axis perpendicular to the seven-fold axis of symmetry of the proteasome (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Regardless of the extent to which twisting of α subunits parallel to the proteasome axis is coupled to gate opening by PAN/19S, we favor the model that direct contacts with the Pro-17 turn induce gate opening by essentially the same mechanism as PA26 (10Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although it has been established that a penultimate tyrosine is important for activation by PAN/19S (33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), it is notable that this position is often substituted by a phenylalanine in PAN homologs from other archaea and is sometimes similarly substituted in ATPase subunits of the eukaryotic 19S activator. Surprisingly, PAN displaying C termini mutated to include a penultimate phenylalanine residue did not stimulate model substrate degradation using the T. acidophilum proteasome (33Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although it seems probable that phenylalanine-containing PAN sequences will be functional against proteasomes whose cognate PAN displays a phenylalanine (24Medalia N. Sharon M. Martinez-Arias R. Mihalache O. Robinson C.V. Medalia O. Zwickl P. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the structure of V230F and found that the penultimate phenylalanine and adjacent C-terminal residues are superimposable with the C7PAN and V230Y structures. Interestingly, like a penultimate tyrosine, the phenylalanine contacts Gly-19-O and hence appears to stabilize the same gate-opening transition of the Pro-17 turn. This substitution of a van der Waals interaction by the phenylalanine for a hydrogen bond by the tyrosine explains how the different side chains might stabilize the same open conformation. All of the structures reported here are complexes of the archaeal T. acidophilum proteasome, which possesses one type of α subunit, is seven-fold symmetric, and displays a disordered, partly closed conformation in the absence of an activator. In contrast, eukaryotic proteasomes possess seven different α subunits and, in the absence of an activator, adopt an ordered closed conformation in which the entrance pore is sealed primarily by N-terminal residues of α2, α3, α4, and, to a lesser extent, α5. This asymmetric closed conformation explains why some of the S. cerevisiae proteasome Pro-17 reverse turns move as much as 3.5 Åupon binding of PA26, whereas others move less than 1.0 Å. Consistent with their roles in closing the gate, the largest Pro-17 displacements are seen for α2, α3, α4, and α5. Notably, the S. cerevisiae proteasome PA26 complex structure displays density for the PA26 C-terminal residues in the α2/α3, α3/α4, α4/α5, α5/α6 pockets, whereas density in the other pockets is poorly defined or absent (the corresponding Pro-17 is from the first named subunit for each pocket) (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This pattern of pocket occupancy parallels the conservation of the critical binding residue Lys-66 (from second subunit of each pocket), which among eukaryotes is invariant in α3, α4, α5, and α6, is conserved as Lys/Arg in α2, and α7, and is never Lys in α1 (31Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that 19S ATPase subunits likely bind to some or all of these pockets occupied by PA26, and the activating displacement of Pro-17 turns will be promoted by interactions of penultimate tyrosine residues that are equivalent to those seen in our T. acidophilum proteasome complex structures. As a complement to the structural studies, we developed a quantitative binding assay that uses affinity immobilized S. cerevisiae proteasome. In principle, this assay could be developed for proteasomes from a range of different species, although we have initially focused on yeast because of the potential for using this assay in future studies to identify and characterize novel or candidate proteasome binding factors. We find that the C-terminal residues of PAN promote binding and that a penultimate tyrosine or phenylalanine makes a positive contribution to binding affinity, at least in the context of an activator that already favors the open conformation. In summary, our structural and binding data support models for proteasome gate opening by 11S and PAN/19S activators that include considerable similarities. In both cases, the activator C-terminal residues are likely to bind through equivalent main chain hydrogen bonds with the activator C-terminal carboxylate forming a salt bridge with Lys-66. The orientation of bound C-terminal residues is constrained by the main chain hydrogen bonding and by packing of the penultimate tyrosine/phenylalanine and the preceding large hydrophobic side chain in a conserved pocket. These interactions dictate that the penultimate tyrosine/phenylalanine side chain contacts Gly-19-O and thereby stabilizes the Pro-17 reverse turn of the proteasome in the open conformation. In the case of PA26 and the other 11S activators, the smaller penultimate residues do not substantially stabilize the open conformation, and the repositioning of Pro-17 is driven by an internal activation loop (10Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, we favor the model in which both classes of activator function by the same mechanism of moving Pro-17 to a position that triggers gate opening (28Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L.

https://openalex.org/W1991486683,"Pneumonia associated with Iegionnaires's disease is initiated in humans after inhalation of contaminated aerosols. In the environment, Legionella pneumophila is thought to survive and multiply as an intracellular parasite within free-living amoeba. In the genome of L. pneumophila Lens, we identified a unique gene, tolC, encoding a protein that is highly homologous to the outer membrane protein TolC of Escherichia coli. Deletion of tolC by allelic exchange in L. pneumophila caused increased sensitivity to various drugs. The complementation of the tolC mutation in trans restored drug resistance, indicating that TolC is involved in multi-drug efflux machinery. In addition, deletion of tolC caused a significant attenuation of virulence towards both amoebae and macrophages. Thus, the TolC protein appears to play a crucial role in virulence which could be mediated by its involvement in efflux pump mechanisms. These findings will be helpful in unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms of L. pneumophila as well as in developing new therapeutic agents affecting the efflux of toxic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2075700543,"Smooth muscle activities are regulated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). Local Ca2+ release from an InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) cluster present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum is termed a Ca2+ puff. Ca2+ released via InsP3R may diffuse to adjacent clusters to trigger further release and generate a cell-wide (global) Ca2+ rise. In smooth muscle, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake maintains global InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release by preventing a negative feedback effect of high [Ca2+] on InsP3R. Mitochondria may regulate InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signals by operating between or within InsP3R clusters. In the former mitochondria could regulate only global Ca2+ signals, whereas in the latter both local and global signals would be affected. Here whether mitochondria maintain InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release by operating within (local) or between (global) InsP3R clusters has been addressed. Ca2+ puffs evoked by localized photolysis of InsP3 in single voltage-clamped colonic smooth muscle cells had amplitudes of 0.5–4.0 F/F0, durations of ∼112 ms at half-maximum amplitude, and were abolished by the InsP3R inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chloropheylhydrazone and complex I inhibitor rotenone each depolarized ΔΨM to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and attenuated Ca2+ puffs by ∼66 or ∼60%, respectively. The mitochondrial uniporter inhibitor, RU360, attenuated Ca2+ puffs by ∼62%. The “fast” Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acted like mitochondria to prolong InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release suggesting that mitochondrial influence is via their Ca2+ uptake facility. These results indicate Ca2+ uptake occurs quickly enough to influence InsP3R communication at the intra-cluster level and that mitochondria regulate both local and global InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signals. Smooth muscle activities are regulated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). Local Ca2+ release from an InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) cluster present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum is termed a Ca2+ puff. Ca2+ released via InsP3R may diffuse to adjacent clusters to trigger further release and generate a cell-wide (global) Ca2+ rise. In smooth muscle, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake maintains global InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release by preventing a negative feedback effect of high [Ca2+] on InsP3R. Mitochondria may regulate InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signals by operating between or within InsP3R clusters. In the former mitochondria could regulate only global Ca2+ signals, whereas in the latter both local and global signals would be affected. Here whether mitochondria maintain InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release by operating within (local) or between (global) InsP3R clusters has been addressed. Ca2+ puffs evoked by localized photolysis of InsP3 in single voltage-clamped colonic smooth muscle cells had amplitudes of 0.5–4.0 F/F0, durations of ∼112 ms at half-maximum amplitude, and were abolished by the InsP3R inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chloropheylhydrazone and complex I inhibitor rotenone each depolarized ΔΨM to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and attenuated Ca2+ puffs by ∼66 or ∼60%, respectively. The mitochondrial uniporter inhibitor, RU360, attenuated Ca2+ puffs by ∼62%. The “fast” Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acted like mitochondria to prolong InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release suggesting that mitochondrial influence is via their Ca2+ uptake facility. These results indicate Ca2+ uptake occurs quickly enough to influence InsP3R communication at the intra-cluster level and that mitochondria regulate both local and global InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signals."
https://openalex.org/W2057604685,"Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) can differentiate into cells derived from all three germ layers and extraembryonic tissues. While transcription factors such as, Oct4 and Nanog are well known for their requirements for undifferentiated ES cell growth, mechanisms of epigenetic repression of germ layer specific differentiation in ES cells are not well understood. Here, we investigate functions of Mbd3, a component of nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex (NuRD/Mi-2) in mouse ES cells. We find that compared to wild type ES cells, Mbd3 knockdown cells show elevated RNA expression of trophectoderm markers, including Cdx2, Eomesodermin, and Hand1. In parallel, these cells show an increased acetylation level of histone 3 in promoters of the respective genes, suggesting Mbd3 plays a role in repression of these genes in undifferentiated ES cells. However, these changes are not sufficient for definitive differentiation to trophectoderm (TE) in chimeric embryos. When further cultured in ES medium without LIF or in trophoblast stem (TS) cell medium, Mbd3 knockdown cells differentiate into TE cells, which express Cdx2 and, at later stages, trophoblast lineage specific marker Cadherin 3. These results suggest that Mbd3 helps restrict ES cells from differentiating towards the trophectoderm lineage and is an important epigenetic player in maintaining full pluripotency of mouse ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015690768,"The HAP2/GCS1 gene first appeared in the common ancestor of plants, animals, and protists, and is required in the male gamete for fusion to the female gamete in the unicellular organisms Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium. We have identified a HAP2/GCS1 gene in the genome sequence of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. This finding provides a continuous evolutionary history of HAP2/GCS1 from unicellular organisms into the metazoan lineage. Divergent versions of the HAP2/GCS1 gene are also present in the genomes of some but not all arthropods. By examining the expression of the HAP2/GCS1 gene in the cnidarian Hydra, we have found the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that HAP2/GCS1 was used for male gamete fusion in the ancestor of extant metazoans and that it retains that function in modern cnidarians."
https://openalex.org/W2019296594,"Background Psychosocial stress is becoming a major contributor to increased mental ill-health and sick leave in many countries. Valid markers of chronic stress would be valuable for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. A recent study suggested monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as markers of chronic stress. We aimed to confirm these potential biomarkers of prolonged psychosocial stress in female patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Circulating levels of MCP-1, EGF and VEGF, along with several other cytokines, were measured in plasma from 42 female patients suffering from exhaustion due to prolonged psychosocial stress and 42 control subjects, using a protein biochip immunoassay. There were no significant differences between patients and controls in any of the cytokines or growth factors analyzed. Furthermore, when using a different protein bioassay and reanalyzing MCP-1 and VEGF in the same samples, markedly different levels were obtained. To further explore if inflammation is present in patients with exhaustion, the classical inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in another group of patients (n = 89) and controls (n = 88) showing a small but significant increase of CRP levels in the patients. Conclusions/Significance MCP-1, EGF and VEGF may not be suitable markers of prolonged psychosocial stress as previously suggested. Furthermore, significant differences were obtained when using two different protein assays measuring the same samples, indicating that comparing studies where different analytic techniques have been used might be difficult. Increased levels of CRP indicate that low-grade inflammation might be present in patients with exhaustion due to prolonged stress exposure but this inflammation does not seem to be reflected by increase in circulating MCP-1 or other cytokines measured."
https://openalex.org/W2140883829,"The molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is complex and not fully understood. We have recently found that the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl in the RCC tumors independently correlates with survival of the patients.Here, we have investigated the role of Axl and its ligand Gas6, the vitamin-K dependent protein product of the growth arrest-specific gene 6, in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) derived cells. The Axl protein was highly expressed in ccRCC cells deficient in functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, a tumor suppressor gene often inactivated in ccRCC. VHL reconstituted cells expressed decreased levels of Axl protein, but not Axl mRNA, suggesting VHL to regulate Axl expression. Gas6-mediated activation of Axl in ccRCC cells resulted in Axl phosphorylation, receptor down-regulation, decreased cell-viability and migratory capacity. No effects of the Gas6/Axl system could be detected on invasion. Moreover, in ccRCC tumor tissues, Axl was phosphorylated and Gas6 gamma-carboxylated, suggesting these molecules to be active in vivo.These results provide novel information regarding the complex function of the Gas6/Axl system in ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W1965148779,"The development of fetal brain is influenced by nutrients such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) and choline. Phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine enriched in DHA and many humans have functional genetic polymorphisms in the PEMT gene. Previously, it was reported that Pemt−/− mice have altered hippocampal development. The present study explores whether abnormal phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis causes altered incorporation of DHA into membranes, thereby influencing brain development, and determines whether supplemental dietary DHA can reverse some of these changes. Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and Pemt−/− mice were fed a control diet, or a diet supplemented with 3 g/kg of DHA, from gestational day 11 to 17. Brains from embryonic day 17 fetuses derived from Pemt−/− dams fed the control diet had 25–50% less phospholipid-DHA as compared with WT (p < 0.05). Also, they had 60% more neural progenitor cell proliferation (p < 0.05), 60% more neuronal apoptosis (p < 0.01), and 30% less calretinin expression (p < 0.05; a marker of neuronal differentiation) in the hippocampus compared with WT. The DHA-supplemented diet increased fetal brain Pemt−/− phospholipid-DHA to WT levels, and abrogated the neural progenitor cell proliferation and apoptosis differences. Although this diet did not change proliferation in the WT group, it halved the rate of apoptosis (p < 0.05). In both genotypes, the DHA-supplemented diet increased calretinin expression 2-fold (p < 0.05).

DHA is an omega-3 (22:6(n-3)) polyunsaturated fatty acid that accumulates in the fetal brain in a manner that is dependent on maternal dietary DHA levels (4Bazan N.G. Scott B.L. Upsala J. Med. Sci. Suppl. 1990; 48: 97-107PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cherian G. Sim J. Poult. Sci. 1992; 71: 1658-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Green P. Yavin E.

It is typically found enriched in the aminophospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), of neural membranes (8Kim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18661-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because of its effects on brain and retina development and function, DHA is also included in many infant formulas and in diets of pregnant women (2Innis S.M. J. Nutr. 2007; 137: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The effects of DHA may be related to changes in formation of membrane phospholipid species containing this fatty acid (2Innis S.M. J.

Choline is included in infant formulas and in the maternal diet because, during a critical span of time during fetal brain development, choline availability influences neural progenitor cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (9Albright C.D.

Nutr. 2003; 133: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In humans, low choline intake during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects in the fetus (12Shaw G.M. Carmichael S.L. Yang W. Selvin S. Schaffer D.M. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2004; 160: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Shaw G.M. Carmichael S.L. Laurent C. Rasmussen S.A. Epidemiology. 2006; 17: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the effects of this nutrient on brain development are mediated by changes in gene methylation (14Niculescu M.D. Craciunescu C.N. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 134: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Niculescu M.D. Craciunescu C.N. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, there is a metabolic pathway that links choline with DHA, and there could be a common mechanism for the effects of these two nutrients on brain development. DHA metabolism and choline metabolism are linked by the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT), which catalyzes de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) by methylation of PtdEtn (16Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This enzyme prefers species of PtdEtn that contain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA (17DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), thereby forming DHA-enriched species of PtdCho in membranes. Available PtdCho and PtdEtn are used to form phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) by serine base exchange enzymes (18Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1377-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because PtdCho is almost exclusively found in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane and PtdEtn and PtdSer are only found in the inner leaflet, any change in the activity of PEMT can modify not only PtdCho-DHA and PtdEtn-DHA concentrations, but may also lead to an imbalance in DHA distribution in the leaflets of the membrane. In fact, PtdCho-DHA concentrations in liver cell membranes and plasma were diminished in Pemt−/− mice compared with wild type (19Watkins S.M. Zhu X. Zeisel S.H. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There is increased neurogenesis and decreased GABAergic neuron differentiation in the fetal hippocampus of the Pemt−/− mouse compared with wild type (20Zhu X. Mar M.H. Song J. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 149: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because PEMT activity is a major user of S-adenosylmethionine (21Stead L.M. Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Vance D.E. Jacobs R.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and because there was increased S-adenosylmethionine concentration as well as increased DNA and histone methylation in the hippocampus of Pemt−/− fetuses, it was suggested that the effects of deleting Pemt on fetal brain development were mediated by changes in gene methylation (20Zhu X. Mar M.H. Song J. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 149: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Zhu X. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 134: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although this remains a likely mechanism mediating many of the observed changes, we now consider whether changes in DHA concentrations and/or DHA distribution in membrane leaflets might also mediate or enhance the observed effects of deleting Pemt. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of DHA to Pemt−/− dams would restore normal PtdCho-DHA concentrations in cell membranes, and that this would reverse at least some of the abnormal cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation observed in the knock-out fetal mouse hippocampus. C57BL/6 wild type mice, in-house bred from timed pregnant C57BL/6 wild type mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and in-house bred Pemt−/− mice (fully backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice by the MAX/BAX method at Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA)) were used, and all experiments were performed in duplicate to generate fetal brain data from 5 to 10 dams per group, using 1–4 fetuses per dam. Knock-out mice were mated with knock-out mice, wild type mice with wild type. The day after mating was considered gestational (embryonic) day zero (E0). Mice were maintained in a temperature controlled room at 24 °C and exposed to a 12-h light and dark cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Tail clippings of young post-weaned mice were collected under sterile conditions. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified. For the Pemt WT, 250 ng of DNA was added to a mixture (20 μl total volume) containing 1 μm primers (forward, GAGCGCAATGGTACTCACCACATTCC and reverse, GATCTTGTCTTCAGAGCCACAG; Operon Biotechnologies, Huntsville, AL) and 10 μl of Takara enzyme SYBR mixture (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). For the Pemt Neo, forward (CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC) and reverse primers (AGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC; Operon Biotechnologies) were used. Successful amplification was carried out on an Ep Realplex 1.5 Thermalcycler (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). The following conditions were used for Pemt WT: 95 °C for 2 min; 37 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 61 °C for 15 s, and 70 °C for 20 s) annealing, followed by 95 °C for a 15-s final extension and melting curve. For the Pemt Neo, conditions for “touchdown PCR” included enzyme activation at 94 °C for 2 min, 12 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s melting, 64 °C for 30 s (repeated decrease in temperatures by 0.5 °C/cycle) annealing, 72 °C for 35 s extension followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 35 s final extension, and melting curve. DNA contamination, if any, was identified by comparing the reverse transcription-PCR results to a standard curve. Mice were maintained on an ad libitum AIN-76A pelleted diet containing standard choline chloride (1.1 g/kg) and 50 g/kg of corn oil (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) and on ad libitum water until they were on the experimental diets. At the end of day 11 of gestation, pregnant mice were randomly assigned to one of two feeding groups: control or DHA supplemented. From day 11 of gestation until the end point on gestational day 17, pregnant mice in the control group continued on the standard AIN-76A pelleted diet, whereas mice on the DHA-supplemented diet were fed a modified AIN-76A pelleted diet containing the 1.1 g/kg of choline chloride, 47 g/kg of corn oil, and 3 g/kg of DHA (DHA was obtained as an ethyl ester from Nu-Check Prep (Elysian, MN) and given to Dyets for the preparation of the diet). Corn oil contains about 10% palmitate (16:0), 3% stearate (18:0), 30% oleate (18:1), 56% linoleate (18:2), 1% α-linolenate (18:3), and no DHA (23Baur Jr., F.J. Brown J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945; 67: 1899-1900Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antioxidant content was equalized in all diets. The diets were kept refrigerated and replaced in the cages each day to minimize oxidation. On gestational day 17, the pregnant dams were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine (200 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight; Henry Schein, Melville, NY). The uterine horns were exposed by a midline abdominal incision to collect the fetuses, which were kept in culture dishes containing 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on a heating pad at 37 °C to maintain body temperature. The fetuses were removed individually from the uterine sacs, decapitated, and in an alternating manner, brains and whole skulls were collected. Fetal brains for biochemical determinations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. Fetal brains were collected for immunohistochemical determinations using the modified technique of Park et al.(24Park J.J. Baum M.J. Paredes R.G. Tobet S.A. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Skulls were opened and immersed in fixation buffer containing 4% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. On the subsequent day, fetal brains were removed from the skull, post-fixed with perfusion fixative, rinsed in PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were processed overnight in an automated processor (model ASP300S, Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) and embedded in paraffin wax. Embedded fetal brains were processed for serial 5-μm coronal sections using a microtome (model RM2155 version 1.0, Leica Microsystems) and serially collected on superfrost glass slides. The fetal brains were appropriately oriented during paraffin embedding to get coronal sections of the hippocampus. Because there is a posterior to anterior gradient of neurogenesis in fetal mouse hippocampus (25Miyama S. Takahashi T. Nowakowski R.S. Caviness Jr., V.S. Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the fetal brain serial sections were reviewed and selected before immunohistochemical staining to ensure that they included anatomically equivalent areas of the hippocampus as defined by a standard atlas of the developing brain (26Jacobowitz D. Abbott L. Chemoarchitectonic Atlas of the Developing Mouse Brain. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). Phospholipid-DHA concentrations in fetal brain were determined by capillary gas chromatography. Lipids were extracted (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42361) Google Scholar) and the phospholipids separated by thin layer chromatography (CHCl3, 2-propanol, triethylamine, MeOH, 0.25% KCl (w/v), H2O, 30:25:18:9:3:3, v/v) (28Chen C.T. Ma D.W. Kim J.H. Mount H.T. Bazinet R.P. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 147-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The bands that co-eluted with authentic PtdCho, PtdEtn, PtdSer, and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) standards were collected, saponified, and the fatty acids trans-methylated by a sequential 1-ml addition of 4.25% NaOH in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) and 1 n HCl in saline (29Tacconi M. Wurtman R.J. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The resulting methyl esters were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, re-suspended in 50 μl of undecane, and separated on a capillary column (coated with 70% cyanopropyl polysilphenylene-siloxane; 10 m × 0.1 mm inner diameter, BPX70 0.2 μm; SGE, Austin, TX), using a split injection system (Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatograph, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), with helium as the carrier gas. The injector temperature was 240 °C, and detector 280 °C. The four phospholipids with heptadecanoic acid (C17:0, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were added to the samples as internal standards to correct for recovery. Individual fatty acids were identified by comparing their retention times with authentic standards (NuChek Prep). Data were analyzed using ChemStation Firmware A.01.09 (Agilent). Consecutive coronal fetal brain sections, 5 μm thick, selected from the middle to posterior regions of the fetal hippocampus from at least one fetus per dam, and at least five dams from each genotype and dietary treatment group, were used for immunohistochemical analyses of neural progenitor cell proliferation, calretinin expression, and neural cell apoptosis. Wrinkles on fetal brain paraffin sections were flattened by incubating the slides horizontally at 55–60 °C in an Isotemp oven for 10 min. Fetal brain sections that were damaged during sectioning or immunohistochemistry processing were excluded from the study. Coronal sections were probed for phosphorylated histone H3 (phosphohistone H3), a specific marker for mitosis (11Craciunescu C.N. Albright C.D. Mar M.H. Song J. Zeisel S.H. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Slides were deparaffinized in fresh xylene three times for 20 min each, washed three times for 5 min each in absolute ethanol, then rehydrated gradually in 95% ethanol for 5 min, 70% ethanol with 0.25% ammonium hydroxide for 1 h, and 50% ethanol for 15 min. This was followed by three washes, each for 5 min, in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) (Sigma). Antigen retrieval was carried out for 20 min in 20 μg/ml of proteinase K (Sigma), followed by 40 min in 10 mg/ml of sodium borohydrate (Sigma), both steps at room temperature. A heat-induced antigen unmasking was done by incubating the slides in citric buffer, pH 6.0, at >90 °C in a microwave oven for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature and washing three times with PBST, nonspecific sites were blocked overnight with 10% nonimmune goat serum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in PBST. Brain sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in blocking buffer (1:1000 dilution). Negative control sections were treated with non-immune goat serum instead of the primary antibody. Phosphohistone H3 expressing cells were detected using a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) at 1:1000 dilution after 2 h at room temperature. Nuclear DNA was counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were mounted using 80% Tris-buffered glycerol, pH 7.0, and covered by a number 1 thickness coverglass. Images were acquired using a Microphot FXA Microscope (Nikon Instrument Group, Garden City, NY), which was equipped with a QImaging Micropublisher CCD camera for digital image acquisition by epifluorescence on an Apple IMAC computer. Different laser wavelengths were used for DAPI (359 nm), and for Cy3 (550 nm excitation and 570 nm emission). The total number of phosphorylated histone H3 positive cells were counted in two periventricular regions: adjoining the developing hippocampus and adjoining the developing cortex, beginning at the junction of the hippocampus and choroid plexus (hippocampal wedge). Cells were counted at a final magnification of ×100 in six to eight hippocampal hemispheres from three to four consecutive serial sections for each of the above mentioned regions, and the average number of proliferating neural progenitor cells per region in each fetus was calculated. Ventricular zone lengths were measured in calibrated images at the same magnification (×40) and resolution. Coronal sections were probed for the expression of calretinin, a vitamin D-dependent protein involved in calcium signaling, and which is expressed by a subclass of GABAergic neurons when they differentiate (10Albright C.D. Siwek D.F. Craciunescu C.N. Mar M.H. Kowall N.W. Williams C.L. Zeisel S.H. Nutr. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, subjected to antigen retrieval, and blocked as stated above. Brain sections were then incubated in rabbit anti-calretinin antibody (Chemicon) at a 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Sites of calretinin immunoreactivity were detected using a goat anti-rabbit Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon) in a 1:250 dilution in PBST, prepared fresh and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were counterstained and mounted as stated above. As an internal control, we monitored the calretinin immunoreactivity of the dorsal hypothalamic nucleus, a region of developing mouse brain that contains neurons expressing high levels of calretinin. Quantitative image analysis in the primordial dentate gyrus of the fetal hippocampus, specifically the putative outer marginal zone of the granular cell layer, using ×100 magnification, was performed on a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an integrating camera connected to a computer utilizing a Scion CG7 image capture card for digital image capture of standard and epifluorescence images, as described earlier (20Zhu X. Mar M.H. Song J. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 149: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The laser wavelength at 359 nm was used for DAPI, and 492 nm excitation and 510 nm emission used for Cy2. The images were then analyzed using the Scion Image software program (Scion Corporation, Fredrick, MD), converting the pictures taken from the microscope to gray scale images, and then inverting them to obtain mean optical density, background, and the area of the selected region of interest. These measurements were used to calculate integrated optical density (IOD = (mean optical density − background) × area) for six to eight hemispheres from three to four serial sections, and an averaged value reported for calretinin expressed in the primordial dentate gyrus of each hippocampus hemisphere. Activated cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were used to detect apoptotic cells in paraffin-embedded fetal hippocampal coronal sections. After deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval of fetal brain sections (as described for phosphohistone H3 and calretinin above), cleaved activated caspase-3 immunofluorescence labeling was assessed after overnight incubation with a primary rabbit monoclonal antibody to cleaved (activated) caspase-3 (Asp-175; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sections were incubated with goat Cy3-anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 2 h at room temperature followed by counterstaining with 0.1 μg/ml of DAPI (Sigma) for 20 m. The activated caspase-3 positive cells in the fetal hippocampus were identified based on the presence of red fluorescent staining and scored using ×10 or 20 magnification with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Two laser wavelengths were used (359 nm for DAPI, 550 nm excitation and 570 nm emission for Cy3). For the TUNEL-based assay, labeling was assessed according to the manufacturer's protocol (ApopTag® Plus Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit S7111; Chemicon). Two laser wavelengths were used (359 nm for DAPI, 490 nm excitation and 520 nm emission for FITC). The number of apoptotic cells per hippocampus was counted in 4–8 brain hemispheres from 2 to 4 consecutive serial sections and averaged to obtain a mean single hemilateral value/hippocampal section/fetus. We used a two-way analysis of variance with and without interaction, followed by a pairwise comparison of the diets separately for each genotype. Statistical differences were determined using JMP software (V2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Changes in brain phospholipids were examined in two ways, as changes in the distribution of fatty acid species present in individual phospholipids, and as changes in the concentrations of phospholipids. We observed significant differences in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in fetal brain from the Pemt−/− mice compared with the WT mice (Table 1). Pemt−/− mice had lower proportional fractions of DHA in all four phospholipids measured in fetal brain than did WT mice on the control diet (p < 0.05; Tables 1 and supplemental S1, S3, S5, and S7). Maternal supplementation with DHA during E11–E17 increased the proportional fraction of PtdCho-DHA and PtdIns-DHA in the fetal brains of the WT mice by ∼150% (p < 0.001; Table 1), and increased the proportional fraction of PtdEtn-DHA and PtdSer-DHA in fetal brains by ∼10%. DHA supplementation of the Pemt−/− dams increased the proportional fraction of DHA in several membrane phospholipids in the fetal brain (PtdSer-DHA to 135% of the fraction present in control diet; PtdEtn-DHA to 158%; PtdCho-DHA to 192%; and PtdIns-DHA to 220%; all values p < 0.01 different from those on control diet Table 1) so that these fractions were similar to, or higher than, those measured in WT on the control diet. In addition, the fatty acid species docosapentaenoic acid (22:5) was detected in PtdEtn and PtdSer fractions of the Pemt−/− but not in WT fetal brains (Table 1). Brain PtdEtn-18:1 was higher in the fetuses from the Pemt−/− mice on the control diet compared with WT (p < 0.01; Table 1), but returned to WT levels with DHA supplementation. In PtdEtn, PtdSer, and PtdIns of fetal brains, the arachidonic acid (20:4) species was higher in Pemt−/− compared with WT on the control diet (p < 0.01; Table 1), but maternal DHA supplementation decreased the proportional amount in Pemt−/− fetal brains (p < 0.05).TABLE 1Proportion of fatty acid species present in phospholipids of fetal mouse brainAIN-76A dietDHA dietPemt+/+Pemt−/−Pemt+/+Pemt−/−g/100 g total fatty acidsPtdCho 18:120.6 ± 1.019.5 ± 1.020.7 ± 0.820.5 ± 0.7 18:20.6 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.1aDifferent from WT on the AIN diet, p < 0.05.0.4 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1bDifferent from Pemt−/− on AIN diet, p < 0.05. 20:45.9 ± 0.46.7 ± 0.56.0 ± 0.25.8 ± 0.5 22:62.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.4.0 ± 0.2cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.2.5 ± 0.2PtdEtn 18:19.4 ± 0.111.1 ± 0.6dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.9.2 ± 0.19.4 ± 0.4 18:2NDeND, none detected.0.4 ± 0.2ND0.2 ± 0.1 20:419.7 ± 0.1dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.25.4 ± 0.8cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.17.6 ± 0.1dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.21.8 ± 0.3dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05. 22:5ND0.6 ± 0.1ND0.6 ± 0.1 22:626.1 ± 0.515.7 ± 0.9cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.28.9 ± 0.3dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.24.9 ± 0.5PtdSer 18:16.7 ± 0.29.0 ± 1.0aDifferent from WT on the AIN diet, p < 0.05.7.0 ± 0.17.9 ± 0.6 20:47.4 ± 0.310.6 ± 0.5cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.6.0 ± 0.1dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.8.2 ± 0.3 22:5ND0.2 ± 0.1ND0.4 ± 0.1 22:631.3 ± 0.223.1 ± 1.2cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.35.4 ± 0.2dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.31.3 ± 1.0PtdIns 18:16.1 ± 0.45.3 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.6 20:439.8 ± 0.843.7 ± 0.7cDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.01.38.2 ± 0.336.2 ± 0.8 22:67.0 ± 0.3dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.5.3 ± 0.3dDifferent from all other groups, p < 0.05.10.6 ± 0.511.7 ± 0.3a Different from WT on the AIN diet, p < 0.05.b Different from Pemt−/− on AIN diet, p < 0.05.c Different from all other groups, p < 0.01.d Different from all other groups, p < 0.05.e ND, none detected.

https://openalex.org/W2093616544,"For 10 years, research has focused on signaling pathways controlling translation to explain neuronal death in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Previous studies demonstrated in different cellular and animal models and AD patients that translation is down-regulated by the activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). Among downstream factors of PKR, the Fas-associated protein with a death domain (FADD) and subsequent activated caspase-8 are responsible for PKR-induced apoptosis in recombinant virus-infected cells. However, no studies have reported the role of PKR in death receptor signaling in AD. The aim of this project is to determine physical and functional interactions of PKR with FADD in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) neurotoxicity and in APP(SL)PS1 KI transgenic mice. In SH-SY5Y cells, results showed that Abeta42 induced a large increase in phosphorylated PKR and FADD levels and a physical interaction between PKR and FADD in the nucleus, also observed in the cortex of APP(SL)PS1 KI mice. However, PKR gene silencing or treatment with a specific PKR inhibitor significantly prevented the increase in pT(451)-PKR and pS(194)-FADD levels in SH-SY5Y nuclei and completely inhibited activities of caspase-3 and -8. The contribution of PKR in neurodegeneration through the death receptor signaling pathway may support the development of therapeutics targeting PKR to limit neuronal death in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2018650598,"In animals, visual pigments are essential for photoreceptor function and survival. These G-protein-coupled receptors consist of a protein moiety (opsin) and a covalently bound 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore. The chromophore is derived from dietary carotenoids by oxidative cleavage and trans-to-cis isomerization of double bonds. In vertebrates, the necessary chemical transformations are catalyzed by two distinct but structurally related enzymes, the carotenoid oxygenase β-carotenoid-15,15′-monooxygenase and the retinoid isomerase RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa). Recently, we provided biochemical evidence that these reactions in insects are catalyzed by a single enzyme family member named NinaB. Here we show that in the fly pathway, carotenoids are mandatory precursors of the chromophore. After chromophore formation, the retinoid-binding protein Pinta acts downstream of NinaB and is required to supply photoreceptors with chromophore. Like ninaE encoding the opsin, ninaB expression is eye-dependent and is activated as a downstream target of the eyeless/pax6 and sine oculis master control genes for eye development. The requirement for coordinated synthesis of chromophore and opsin is evidenced by analysis of ninaE mutants. Retinal degeneration in opsin-deficient photoreceptors is caused by the chromophore and can be prevented by restricting its supply as seen in an opsin and chromophore-deficient double mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2019568194,"Infection with Aspergillus terreus is more likely to result in invasive, disseminated disease when compared to other Aspergillus species; importantly this species appears to be less susceptible to the antifungal drug amphotericin B. Unique to this species is the ability to produce specialized structures denoted as accessory conidia (AC) directly on hyphae both in vitro and in vivo. With the hypothesis that production of AC by A. terreus may enhance virulence of this organism, we analyzed the phenotype, structure and metabolic potential of these conidia. Comparison of A. terreus phialidic conidia (conidia that arise from conidiophores, PC) and AC architecture by electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the two conidial forms; AC have a smoother, thicker outer cell surface with no apparent pigment-like layer. Further, AC germinated rapidly, had enhanced adherence to microspheres, and were metabolically more active compared to PC. Additionally, AC contained less cell membrane ergosterol, which correlated with decreased susceptibility to AMB as determined using a flow cytometry based analysis. Furthermore, AC exhibited surface patches of β1-3 glucan, suggestive of attachment scarring. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest a possible role for AC in A. terreus pathogenesis."

Despite the fundamentally different origins, both diseases share common clinical symptoms in the connective tissue such as long bone overgrowth, scoliosis, and ectopia lentis, whereas they differ in others. Fibrillin-1 contains ∼13% cysteine residues and can be modified by homocysteine. We report here that homocysteinylation affects functional properties of fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin. We used recombinant fragments spanning the entire fibrillin-1 molecule to demonstrate that homocysteinylation, but not cysteinylation leads to abnormal self-interaction, which was attributed to a reduced amount of multimerization of the fibrillin-1 C terminus. The deposition of the fibrillin-1 network by human dermal fibroblasts was greatly reduced by homocysteine, but not by cysteine. Furthermore, homocysteinylation, but not cysteinylation of elastin-like polypeptides resulted in modified coacervation properties.

https://openalex.org/W2064362435,"The peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor PPARγ plays an essential role in vascular biology, modulating macrophage function and atherosclerosis progression. Recently, we have described the beneficial effect of combined activation of the ghrelin/GHS-R1a receptor and the scavenger receptor CD36 to induce macrophage cholesterol release through transcriptional activation of PPARγ. Although the interplay between CD36 and PPARγ in atherogenesis is well recognized, the contribution of the ghrelin receptor to regulate PPARγ remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ghrelin triggers PPARγ activation through a concerted signaling cascade involving Erk1/2 and Akt kinases, resulting in enhanced expression of downstream effectors LXRα and ABC sterol transporters in human macrophages. These effects were associated with enhanced PPARγ phosphorylation independently of the inhibitory conserved serine-84. Src tyrosine kinase Fyn was identified as being recruited to GHS-R1a in response to ghrelin, but failure of activated Fyn to enhance PPARγ Ser-84 specific phosphorylation relied on the concomitant recruitment of docking protein Dok-1, which prevented optimal activation of the Erk1/2 pathway. Also, substitution of Ser-84 preserved the ghrelin-induced PPARγ activity and responsiveness to Src inhibition, supporting a mechanism independent of Ser-84 in PPARγ response to ghrelin. Consistent with this, we found that ghrelin promoted the PI3-K/Akt pathway in a Gαq-dependent manner, resulting in Akt recruitment to PPARγ, enhanced PPARγ phosphorylation and activation independently of Ser-84, and increased expression of LXRα and ABCA1/G1. Collectively, these results illustrate a complex interplay involving Fyn/Dok-1/Erk and Gαq/PI3-K/Akt pathways to transduce in a concerted manner responsiveness of PPARγ to ghrelin in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2013598942,"Background While intracellular buffers are widely used to study calcium signaling, no such tool exists for the other major second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP). Methods/Principal Findings Here we describe a genetically encoded buffer for cAMP based on the high-affinity cAMP-binding carboxy-terminus of the regulatory subunit RIβ of protein kinase A (PKA). Addition of targeting sequences permitted localization of this fragment to the extra-nuclear compartment, while tagging with mCherry allowed quantification of its expression at the single cell level. This construct (named “cAMP sponge”) was shown to selectively bind cAMP in vitro. Its expression significantly suppressed agonist-induced cAMP signals and the downstream activation of PKA within the cytosol as measured by FRET-based sensors in single living cells. Point mutations in the cAMP-binding domains of the construct rendered the chimera unable to bind cAMP in vitro or in situ. Cyclic AMP sponge was fruitfully applied to examine feedback regulation of gap junction-mediated transfer of cAMP in epithelial cell couplets. Conclusions This newest member of the cAMP toolbox has the potential to reveal unique biological functions of cAMP, including insight into the functional significance of compartmentalized signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W2005554112,"Background The development of collections of quantitatively characterized standard biological parts should facilitate the engineering of increasingly complex and novel biological systems. The existing enzymatic and fluorescent reporters that are used to characterize biological part functions exhibit strengths and limitations. Combining both enzymatic and fluorescence activities within a single reporter protein would provide a useful tool for biological part characterization. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe the construction and quantitative characterization of Gemini, a fusion between the β-galactosidase (β-gal) α-fragment and the N-terminus of full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP). We show that Gemini exhibits functional β-gal activity, which we assay with plates and fluorometry, and functional GFP activity, which we assay with fluorometry and microscopy. We show that the protein fusion increases the sensitivity of β-gal activity and decreases the sensitivity of GFP. Conclusions/Significance Gemini is therefore a bifunctional reporter with a wider dynamic range than the β-gal α-fragment or GFP alone. Gemini enables the characterization of gene expression, screening assays via enzymatic activity, and quantitative single-cell microscopy or FACS via fluorescence activity. The analytical flexibility afforded by Gemini will likely increase the efficiency of research, particularly for screening and characterization of libraries of standard biological parts."
https://openalex.org/W1973554620,"The Src family kinases possess two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation that are critical to the regulation of kinase activity. Autophosphorylation on an activation loop tyrosine residue (Tyr 416 in commonly used chicken c-Src numbering) increases catalytic activity, while phosphorylation of a C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr 527 in c-Src) inhibits activity. The latter modification is achieved by the tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase), but the complete inactivation of the Src family kinases also requires the dephosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine. The SH3 domain of Csk recruits the tyrosine phosphatase PEP, allowing for the coordinated inhibition of Src family kinase activity. We have discovered that Csk forms homodimers through interactions mediated by the SH3 domain in a manner that buries the recognition surface for SH3 ligands. The formation of this dimer would therefore block the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases and may have important implications for the regulation of Src kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2099624967,"The mammalian epidermis is a continually renewing structure that provides the interface between the organism and an innately hostile environment. The keratinocyte is its principal cell. Keratinocyte proteins form a physical epithelial barrier, protect against microbial damage, and prepare immune responses to danger. Epithelial immunity is disordered in many common diseases and disordered epithelial differentiation underlies many cancers. In order to identify the genes that mediate epithelial development we used a tissue model of the skin derived from primary human keratinocytes. We measured global gene expression in triplicate at five times over the ten days that the keratinocytes took to fully differentiate. We identified 1282 gene transcripts that significantly changed during differentiation (false discovery rate <0.01%). We robustly grouped these transcripts by K-means clustering into modules with distinct temporal expression patterns, shared regulatory motifs, and biological functions. We found a striking cluster of late expressed genes that form the structural and innate immune defences of the epithelial barrier. Gene Ontology analyses showed that undifferentiated keratinocytes were characterised by genes for motility and the adaptive immune response. We systematically identified calcium-binding genes, which may operate with the epidermal calcium gradient to control keratinocyte division during skin repair. The results provide multiple novel insights into keratinocyte biology, in particular providing a comprehensive list of known and previously unrecognised major components of the epidermal barrier. The findings provide a reference for subsequent understanding of how the barrier functions in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2029273384,"Fragile X Syndrome is caused by the silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene (FMR1). Regulating dosage of FMR1 levels is critical for proper development and function of the nervous system and germ line, but the pathways responsible for maintaining normal expression levels are less clearly defined. Loss of Drosophila Fragile X protein (dFMR1) causes several behavioral and developmental defects in the fly, many of which are analogous to those seen in Fragile X patients. Over-expression of dFMR1 also causes specific neuronal and behavioral abnormalities. We have found that Argonaute2 (Ago2), the core component of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway, regulates dfmr1 expression. Previously, the relationship between dFMR1 and Ago2 was defined by their physical interaction and co-regulation of downstream targets. We have found that Ago2 and dFMR1 are also connected through a regulatory relationship. Ago2 mediated repression of dFMR1 prevents axon growth and branching defects of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Consequently, the neurogenesis defects in larvae mutant for both dfmr1 and Ago2 mirror those in dfmr1 null mutants. The Ago2 null phenotype at the NMJ is rescued in animals carrying an Ago2 genomic rescue construct. However, animals carrying a mutant Ago2 allele that produces Ago2 with significantly reduced endoribonuclease catalytic activity are normal with respect to the NMJ phenotypes examined. dFMR1 regulation by Ago2 is also observed in the germ line causing a multiple oocyte in a single egg chamber mutant phenotype. We have identified Ago2 as a regulator of dfmr1 expression and have clarified an important developmental role for Ago2 in the nervous system and germ line that requires dfmr1 function."

The trypanosome flagellum contains a para-crystalline extra-axonemal structure termed the paraflagellar rod (PFR) with around forty identified components. We have used a Gateway cloning approach coupled with yeast two-hybrid, RNAi and 2D DiGE to define a protein-protein interaction network taking place in this structure. We define two clusters of interactions; the first being characterised by two proteins with a shared domain which is not sufficient for maintaining the interaction. The other cohort is populated by eight proteins, a number of which possess a PFR domain and sub-populations of this network exhibit dependency relationships. Finally, we provide clues as to the structural organisation of the PFR at the molecular level. This multi-strand approach shows that protein interactome data can be generated for insoluble protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2015184095,"By stimulating collagen synthesis and myofibroblasts differentiation, transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β) plays a pivotal role in tissue repair and fibrosis. The early growth response-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor mediates profibrotic TGF-β responses, and its expression is elevated in biopsies from patients with scleroderma. NGF1-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2) is a conserved transcriptional cofactor that directly binds to Egr-1 and positively or negatively modulates Egr-1 target gene transcription. Despite the recognized importance of Nab2 in governing the intensity of Egr-1-dependent responses, the regulation and function of Nab2 in the context of fibrotic TGF-β signaling is unknown. Here we show that TGF-β caused a time-dependent stimulation of Nab2 protein and mRNA in normal fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of Nab2 in these cells blocked Egr-1-dependent transcriptional responses, and abrogated TGF-β-induced stimulation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblasts differentiation. These inhibitory effects of Nab2 involved recruitment of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex to the COL1A2 promoter and were accompanied by reduced histone H4 acetylation. Mice with targeted deletion of Nab2 displayed increased collagen accumulation in the dermis, and genetic or siRNA-mediated loss of Nab2 in fibroblasts was associated with constitutively elevated collagen synthesis and accentuation of Egr-1-dependent TGF-β responses in vitro. Expression of Nab2 was markedly up-regulated in skin biopsies from patients with scleroderma, and was localized primarily to epidermal keratinocytes. In contrast, little Nab2 could be detected in dermal fibroblasts. These results identify Nab2 as a novel endogenous negative regulator of Egr-1-dependent TGF-β signaling responsible for setting the intensity of fibrotic responses. Defective Nab2 expression or function in dermal fibroblasts might play a role in persistent fibrotic responses in scleroderma."
https://openalex.org/W2159756692,"The human GFAP splice variants GFAPΔ164 and GFAPΔexon6 both result in a GFAP protein isoform with a unique out-of-frame carboxy-terminus that can be detected by the GFAP+1 antibody. We previously reported that GFAP+1 was expressed in astrocytes and in degenerating neurons in Alzheimer's disease brains. In this study we aimed at further investigating the neuronal GFAP+1 expression and we started by affinity purifying the GFAP+1 antibody. The purified antibody resulted in a loss of neuronal GFAP+1 signal, although other antibodies directed against the amino- and carboxy-terminus of GFAPα still revealed GFAP-immunopositive neurons, as described before. With an in-depth analysis of a western blot, followed by mass spectrometry we discovered that the previously detected neuronal GFAP+1 expression was due to cross-reactivity of the antibody with neurofilament-L (NF-L). This was confirmed by double-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry and western blotting with the unpurified GFAP+1 antibody and an antibody against NF-L. Our data imply that NF-L can accumulate in some tangle-like structures in Alzheimer brains. More importantly, the purified GFAP+1 antibody clearly revealed a specific subtype of astrocytes in the adult human brain. These large astrocytes are present throughout the brain, e.g., along the subventricular zone, in the hippocampus, in the striatum and in the spinal cord of controls, Alzheimer, and Parkinson patients. The presence of a specific GFAP-isoform suggests a specialized function of these astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2159879269,"Vitamin B1 is in its active form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), an essential cofactor for several key enzymes in the carbohydrate metabolism. Mammals must salvage this crucial nutrient from their diet in order to complement the deficiency of de novo synthesis. In the human pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, two operons were identified which are involved in vitamin B1 metabolism. The first operon encodes for the thiaminase type II (TenA), 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine kinase (ThiD), 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole kinase (ThiM) and thiamine phosphate synthase (ThiE). The second operon encodes a phosphatase, an epimerase and the thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK). The open reading frames of the individual operons were cloned, their corresponding proteins were recombinantly expressed and biochemically analysed. The kinetic properties of the enzymes as well as the binding of TPP to the in vitro transcribed RNA of the proposed operons suggest that the vitamin B1 homeostasis in S. aureus is strongly regulated at transcriptional as well as enzymatic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2105517341,"Nanomechanical properties of filamentous biopolymers, such as the persistence length, may be determined from two-dimensional images of molecules immobilized on surfaces. For a single filament in solution, two principal adsorption scenarios are possible. Both scenarios depend primarly on the interaction strength between the filament and the support: i) For interactions in the range of the thermal energy, the filament can freely equilibrate on the surface during adsorption; ii) For interactions much stronger than the thermal energy, the filament will be captured by the surface without having equilibrated. Such a ‘trapping’ mechanism leads to more condensed filament images and hence to a smaller value for the apparent persistence length. To understand the capture mechanism in more detail we have performed Brownian dynamics simulations of relatively short filaments by taking the two extreme scenarios into account. We then compared these ‘ideal’ adsorption scenarios with observed images of immobilized vimentin intermediate filaments on different surfaces. We found a good agreement between the contours of the deposited vimentin filaments on mica (‘ideal’ trapping) and on glass (‘ideal’ equilibrated) with our simulations. Based on these data, we have developed a strategy to reliably extract the persistence length of short worm-like chain fragments or network forming filaments with unknown polymer-surface interactions."

CPAP is a centrosome protein with five coiled-coil domains and plays an important role in the control of brain size in autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Previous studies showed that CPAP interacts with tubulin and controls centriole length. Here, we reported that CPAP forms a homodimer during interphase, and the fifth coiled-coil domain of CPAP is required for its dimerization. Moreover, this self-interaction is required for maintaining centrosome cohesion and preventing the centrosome from splitting before the G2/M phase. Our biochemical studies show that CPAP forms homodimers in vivo. In addition, both monomeric and dimeric CPAP are required for accurate cell division, suggesting that the temporal dynamics of CPAP homodimerization is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Significantly, our results provide evidence that CPAP is phosphorylated during mitosis, and this phosphorylation releases its intermolecular interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation orchestrates the dynamics of CPAP molecular interaction and centrosome splitting to ensure genomic stability in cell division.

https://openalex.org/W2005078845,"Pressure sores are localized injuries to the skin and underlying tissues and are mainly resulting from overpressure. Paraplegic peoples are particularly subjects to pressure sores because of long-time seated postures and sensory deprivation at the lower limbs.Here we report outcomes of a feasibility trial involving a biofeedback system aimed at reducing buttock overpressure whilst an individual is seated. The system consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and actuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit embedded in a dental retainer with electrodes put in contact with the tongue. The principle consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated over long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce these overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional information transmitted by the TDU.Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily participated in this study. Twelve healthy subjects initially formed the experimental group (EG) and were seated on a chair with the wireless TDU inside their mouth. They were asked to follow TDU orders that were randomly spread throughout the session. They were evaluated during two experimental sessions during which 20 electro-stimulations were sent. Twelve other subjects, added retrospectively, formed the control group (CG). These subjects participated in one session of the same experiment without any biofeedback.Three dependent variables were computed: (1) the ability of subjects to reach target posture (EG versus CG), (2) high pressure reductions after a biofeedback (EG versus CG) and (3) the level of these reductions relative to their initial values (EG only). Results show (1) that EG reached target postures in 90.2% of the trials, against 5,3% in the CG, (2) a significant reduction in overpressures in the EG compared to the CG and (3), for the EG, that the higher the initial pressures were, the more they were decreased.The findings suggest that, in this trial, subjects were able to use a tongue tactile feedback system to reduce buttock overpressure while seated. Further evaluation of this system on paraplegic subjects remains to be done."
https://openalex.org/W2029317255,"The formation of SiO(2)-based cell walls by diatoms (a large group of unicellular microalgae) is a well established model system for the study of molecular mechanisms of biological mineral morphogenesis (biomineralization). Diatom biomineralization involves highly phosphorylated proteins (silaffins and silacidins), analogous to other biomineralization systems, which also depend on diverse sets of phosphoproteins (e.g. mammalian teeth and bone, mollusk shells, and sponge silica). The phosphate moieties on biomineralization proteins play an essential role in mineral formation, yet the kinases catalyzing the phosphorylation of these proteins have remained poorly characterized. Recent functional genomics studies on the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana have revealed >100 proteins potentially involved in diatom silica formation. Here we have characterized the biochemical properties and biological function of one of these proteins, tpSTK1. Multiple tpSTK1-like proteins are encoded in diatom genomes, all of which exhibit low but significant sequence similarity to kinases from other organisms. We show that tpSTK1 has serine/threonine kinase activity capable of phosphorylating silaffins but not silacidins. Cell biological and biochemical analysis demonstrated that tpSTK1 is an abundant component of the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The present study provides the first molecular structure of a kinase that appears to catalyze phosphorylation of biomineral forming proteins in vivo."

The effects of norUDCA on the formation of the cholestatic lithocholic acid-glucuronide derivative and of rifampicin on hepatic norUDCA glucuronidation were also explored. In vitro glucuronidation assays were performed with microsomes from human tissues (liver and intestine) and HEK293 cells expressing human UGT enzymes and variant allozymes. UGT1A3 was identified as the major hepatic UGT enzyme catalyzing the formation of norUDCA-23G. Correlation studies using samples from a human liver bank (n = 16) indicated that the level of UGT1A3 protein is a strong determinant of in vitro norUDCA glucuronidation. Analyses of the norUDCA-conjugating activity by 11 UGT1A3 variant allozymes identified three phenotypes with high, low, and intermediate capacity. norUDCA is also identified as a competitive inhibitor for the hepatic formation of the pro-cholestatic lithocholic acid-glucuronide derivative, whereas norUDCA glucuronidation is weakly stimulated by rifampicin.

https://openalex.org/W1997363973,"Background Inducible Costimulator (ICOS) is an important regulator of Th2 lymphocyte function and a potential immunotherapeutic target for allergy and asthma. A SNP in the ICOS 5′ promoter in humans is associated with increased atopy and serum IgE in a founder population and increased ICOS surface expression and Th2 cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, it is unknown if increased ICOS expression contributes to disease progression or is a result of disease pathology. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a mouse model in which ICOS surface expression levels are genetically predetermined to test our hypothesis that genetic regulation of ICOS expression controls the severity of Th2 responses in vivo. Using ICOS+/+ and ICOS+/− mice in a Th2 model of airway inflammation, we found that T cells from the ICOS+/− mice had reduced ICOS expression and decreased Th2-mediated inflammation in vivo. Although the activation status of the T cells did not differ, T cells isolated from the lungs and draining lymph nodes of ICOS+/− mice at the peak of inflammation produced less Th2 cytokines upon stimulation ex vivo. Using 4get mice, which express GFP upon IL-4 transcription, we determined that the decreased Th2 cytokines in ICOS+/− is due to reduced percentage of Th2 cells and not a defect in their ability to produce IL-4. Conclusion These data suggest that in both mice and humans, the level of ICOS surface expression regulates the magnitude of the in vivo Th2 response, perhaps by influencing Th2 differentiation."

However, intravenous immune globulin is limited in supply, and there is not enough to treat the entire AD patient population.In an attempt to generate more renewable human anti-Aβ antibodies, we recently used splenic B-cells from a normal individual to create hybridomas secreting pan-amyloid fibril and oligomer cross-reactive human antibodies. This fusion resulted in the cloning of a novel free human Ig heavy chain (HC), F1, which cross-reacted with amyloid fibrils and Aβ oligomers without binding to the native precursor proteins, inhibited Aβ fibril growth, and reduced soluble Aβ-induced impairment of a cellular mechanism of rodent memory and learning, hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP). Moreover, we have demonstrated that anti-amyloidogenic activity is a general property of free human Ig γ HCs. These findings advance understanding of the types of molecular interactions that amyloidogenic conformers may be involved with in vivo and should facilitate the development of novel and much needed therapeutic reagents for patients with amyloid-associated diseases.DISCUSSIONThe pan-amyloid fibril and oligomer binding of free Ig γ HCs is analogous to the reactivity of a subpopulation of naturally occurring human antibodies that we have recently identified (17O'Nuallain B. Acero L. Williams A.D. Koeppen H.P. Weber A. Schwarz H.P. Wall J.S. Weiss D.T. Solomon A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12254-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is similar to the conformational specificity of antibodies generated by active vaccination (11Lee E.B. Leng L.Z. Zhang B. Kwong L. Trojanowski J.Q. Abel T. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4292-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Chang L.

Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L. Thompson J.L. Rasool S. Gurlo T. Butler P. Glabe C.G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). However, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of HCs is unique because it is inherent in all of the molecules tested. Furthermore, in contrast with antibody binding, free HC interactions with amyloidogenic assemblies are likely to involve neo-exposed residues, which are usually buried and involved in HC-LC interactions (49Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Segal D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 639-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) because free HC binding to Aβ conformers was prevented when the molecule was bound to a LC in an antibody molecule. Such surfaces are presumably ideal for binding to similar surfaces on the growing ends of amyloid fibrils or oligomers because the HC F1 prevented Aβ fibril elongation. By analogy to HC-LC interactions, HC binding to amyloidogenic conformers and the diverse anti-amyloidogenic potencies we determined may crucially depend on particular amino acid residues at or removed from the reactive surface (50Grey H.M. Mannik M. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The exposure of a protein “hot spot” on dissociation of its natural ligand, as occurs on dissociation of antibody HCs and LCs, may be a general mechanism by which endogenous accessory molecules incorporate onto amyloidogenic assemblies (51Gruschus J.M. Amyloid. 2008; 15: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding of HCs to Aβ fibrils is unique relative to other endogenous molecules because murine serum was not able to prevent nanomolar F1 binding to Aβ fibrils (data not shown). Moreover, the free LCs of 13A and 30B also had novel nanomolar binding to Aβ fibrils (Fig. 9), indicating that anti-amyloidogenic activity is an inherent property of unpaired β-sheet surfaces of free Ig chains.The anti-amyloidogenic activity of free HCs may also have been due to a sequence-dependent subtle conformational rearrangement that occurs when these molecules are not bound to LCs or because the relatively small HCs can intercalate into grooves on amyloidogenic assemblies that are not accessible to “large” antibody molecules. For example, camelid HC antibodies, which do not contain LCs, can penetrate enzyme active sites that are not accessible to larger native antibody molecules (52De Genst E. Silence K. Decanniere K. Conrath K. Loris R. Kinne J. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Future studies that should advance understanding of the contribution of the HCs subgroup and the molecular basis for protein interactions with amyloidogenic assemblies include the generation of phage display peptide epitope mimics (53O'Nuallain B.

The prototypic γ1 HC, F1, has also shown therapeutic potential for AD by binding to a conformational epitope on amyloid fibrils and oligomers, preventing in vitro Aβ fibril growth and partly neutralizing the in vivo neurotoxic effect of Aβ oligomers on rodent hippocampal long term potentiation. These results and our findings with polyclonal HCs that demonstrated the general anti-amyloidgenic activity of free γ HCs suggest that these molecules could provide a benefit to AD patients. This may involve HCs binding to neurotoxic Aβ within the brain (5Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 59Dodart J.C. Bales K.R.

A potential advantage of HCs for therapeutics is the relative ease by which they can cross the blood-brain barrier compared with full-length antibodies, and they are less prone to adverse inflammatory side effects (61Robert R.

Moreover, HCs are generally robust, well suited to genetic manipulation, and easily expressed, and their solubility can be greatly enhanced with point mutations in the VL-VH interface (40Carroll W.L. Mendel E. Levy S. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Given that F1 and not 13A, which are γ1 and γ2 HCs, respectively, inhibited Aβ fibril elongation, it is important to establish whether the anti-amyloidogenic potential of an HC is influenced by its subtype.Free HCs are not the only antibody subunits that have shown anti-amyloidogenic activity. Single chain variable fragments have been generated against Aβ that preferentially bind to the multimeric peptide, inhibit fibril formation, reduce Aβ cytotoxicity in cultured cells, and degrade brain amyloid plaques in vivo (62Zameer A.

However, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of free HCs is distinct from other antibody subunits because it is an inherent property of all HCs tested. It is evident from our experimental findings that further characterization of the therapeutic potential for free HCs for AD and other amyloid-related diseases is warranted. Determination of the molecular basis for their reactivity with amyloidogenic assemblies could facilitate the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics and advance understanding on the types of interactions that pathogenic amyloidogenic assemblies have with biological molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1971973336,"Background Relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes are notable for multiphasic antigenic variation of polymorphic outer membrane lipoproteins, a phenomenon responsible for immune evasion. An additional role in tissue localization is suggested by the finding that isogenic serotypes 1 (Bt1) and 2 (Bt2) of the RF spirochete Borrelia turicatae, which differ only in the Vsp they express, exhibit marked differences in clinical disease severity and tissue localization during infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used known vsp DNA sequences encoding for B. turicatae and Borrelia hermsii Vsp proteins with variable regions and then studied whether there are differences in disease expression and tissue localization of their corresponding serotypes during mouse infection. For sequence and structural comparisons we focused exclusively on amino acid residues predicted to project away from the spirochetes surface, referred to as the Vsp dome. Disease severity and tissue localization were studied during persistent infection with individual or mixed serotypes in SCID mice. The results showed that all Vsp domes clustered into 3 main trunks, with the domes for B. turicatae Vsp1 (BtVsp1) and BtVsp2 clustering into separate ones. B. hermsii serotypes whose Vsp domes clustered with the BtVsp1 dome were less virulent but localized to the brain more. The BtVsp2 dome was the oddball among all and Bt2 was the only serotype that caused severe arthritis. Conclusion/Significance These findings indicate that there is significant variability in Vsp dome structure, disease severity, and tissue localization among serotypes of B. hermsii."

However, how somatic sensory information participates in the drug related behaviors is still unclear. Many studies demonstrated that drug addiction represents a pathological usurpation of neural mechanisms of learning and memory that normally relate to the pursuit of rewards. Thus, elucidate the role of somatic sensory in drug related learning and memory is of particular importance to understand the neurobiological mechanisms of drug addiction.In the present study, we investigated the role of somatosensory system in reward-related associative learning using the conditioned place preference model. Lesions were made in somatosensory cortices either before or after conditioning training. We found that lesion of somatosensory cortices before, rather than after morphine conditioning impaired the acquisition of place preference.These results demonstrate that somatosensory cortices are necessary for the acquisition but not retention of morphine induced place preference."
https://openalex.org/W2075024897,"Background Spontaneous circulation returns to less than half of adult cardiac arrest victims who received in-hospital resuscitation. One clue for this disheartening outcome arises from the prognosis that asystole invariably takes place, after a time lag, on diagnosis of brain stem death. The designation of brain stem death as the point of no return further suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery precedes death. It follows that a crucial determinant for successful revival of an arrested heart is that spontaneous circulation must resume before brain stem death commences. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that maintained functional integrity of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a neural substrate that is intimately related to brain stem death and central circulatory regulation, holds the key to the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings An animal model of brain stem death employing the pesticide mevinphos as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Intravenous administration of lethal doses of mevinphos elicited an abrupt cardiac arrest, accompanied by elevated systemic arterial pressure and anoxia, augmented neuronal excitability and enhanced microvascular perfusion in RVLM. This period represents the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation in our experimental model. Animals with restored spontaneous circulation exhibited maintained neuronal functionality in RVLM beyond this critical time-window, alongside resumption of baseline tissue oxygen and enhancement of local blood flow. Intriguingly, animals that subsequently died manifested sustained anoxia, diminished local blood flow, depressed mitochondrial electron transport activities and reduced ATP production, leading to necrotic cell death in RVLM. That amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic failure in RVLM by coenzyme Q10, the mobile electron carrier in mitochondrial respiratory chain, or oxygenation restored spontaneous circulation further established a causal relationship between functionality of RVLM and resumed spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that whereas necrotic cell death because of bioenergetic failure triggered by anoxia in RVLM, which precipitates brain stem death, negates resuscitation of an arrested heart, maintained functional integrity of this neural substrate holds the key to resumption of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2100712609,"Coding region microsatellite instability (MSI) results in loss of gene products and promotion of microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H) carcinogenesis. Recent studies have indicated that MSI within 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) may post-transcriptionally dysregulate gene products. Within this context, we conducted a broad mutational survey of 42 short 3'UTR microsatellites (MSs) in 45 MSI-H colorectal tumors and their corresponding normal colonic mucosae.In order to estimate the overall susceptibility of MSs to MSI in MSI-H tumors, the observed MSI frequency of each MS was correlated with its length, interspecies sequence conservation level, and distance from some genetic elements (i.e., stop codon, polyA signal, and microRNA binding sites). All MSs were stable in normal colonic mucosae. The MSI frequency at each MS in MSI-H tumors was independent of sequence conservation level and distance from other genetic elements. In contrast, MS length correlated significantly with MSI frequency in MSI-H tumors (r=0.86, p=7.2x10(-13)). 3'UTR MSs demonstrated MSI frequencies in MSI-H tumors higher than the 99% upper limit predicted by MS length for RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1(RB1CC1, mutation frequency 68.4%), NUAK family SNF1-like kinase 1(NUAK1, 31.0%), and Rtf1, Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex component, homolog (RTF1, 25.0%). An in silico prediction of RNA structure alterations was conducted for these MSI events to gauge their likelihood of affecting post-transcriptional regulation. RB1CC1 mutant was predicted to lose a microRNA-accessible loop structure at a putative binding site for the tumor-suppressive microRNA, miR-138. In contrast, the predicted 3'UTR structural change was minimal for NUAK1- and RTF1 mutants. Notably, real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed significant RB1CC1 mRNA overexpression vs. normal colonic mucosae in MSI-H cancers manifesting RB1CC1 3'UTR MSI (9.0-fold; p = 3.6x10(-4)).This mutational survey of well-characterized short 3'UTR MSs confirms that MSI incidence in MSI-H colorectal tumors correlates with MS length, but not with sequence conservation level or distance from other genetic elements. This study also identifies RB1CC1 as a novel target of frequent mutation and aberrant upregulation in MSI-H colorectal tumors. The predicted loss of a microRNA-accessible structure in mutant RB1CC1 RNA fits the hypothesis that 3'UTR MSI involves in aberrant RB1CC1 posttranscriptional upregulation. Further direct assessments are indicated to investigate this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2058693400,"Mate choice and mating preferences often rely on the information content of signals exchanged between potential partners. In species where a female's reproduction is the terminal event in life it is to be expected that females choose high quality males and assess males using some honest indicator of male quality. The Nereidid polychaete, Neanthes acuminata, exhibits monogamous pairing and the release of eggs by females terminates her life and larval success relies entirely on a male's ability to provide paternal care. As such females should have developed reliable, condition-dependent criteria to choose mates to guarantee survival and care for offspring. We show that females actively chose males experienced in fatherhood over others. In the absence of experienced males dominance, as evident from male-male fights, is utilized for mate selection. The preference for experienced males is not affected by previous social interactions between the individuals. We show that the choice of the partner is based on chemical signals demonstrating a ‘scent of experience’ to females providing evidence for the role of chemical signals in sexual selection for paternal care adding to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating condition-dependent mate choice."
https://openalex.org/W2092079708,"Several effects of leptin in the immune system rely on its capacity to modulate cytokine expression and apoptosis in the thymus. Surprisingly, some of these effects are dependent on signal transduction through the IRS1/PI3-kinase, but not on the activation of JAK2. Since all the well known effects of leptin in different cell types and tissues seem to be dependent on JAK2 activation, we hypothesized that, at least for the control of thymic function, another, unknown kinase could mediate the transduction of the leptin signal from the ObR towards the IRS1/PI3-kinase signaling cascade.Here, by employing immunoblot, real-time PCR and flow citometry we show that the tyrosine kinase, Fyn, is constitutively associated with the ObR in thymic cells. Following a leptin stimulus, Fyn undergoes an activating tyrosine phosphorylation and a transient association with IRS1. All these effects are independent of JAK2 activation and, upon Fyn inhibition, the signal transduction towards IRS1/PI3-kinase is abolished. In addition, the inhibition of Fyn significantly modifies the effects of leptin on thymic cytokine expression.Therefore, in the thymus, Fyn acts as a tyrosine kinase that transduces the leptin signal independently of JAK2 activation, and mediates some of the immunomodulatory effects of leptin in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2109284549,"Different studies show evidence that several unicellular organisms display a cellular metabolic structure characterized by a set of enzymes which are always in an active state (metabolic core), while the rest of the molecular catalytic reactions exhibit on-off changing states. This self-organized enzymatic configuration seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of metabolism, common to all living cellular organisms. In a recent analysis performed with dissipative metabolic networks (DMNs) we have shown that this global functional structure emerges in metabolic networks with a relatively high number of catalytic elements, under particular conditions of enzymatic covalent regulatory activity.Here, to investigate the mechanism behind the emergence of this supramolecular organization of enzymes, we have performed extensive DMNs simulations (around 15,210,000 networks) taking into account the proportion of the allosterically regulated enzymes and covalent enzymes present in the networks, the variation in the number of substrate fluxes and regulatory signals per catalytic element, as well as the random selection of the catalytic elements that receive substrate fluxes from the exterior. The numerical approximations obtained show that the percentages of DMNs with metabolic cores grow with the number of catalytic elements, converging to 100% for all cases.The results show evidence that the fundamental factor for the spontaneous emergence of this global self-organized enzymatic structure is the number of catalytic elements in the metabolic networks. Our analysis corroborates and expands on our previous studies illustrating a crucial property of the global structure of the cellular metabolism. These results also offer important insights into the mechanisms which ensure the robustness and stability of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993634505,"Background Thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of drugs, and 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) are immune regulators predicted to modulate human autoimmune disease. Their effects on γδ T cells, which are involved in animal model and human and animal autoimmune diseases, are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized the activity of rosiglitazone (from the TZD class of drugs) and 15d-PGJ2 in human Vδ2 T cells. We found that 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone had different effects on Vδ2 T cell functions. Both 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone suppressed Vδ2 T cell proliferation in response to IPP and IL2. However, only 15d-PGJ2 suppressed functional responses including cytokine production, degranulation and cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The mechanism for 15d-PGJ2 effects on Vδ2 T cells acts through inhibiting Erk activation. In contrast, rosiglitazone did not affect Erk activation but the IL2 signaling pathway, which accounts for rosiglitazone suppression of IL2-dependent, Vδ2 T cell proliferation without affecting TCR-dependent functions. Rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 are designed to be peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligands and PPARγ was expressed in Vδ2 T cell. Surprisingly, when PPARγ levels were lowered by specific siRNA, 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone were still active, suggesting their target of action induces cellular proteins other than PPARγ. Conclusions/Significance The current findings expand our understanding of how the immune system is regulated by rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 and will be important to evaluate these compounds as therapeutic agents in human autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966174941,"Objectives Educational opportunities for African-Americans expanded throughout the 20th century. Twin pairs are an informative population in which to examine changes in educational attainment because each twin has the same parents and childhood socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that correlation in educational attainment of older twin pairs would be higher compared to younger twin pairs reflecting changes in educational access over time and potentially reflecting a “ceiling effect” associated with Jim Crow laws and discrimination. Methodology and Principal Findings We used data from 211 same-sex twin pairs (98 identical, 113 fraternal) in the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging who were identified through birth records. Participants completed an in-person interview. The twins were predominantly female (61%), with a mean age of 50 years (SD = 0.5). We found that older age groups had a stronger intra-twin correlation of attained educational level. Further analysis across strata revealed a trend across zygosity, with identical twins demonstrating more similar educational attainment levels than did their fraternal twin counterparts, suggesting a genetic influence. Discussion These findings suggest that as educational opportunities broadened in the 20th century, African-Americans gained access to educational opportunities that better matched their individual abilities."
https://openalex.org/W1989561563,"Background In natural cat populations, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is transmitted through bites between individuals. Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. Methodology/Principal Findings To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. Conclusion Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease."
