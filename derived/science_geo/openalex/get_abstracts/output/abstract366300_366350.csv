One strategy for reducing costs is to increase the surface area of the platinum. Lim et al. (p. 1302 , published online 14 May) describe a simple chemical route, in which Pt ions in solution are reduced onto Pd seed crystals, which creates faceted Pt nanocrystals with a high area owing to their dendritic architecture. On a Pt mass basis, these catalysts are several times more active than conventional Pt catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2101083009,"The mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival. We identify DEPTOR as an mTOR-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. Loss of DEPTOR activates S6K1, Akt, and SGK1, promotes cell growth and survival, and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities. DEPTOR overexpression suppresses S6K1 but, by relieving feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K signaling, activates Akt. Consistent with many human cancers having activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways, DEPTOR expression is low in most cancers. Surprisingly, DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in a subset of multiple myelomas harboring cyclin D1/D3 or c-MAF/MAFB translocations. In these cells, high DEPTOR expression is necessary to maintain PI3K and Akt activation and a reduction in DEPTOR levels leads to apoptosis. Thus, we identify a novel mTOR-interacting protein whose deregulated overexpression in multiple myeloma cells represents a mechanism for activating PI3K/Akt signaling and promoting cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W2042392223,"Sequence preferences of DNA binding proteins are a primary mechanism by which cells interpret the genome. Despite the central importance of these proteins in physiology, development, and evolution, comprehensive DNA binding specificities have been determined experimentally for only a few proteins. Here, we used microarrays containing all 10-base pair sequences to examine the binding specificities of 104 distinct mouse DNA binding proteins representing 22 structural classes. Our results reveal a complex landscape of binding, with virtually every protein analyzed possessing unique preferences. Roughly half of the proteins each recognized multiple distinctly different sequence motifs, challenging our molecular understanding of how proteins interact with their DNA binding sites. This complexity in DNA recognition may be important in gene regulation and in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks."

When the pituitary surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) binds to its receptor on granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, a cascade of signaling events triggers granulosa cells to become luteal cells and the oocyte to resume meiosis. Fan et al. (p. 938 ; see the Perspective by Duggavathi and Murphy ), using the mouse as a model system, targeted disruption of the kinases ERK1 and ERK2 selectively in granulosa cells. The kinases were essential in vivo mediators of LH induction of ovulation and luteinization."
https://openalex.org/W2076723714,"Understanding the factors that regulate the induction, quality, and longevity of antiviral T cell responses is essential for devising rational strategies to prevent or combat infections. In this study, we show that interleukin-21 (IL-21), likely produced by CD4+ T cells, directly influences the generation of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells and that the number of CD4+ T cells that produce IL-21 differs markedly between acute and chronic infections. IL-21 regulates the development of CD8+ T cell exhaustion and the ability to contain chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. Thus, IL-21 serves as a critical helper factor that shapes the functional quality of antiviral CD8+ T cells and is required for viral control."
https://openalex.org/W2170484048,"Resolving Landau Levels in Graphene The charge carriers in a two-dimensional conductor, when placed in a magnetic field, can develop an additional set of quantized energy levels. These Landau levels correspond to the carriers now moving in cyclotron orbits. In graphene, which consists of single-atom-thick sheets of graphite, an unusual set of Landau levels with nonequal energy spacing can develop in graphene layers that have undergone symmetry breaking caused by rotation between adjacent layers. Miller et al. (p. 924 ) used scanning tunneling microscopy at cryogenic temperatures to map out Landau levels in graphene grown on silicon carbide with high energy and momentum resolution, including the characteristic level in graphene that can occur at zero energy."
https://openalex.org/W2093807014,"Collapse and Rise The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is thought to be inherently unstable and susceptible to rapid collapse if it reaches a certain warming threshold. Although such an event is considered unlikely, to predict the consequences of collapse it is important to know how much sea level would rise in such a case. The WAIS is thought to contain enough ice to raise sea level by 5 to 7 meters were it to collapse. Bamber et al. (p. 901 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Ivins ) have reassessed that number, on the basis of better data on the geometry of the WAIS, and conclude that its sudden collapse would raise sea level by about 3.2 meters, on average, with large and important regional variations. Although this is only about half as much as previously thought, its impact on coastal areas would still be devastating."
https://openalex.org/W2094358092,"Motion detection is an essential component of visual processing. On-Off direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs) detect objects moving along specific axes of the visual field due to their precise retinal circuitry. The brain circuitry of On-Off DSGCs, however, is largely unknown. We report a mouse with GFP expressed selectively by the On-Off DSGCs that detect posterior motion (On-Off pDSGCs), allowing two-photon targeted recordings of their light responses and delineation of their complete map of central connections. On-Off pDSGCs project exclusively to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus and in both targets form synaptic lamina that are separate from a lamina corresponding to non-DSGCs. Thus, individual On-Off DSGC subtypes are molecularly distinct and establish circuits that map specific qualities of directional motion to dedicated subcortical areas. This suggests that each RGC subtype represents a unique parallel pathway whose synaptic specificity in the retina is recapitulated in central targets."
https://openalex.org/W2063159592,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing mechanism conserved from fungi to humans. High-throughput sequencing has highlighted a vast reservoir of small non-coding RNAs in animals and plants, many of whose function remains to be determined. Despite the conservation of the RNAi pathways, whether similar types of small RNAs exist in the lower eukaryotes has been largely unexplored. Now a novel class of small RNAs has been identified in the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Named qiRNAs, for their association with the Argonaute protein QDE-2, like QDE-2 they appear in response to DNA damage. At about 20 nucleotides long they are slightly shorter than Neurospora siRNAs. Neurospora RNAi mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a role for qiRNAs in DNA repair as inhibitors of protein translation. High-throughput sequencing has highlighted a vast reservoir of small non-coding RNAs, the function of which, for the most part, remains to be determined. Here a new class of small RNAs, termed qiRNAs, is identified from the fungus Neurospora. The production of qiRNAs is dependent on DNA damage, and it is proposed that they may have a role in the DNA damage response. RNA interference pathways use small RNAs to mediate gene silencing in eukaryotes. In addition to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs, several types of endogenously produced small RNAs have important roles in gene regulation, germ cell maintenance and transposon silencing1,2,3,4. The production of some of these RNAs requires the synthesis of aberrant RNAs (aRNAs) or pre-siRNAs, which are specifically recognized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to make double-stranded RNA. The mechanism for aRNA synthesis and recognition is largely unknown. Here we show that DNA damage induces the expression of the Argonaute protein QDE-2 and a new class of small RNAs in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This class of small RNAs, known as qiRNAs because of their interaction with QDE-2, are about 20–21 nucleotides long (several nucleotides shorter than Neurospora siRNAs), with a strong preference for uridine at the 5′ end, and originate mostly from the ribosomal DNA locus. The production of qiRNAs requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase QDE-1, the Werner and Bloom RecQ DNA helicase homologue QDE-3 and dicers. qiRNA biogenesis also requires DNA-damage-induced aRNAs as precursors, a process that is dependent on both QDE-1 and QDE-3. Notably, our results suggest that QDE-1 is the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that produces aRNAs. Furthermore, the Neurospora RNA interference mutants show increased sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a role for qiRNAs in the DNA-damage response by inhibiting protein translation."

https://openalex.org/W1971029629,"To understand how our global climate will change in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing, it is essential to determine how quickly and by what pathways climate change signals are transported throughout the global ocean, a vast reservoir for heat and carbon dioxide. Labrador Sea Water (LSW), formed by open ocean convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, is a particularly sensitive indicator of climate change on interannual to decadal timescales. Hydrographic observations made anywhere along the western boundary of the North Atlantic reveal a core of LSW at intermediate depths advected southward within the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). These observations have led to the widely held view that the DWBC is the dominant pathway for the export of LSW from its formation site in the northern North Atlantic towards the Equator. Here we show that most of the recently ventilated LSW entering the subtropics follows interior, not DWBC, pathways. The interior pathways are revealed by trajectories of subsurface RAFOS floats released during the period 2003-2005 that recorded once-daily temperature, pressure and acoustically determined position for two years, and by model-simulated 'e-floats' released in the subpolar DWBC. The evidence points to a few specific locations around the Grand Banks where LSW is most often injected into the interior. These results have implications for deep ocean ventilation and suggest that the interior subtropical gyre should not be ignored when considering the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2073698878,"The Path Not Taken People readily recognize that unchosen actions have consequences and adjust their behavior accordingly. The ability to recognize fictive outcomes is thought to be a necessary component of regret, and disruptions in this ability may cause anxiety and problem gambling. Do animals engage in this same process? Hayden et al. (p. 948 ) provided monkeys with information about what rewards unchosen options would have given. The monkeys' behavior depended strongly on these fictive outcomes. Responses of single neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, which monitors outcomes of rewarding decisions and guides subsequent changes in behavior, were recorded while monkeys performed the task. Nearly half the neurons in the sample responded to both experienced and fictive outcomes. Thus, the anterior cingulate cortex does not simply monitor the consequences of actions, but represents outcomes in a more abstract manner that incorporates both real and fictive information."
https://openalex.org/W1976776701,"Microbial pathogens use environmental cues to trigger the developmental events needed to infect mammalian hosts or transmit to disease vectors. The parasites causing African sleeping sickness respond to citrate or cis-aconitate (CCA) to initiate life-cycle development when transmitted to their tsetse fly vector. This requires hypersensitization of the parasites to CCA by exposure to low temperature, conditions encountered after tsetse fly feeding at dusk or dawn. Here we identify a carboxylate-transporter family, PAD (proteins associated with differentiation), required for perception of this differentiation signal. Consistent with predictions for the response of trypanosomes to CCA, PAD proteins are expressed on the surface of the transmission-competent ‘stumpy-form’ parasites in the bloodstream, and at least one member is thermoregulated, showing elevated expression and surface access at low temperature. Moreover, RNA-interference-mediated ablation of PAD expression diminishes CCA-induced differentiation and eliminates CCA hypersensitivity under cold-shock conditions. As well as being molecular transducers of the differentiation signal in these parasites, PAD proteins provide the first example of a surface marker able to discriminate the transmission stage of trypanosomes in their mammalian host. The sleeping sickness pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, like many other parasites, has a complex life cycle involving insect and mammalian hosts. It has been long known that differentiation from the human blood to the tsetse-fly stage requires two signals, low temperature and citrate and/or cis-aconitate, but how these signals were perceived was not clear. Now the cell surface molecules that convey the environmental signal responsible for trypanosome differentiation have been identified as members of the trypanosome carboxylate-transporter family PAD. Significantly, it is the transmission-competent 'stumpy' forms of the blood-borne parasite — more robust than slender forms and competent to differentiate— that carry PAD proteins. The differentiation of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the cause of sleeping sickness, from the human blood to the tsetse fly stage is known to require two signals – low temperature and citrate and/or cis-aconitate – but how these signals were perceived was unknown. The trypanosome carboxylate-transporter family PAD is now revealed to be essential in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2050849480,"Sensorin Reporter Long-term memory and synaptic plasticity require changes in gene expression and yet can occur in a synapse-specific manner. Messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and regulated translation at synapses have been proposed as mechanisms for spatially restricting gene expression during transcription-dependent, synapse-specific forms of neuronal plasticity. In the sea slug Aplysia , which is a frequently used model system for studying learning and memory, sensorin is a sensory cell–specific peptide neurotransmitter. The mRNA encoding sensorin localizes to distal sensory neurites and further concentrates at sites of synaptic contact between sensory and motor neurons. Wang et al. (p. 1536 , published online 14 May; see the Perspective by Korte ) demonstrate, using translational reporters of sensorin mRNA expressed in individual cultured Aplysia sensory and motor neurons, that local translation occurs at synapses during transcription-dependent, learning-related forms of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2131001041,"Nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone places intense pressure on marine communities. Previous studies have shown that growth of intertidal mangrove forests is accelerated with enhanced nutrient availability. However, nutrient enrichment favours growth of shoots relative to roots, thus enhancing growth rates but increasing vulnerability to environmental stresses that adversely affect plant water relations. Two such stresses are high salinity and low humidity, both of which require greater investment in roots to meet the demands for water by the shoots. Here we present data from a global network of sites that documents enhanced mortality of mangroves with experimental nutrient enrichment at sites where high sediment salinity was coincident with low rainfall and low humidity. Thus the benefits of increased mangrove growth in response to coastal eutrophication is offset by the costs of decreased resilience due to mortality during drought, with mortality increasing with soil water salinity along climatic gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2121046240,"The central protease of eukaryotes, the 26S proteasome, has a 20S proteolytic core particle (CP) and an attached 19S regulatory particle (RP). The RP is further subdivided into lid and base subcomplexes. Little is known about RP assembly. Here, we show that four conserved assembly factors govern biogenesis of the yeast RP base. Nas2 forms a complex with the Rpt4 and Rpt5 ATPases and enhances 26S proteasome formation in vivo and in vitro. Other RP subcomplexes contain Hsm3, which is related to mammalian proteasome subunit S5b. Hsm3 also contributes to base assembly. Larger Hsm3-containing complexes include two additional proteins, Nas6 and Rpn14, which function as assembly chaperones as well. Specific deletion combinations affecting these four factors cause severe perturbations to RP assembly. Our results demonstrate that proteasomal RP biogenesis requires multiple, functionally overlapping chaperones and suggest a model in which subunits form specific subcomplexes that then assemble into the base."
https://openalex.org/W2021296110,"The 26S proteasome is a highly conserved multisubunit protease that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. The 26S proteasome consists of the proteolytic core particle (CP) and one or two 19S regulatory particles (RPs). Although the mechanisms of CP assembly are well described, the mechanism of RP assembly is largely unknown. Here, we show that four proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs), Nas2/p27, Nas6/gankyrin, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Hsm3/S5b, bind specific Rpt subunits of the RP and interact each other genetically. Lack of these PIPs resulted in defective assembly of the 26S proteasome at an early stage, suggesting that these proteins are bona fide RP chaperones. Each of the RP chaperones formed distinct specific subassemblies of the base components and escorted them to mature RPs. Our results indicate that the RP assembly is a highly organized and elaborate process orchestrated by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W2122638939,"The embryonic stem cell (ESC) factor, SALL4, plays an essential role in both development and leukemogenesis. It is a unique gene that is involved in self-renewal in ESC and leukemic stem cell (LSC).To understand the mechanism(s) of SALL4 function(s), we sought to identify SALL4-associated proteins by tandem mass spectrometry. Components of a transcription repressor Mi-2/Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex were found in the SALL4-immunocomplexes with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in ESCs with endogenous SALL4 expression and 293T cells overexpressing SALL4. The SALL4-mediated transcriptional regulation was tested on two potential target genes: PTEN and SALL1. Both genes were confirmed as SALL4 downstream targets by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, and their expression levels, when tested by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were decreased in 293T cells overexpressing SALL4. Moreover, SALL4 binding sites at the promoter regions of PTEN and SALL1 were co-occupied by NuRD components, suggesting that SALL4 represses the transcriptions of PTEN and SALL1 through its interactions with the Mi-2/NuRD complex. The in vivo repressive effect(s) of SALL4 were evaluated in SALL4 transgenic mice, where decreased expressions of PTEN and SALL1 were associated with myeloid leukemia and cystic kidneys, respectively.In summary, we are the first to demonstrate that stem cell protein SALL4 represses its target genes, PTEN and SALL1, through the epigenetic repressor Mi-2/NuRD complex. Our novel finding provides insight into the mechanism(s) of SALL4 functions in kidney development and leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1523682399,"Our Solar System originated in interstellar gas and dust; the latter is in the form of amorphous silicate particles and carbonaceous dust. The composition of cometary material shows that a significant fraction of the amorphous silicates was transformed into crystalline form during the early evolution of the protosolar nebula. How and when this transformation happened has been controversial, with the main options being heating by the young Sun or shock heating. Here we report mid-infrared features in the outburst spectrum of the young solar-like star EX Lupi that were not present in quiescence. We attribute them to crystalline forsterite; the crystals were produced via thermal annealing in the surface layer of the inner disk by heat from the outburst, a process that has hitherto not been considered. The observed lack of cold crystals excludes shock heating at larger radii."

It has not been known whether abortive initiation occurs in vivo. Using hybridization with locked nucleic acid probes, we directly detected abortive transcripts in bacteria. In addition, we show that in vivo abortive initiation shows characteristics of in vitro abortive initiation: Abortive initiation increases upon stabilizing interactions between RNAP and either promoter DNA or sigma factor, and also upon deleting elongation factor GreA. Abortive transcripts may have functional roles in regulating gene expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2068746016,"Root and stem rot disease of soybean is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora sojae. The avirulence (Avr) genes of P. sojae control race-cultivar compatibility. In this study, we identify the P. sojae Avr3c gene and show that it encodes a predicted RXLR effector protein of 220 amino acids. Sequence and transcriptional data were compared for predicted RXLR effectors occurring in the vicinity of Avr4/6, as genetic linkage of Avr3c and Avr4/6 was previously suggested. Mapping of DNA markers in a F2 population was performed to determine whether selected RXLR effector genes co-segregate with the Avr3c phenotype. The results pointed to one RXLR candidate gene as likely to encode Avr3c. This was verified by testing selected genes by a co-bombardment assay on soybean plants with Rps3c, thus demonstrating functionality and confirming the identity of Avr3c. The Avr3c gene together with eight other predicted genes are part of a repetitive segment of 33.7 kb. Three near-identical copies of this segment occur in a tandem array. In P. sojae strain P6497, two identical copies of Avr3c occur within the repeated segments whereas the third copy of this RXLR effector has diverged in sequence. The Avr3c gene is expressed during the early stages of infection in all P. sojae strains examined. Virulent alleles of Avr3c that differ in amino acid sequence were identified in other strains of P. sojae. Gain of virulence was acquired through mutation and subsequent sequence exchanges between the two copies of Avr3c. The results illustrate the importance of segmental duplications and RXLR effector evolution in the control of race-cultivar compatibility in the P. sojae and soybean interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1998613854,"The potential role of amelogenin phosphorylation in enamel formation is elucidated through in vitro mineralization studies. Studies focused on the native 20-kDa porcine amelogenin proteolytic cleavage product P148 that is prominent in developing enamel. Experimental conditions supported spontaneous calcium phosphate precipitation with the initial formation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). In the absence of protein, ACP was found to undergo relatively rapid transformation to randomly oriented plate-like apatitic crystals. In the presence of non-phosphorylated recombinant full-length amelogenin, rP172, a longer induction period was observed during which relatively small ACP nanoparticles were transiently stabilized. In the presence of rP172, these nanoparticles were found to align to form linear needle-like particles that subsequently transformed and organized into parallel arrays of apatitic needle-like crystals. In sharp contrast to these findings, P148, with a single phosphate group on serine 16, was found to inhibit calcium phosphate precipitation and stabilize ACP formation for more than 1 day. Additional studies using non-phosphorylated recombinant (rP147) and partially dephosphorylated forms of P148 (dephoso-P148) showed that the single phosphate group in P148 was responsible for the profound effect on mineral formation in vitro. The present study has provided, for the first time, evidence suggesting that the native proteolytic cleavage product P148 may have an important functional role in regulating mineralization during enamel formation by preventing unwanted mineral formation within the enamel matrix during the secretory stage of amelogenesis. Results obtained have also provided new insights into the functional role of the highly conserved hydrophilic C terminus found in full-length amelogenin.

Results obtained have also provided new insights into the functional role of the highly conserved hydrophilic C terminus found in full-length amelogenin. Extracellular matrix molecules play a crucial role in the regulation of biological mineralization by controlling crystal size, shape, and organization. An example of this exquisite regulation is in the formation of the highly organized dental enamel tissue that is regulated in part by amelogenin, the major extracellular matrix protein secreted by ameloblasts (1.Margolis H.C. Beniash E. Fowler C.E. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although amelogenin is processed by proteinases soon after secretion, the intact full-length parent molecule has been found to be exclusively associated with newly formed enamel mineral (2.Uchida T. Tanabe T. Fukae M. Shimizu M. Yamada M. Miake K. Kobayashi S. Histochemistry. 1991; 96: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Prior studies in our laboratory (3.Beniash E. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have also shown that full-length recombinant mouse amelogenin (rM179) can regulate the formation of parallel arrays of apatitic crystals (a salient feature of developing and mature dental enamel) under conditions of spontaneous precipitation in vitro. This functional capability appears to be related to the specific primary structure of the full-length amelogenin and its unique assembly properties under certain physicochemical conditions of pH and temperature (4.Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In particular, the conserved hydrophilic C terminus of amelogenin has been shown to play a key role in these processes (3.Beniash E. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To date, however, most studies have utilized recombinant amelogenins that lack the N-terminal methionine and the single phosphate group (Ser-16) found in native proteins (e.g. Fig. 1). Thus, the effect of phosphorylation on amelogenin self-assembly and its regulation of mineralization is not known. This report describes for the first time evidence that the single phosphate group found in native amelogenins has a profound influence on the formation of calcium phosphates in vitro. The potential role of amelogenin phosphorylation in enamel formation is elucidated here through comparative studies using the 20-kDa porcine amelogenin proteolytic cleavage product P148, found in the developing enamel matrix, and its recombinant form (rP147) that lacks the N-terminal methionine and the single phosphate group (Ser-16). P148 has been shown to be the predominant cleavage product present during the secretory stage of developing porcine enamel (5.Tanabe T. Fukae M. Uchida T. Shimizu M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6.Yamakoshi Y. Tanabe T. Fukae M. Shimizu M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The recombinant full-length amelogenin (rP172) was also investigated for further comparison, providing additional new insights into the role of the hydrophilic C terminus. The smaller molecules used (rP147 and P148) lack the hydrophilic C terminus present in the full-length parent molecule (Fig. 1). The predominant native porcine amelogenin cleavage product P148 was isolated and purified from developing tooth buds as previously described (6.Yamakoshi Y. Tanabe T. Fukae M. Shimizu M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The recombinant analog of P148, rP147, and the recombinant full-length amelogenin from pig, rP172, were produced and purified as reported (7.Ryu O.H. Fincham A.G. Hu C.C. Zhang C. Qian Q. Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins, derived from bacteria, lack a single phosphate group at Ser-16 and an N-terminal methionine that are both present in the native full-length amelogenin (P173) from pig (Fig. 1). P148 and rP147 differ from the full-length recombinant (rP172) by lacking the hydrophilic C-terminal tail of 25 amino acids. Unlike rP172 and rP147, P148 is phosphorylated at Ser-16 (Fig. 1). P148 was also partially dephosphorylated prior to use in selected experiments. A 24-μl aliquot of a 5 mg/ml P148 solution was incubated with 2 μl of acid phosphatase (2 units) for 24 h, prior to being used in the mineralization experiment described below. The level of phosphorylation of the P148 and partially dephosphorylated P148 (dephoso-P148) was estimated using mass spectrometric analysis (Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School). Lyophilized proteins were weighed and dissolved in distilled deionized water to yield stock solutions of 5 mg/ml. Protein solutions had pH values below 4 and were maintained at 4 °C for 24 h to ensure complete dissolution. Dynamic light scattering showed that the initial protein stock solutions exhibited mean hydrodynamic radii values (RH) of 1–2 nm, indicating that both the full-length and cleaved amelogenins studied were present as monodisperse populations of monomers or dimers (4.Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Prior to use in mineralization studies and dynamic light scattering measurements, protein stock solutions were centrifuged (11,340 × g, Eppendorf Centrifuge 5403) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove dust and any particulate matter. Stock solutions of calcium (30 mm) and phosphate (3 mm) were prepared using reagent grade CaCl2 (Sigma, >99.0% pure) and KH2PO4 (Sigma, >99.0% pure). The KH2PO4 solution was subsequently adjusted to pH 8–10 at 25 °C, using a small volume of KOH. The precise pH value was selected by design so that the reaction solution (including protein) would have an initial pH value of ∼7.4 at 37 °C upon mixing of all solution components. With the exception of the centrifuged protein solution, all solutions were filtered (0.22-μm Isopore filters (Millipore)) prior to use. Aliquots of calcium and the pH-adjusted phosphate solution were sequentially added to cold protein solutions maintained on ice to yield final concentrations of 2.5 mm Ca2+, 1.5 mm Pi, and 2 mg/ml protein, with a final volume of 60 μl. The samples were then placed in a thermostatic water bath adjusted to 37 °C. Initial pH values were ∼7.4. To minimize evaporation, the reaction tube was tightly sealed with a cap or Parafilm (America National Can, Chicago, IL). Each experiment was carried out using two identically prepared samples. In one sample, a microcombination pH electrode (MI-410, Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, NH) was immersed in the reaction solution to monitor changes in pH as a function of time. The other sample was used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 3The abbreviations used are: TEMtransmission electron microscopyHAhydroxylapatiteFT-IRFourier transform-infraredSAEDselected area electron diffractionACPamorphous calcium phosphate. analyses, as described below. Additional experiments were also carried out over a 4-h period using a larger sample volume (1.8 ml) that was stirred with a small magnetic stir bar. At the end of this time period, in selected experiments changes in total calcium and phosphate were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAnalyst 200, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a spectrometric method (8.Gee A. Deitz V.R. Anal. Chem. 1953; 25: 1320-1324Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar), respectively.

These aliquots were placed on carbon-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 0.5–1 min, blotted vertically against filter paper, quickly rinsed with distilled water, blotted again, and then air-dried. Grids were prepared in duplicate. Images were obtained in bright field and SAED modes using a JEOL 1200 TEM operated at 100 kV and captured by an AMT CCD camera (AMT, Danvers, MA). The analysis of micrographs was performed using NIH ImageJ 1.64 software. Following each mineralization experiment, reaction mixtures were concentrated by centrifugation and the removal of 20 μl of the supernatant. A 20-μl aliquot of the concentrated sample was then placed on a KBr sheet (KBr IR Card, International Crystal Labs, Garfield, NJ) and dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator or at room temperature. However, to prevent possible phase transformation of ACP, spectroscopic grade acetone was added to concentrated 1-day samples prepared in the presence of P148 before overnight drying. FT-IR spectra (4000 to 450 cm−1) of these samples were then recorded using a PerkinElmer Multiscope FT-IR microscope. FT-IR results are presented in the supplemental material. The effect of rP147, P148, and rP172 on the rate of spontaneous calcium phosphate precipitation was monitored via changes in pH. In the absence of protein (control), using 60-μl samples, a decrease in pH was observed to take place in three distinct steps, corresponding to an initial induction period of ∼15 min associated with the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), as shown below, followed by a rapid and a slower apatitic crystal growth phase (Fig. 2A, curve a). A similar change in pH with time was also observed in the presence of the full-length recombinant amelogenin rP172 (Fig. 2A, curve b), following a longer ∼45-min induction period, although the pH was found to level off (at ∼6 h) at a higher value than that seen in the control. In the presence of recombinant amelogenin rP147 that lacks 25 C-terminal amino acids, however, an almost immediate decrease in pH was observed (Fig. 2A, curve c). Although the initial pH drop is similar to that seen in the control, the pH leveled off (after 4 h) again at a higher value than observed in the control. In sharp contrast to these findings, however, the native phosphorylated form of rP147, P148 (Fig. 1), behaved quite differently under the same experimental conditions. In 60-μl samples, in the presence of P148, relatively little pH change was observed for 1 day (Fig. 2A, curve e) and even longer (i.e. up to 3 days (data not shown)). At the beginning of the reaction, the pH decreased slightly (0.2∼0.4 pH units) during the first hour and then slowly increased to almost the initial pH value that remained relatively constant for up to 24 h, as shown. Marked changes in pH as seen in the control, or in the presence of rP172 and rP147, were not observed. Similar findings were also obtained when a larger (stirred) reaction volume (1.8 ml) was used. A mineralization induction time (∼45 min) was observed for rP172 that was again greater than that seen in the control (∼20 min), while pH values remained nearly constant for the 4-h period in the presence of P148 (Fig. 2B, curve c) following a small initial decrease. Relative changes in pH at 4 h were also reflected in observed changes in total calcium and phosphate concentrations measured in selected samples (Table 1) that showed, in general, a much smaller decrease in mineral ion concentrations in the presence of P148 in comparison to those observed with rP172 and in the control. These changes in mineral ion concentrations are also consistent with the relative amounts of mineral observed in 60-μl samples using TEM, as described below. When larger volumes of stirred solutions were monitored for pH for longer times, pH values did not change for up to 10 h in the presence of P148 (data not shown).TABLE 1Mean percent decrease (S.D.) in total calcium and phosphateSamplesCalciumPhosphaten%%Control47.5 (7.3)47.4 (8.0)6rP17256.1 (4.7)58.6 (3.7)4P14819.4 (6.5)12.1 (3.8)2 Open table in a new tab In the absence of amelogenin (control), monodispersed spherical particles (32.1 ± 4.3 nm, n = 64) of ACP were observed by TEM within the first 15 min. Mineral phase identification was based on SAED analyses (Fig. 3A, 15 min, inset) of the observed particles that exhibited spherical shapes that are consistent with amorphous material and the known morphology of ACP (9.Eanes E.D. Monogr. Oral Sci. 2001; 18: 130-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10.Mahamid J. Sharir A. Addadi L. Weiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12748-12753Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). After 45 min, thin plate-like particles were found to grow from the network of ACP particles. From 1–4 h, the spherical particles could no longer be seen and were replaced by networks (agglomerates) of thin plate-like crystals (Fig. 3A). At the edge of these agglomerates, rhombohedral or rounded plates were observed. After 1 day (24 h), randomly arranged thin plate-like crystals (l = 72.9 ± 20.6 nm, n = 76) were observed (Fig. 3A). SAED analyses (Fig. 3A, 1 day, inset) were consistent with the formation of hydroxylapatite (HA), as confirmed by FT-IR (see supplemental material). TEM and SAED analyses of sample solutions containing rP172 also revealed the initial (∼15 min) presence of nanometer-sized ACP particles, as seen in Fig. 3B (and inset). In general, these particles were smaller than those seen in the control, having diameters of 8.5 ± 1.1 nm (n = 166). At 45 min (Fig. 3B), small nanoparticles were seen to align and form linear needle-like particles, whereas after 1–4 h needle-like crystals were observed. After 1 day, multiple bundles of aligned needle-like crystals (l = 154 ± 35 nm; n = 91) were seen. The SAED pattern of an isolated bundle exhibited narrow arcs corresponding to 002 and 004 reflections, as shown in Fig. 3B (1 day, insets), indicating that the thin crystals were elongated in the [001] direction and that the crystals were organized into bundles with their crystallographic c-axes preferentially oriented in near parallel arrangement. SAED results were again consistent with the formation of HA, as confirmed by FT-IR (see supplemental material). When rP147, a recombinant truncated version of rP172, was used, randomly arranged plate-like HA crystals, based on SAED and FT-IR analyses (see supplemental material), were observed at 1 day that were similar in these respects to those seen in the control (Fig. 3D, 1 day and inset), but unlike those observed in the presence of rP172. These crystals, however, were found to be significantly (p < 0.001) though slightly smaller (l = 67.1 ± 18.5 nm, n = 79) than those in control samples. As shown in Fig. 3D, mineralization in the presence of rP147 appeared to take place outside of the observed protein masses. At 15 min, as suggested by the observance of a somewhat diffuse SAED diffraction pattern (Fig. 3D, inset), TEM analyses revealed both spherical particles and small plate-like crystals. At 45 min, diffraction spots forming a discrete ring pattern were clearly visible, as was the presence of plate-like crystals after 1–4 h of reaction. In sharp contrast to the control and samples with rP147 and rP172, monodispersed particles and/or networks of ACP were observed by TEM in samples containing P148, the native phosphorylated derivative of rP147, at all noted time points from 15 min to 1 day (Fig. 3C). SAED patterns at 15 min and at 1 day were characteristic of ACP (Fig. 3C, insets), consistent with the lack of pH change observed during the mineralization experiments in the presence of P148. The amorphous nature of the reaction product formed (at 1 day) in the presence of P148 was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy (see supplemental material). Such mineral particles were rarely found, however, when the entire grid was examined (data not shown). Nevertheless, in the presence of P148, monodispersed spherical particles (d = 36.4 ± 3.6 nm, n = 60) of ACP were clearly seen by TEM at 1 day (Fig. 3C) that were similar in size and appearance to those observed in the control within the first 15 min of reaction. P148 was also found to stabilize ACP formation at a lower protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, whereas at protein concentrations of 400 μg/ml and below, apatitic crystal growth was observed (data not shown). Reacting native P148 with acid phosphatase reduced the percentage of Ser-16-phosphorylated sites by almost 50% from an initial value of 66.1 to 34.5%. Using the partially dephosphorylated protein (dephoso-P148) in the 60-μl mineralizing system, a decrease in solution pH was observed after a 4-h induction period (Fig. 2A, curve d), in contrast to that seen for P148. The observed change in pH corresponded to the formation of bundles of plate-like crystals (Fig. 4C) that were significantly (p < 0.001) larger (l = 213 ± 55 nm, n = 98) than those seen in the control or in the presence of rP147 and rP172. To illustrate the effect of the single phosphate group present in P148, TEM results obtained at 1 day for rP147, P148, and dephoso-P148 are compared in Fig. 4. A summary of the shape, size, and identification of mineral phases formed after 1 day in the absence and presence of all amelogenins studied is also presented in Table 2.TABLE 2Particle size, shape, and phase identification for calcium phosphates grown in the absence and presence of amelogenins at 1 dayAmelogeninsParticle size (length, nm)ShapePhaseNone (control)72.9 ± 20.6 (n = 76)Randomly arranged platesHArP172154 ± 35 (n = 91)Bundles of aligned needlesHArP14767.1 ± 18.5 (n = 79)Randomly arranged platesHADephos-P148213 ± 55 (n = 98)Bundles of platesHAP14836.4 ± 3.6 (n = 60)Spherical particlesACP Open table in a new tab P148 is the predominant cleavage product of the most abundant extracellular matrix protein in the secretory stage of developing tooth enamel (5.Tanabe T. Fukae M. Uchida T. Shimizu M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6.Yamakoshi Y. Tanabe T. Fukae M. Shimizu M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present results clearly show that P148 can dramatically inhibit spontaneous calcium phosphate formation in vitro and stabilize ACP, thus preventing its transformation to apatitic material as seen in the control. This effect was shown to be related to the single phosphate group found on Ser-16, through comparative studies using the non-phosphorylated recombinant analog rP147 and samples of P148 in which the level of phosphorylation was reduced by a factor of two (i.e. dephoso-P148). As shown in Fig. 2A, based on observed changes in pH, rP147 had little influence on the initial rapid rate of mineral formation, relative to the control. However, some influence of rP147 was observed on the rate of pH change following the initial rapid change, resulting in a smaller change in pH after 1 day. Consistent with the observed difference in final pH, plate-like crystals of apatite that formed in the presence of rP147 were slightly but significantly smaller than those formed in control reactions (Table 2). Using dephoso-P148, a 4-h induction period was observed, and plate-like crystals were found (1 day) that were significantly larger than those observed in the presence of rP147 (or rP172). This latter finding is consistent with a partial inhibition of nucleation and ACP formation, i.e. fewer crystal precursors formed that subsequently grew into larger crystals. In the present study, the identification of ACP was partially based on observed particle morphology and diffuse electron diffraction patterns. It should be noted, however, that such amorphous scattering patterns might also result from the presence of agglomerations of nanocrystals of apatitic material (11.Suvorova E.I. Buffat P.A. Cryst. Rep. 2001; 46: 722-729Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although some uncertainty remains, in the absence of high-resolution TEM analyses of the observed spherical particles, our SAED findings agreed well with FT-IR analyses that were clearly consistent with the presence of ACP (see supplemental material). Collectively, our results show that phosphorylation has a profound effect on the ability of P148 to inhibit apatite formation under conditions that support the spontaneous formation of calcium phosphates. In vivo, therefore, P148 may play an important functional role in regulating mineralization during enamel formation through its inhibition of crystal nucleation and the stabilization of ACP. This inhibition may serve to prevent unwanted mineral formation throughout the majority of the extracellular enamel matrix during the secretory stage of amelogenesis where very thin crystals of enamel mineral are formed and constitute only ∼10–20% of the extracellular matrix volume, with the remaining portion occupied by protein and water (12.Robinson C. Kirkham J. Hallsworth A.S. Arch. Oral Biol. 1988; 33: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13.Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Consistent with our observations regarding P148 and in support of our experimental model that uses highly supersaturated calcium phosphate solutions that induce ACP formation, data have been obtained that suggest the presence of ACP in the developing enamel matrix (14.Diekwisch T.G.

Transient amorphous mineral phases (i.e. ACP and amorphous calcium carbonate) have also been observed to be associated with a number of other biomineralization systems, including mollusk shells and teeth, echinoderm skeletal elements, sponge spicules (17.Lowenstam H.A.

Other molecules believed to be associated with the regulation of biomineralization, like the highly phosphorylated osteopontin from milk (24.Gericke A. Qin C. Spevak L. Fujimoto Y. Butler W.T. Sørensen E.S. Boskey A.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2005; 77: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain of dentin matrix protein 1 (25.Gajjeraman S. Narayanan K. Hao J. Qin C. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1193-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), have been shown to stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the transformation of amorphous phases to crystalline materials is an important aspect of the biological mineralization process (21.Beniash E. Aizenberg J. Addadi L. Weiner S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 461-465Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 26.Deshpande A.S. Beniash E. Cryst.

Our data show that, under the chosen experimental conditions, relatively large ACP particles initially form in the absence of protein and subsequently transform to randomly arranged apatitic crystal plates (Fig. 3A). Unlike P148, rP172 was found to only transiently stabilize ACP and its transformation to apatitic crystals. In comparison to these findings obtained under conditions of spontaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates, it has been reported (28.Aoba T. Fukae M. Tanabe T. Shimizu M. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that the 25-kDa full-length porcine amelogenin (i.e. P173) selectively adsorbs onto synthetic HA crystals and partially inhibits their growth when added to a metastable solution supersaturated with respect to HA. However, the 20-kDa P148 degradation product was found to adsorb substantially less onto HA crystals and did not significantly inhibit HA crystal growth. The lower affinity of P148 for HA crystals, compared with P173 and rP172, was subsequently demonstrated in another study (29.Moradian-Oldak J. Bouropoulos N. Wang L. Gharakhanian N. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In light of these reported results, our current findings suggest that P148 interacts more strongly with critical nuclei precursors and ACP than with mature HA crystals. Although the mechanism by which molecules stabilize amorphous phases is not well understood, structure-function studies (30.Schwartz S.S. Hay D.I. Schluckebier S.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31.Sikes C.S. Wheeler A.P. Chemical Aspects of Regulation of Mineralization. 1st Ed. University of South Alabama Publication Services, Mobile, AL1988Google Scholar, 32.Sikes C.S. Yeung M.L. Wheeler A.P. Surface Reactive Peptides and Polymers: Discovery and Commercialization. 1st Ed. American Chemical Society, Dallas, TX1991Crossref Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the propensity of a molecule to inhibit spontaneous (primary) precipitation of HA, as compared with seeded (secondary) HA crystal growth, can be related to specific structural domains within the molecule. In particular, it was shown (30.Schwartz S.S. Hay D.I. Schluckebier S.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that the ability of the salivary protein statherin to inhibit primary precipitation was mostly related to its hydrophobic C terminus, whereas its ability to inhibit secondary precipitation was related to the N-terminal hexapeptide containing two phosphoserines. The authors of this study proposed that, with respect to inhibition of primary precipitation, the highly charged N-terminal region interacts with the initially formed calcium phosphate nuclei and that the hydrophobic C terminus (presumably) oriented toward the aqueous solution would restrict the diffusion of mineral ions toward the forming crystal embryo (30.Schwartz S.S. Hay D.I. Schluckebier S.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on our present findings, a similar mechanism for the inhibition of calcium phosphate formation by P148 could be suggested, where the phosphorylated N-terminal region binds strongly to forming calcium phosphate nuclei and ACP, and their transformation to HA is inhibited, in part, due to the presence of a rather large predominantly hydrophobic C-terminal portion of the P148 molecule. Hence, one might predict that, as in the case of statherin, the subsequent removal of hydrophobic residues from the C terminus of amelogenin, as occurs in vivo, would reduce the observed inhibitory activity of native amelogenins. However, from the results obtained in the presence of the non-phosphorylated analog of P148, rP147, showing the formation of randomly oriented plate-like crystals similar to those found in the control, it is apparent that the affinity of rP147 for both ACP and forming apatitic crystals is relatively low. Based on these findings and those obtained showing that mineralization took place when the level of P148 phosphorylation (i.e. dephoso-P148), was reduced significantly, it is concluded that the inhibitory activity of P148 is primarily due to the single phosphate group on Ser-16 that results in a high affinity for forming crystal embryos and ACP. Despite the lack of the Ser-16 phosphate group, rP172, which contains the 25-amino acid hydrophilic C terminus, was found in the present study to interact with ACP transiently, stabilizing this mineral phase for relatively brief periods of time (<1 h) in comparison to P148, as well as with forming apatitic crystals as ACP transforms, affecting crystal shape and organization. In comparison to results obtained using rP147, showing no specific effect on mineral formation, these latter results indicate that the presence of the hydrophilic C terminus enhances amelogenin interactions with mineral phases, consistent with earlier findings (3.Beniash E. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28.Aoba T. Fukae M. Tanabe T. Shimizu M. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29.Moradian-Oldak J. Bouropoulos N. Wang L. Gharakhanian N. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33.Aoba T. Moreno E.C. Kresak M. Tanabe T. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Observed differences between rP147 and rP172 interactions with mineral phases, however, may also reflect differences in their self-assembly properties in addition to their differences in primary structure. In a recent study (4.Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we found that rP172 can form tightly connected elongated assemblies of small spheres with a high aspect ratio, whereas P148 formed loosely associated networks of larger spherical particles under similar conditions. This difference in protein assembly that was attributed to the absence of hydrophilic C terminus in P148 (4.Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) may also significantly affect protein-mineral interactions. Importantly, rP147 has been found to self-assemble in a manner similar to that observed for P148 (data not shown) and, consequently, also differs from rP172 in this respect. Unlike the results obtained using rP147, the full-length amelogenin rP172 was found to promote the formation of ordered arrays of needle-like apatitic crystals. This result is consistent with those obtained in our previous study (3.Beniash E. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using the full-length recombinant amelogenin (rM179) from mouse. This similarity is not surprising because the primary structure of rM179 is highly homologous with that of rP172, with nearly identical N- and C-terminal domains (1.Margolis H.C. Beniash E. Fowler C.E. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition, we found previously that both rM179 and rP172 self-assemble in a similar pH-dependent fashion to form either nanometer-sized particles (nanospheres) or chain-like structures composed of closely linked nanoparticles (4.Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, the present findings also demonstrate that the C-terminal domain that is present in rP172, and not in rP147, plays an important role in regulating the shape and organization of forming mineral crystals, under conditions where mineralization and protein assembly are induced simultaneously (3.Beniash E. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Of considerable interest, we have obtained TEM evidence (Fig. 3B, 45 min) showing that small nanoparticles (presumably ACP) align and form linear needle-like structures in the presence of rP172 (Fig. 3B), during the transformation of ACP particles to aligned bundles of apatitic crystals (1 day). This finding is consistent with a proposed hypothesis that initial enamel crystals form from the assembly and fusion of amorphous calcium phosphate particles (e.g. Ref. 34.Robinson C. J. Dent. Res. 2007; 86: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as supported by very recent findings (16.Beniash E. Metzler R.A. Lam R.S. Gilbert P.U. J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 166: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It has also been recently suggested that such assembly and fusion processes are facilitated by the presence of ACP (35.Tao J. Pan H. Zeng Y. Xu X. Tang R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 13410-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported (36.Fan Y. Sun Z. Wang R. Abbott C. Moradian-Oldak J. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that chain-like structures composed of amorphous nanoparticles, suggestive of the formation of ACP, were observed in solution in the presence of rP172 prior to the electrolytic deposition of crystalline calcium phosphate on a cathode surface. The identification of ACP in this study, however, was based solely on the lack of evidence of crystalline material using SAED. Experimental conditions used in this noted study also differed significantly from those used in the present study. In vitro studies are currently under way to explore the effect of the phosphorylation of Ser-16 on the self-assembly and function of the full-length porcine amelogenin. Finally, it should be noted that the present in vitro studies were carried out using amelogenin concentrations (0.2–2.0 mg/ml) that are below those found (12.Robinson C. Kirkham J. Hallsworth A.S. Arch. Oral Biol. 1988; 33: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38.Fukae M. The Proceedings of International Symposium of Oral Science.

Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Such factors must ultimately be considered with respect to the biological relevance of in vitro findings. Nevertheless, the protein structure-function relationships described here have provided important new insights into amelogenesis processes, under experimental conditions that yield mineral phases and patterns of crystal organization similar to those in developing enamel. In contrast to the results presented here using native and recombinant proteins, it has recently been reported (40.Wang L. Guan X.Y. Du C. Moradian-Oldak J. Nancollas G.H. J. Phys. Chem.

These studies were carried out in modestly supersaturated solutions that undergo spontaneous formation of HA in ∼700 h under near-physiological pH, temperature, and ionic strength conditions. However, at somewhat higher concentrations (65 μg/ml) the induction time was found to increase (relative to that observed at 6.5 μg/ml), and lesser amounts of HA precipitated (41.Tarasevich B.J.

Again, an acceleration of nucleation and crystal growth was not observed in the present study that was carried out at higher protein concentrations and under higher driving forces for precipitation where HA formation proceeded through the formation of ACP. The latter conditions used in the present study, however, may better reflect the in vivo situation, for the reasons already noted. Nevertheless, it is apparent that protein-mineral interactions with respect to the promotion and inhibition of crystal formation are highly dependent on environmental conditions (37.Aparicio S.

In conclusion, we have presented for the first time evidence that the single phosphate group found in native amelogenins can have a profound influence on the formation of calcium phosphates in vitro. Evidence obtained suggests that native proteolytic cleavage products like P148 may have a functional role during enamel formation. Moreover, we have provided new insights into the mechanism of crystal formation and the functional role of the highly conserved hydrophilic C terminus. Download .pdf (.62 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2038425961,"Background The conversion of soluble peptides and proteins into polymeric amyloid structures is a hallmark of many age-related degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes and a variety of systemic amyloidoses. We report here that amyloid formation is linked to another major age-related phenomenon − prostate tissue remodelling in middle-aged and elderly men. Methodology/Principal Findings By using multidisciplinary analysis of corpora amylacea inclusions in prostate glands of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer we have revealed that their major components are the amyloid forms of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins associated with numerous inflammatory conditions and types of cancer. In prostate protease rich environment the amyloids are stabilized by dystrophic calcification and lateral thickening. We have demonstrated that material closely resembling CA can be produced from S100A8/A9 in vitro under native and acidic conditions and shows the characters of amyloids. This process is facilitated by calcium or zinc, both of which are abundant in ex vivo inclusions. These observations were supported by computational analysis of the S100A8/A9 calcium-dependent aggregation propensity profiles. We found DNA and proteins from Escherichia coli in CA bodies, suggesting that their formation is likely to be associated with bacterial infection. CA inclusions were also accompanied by the activation of macrophages and by an increase in the concentration of S100A8/A9 in the surrounding tissues, indicating inflammatory reactions. Conclusions/Significance These findings, taken together, suggest a link between bacterial infection, inflammation and amyloid deposition of pro-inflammatory proteins S100A8/A9 in the prostate gland, such that a self-perpetuating cycle can be triggered and may increase the risk of malignancy in the ageing prostate. The results provide strong support for the prediction that the generic ability of polypeptide chains to convert into amyloids could lead to their involvement in an increasing number of otherwise apparently unrelated diseases, particularly those associated with ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2094794384,"Background Breast cancer is the most common neoplasia in women. Even though advances in its treatment have improved disease outcome, some patients relapse. Therefore, attempts to better define the molecular determinants that drive breast cancer cell proliferation may help in defining potential therapeutic targets. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play important roles in tumorigenesis. One of them, Erk5, has been linked to the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro. Here we have investigated the expression and prognostic value of Erk5 in human breast cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Animal and cellular models were used to study Erk5 expression and function in breast cancer. In 84 human breast tumours the expression of Erk5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Active Erk5 (pErk5) was studied by Western blotting. Correlation of Erk5 with clinicopathological parameters and with disease-free survival in early stage breast cancer patients was analyzed. Expression of Erk5 was detected in most patients, and overexpression was found in 20%. Active Erk5 was present in a substantial number of samples, as well as in tumours from an animal breast cancer model. Overexpression of Erk5 was associated with a decrease in disease-free survival time, which was independent of other clinicopathological parameters of prognosis. Transient transfection of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Erk5, and a stable cell line expressing a dominant negative form of Erk5 (Erk5AEF), were used to investigate the influence of Erk5 on drugs used in the clinic to treat breast tumours. We found that inhibition of Erk5 decreased cancer cell proliferation and also sensitized these cells to the action of anti-HER2 therapies. Conclusions/Significance Overexpression of Erk5 is an independent predictor of disease-free survival in breast cancer, and may represent a future therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2037685778,"Synaptic Tag Tagged Input-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for the reproducible activation of a specific neuronal assembly encoding a particular memory. The synaptic tagging hypothesis, which suggests how input specificity is maintained in late-phase synaptic plasticity, attempts to explain the persistence of long-term memory. However, it has been difficult to identify proteins that behave as the hypothesis predicts. Okada et al. (p. 904 ) investigated if the regulated spine entry of a late-phase-related somatically synthesized plasticity-related protein, Vesl-1S, works as a synaptic tag. Vesl-1S protein was carried from the soma to every dendrite and recruited into spines by synaptic activation in an input-specific manner. Spine entry was protein-synthesis independent, was NMDA receptor dependent, and had a persistent lifetime of activation. These results provide long-sought evidence for the input-specific capturing of a plasticity-related protein as postulated by the synaptic tagging hypothesis."

However, few studies have addressed the effects of DHA on both platelet reactivity and redox status in healthy subjects, and dose-related studies are scarce. The main objectives of the present study were to determine the effects of increasing doses of DHA on platelets and redox status in humans. Twelve healthy male volunteers (aged 53-65 yr) were assigned to consume an intake of successively 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mg/d DHA, as the only omega-3 fatty acid, for 2 wk each dose. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after each dose of DHA and at 8 wk after arrest of supplementation. DHA was incorporated in a dose-response fashion in platelet phospholipids. After supplementation with 400 and 800 mg/d DHA, platelet reactivity was significantly decreased. Platelet vitamin E concentration increased only after 200 mg/d DHA, while p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation decreased. Urinary isoprostane was also significantly lowered after 200 mg/d DHA but was increased after 1600 mg/d. Therefore, supplementation with only 200 mg/d DHA for 2 wk induced an antioxidant effect. It is concluded that low consumption of DHA could be an effective and nonpharmacological way to protect healthy men from platelet-related cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2040144923,"In a previous study, we have shown that human neural stem cells (hNSCs) transplanted in brain of mouse intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) stroke model selectively migrate to the ICH lesion and induce behavioral recovery. However, low survival rate of grafted hNSCs in the brain precludes long-term therapeutic effect. We hypothesized that hNSCs overexpressing Akt1 transplanted into the lesion site could provide long-term improved survival of hNSCs, and behavioral recovery in mouse ICH model. F3 hNSC was genetically modified with a mouse Akt1 gene using a retroviral vector. F3 hNSCs expressing Akt1 were found to be highly resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Following transplantation in ICH mouse brain, F3.Akt1 hNSCs induced behavioral improvement and significantly increased cell survival (50-100% increase) at 2 and 8 weeks post-transplantation as compared to parental F3 hNSCs. Brain transplantation of hNSCs overexpressing Akt1 in ICH animals provided functional recovery, and survival and differentiation of grafted hNSCs. These results indicate that the F3.Akt1 human NSCs should be a great value as a cellular source for the cellular therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders including ICH."

https://openalex.org/W2052798312,"We present a multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of the shallow water (high intertidal) barnacle genus Chthamalus, focusing on member species in the western hemisphere. Understanding the phylogeny of this group improves interpretation of classical ecological work on competition, distributional changes associated with climate change, and the morphological evolution of complex cirripede phenotypes.We use traditional and Bayesian phylogenetic and 'deep coalescent' approaches to identify a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of the mostly American 'fissus group' of Chthamalus, but that also supports a need for taxonomic revision of Chthamalus and Microeuraphia. Two deep phylogeographic breaks were also found within the range of two tropical American taxa (C. angustitergum and C. southwardorum) as well.Our data, which include two novel gene regions for phylogenetic analysis of cirripedes, suggest that much more evaluation of the morphological evolutionary history and taxonomy of Chthamalid barnacles is necessary. These data and associated analyses also indicate that the radiation of species in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene was very rapid, and may provide new insights toward speciation via transient allopatry or ecological barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2065231819,"Background Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) governs a number of physiologic and pathophysiological processes. Malignant ascites fluid is rich in LPA, and LPA receptors are aberrantly expressed by ovarian cancer cells, implicating LPA in the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. However, there is an absence of systematic data critically analyzing the transcriptional changes induced by LPA in ovarian cancer. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, gene expression profiling was used to examine LPA-mediated transcription by exogenously adding LPA to human epithelial ovarian cancer cells for 24 h to mimic long-term stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. The resultant transcriptional profile comprised a 39-gene signature that closely correlated to serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering of ovarian cancer patient specimens demonstrated that the signature is associated with worsened prognosis. Patients with LPA-signature-positive ovarian tumors have reduced disease-specific and progression-free survival times. They have a higher frequency of stage IIIc serous carcinoma and a greater proportion is deceased. Among the 39-gene signature, a group of seven genes associated with cell adhesion recapitulated the results. Out of those seven, claudin-1, an adhesion molecule and phenotypic epithelial marker, is the only independent biomarker of serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Knockdown of claudin-1 expression in ovarian cancer cells reduces LPA-mediated cellular adhesion, enhances suspended cells and reduces LPA-mediated migration. Conclusions The data suggest that transcriptional events mediated by LPA in the tumor microenvironment influence tumor progression through modulation of cell adhesion molecules like claudin-1 and, for the first time, report an LPA-mediated expression signature in ovarian cancer that predicts a worse prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2131328425,"Transcription is essential for neurite and axon outgrowth during development. Recent work points to the involvement of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the regulation of genes important for axon growth and guidance. However, NFAT has not been reported to directly control the transcription of axon outgrowth-related genes. To identify transcriptional targets, we performed an in silico promoter analysis and found a putative NFAT site within the GAP-43 promoter. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that NFAT-3 regulates GAP-43, but unexpectedly, does not promote but represses the expression of GAP-43 in neurons and in the developing brain. Specifically, in neuron-like PC-12 cells and in cultured cortical neurons, the overexpression of NFAT-3 represses GAP-43 activation mediated by neurotrophin signaling. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we also show that prior to neurotrophin activation, endogenous NFAT-3 occupies the GAP-43 promoter in PC-12 cells, in cultured neurons, and in the mouse brain. Finally, we observe that NFAT-3 is required to repress the physiological expression of GAP-43 and other pro-axon outgrowth genes in specific developmental windows in the mouse brain. Taken together, our data reveal an unexpected role for NFAT-3 as a direct transcriptional repressor of GAP-43 expression and suggest a more general role for NFAT-3 in the control of the neuronal outgrowth program."
https://openalex.org/W2082258707,"Protoplanetary disks, the clouds of interstellar gas and dust thought to be the precursors of solar systems, ours included, consist largely of amorphous grains of silicate. Yet the grains found in comets and meteorites (representing the early Solar System), and traced in the spectra of young stars, include large crystalline grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures above 1,000 K, despite being surrounded by material that has never experienced such heating. This apparent anomaly has been the subject of much discussion and theorizing. Two papers published in this issue add to the discussion. Ábrahám et al. report mid-infrared features in the outburst spectrum of the young solar-like star EX Lupi that they attribute to crystalline forsterite. These features were not present before EX Lupi's recent outbust, so this may be the first direct observation of the crystal formation process in a celestial object. Annealing by heat from a stellar outburst is a crystal source not previously considered for protoplanetary disks. Dejan Vinković suggests another new mechanism that might produce crystals: infrared light arising from a protoplanetary disk can in theory lift grains bigger than 1 μm out of the inner disk, where they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure while gliding above the disk. Grains re-enter the disk at radii where it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation-pressure support for a given grain size and solid density. Dusty disks around young stars are formed out of interstellar dust that consists of amorphous submicrometre grains. Yet the grains found in comets, meteorites and traced in the spectra of young stars include big crystalline grains in environments considered too cold for crystallinity to occur. Here it is shown that infrared light arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of the hot inner disk, whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure. Dusty disks around young stars are formed out of interstellar dust that consists of amorphous, submicrometre grains. Yet the grains found in comets1 and meteorites2, and traced in the spectra of young stars3, include large crystalline grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K, even though they are mixed with surrounding material that never experienced temperatures as high as that4. This prompted theories of large-scale mixing capable of transporting thermally altered grains from the inner, hot part of accretion disks to outer, colder disk regions5,6,7, but all have assumptions that may be problematic8,9,10,11,12. Here I report that infrared radiation arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of the inner disk, whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure while gliding above the disk. Grains re-enter the disk at radii where it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation-pressure support for a given grain size and solid density. Properties of the observed disks suggest that this process might be active in almost all young stellar objects and young brown dwarfs."
https://openalex.org/W2047078943,"T cell factor 4 (TCF4) interacts with beta-catenin in the WNT signaling pathway and transactivates downstream target genes involved in cancer progression. To identify proteins that regulate TCF4-mediated biological responses, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for a TCF4-binding protein(s) and found that MAD2B interacts with TCF4. We confirmed that MAD2B is a TCF4-binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation. Using the TOPFLASH reporter assay, we found that MAD2B blocks TCF4-mediated transactivation. The MAD2B binding regions of TCF4 were identified by TCF4 deletion mapping and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis. TCF4 and MAD2B interactions abolished the DNA binding ability of TCF4. Knockdown of MAD2B in SW480 colorectal cancer cells led to the conversion of epithelial cells to a mesenchymal fibroblastoid phenotype (epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation). An E-cadherin promoter reporter analysis showed that MAD2B modulates TCF4-mediated E-cadherin expression. MAD2B knockdown blocked E-cadherin expression and significantly induced mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and vimentin. Mesenchymal induction was accompanied by F-actin redistribution and the appearance of a fibroblastoid phenotype. MAD2B knockdown also increased both mRNA and protein levels of Slug, a known TCF4-induced E-cadherin transcriptional repressor. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that MAD2B silencing enhances the ability of TCF4 to bind the Slug promoter. Thus, MAD2B is a novel TCF4-interacting protein. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of MAD2B in TCF4-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2029054802,"A pre-requisite for bacterial pathogenesis is the successful interaction of a pathogen with a host. One mechanism used by a broad range of Gram negative bacterial pathogens is to deliver effector proteins directly into host cells through a dedicated type III secretion system where they modulate host cell function. The cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) family of effector proteins, identified in a growing number of pathogens that harbour functional type III secretion systems and have a wide host range, arrest the eukaryotic cell cycle. Here, the crystal structures of Cifs from the insect pathogen/nematode symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens (a γ-proteobacterium) and human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei (a β-proteobacterium) are presented. Both of these proteins adopt an overall fold similar to the papain sub-family of cysteine proteases, as originally identified in the structure of a truncated form of Cif from Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), despite sharing only limited sequence identity. The structure of an N-terminal region, referred to here as the ‘tail-domain’ (absent in the EPEC Cif structure), suggests a surface likely to be involved in host-cell substrate recognition. The conformation of the Cys-His-Gln catalytic triad is retained, and the essential cysteine is exposed to solvent and addressable by small molecule reagents. These structures and biochemical work contribute to the rapidly expanding literature on Cifs, and direct further studies to better understand the molecular details of the activity of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2073658602,"Distinctive features of aspartyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (AspRS) from the protozoan Plasmodium genus are described. These apicomplexan AspRSs contain 29-31 amino acid insertions in their anticodon binding domains, a remarkably long N-terminal appendix that varies in size from 110 to 165 amino acids and two potential initiation codons. This article focuses on the atypical functional and structural properties of Plasmodium falciparum cytosolic AspRS, the causative parasite of human malaria. This species encodes a 626 or 577 amino acids AspRS depending on whether initiation starts on the first or second in-frame initiation codon. The longer protein has poor solubility and a propensity to aggregate. Production of the short version was favored as shown by the comparison of the recombinant protein with endogenous AspRS. Comparison of the tRNA aminoacylation activity of wild-type and mutant parasite AspRSs with those of yeast and human AspRSs revealed unique properties. The N-terminal extension contains a motif that provides unexpectedly strong RNA binding to plasmodial AspRS. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated the requirement of the plasmodial insertion for AspRS dimerization and, therefore, tRNA aminoacylation and other putative functions. Implications for the parasite biology are proposed. These data provide a robust background for unraveling the precise functional properties of the parasite AspRS and for developing novel lead compounds against malaria, targeting its idiosyncratic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2036331552,"Ubiquitin-like modifications regulate nearly every aspect of cellular functions. A key step in these modifications is the recognition of the carrier enzyme (E2) by the activating enzyme (E1). In this study, we have found that a critical E2-binding surface on the E1 of the small ubiquitin-like modifier has unusually high populations in both ordered and disordered states. Upon binding the E2, the disordered state is converted to the ordered state, which resembles the structure of the bound conformation, providing a mechanism to resolve the ""Levinthal Paradox"" search problem in a folding-upon-binding process. The significance of the folding-unfolding equilibrium is shown by the loss of functions of the mutations that shift the equilibrium to the folded state. This study highlights the importance of conformational flexibility in the molecular recognition event."
https://openalex.org/W2074103980,"In the mammal, the pluripotent cells of embryo differentiate and commit to either the mesoderm/endoderm lineages or the ectoderm lineage during gastrulation. In culture, the ability to direct lineage choice from pluripotent cells into the mesoderm/endoderm or ectoderm lineages will enable the development of technologies for the formation of highly enriched or homogenous populations of cells. Here we show that manipulation of cell:cell contact and a mesoderm suppressing activity in culture affects the outcome of pluripotent cell differentiation and when both variables are manipulated appropriately they can direct differentiation to either the mesoderm or ectoderm lineage. The disruption of cell:cell contacts and removal of a mesoderm suppressor activity results in the differentiation of pluripotent, primitive ectoderm-like cells to the mesoderm lineage, while maintenance of cell:cell contacts and inclusion, within the culture medium, of a mesoderm suppressing activity results in the formation of near homogenous populations of ectoderm. Understanding the contribution of these variables in lineage choice provides a framework for the development of directed differentiation protocols that result in the formation of specific cell populations from pluripotent cells in culture."

Proposed NIH funding rules are retroactive. Legal history and ethical analysis show why there should be a strong presumption that such new rules should be only prospective, in any area of scientific research. Science often progresses faster than regulation, and retroactive ethically linked rules have been a persistent issue in stem cell research. Proposed NIH funding rules are retroactive. Legal history and ethical analysis show why there should be a strong presumption that such new rules should be only prospective, in any area of scientific research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has just proposed draft embryonic stem cell (ESC) funding rules that, if adopted following an open comment period, few existing cell lines would meet. This constraint is due to new, specific mandates for informed consent. The proposed rules do not explicitly provide research funding for existing so-called Presidential ESC lines fundable under President George W. Bush, although some of these lines may yet be eligible under the current drafted regulations. Existing NIH grants are also not protected, raising the possibility that ongoing experiments must be interrupted, and new cell lines developed, for current research to continue. Nor do the proposed rules promise funding to the many ESC cell lines derived after 2001 according to ethical protocols approved by institutional review boards (IRBs), operating under federal regulations. Furthermore, funding for cell lines derived according to the so-called “NAS guidelines” (Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research Council, 2005Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research CouncilGuidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.2005Google Scholar) or the “ISSCR guidelines” (Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Task Force, International Society for Stem Cell Research, 2006Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Task Force, International Society for Stem Cell ResearchGuidelines for human embryonic stem cell research. International Society for Stem Cell Research, Chicago, IL2006Google Scholar) will also be in jeopardy based on the proposed NIH requirements for consent documentation. The NAS and ISSCR guidelines were developed after extensive multidisciplinary deliberation, and public consultation over several years. The resulting guidelines are considered models of self-regulation, and they have been adopted widely across the global research community. Existing IRB reviews and the established guidelines ought, therefore, to be given significant weight when assessing the ethical provenance of an ESC line. Prospectively applied, the proposed NIH rules as they stand would present a challenge to the field. But retroactively applied, the draft regulations would create a tectonic shift: previously, only certain old lines were fundable, and now—conceivably—only certain new lines will be, and there will continue to be no federal funding available for research using cells created ethically since 2001. Important research will need to be repeated, and assays and data rebuilt. As currently outlined, it's as if the last 8 years of cell line creation and ethical self-regulation have just vanished, to be replaced by a new funding structure that does not give weight to the existing science, ethics, self-regulation, donor intentions, or diverse cell lines. Resolving this situation is critically important for stem cell research. But the broader principle—should government guidance be retroactive?—is vital for all areas of scientific research."
