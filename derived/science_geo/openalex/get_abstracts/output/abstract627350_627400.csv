https://openalex.org/W2914647662,"Background Nowadays, heart failure (HF) related morbidity and mortality rate is increasing globally. Younger populations happen to be more affected by HF in sub- Saharan African than the western countries. Even though medications, low sodium diet, regular exercise, and weight monitoring are essential to control heart failure symptoms and its exacerbation, poor adherence to these self-care recommendations is contributing to an increased in hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to assess heart failure patients’ adherence to self-care recommendations and its associated factors. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 310 adult heart failure patients attending Gondar University referral hospital from February to May 2017. The participants were selected by systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected through face to face interview and from the patients’ medical records. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. A binary logistic regression model was used to check the effect of different factors on the patients’ adherence level. Results Of 310 study participants only 22.3% (95% CI, 17.4%-26.8%) of heart failure patients reported good adherence to their self-care recommendations. Adherence to self-care recommendation was positively associated with being male in gender (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.18–4.62), good level of heart failure knowledge (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.276–4.856) and free from chronic comorbid diseases (AOR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14). Conclusion Overall, heart failure patients’ adherence to self-care recommendations is poor and selective. Being male in gender, had no chronic comorbidity, and a good level of heart failure knowledge were positively associated with adherence to self-care recommendations. It is therefore strategic to plan improving heart failure patients’ knowledge about heart failure signs, symptoms and its management approaches, to improve the patients’ adherence level."
https://openalex.org/W2911875127,"The use of subtle features as species diagnostic traits in taxa with high morphological similarity sometimes fails in discriminating intraspecific variation from interspecific differences, leading to an incorrect species delimitation. A clear assessment of species boundaries is particularly relevant in disease vector organisms in order to understand epidemiological and evolutionary processes that affect transmission capacity. Here, we assess the validity of the recently described Rhodnius taquarussuensis (da Rosa et al., 2017) using interspecific crosses and molecular markers. We did not detect differences in hatching rates in interspecific crosses between R. taquarussuensis and R. neglectus (Lent, 1954). Furthermore, genetic divergence and species delimitation analyses show that R. taquarussuensis is not an independent lineage in the R. prolixus group. These results suggest that R. taquarussuensis is a phenotypic form of R. neglectus instead of a distinct species. We would like to stress that different sources of evidence are needed to correctly delimit species. We consider this is an important step in understanding vectorial Chagas disease spread and transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2913787865,"Objective The aim of this study was to examine the trend in socioeconomic inequalities in child undernutrition in Nigeria. Methods The study analysed cross-sectional data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2003 to 2013. The outcome variables were stunting, wasting and underweight among children under-five years. The magnitude of child undernutrition in Nigeria was estimated via a concentration index, and the socioeconomic factors contributing to child undernutrition over time were determined using the decomposition method. Results The concentration index showed an increase in childhood wasting and underweight in Nigeria over time. The socioeconomic factors contributing to the increase in child undernutrition were: child’s age (0–23 months), maternal education (no education), household wealth index (poorest household), type of residence (rural) and geopolitical zone (North East, North West). Conclusions To address child undernutrition, there is a need to improve maternal education and adopt effective social protection policies especially in rural communities in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2911979140,"Fatigue-related impairments in the nursing workforce contribute to a multitude of health, safety, and economic consequences at the individual, organizational and societal levels. Long and compressed work schedules are commonly worked in the healthcare industry, but more research is needed to understand the cumulative effects of multiple work shifts on physiology-based performance outcomes in nurses. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a single nursing work shift versus three compressed (one every 24 hours) 12 hour shifts on performance-based fatigue in nurses and aides. Twenty-six fulltime hospital working nurses and aides (age = 36.1 ± 13.3 years) reported to the lab for testing before, immediately after working a single 12 hour shift, and after working three 12 hour shifts in a 72 hour period. Outcome measures included vigilance-based reaction time, lapses of attention, and muscle function assessments (lower and upper body muscle strength, explosive strength and vertical jump performance). All variables except hand grip strength showed a significant decline following the three work shifts. The psychomotor vigilance reaction time and lapses of attention variables also generally showed a significant decline from the end of shift one to the end of shift three, indicting an accumulation of fatigue in these metrics with increasing number of shifts worked. Muscle function variables responded early in the duty cycle, showing a significant decline after a single work shift, but did no further decline by the end of the third shift. These findings use objective measures to substantiate that fatigue impairments occur from working a single 12 hour shift, and in several instances, increase further with more successive work shifts. Caution should be employed by personnel and administrators with work schedules involving multiple compressed 12 hour shifts. Fatigue management strategies may be used to improve risks and consequences from fatigue-related mishaps, and this study reports several variables that appear sensitive to identifying and tracking fatigue in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2912387698,"Purpose The study objective was to compare the prognostic value of interim and end-of-treatment FDG PET/CT using five therapeutic evaluation criteria in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods 181 patients were retrospectively analysed. All patients underwent FDG-PET at baseline and after four cycles (iPET4) of first-line chemotherapy and 165 at the end-of-treatment (PET-eot). Ratio Deauville score (rDS) (SUVmax-target residual lesion/SUVmax-liver) was measured in iPET4 and PET-eot, and its optimal threshold was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Deauville score (DS) (iPET4 and PET-eot), ΔSUVmax, ΔSUVmax determined according to Menton 2011 criteria (ΔSUVmax+DS) and ΔSUVmax+rDS were also evaluated (iPET4 only). Median follow-up was 44 months. Results ROC analysis revealed the optimal cut-off value was 1.4-fold of SUVmax-liver on iPET4 and PET-eot. On iPET4, positive predictive value (PPV) of rDS was significantly better than DS: 81.58% vs. 67.79%. In univariate analysis, the five interpretation methods were statistically significant (p<0.0001 for progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). In multivariate analysis, only rDS was an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.0002 and p<0.0001 for PFS and OS, respectively). On PET-eot, similarly, the two therapeutic evaluation criteria analysed (rDS and DS) were statistically significant at the univariate level (p<0.0001). rDS was the only significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (p<0.0001). PPV and accuracy of rDS were also better than DS. Conclusions rDS with a tumor/liver ratio of 1.4 is a robust prognostic factor in patients with DLBCL on iPET4 and PET-eot."
https://openalex.org/W2913428372,"Reports using computed tomography (CT) to estimate thigh skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and mean muscle attenuation are often difficult to evaluate due to inconsistent methods of quantification and/or poorly described analysis methods. This CT tutorial provides step-by-step instructions in using free, NIH Image J software to quantify both muscle size and composition in the mid-thigh, which was validated against a robust commercially available software, SliceOmatic. CT scans of the mid-thigh were analyzed from 101 healthy individuals aged 65 and older. Mean cross-sectional area and mean attenuation values are presented across seven defined Hounsfield unit (HU) ranges along with the percent contribution of each region to the total mid-thigh area. Inter-software correlation coefficients ranged from R2 = 0.92-0.99 for all specific area comparisons measured using the Image J method compared to SliceOmatic. We recommend reporting individual HU ranges for all areas measured. Although HU range 0-100 includes the majority of skeletal muscle area, HU range -29 to 150 appears to be the most inclusive for quantifying total thigh muscle. Reporting all HU ranges is necessary to determine the relative contribution of each, as they may be differentially affected by age, obesity, disease, and exercise. This standardized operating procedure will facilitate consistency among investigators reporting computed tomography characteristics of the thigh on single slice images.

https://openalex.org/W2914739067,"Background Violence by mothers-in-law, as well as husbands, is a recognised problem in many countries. It has been given little attention in research on violence and its importance as a health problem, and aggravator of husband violence, has not been well established. Our aim was to describe patterns and the frequency of mother-in-law and sibling-in-law/sibling physical violence in relation to physical violence from husbands, and to describe risk characteristics and associated health behaviours of women with different abuse exposures. Methods 1,463 women aged 18–48 were recruited into a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a women empowerment intervention in 6 villages of Kabul and Nangarhar provinces. The women were interviewed at baseline. The analysis uses bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression. Results 932 of the women were currently married. Of these, 14% of women experienced mother-in-law physical violence and 23.2% of women experienced physical spousal violence in the previous 12 months. For 7.0% of women, these exposures were combined. Physical violence was associated with food insecurity and having to borrow for food, being in a polygamous marriage, living with their mother-in-law, as well as province of residence (higher in Nangarhar). Women who had earnings were relatively protected. Whilst most mothers-in-law were described in positive terms, those who used physical violence were much less likely to be described so and a quarter were described as very strict and controlling and 16.8% as cruel. Overall slightly more women described their husband in positive terms than their mother-in-law, but there was a very strong correlation between the way in which husbands were perceived and the violence of their mothers. Women’s mental health (depression, suicidal thoughts and PTSD symptoms score), self-rated general health, disability and beating of their children were all strongly associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure. The strength of the association was much greater for all of these problems if the IPV was combined with physical violence from a mother-in-law or sibling-in-law/sibling. Experienced alone, violence from the mother-in-law or a sibling-in-law/sibling was associated with an elevated risk of all of these problems except depression. Interpretation Mother-in-law and sibling-in-law/sibling physical violence is an appreciable problem among the women studied in Afghanistan, linked to poverty. It has a major impact on women’s health, componding the heath impact of IPV. In this setting conceptualising women’s risk and exposure to violence at home as only in terms of IPV is inadequate and the framing of domestic violence much more appropriately captures women’s risks and exposures. We suggest that it may be fruitful for many women to target violence prevention at the domestic unit rather than just at women and their husbands."
https://openalex.org/W2911780684,"A single focus optical tweezer is formed when a laser beam is launched through a high numerical aperture immersion objective. This objective focuses the beam down to a diffraction-limited spot, which creates an optical trap where cells suspended in aqueous solutions can be held fixed. Spermatozoa, an often probative cell type in forensic investigations, can be captured inside this optical trap and dragged one by one across millimeter-length distances in order to create a cluster of cells which can be subsequently drawn up into a capillary for collection. Sperm cells are then ejected onto a sterile cover slip, counted, and transferred to a tube for DNA analysis workflow. The objective of this research was to optimize sperm cell collection for maximum DNA yield, and to determine the number of trapped sperm cells necessary to produce a full STR profile. A varying number of sperm cells from both a single-source semen sample and a mock sexual assault sample were isolated utilizing optical tweezers and processed using conventional STR analysis methods. Results demonstrated that approximately 50 trapped spermatozoa were required to obtain a consistently full DNA profile. A complete, single-source DNA profile was also achieved by isolating sperm cells via optical trapping from a mixture of sperm and vaginal epithelial cells. Based on these results, optical tweezers are a viable option for forensic applications such as separation of mixed populations of cells in forensic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2914444126,"Psychiatric comorbidities are common in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we sought to evaluate the effects of medication and childhood ADHD subtypes on psychiatric comorbidities among adults with ADHD as compared to healthy adult controls. We assessed 121 drug-naïve adults with ADHD, 93 treated adults with ADHD, and 145 healthy controls (age 18–36 years) using semi-structured psychiatric interviews, intelligence tests, and medical records. Drug-naïve adults with ADHD had more comorbidities than treated adults with ADHD and controls. Childhood ADHD-combined subtype, relative to ADHD-inattentive subtype, was associated with higher risks of comorbidities. Current medication treatment was associate with a higher risk for anxiety disorders, and longer treatment duration was associated with lower risks of mood disorders and sleep disorders. Our results indicate that no medication treatment, short treatment duration, and childhood ADHD-combined subtype are associated with increased risks for psychiatric comorbidities among adults with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2914966604,"The termination of cover crops in conventional no-till systems is mostly conducted mechanically in combination with herbicides. Combining flaming and roller crimpers could be a viable solution to avoid using herbicides for cover crop termination in farming systems where herbicides are banned, or at least to reduce their use in an integrated management approach. This research tested the effects of flaming used in combination with three different types of roller crimpers to terminate a fall-sown cover crop mixture of winter pea and barley. The cover crop termination rate was visually assessed in terms of percentage of green cover provided by cover crop plants at different intervals from the termination date, and estimated using a log-logistic non-linear regression model with four parameters. Machine performance data are also reported. The results show that, irrespective of the roller type, flaming significantly boosted the effect of the roller crimpers. In fact, an economic threshold for cover crop suppression of 85% was reached only when the rollers were used in combination with flaming. Nevertheless, none of the methods were able to reach the 100% of cover crop suppression. In some case, the combined use of flaming and roller crimpers allowed reaching the 90% of cover crop devitalisation, which happened six weeks after the termination date. More importantly, the use of flaming in combination with rollers shortened the time needed to achieve the estimated levels of devitalisation, compared with the rollers used alone. We conclude that flaming is an effective tool to increase the effectiveness of roller crimpers. Nevertheless, further research is needed to identify solutions to overcome the barrier of the high operational costs of flaming, which is constraining its wider adoption by farmers. Future studies could focus, for instance, on the development of a new prototype of combined machine for crimping and flaming the cover crops simultaneously, which could potentially reduce the operational costs."
https://openalex.org/W2914258303,"Interoception refers to the detection and perception of signals from the inner body. Deficits in this domain have been linked to psychopathologies, prompting the search for strategies to improve this ability. Preliminary studies have shown that interoception could be enhanced through the manipulation of subjective feelings of power. We tested the effects of adopting powerful postures on different facets of interoception. Firstly, we measured the impact of a single power posing session on interoceptive ability in 41 healthy females. Then, the same participants were randomly assigned to two conditions (daily power posing practice vs. no practice). After one week the conditions alternated. Interoceptive accuracy, measured by the heartbeat tracking task, interoceptive sensibility, measured by the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) and confidence ratings, as well as subjective feelings of power were assessed at baseline, after a single power posing session and after one week of training. A single power posing session significantly increased individuals' interoceptive accuracy. Also, power posing reduced individuals' scores on the BPQ after one week of daily practice and increased subjective feelings of power after one session and one week of daily practice. These findings suggest that adopting powerful postures has the potential to increase interoceptive accuracy, as well as subjective feelings of power, and to reduce interoceptive sensibility, measured by questionnaire."
https://openalex.org/W2914858138,"The evolutionary success of insects is arguably due to their ability to build up a complex, highly-adaptable and very effective defense system against numerous pathogens, including entomopathogenic fungi. This system relies on the humoral immune system and cellular defense reactions. The first line of defense against biological pathogens is a cuticle formed of several layers. The cuticular lipids may contain hydrocarbons, free fatty acids (FFA), alcohols, waxes, glycerides, aldehydes and sterols. Cuticular fatty acids may also play a role in defending against fungal invasion. Our present findings show that the diet of insects can have a significant effect on their sensitivity and defense response to pathogens; for example, while G. mellonella larvae fed on beeswax had a similar appearance to those reared on a semi-artificial diet, they possessed a different cuticular free fatty acid (FFA) profile to those fed on a semi-artificial diet, and were less sensitive to Conidiobolus coronatus infection. It is possible that the presence of heneicosenoic acid (C21:1) and other long-chain free fatty acids (C22:0, C24:0, C26:0), as well as Brevibacillus laterosporus bacteria, on the cuticle of larvae fed on beeswax, plays a protective role against fungal invasion. Insect pests represent a global problem. An understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying the fungal infection of insects might provide a clearer insight into their defenses, thus allowing the design of more effective, and environmentally-friendly, means of controlling them. The greater wax moth is an excellent model for the study of immunology resistance. Knowledge of the influence of diet on pathogen resistance in insects can be also useful for creating a model of human diseases caused by pathogens, such as Candia albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2765678166,"Background Open Payments is a United States federal program mandating reporting of medical industry payments to physicians, increasing transparency of physician conflicts of interest (COI). Study objectives were to assess industry payments to physician-editors, and to compare their financial COI rate to all physicians within the specialty. Methods and findings We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, reviewing Open Payments from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. We reviewed general payments (“… not made in connection with a research agreement”) and research funding to “top tier” physician-editors of highly-cited medical journals. We compared payments to physician-editors and physicians-by-specialty. In 35 journals, 333 (74.5%) of 447 “top tier” US-based editors met inclusion criteria. Of these, 212 (63.7%) received industry-associated payments in the study period. In an average year, 141 (42.3%) of physician-editors received any direct payments to themselves including general payments and research payments, 66 (19.8%) received direct payments >$5,000 (National Institutes of Health threshold for a Significant Financial Interest) and 51 (15.3%) received >$10,000. Mean annual general payments to physician-editors was $55,157 (median 3,512, standard deviation 561,885, range 10–10,981,153). Median general payments to physician-editors were mostly higher compared to all physicians within their specialty. Mean annual direct research payment to the physician-editor was $14,558 (median 4,000, range 15–174,440). Mean annual indirect research funding to the physician-editor’s institution (highly valued by academic leaders such as departmental chairs and deans) was $175,282 (median 49,107, range 0.18–5,000,000). The main study limitation was difficulty identifying physician-editors primarily responsible for making manuscript decisions. Conclusions A substantial minority of physician-editors receive payments from industry within any given year, sometimes quite large. Most editors received payment of some kind during the four-year study period. Given the extent of editors’ influences on the medical literature, more robust and accessible editor financial COI declarations are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2912469143,"Background Recurrent bleeding is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Antifibrinolytic therapy is known to reduce recurrent bleeding, however, its beneficial effect on outcome remains unclear. The effect of treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) until aneurysm treatment on clinical outcome is evaluated. Methods Patients with an aSAH from two high-volume tertiary referral treatment centers in the Netherlands, Academic Medical Center (AMC) and Radboud University Medical Center (RUMC), between January 2012 and December 2015 were included. Patients were classified into one of two groups; standard treatment or TXA treatment. Demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital complications and clinical outcome were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for the influence of treatment center and baseline differences. Results Standard treatment was given in 509 patients, and 119 patients received additional TXA therapy before aneurysm occlusion. Patients treated with TXA did not experience less recurrent bleeding adjusted or unadjusted for treatment center (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.37–1.73). In-hospital mortality, was significantly lower in the TXA group than the standard care group (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20–0.85). Poor outcome (mRS 4–6) assessed after six months was not different between treatment groups (aOR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.64–1.74). Conclusions Pooled data from two high-volume treatment centers did not show improved clinical outcome after additional TXA treatment in aSAH patients. However, TXA treatment was associated with a decrease in mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2913019330,"Background Nationwide and regional interventions can help improve bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) awareness, knowledge, and the willingness. Periodic community investigation will help monitor the effect. This study aimed to compare the experience of CPR education, CPR knowledge, and CPR willingness, during a 5-year interval. Methods This is a pre and post study. Two surveys were done in February 2012 and December 2016. National and regional intervention including legislation promoting public involvement, standardizing CPR education programs, training CPR instructors, and installing supporting organizations were done at the period. In both surveys, respondents were selected via quota sampling in Daegu Metropolitan City and answered the survey through face-to-face interview. Respondents’ general demographic characteristics, CPR educational experience, CPR knowledge and CPR willingness were questioned. Results Total of 2141 respondents (1000 in 2012, 1141 in 2016) were selected. The percentage of respondents who received CPR education itself and recent education were higher after intervention compared to before intervention (36.2% vs. 55.1%, 16.9% vs. 30.1%, respectively). Correct knowledge of performing CPR seems to be improved overall (1.6% vs. 11.7%, odd ratio 14.28, 95% confidence interval 5.68–35.94). However, less respondents were willing to perform CPR on strangers (54.5% vs 35.0%). Conclusion Nationwide and regional interventions to promote bystander CPR and CPR education were associated with increased CPR education experience and improved correct CPR knowledge in performing bystander CPR. Willingness to perform bystander CPR on family did not increase significantly and CPR willingness to strangers was decreased. Additional legal and technological measures should be implemented to promote bystander CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2914584086,"Purpose Exophthalmometry is a common examination in ophthalmology. For example it is relevant for diagnosis or follow-up of thyroid eye disease. However, exophthalmometry is affected by several factors such as ethnicity, sex and age. The purpose of this study was to determine the globe position by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate its correlates among the general Northeast German adult population. Methods A total of 3030 subjects aged between 20 and 89 from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) underwent a standardised whole-body MRI. Axial length and globe position were determined in axial T1-weighted images of the orbit. The image had to include the corneal apex as well as the optic nerve head. Study participants were excluded from imaging analysis if there was no plane available that included both structures. Further exclusion criterion was a lateral deviation of the subject’s viewing direction. Images with inadequate quality due to motion artefacts or other technical reasons were excluded as well. Globe position was defined as the perpendicular distance between the interzygomatic line and the posterior surface of the cornea (exophthalmometric value). The distance between the posterior surface of the cornea and the posterior pole of the eyeball, at the boundary with orbital fat, was defined as axial length. We used posterior surface of the cornea for our measurements, because it seemed to be less vulnerable for motion artefacts than the anterior one. Moreover body measurements including body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences were determined. Associations between anthropometric measurements with exophthalmometric outcomes were analysed by linear regressions adjusted for age and stratified by sex. P-values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. To assess intra-reader variability intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed for repeated measurements of the MRI scans of 25 subjects. Results After considering the exclusion criteria 1926 evaluable subjects remained. There was no significant difference between means of right and left eyes. The mean exophthalmometric value was significantly higher in men (16.5 +/- 2.2 mm) than in women (15.3 +/- 2.1 mm). The mean MRI-axial length was 23.4 +/- 0.8 mm for men and 22.8 +/- 0.9 mm for women. BMI, waist and hip circumferences were positively correlated with exophthalmometric value (p<0.001). Difference of mean MRI-based exophthalmometric value for obese subjects (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and non-overweight (BMI <25 kg/m2) was 2.1 mm for men and 1.6 mm for women. ICC between 0.97 and 0.99 indicate excellent repeatability of our method. Conclusion We conclude that MRI-based exophthalmometric values are positively correlated with BMI, waist- and hip-circumference among the general Northeast German adult population. This association is independent from age and axial length. Consequently bodyweight of patients should be regarded to interpret exophthalmometric values correctly. MRI-exophthalmometry seems to be a suitable method to determine globe position. Considering the large number of study participants, exophthalmometric values of our study could be used as comparative values for exophthalmometry of people of Western European descent in future."
https://openalex.org/W2913835537,"Background The transverse facial artery (TFA) perfuses the lateral face. Knowledge of topographical anatomy of the lateral face is crucial for safe procedural performance in aesthetic and plastic surgery, especially the face lift flap and face transplant. The aim of the present study was to assess detailed TFA morphometrical features. Patients and methods One-hundred computed tomography head angiographies were analyzed. TFA numbers and origins were recorded bilaterally (200 cases). TFA diameters and lengths in addition to their positions in relation to neighboring vessels and the zygomatic arches were measured. Results TFA was present in 96% of cases (192/200, left = 97, right = 95). A single TFA was present in 95.3% and double TFAs were present in 4.7% of cases. In 91.7%, the TFA originated from the superficial temporal artery, and in 3.1%, it originated from the external carotid artery. One left TFA originated from the maxillary artery. The TFA was significantly longer on the right than on the left side (56.6±26.0 versus 47.3±22.2 mm; p = 0.03). The TFA mean diameter was 1.0±0.4 mm (range: 0.4–2.2 mm) with no difference between face sides. TFA length correlated with its diameter (r = 0.46, p <0.05). The TFA always originated below the zygomatic arch, and it should be found in the 8.8 mm wide area beginning 17.0mm below the lower border of the zygomatic arch. Conclusions The TFA has a significant role in lateral face vascularization, and absence of this vessel is very uncommon."
https://openalex.org/W2914416364,"This paper examines the association between health facility quality, subjective perceptions, and utilization of obstetric care. We draw on unique survey data from Nigeria describing the quality of care at rural primary health care facilities and the utilization of obstetric care by households in the service areas of these facilities. Constructing a quality index using the detailed survey data, we show that facility quality is positively related to perceptions of quality and utilization. Disaggregating quality into structural, process and outcome dimensions, we find a consistently strong relationship only between utilization and structural measures of quality. The results suggest that efforts to improve quality may involve a trade-off between investing in dimensions that are more easily observed by households, which will influence utilization, and investing in dimensions that are more closely related to outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2912201061,"Some activities can be meaningfully dichotomised as ‘cognitive’ or ‘sensorimotor’ in nature—but many cannot. This has radical implications for understanding activity limitation in disability. For example, older adults take longer to learn the serial order of a complex sequence but also exhibit slower, more variable and inaccurate motor performance. So is their impaired skill acquisition a cognitive or motor deficit? We modelled sequence learning as a process involving a limited capacity buffer (working memory), where reduced performance restricts the number of elements that can be stored. To test this model, we examined the relationship between motor performance and sequence learning. Experiment 1 established that older adults were worse at learning the serial order of a complex sequence. Experiment 2 found that participants showed impaired sequence learning when the non-preferred hand was used. Experiment 3 confirmed that serial order learning is impaired when motor demands increase (as the model predicted). These results can be captured by reinforcement learning frameworks which suggest sequence learning will be constrained both by an individual’s sensorimotor ability and cognitive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2915050707,"The aim of this study was to classify a randomized sample of adolescents according to their violent and sportsmanship attitudes to determine the influence of personal and social responsibility levels on each cluster. The sample comprised of 595 adolescents, aged between 12 and 15 years old (M ± SD = 13.9 ± 2.3 yr). Participants completed the Multidimensional Orientations Towards Sports Scale, the California School Climate and Safety Survey and the Personal and Social Responsibility Questionnaire. Cluster analysis was conducted to classify adolescent' profiles according to the violence and sportsmanship scores. Discriminant analysis, Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests were performed to identify the relationships between personal and social responsibility levels on each cluster. Cluster analysis identified three well-defined profiles: cluster 1 (sportsmanlike and nonviolent), cluster 2 (sportsmanlike and violent) and cluster 3 (unsportsmanlike and nonviolent). Results confirmed a negative impact of aggressiveness on obedience and pro-social behaviours during school stages, but sportsmanship mitigated this negative influence. The sportsmanlike and nonviolent profile obtained the highest personal and social responsibility level. The lowest personal responsibility scores came from sportsmanlike and violent adolescents. This study emphasizes the potential of positive attitude towards sport and physical education to magnify (or mitigate) adolescents' responsibility according to specific profiles. To reduce violent behaviour and improve sportsmanship attitudes would contribute to a better development of personal and social responsibility in adolescents. The current findings may serve to orientate professionals dealing with adolescents in the role of sportsmanship development as an educational tool to mitigate violent behaviour."

Its adverse effect on pregnancy outcome has also been documented.To assess the relationship between maternal blood lead levels and umbilical cord blood lead levels in their corresponding newborn infants; to determine factors associated with high blood lead levels and the pregnancy outcome in participants.This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out at a tertiary Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. Four hundred and forty pregnant women and their respective newborns delivered at the study centre. Blood samples were obtained from the mothers and umbilical cord of the newborns at delivery and analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Socio-demographic and obstetric data was obtained by questionnaires administered to the mothers. The anthropometric measurements of the babies were taken at birth and clinical data recorded. Main outcome measures were blood lead levels in mother and baby pair, socio-demographic factors, birth weight, gestational age, length, occipito-frontal circumference.The median maternal and umbilical blood lead level was 64.3μg/dl and 39.2μg/dl respectively. The levels were above 5μg/dl in 75.6% and 66.8% of mothers and umbilical cord respectively. There was a strong positive correlation between the maternal and umbilical cord blood lead levels (rs = 0.80). Use of calcium supplements during pregnancy was significantly associated with a lower maternal blood lead level (p = 0.010) while recent painting and renovation of residential accommodation were associated with a higher umbilical cord blood lead level (p = 0.025). There were no statistically significant associations between the maternal and umbilical cord blood lead levels and the gestational age and anthropometry of the newborns at birth.The blood lead levels in newborns of women residing in Lagos, Nigeria are high and administration of antenatal calcium is associated with lower blood lead levels."

We i/ show that the original statistical test used in [1] contains an erroneous trimming procedure leading to uncontrolled false positives and underestimated p -values, ii/ propose a deeper analysis of the dataset, identifying several preprocessing parameters and carefully assessing the results’ robustness regarding the choice of these parameters. We observe, as in [1], shifts in fringe visibility in the direction expected by the mind-matter interaction hypothesis. However, these shifts are not deemed significant ( p &gt; 0.05). Our re-analysis concludes that this particular dataset does not contain evidence of mind-matter interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2914123476,"Background The aim of this study is to review patient characteristics, injury patterns, and outcomes of trauma cases admitted to pediatric intensive care in Children’s Health Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Methods Routinely recorded data collected prospectively from the Children’s Health Queensland Trauma Service registry from November 2008 to October 2015 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics of trauma cases in children under 16 years of age are described, and their association with age and mortality analyzed. Results There were 542 cases of pediatric trauma identified and 66.4% were male. The overall mortality since January 2012 was 11.1%. The median injury severity score (ISS) was 11 (IQR = 9–22), 48.2% (n = 261) had an ISS > 12 and 41.7% (n = 226) patients had an ISS > 15. The most common injury patterns were isolated head injury (29.7%; n = 161) and multiple trauma (31.2%; n = 169). In 28.4% of cases (n = 154) surgery was required. The home was reported to be the most common place of injury (37.6%; n = 204). Children aged 0–4 years were least likely to survive their injury (15.3% mortality) compared with the 5–9 (5.6% mortality) and 10–15 (9.0% mortality) age groups. Higher mortality was associated with more severe injuries, abdomen/spine/thorax injuries, inflicted injuries, drowning and hanging. Conclusion This description of major pediatric trauma cases admitted to pediatric intensive care in Children’s Health Queensland, Australia, will inform future pediatric major trauma service requirements as it identifies injury patterns and profiles, injury severity, management and mortality across different age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2911756261,"Tugarinovia (Family Asteraceae) is a monotypic genus. It's sole species, Tugarinovia mongolica Iljin, is distributed in the northern part of Inner Mongolia, with one additional variety, Tugarinovia mongolica var ovatifolia, which is distributed in the southern part of Inner Mongolia. The species has a limited geographical range and declining populations. To understand the phylogeographic structure of T. mongolica, we sequenced two chloroplast DNA regions (psbA-trnH and psbK-psbI) from 219 individuals of 16 populations, and investigated the genetic variation and phylogeographic patterns of T. mongolica. The results identified a total of 17 (H1-H17) chloroplast haplotypes. There were no haplotypes shared between the northern (T. mongolica) and southern groups (T. mongolica var. ovatifolia), and they formed two distinct lineages. The regional split was also supported by AMOVA and BEAST analyses. AMOVA showed the main variation that occurred between the two geographic groups. The time of divergence of the two groups can be dated to the early Pleistocene epoch, when climate fluctuations most likely resulted in the allopatric divergence of T. mongolica. The formation of the desert blocked genetic flow and enhanced the divergence of the northern and southern groups. Our results indicate that the genetic differences between T. mongolica and T. mongolica var. ovatifolia are consistent with previously proposed morphological differences. We speculate that the dry, cold climate and the expansion of the desert during the Quaternary resulted in the currently observed distribution of extant populations of T. mongolica. In the northern group, the populations Chuanjinsumu, Wuliji and Yingen displayed the highest genetic diversity and should be given priority protection. The southern group showed a higher genetic drift (FST = 1, GST = 1), and the inbreeding load (HS = 0) required protection for each population. Our results propose that the protection of T. mongolica should be implemented through in situ and ex situ conservation practices to increase the effective population size and genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2911820614,"Mobile, vehicle-installed road weather sensors are becoming ubiquitous. While mobile sensors are often capable of making observations on a high frequency, their reliability and accuracy may vary. Large-scale road weather observation and forecasting are still mostly based on stationary road weather stations (RWS). Though expensive, sparsely located and making observations on a relatively low frequency, RWS’ reliability and accuracy are well-known and accommodated for in the road weather forecasting models. Statistical analysis revealed that road weather conditions indeed have a great effect on how the observations of mobile and stationary road weather temperature sensors differ from each other. Consequently, we calibrated the observations of mobile sensors with a linear mixed model. The mixed model was fitted fusing ca. 20 000 pairs of mobile and RWS observations of the same location at the same time, following a rendezvous model of sensor calibration. The calibration nearly halved the MSE between the observations of the mobile and the RWS sensor types. Computationally very light, the calibration can be embedded directly in the sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2912442859,"Climate change is impacting environmental conditions, especially with respect to temperature and ice cover in high latitude regions. Predictive models and risk assessment are key tools for understanding potential changes associated with such impacts on coastal regions. In this study relative ecological risk assessment was done for future potential introductions of three species in the Canadian Arctic: periwinkle Littorina littorea, soft shell clam Mya arenaria and red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus. These species occur in locations connected to Canadian Arctic ports through shipping and have the potential to be introduced via ballast water discharge. The methodology proposed in this study is unique in the sense that it considers not only ballast water origin, but also the distribution of the species being assessed and the sensitivity of the receiving habitat. It combines detailed information (ballast water source of each tank, transit time, time of the year when the water is released, environmental suitability of receiving habitat, impact, and habitat sensitivity) in order to assess ecological risk. Through the use of this approach it is highlighted that domestic discharge events pose a higher relative overall risk on a vessel-specific and cumulative annual bases than international discharges. The main ports of Deception Bay and Churchill were classified as being at moderate to high relative risk for L. littorea and M. arenaria, especially from domestic vessels, while relative overall risk for P. camtschaticus was low for international vessels and null for domestic vessels due to few ships transiting from its range of distribution to Canadian Arctic ports. This work can serve as an approach to help build a list of potential high risk species-a ""grey"" watch list-for the Canadian Arctic, and provides useful information for consideration in future decision making actions such as the identification of high risk pathways, species and ports."
https://openalex.org/W2912917731,"Introduction Preliminary studies have showed that the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT) is a maximal test, however comparison between ISWT with the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CEPT) has not yet performed in the healthy woman population. Furthermore, there is no regression equation available in the current literature to predict oxygen peak consumption (VO2 peak). Thus, this study aimed to compare the ISWT with CEPT and to develop an equation to predict peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) in healthy women participants. Methods First, the VO2 peak, respiratory exchange ratio (R peak), heart rate max (HR max) and percentage of predicted HR max (% predicted HR max) were evaluated in the CEPT and ISWT (n = 40). Then, an equation was developed to predict the VO2 peak (n = 54) and its validation was performed (n = 20). Results There were no significant differences between the ISWT and CEPT of VO2 peak, HR max and % predicted HR max values (P>0.05), except for R peak measure in the ISWT (1.22 ± 0.13) and CEPT (1.18 ± 0.1) (P = 0.022). Therefore, both tests showed a moderate positive correlation of VO2 peak (r = 0.51; P = 0.0007), HR max (r = 0.65; P<0.0001) and R peak (r = 0.55; P = 0.0002) and the Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement of VO2 peak (bias = -0.14). The distance walked on ISWT and age explained 36.3% (R2 Adjusted = 0.363) of the variance in VO2 peak. The equation developed was VO2 peak (predicted) = 19.793 + (0.02 x distance walked)—(0.236 x age). There was no statistically significant difference between the VO2 peak measured directly and the predicted, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement (bias = 1.5 ml/kg/min). Conclusion ISWT is a maximal test showing similar results compared to the CEPT, and the predicted equation was valid and applicable for VO2 peak assessing in young adult healthy women."
https://openalex.org/W2914846899,"Introduction Assault is the third most common cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI), after falls and road traffic collisions. TBI can lead to multiple long-term physical, cognitive and emotional sequelae, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Intentional violence may further compound the psychological trauma of the event, in a way that conventional outcome measures, like the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), fail to capture. This study aims to examine the influence of assault on self-reported outcomes, including quality of life and symptoms of PTSD. Methods Questionnaire were completed by 256 patients attending a TBI clinic, including Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) and PTSD checklist (PCL-C). Medical records provided demographics, clinical data and aetiology of injury. Subjective outcomes were compared between assault and other causes. Results Of 202 patients analysed, 21% sustained TBI from assault. There was no difference in severity of injuries between assault and non-assault groups. No relationship was found between self-reported outcomes and TBI severity or GOS. The assault group scored worse in all self-reported questionnaires, with statistically significant differences for measures of PTSD and post-concussion symptoms. However, using threshold scores, the prevalence of PTSD in assaulted patients was not higher than non-assault. After adjusting for age, ethnicity and the presence of extra-cranial trauma, assault did not have a significant effect on questionnaire scores. Exploratory analysis showed that assault and road traffic accidents were associated with significantly worse outcomes compared to falls. Conclusion Quality of life is significantly related to functional and psychological outcomes after TBI. Assaulted patients suffer from worse self-reported outcomes than other patients, but these differences were insignificant when adjusted for demographic factors. Intentionality behind the traumatic event is likely more important than cause alone. Differences in quality of life and other self-reported outcomes are not reflected by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. This information is useful in arranging earlier and targeted review and support."
https://openalex.org/W2911409138,"Data sets that provide a ground truth to quantify the efficacy of automated algorithms are rare due to the time consuming and expensive, although highly valuable, task of manually annotating observations. These datasets exist for niche problems in developed fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Business Process Mining (BPM), however it is difficult to find a suitable dataset for use cases that span across multiple fields, such as the one described in this study. The lack of established ground truth maps between cyberspace and the human-interpretable, persona-driven tasks that occur therein, is one of the principal barriers preventing reliable, automated situation awareness of dynamically evolving events and the consequences of loss due to cybersecurity breaches. Automated workflow analysis—the machine-learning assisted identification of templates of repeated tasks—is the likely missing link between semantic descriptions of mission goals and observable events in cyberspace. We summarize our efforts to establish a ground truth for an email dataset pertaining to the operation of an open source software project. The ground truth defines semantic labels for each email and the arrangement of emails within a sequence that describe actions observed in the dataset. Identified sequences are then used to define template workflows that describe the possible tasks undertaken for a project and their business process model. We present the overall purpose of the dataset, the methodology for establishing a ground truth, and lessons learned from the effort. Finally, we report on the proposed use of the dataset for the workflow discovery problem, and its effect on system accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2912083458,"Malignant transformation is associated with loss of cell differentiation, anaplasia. Transcription factors gli, required for embryonic development, may be involved in this process. We studied the activity of transcription factors gli in high-grade gliomas and their role in maintenance of stem cell state and glioma cell survival. 20 glioma cell lines and a sample of a normal adult brain tissue were used in the present study. We found the expression of gli target genes, including GLI1 and FOXM1, in all tested glioma cell lines, but not in the normal tissue. Interestingly, the expression of gli target genes in some glioma cell lines was observed together with a high level of their transcriptional repressor, Gli3R. Knockdown of GLI3 in one of these lines resulted in decrease of gli target gene expression. These data suggest that Gli3R does not prevent the gli target genes transcription, and gli3 acts in glioma cells more as an activator, than a repressor of transcription. We observed that gli regulated the expression of such genes, as SOX2 or OCT4 that maintain stem cell state, and TET1, involving in DNA demethylation. Treatment with GANT61 or siRNA against GLI1, GLI2, or GLI3 could result in complete glioma cell death, while cyclopamine had a weaker and line-specific effect on glioma cell survival. Thus, the gli transcription factors are abnormally active in high-grade gliomas, regulate expression of genes, maintaining the stem cell state, and contribute to glioma cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2912919346,"In aging, structural and/or functional brain changes may precede changes in cognitive performance. We previously showed that despite having hippocampal volumes similar to those of younger adults, older adults showed oscillatory changes during the encoding phase of a short-delay visuospatial memory task that required spatial relations among objects to be bound across time (Rondina et al., 2016). The present work provides a complementary set of analyses to examine age-related changes in oscillatory activity during maintenance and retrieval of those spatial relations in order to provide a comprehensive examination of the neural dynamics that support memory function in aging. Participants were presented with three study objects sequentially. Following a delay (maintenance phase), the objects were re-presented simultaneously and participants had to determine whether the relative spatial relations among the objects had been maintained (retrieval phase). Older adults had similar task accuracy, but slower response times, compared to younger adults. Both groups showed a decrease in theta (2-7Hz), alpha (9-14Hz), and beta (15-30Hz) power during the maintenance phase. During the retrieval phase, younger adults showed theta and beta power increases that predicted greater task accuracy, whereas older adults showed a widespread decrease in each of the three frequency ranges that predicted longer response latencies. Older adults also showed distinct patterns of behaviour-related activity depending on whether the analysis was time-locked to the onset of the stimulus or to the onset of the response during the test phase. These findings suggest that older adults may experience declines in relational binding and/or comparison processes that are reflected in oscillatory changes prior to structural decline."
https://openalex.org/W2913918832,"Background Prior studies have shown that AHRR (cg05575921) hypomethylation may be a marker of smoking, lung cancer risk and potentially lung cancer survival (in some lung cancer subtypes). It is unknown if AHRR (cg05575921) hypomethylation is associated with reduced survival among lung cancer patients. Methods In bisulfite treated leukocyte DNA from 465 lung cancer patients from the Copenhagen prospective lung cancer study, we measured AHRR (cg05575921) methylation. 380 died during max follow-up of 4.4 years. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze survival as a function of AHRR (cg05575921) methylation. Results We observed the expected inverse correlation between cumulative smoking and AHRR methylation, as methylation (%) decreased (Coefficient -0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.04- -0.02, p = 8.6x10-15) for every pack-year. Cumulative smoking > 60 pack-years was associated with reduced survival (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.48; 1.05–2.09), however, AHRR (cg05575921) methylation was not associated with survival when adjusted for sex, body mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, performance status, TNM Classification, and histology type of lung cancer. Conclusion AHRR (cg05575921) methylation is linked to smoking but does not provide independent prognostic information in lung cancer patients."

However, the comparability of translated self-report measures across countries is often problematic. This study aimed to overcome this problem by developing psychometrically sound brief versions of the widely used 25-item Modern Health Worries Scale (MHWS) suitable for multi-country use. Based on data of overall 5,176 individuals from four European countries (England, Germany, Hungary, Sweden), Ant Colony Optimization was used to identify the indicators that optimize model fit and measurement invariance across countries. Two scales were developed. A short (12-item) version of the MHWS that represents the four-factor structure of the original version and an ultra-short (4-item) scale that only measures the general construct. Both scales show that overall levels of health worries were highest in England and Hungary, but that the main reason for concern (e.g. electromagnetic radiation or food related fears) differs considerably between these countries. This study also shows that even if measurement invariance of translated self-report instruments across countries is problematic, it can be optimized by using adequate item selection procedures. Differences of modern health worries across countries and recommendations for cross-cultural research are discussed."

TB patients were tested for other clinical parameters including HIV co-infection and TB lesion location. Mycobacterial isolates obtained from collected sputum samples were characterized by standard methods. Associations between TBDM patients' epidemiological as well as microbiological variables were assessed.The prevalence of DM at time of diagnosis among 2990 enrolled TB cases was 9.4% (282/2990).

https://openalex.org/W2912617717,"Attenuated live infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus (ILTV) vaccines have been used to prevent and control the outbreak of ILT worldwide. Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing technology have increased the number of complete genome sequences of ILTVs, enabling comparative genome analysis. Although 37 complete genome sequences of ILTV, including vaccine strains, have been reported, the complete genome sequence of any field strain of ILTV in South Korea is yet to be published. In this study, we determined and analyzed the complete genome sequences of three virulent Korean field strains of ILTV (40798/10/Ko, 0206/14/Ko, and 30678/14/Ko). Two of the Korean field strains (40798/10/Ko and 0206/14/Ko) displayed fewer non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms than those of the Serva vaccine strain, indicating that these Korean field strains of ILTV most likely originated from the vaccine strain. The third ILTV strain, 307678/14/Ko, had two regions in the genome showing recombination between the Serva vaccine-like strain and the Australian A20 vaccine-like strain. Comparative genome analysis of ILTV using the Korean field strains with variable virulence can shed light on the recent trend of the emergence of virulent ILTV strains in the field. A few amino acid changes in the genome of ILTV vaccines could enhance the virulence in the vaccine strain, and natural recombination should be considered one of the major risks for the generation of revertant strains of ILTV under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2912452754,"Quantitative laboratory bioassay methods are required to evaluate the toxicity of novel insecticidal compounds for pest control and to determine the presence of resistance traits. We used a radioactive tracer based on 32P-ATP to estimate the volume of a droplet ingested by two dipteran pests: Ceratitis capitata (Tephritidae) and Drosophila suzukii (Drosophilidae). Using blue food dye it was possible to distinguish between individuals that ingested the solution from those that did not. The average volume ingested by C. capitata adults was 1.968 μl. Females ingested a ~20% greater volume of solution than males. Adults of D. suzukii ingested an average of 0.879 μl and females ingested ~30% greater volume than males. The droplet feeding method was validated using the naturally-derived insecticide spinosad as the active ingredient (a.i.). For C. capitata, the concentration-mortality response did not differ between the sexes or among three different batches of insects. Lethal dose values were calculated based on mean ingested volumes. For C. capitata LD50 values were 1.462 and 1.502 ng a.i./insect for males and females, respectively, equivalent to 0.274 and 0.271 ng a.i./mg for males and females, respectively, when sex-specific variation in body weight was considered. Using the same process for D. suzukii, the LD50 value was estimated at 2.927 ng a.i./insect, or 1.994 ng a.i./mg based on a mean body weight of 1.67 mg for both sexes together. We conclude that this technique could be readily employed for determination of the resistance status and dose-mortality responses of insecticidal compounds in many species of pestiferous Diptera."
https://openalex.org/W2912927350,"This study aims to analyze factors related to the occurrence of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in the Purus Region, based on the reporting of cases between 2001 and 2013, correlating them with livelihoods and subsistence farming in the region, and analyzing them in regards to sex, age, clinical form, occupation, diagnostic methods and seasonality. The analysis parameter which was used included all cases of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in each sub-region by municipality. The Purus Region, between the states of Amazonas and Acre, consists of three sub-regions: Upper, Middle, and Lower Purus. We observed that socio-environmental impacts influenced the livelihoods of the human population and that the interaction with extractive activities, especially latex and Brazil nut collecting, where the labor regime implies a long stay in the jungle, leads to socio-environmental conditions that are favorable to the contraction of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis. During the referred period, there were 13,971 cases of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis distributed among the sub-regions: High (12611 cases = 90.27%), Middle (1225 cases = 8.77%) and Lower (135 cases = 0.96%). Among the 22 municipalities that were studied, Rio Branco stands out with 31.6% of cases, followed by Xapuri with 12.6% and Sena Madureira with 12.5%. In the results, we highlight the high percentage (20.8%) of mucous forms; the age group from 11 to 50 (70.2%), however, 20.2% were in the age group of 1 month to 10 years of age; cases in males were 69.8%, and, in the reports examined, 43.7%. cited their occupation as extractivism. A statistically significant negative association was demonstrated between cutaneous leishmaniasis and rainfall between Purus municipalities. However, in regards to the association of cutaneous leishmaniasis for both, temperature and Municipal Human Development Index-MHDI, no significant associations were found in Purus. We concluded that American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis occurring in the Purus Region is related to two distinct aspects: the development of enterprises that extend the agricultural frontier, and a change in lifestyle, namely the extraction of wood as an occupation, which has, as a consequence, an environmental impact and creates difficulties in accessing treatment."

This study aimed to characterize the ONH structures and glaucomatous damage in diabetic OAG patients, using age-matched non-diabetic OAG patients and control subjects.The locations of visual field defects of OAG patients were classified and the prelaminar thickness and lamina cribrosa depth were measured in 64 OAG patients with type 2 diabetes (OAG+DM), 68 OAG patients without diabetes (OAG-DM), and 36 controls. All participants were scanned by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography. The anterior prelaminar depth and lamina cribrosa depth were measured at the center of the reference line (the Bruch's membrane opening plane). The prelaminar tissue thickness was obtained by subtracting the anterior prelaminar depth from the anterior lamina cribrosa depth.The visual field defects in the OAG+DM group were more commonly found in the inferior hemifield (P = 0.010), and tended to involve the central visual field compared to the OAG-DM group (P = 0.044). In the comparison of ONH parameters, the prelaminar thickness was highest in the OAG+DM group, followed by the control subjects and the OAG-DM group (P = 0.035). Post-hoc testing showed that prelaminar thickness was significantly greater in the OAG+DM group than in the OAG-DM group (P = 0.033). The lamina cribrosa depth was deepest in the OAG+DM group, followed by the OAG-DM group and the control subjects (P = 0.006).Diabetic and non-diabetic OAG patients exhibit different characteristics of glaucoma, particularly increased prelaminar thickening in diabetics."

The universal screening test for gonococcal cervicitis, involving nucleic acid amplification for all pregnant women, was performed in 281 institutes (13.9% of institutes across Japan). The total rate of pregnant women with gonococcal cervicitis was 1.3% in the institutes performing the screening test during pregnancy, while it was only 0.2% (p < 0.01) in those not performing it. This suggests that 84% of infected women may have been missed in the institutes that do not routinely perform the screening test for gonococcal cervicitis.

https://openalex.org/W2914687574,"Longitudinal bone growth is accomplished through a process where proliferating chondrocytes produce cartilage in the growth plate, which ultimately ossifies. Environmental influences, like mechanical loading, can moderate the growth of this cartilage, which can alter bone length. However, little is known about how specific behaviors like bipedalism, which is characterized by a shift in body mass (mechanical load), to the lower limbs, may impact bone growth. This study uses an experimental approach to induce bipedal behaviors in a rodent model (Rattus norvegicus) over a 12-week period using a treadmill-mounted harness system to test how rat hindlimbs respond to the following loading conditions: 1) fully loaded bipedal walking, 2) partially loaded bipedal walking, 3) standing, 4) quadrupedal walking, and 5) no exercise control. These experimental conditions test whether mechanical loading from 1) locomotor or postural behaviors, and 2) a change in the magnitude of load can moderate longitudinal bone growth in the femur and tibia, relative to controls. The results demonstrate that fully loaded bipedal walking and bipedal standing groups showed significant differences in the percentage change in length for the tibia and femur. When comparing the change from baseline, which control for body mass, all bipedal groups showed significant differences in tibia length compared to control groups. However, there were no absolute differences in bone length, which suggests that mechanical loads from bipedal behaviors may instead be moderating changes in growth velocity. Implications for the relationship between bipedal behaviors and longitudinal bone growth are discussed."

The present study examined the prognostic value of this polymorphism for African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) BC patients separately and considered the confounding variables of molecular subtypes and somatic mutations in p53.Tissue sections of BCs from 116 AAs and 160 CAs were evaluated for p53 mutations and genotyped for the codon 72 polymorphism. The relationships of phenotypes to clinicopathologic features were determined by χ2 analyses; patient survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier univariate and Cox regression multivariate models in a retrospective cohort study design.The proportion of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 72 alleles differed for races. Many cancers of AAs were Pro/Pro, but most for CAs were Arg/Arg. A higher frequency of missense p53 mutations was evident for AAs. There was an interaction between the SNP allele and p53 mutations for AA women only. The proportion of women with both the Pro/Pro allele and a p53 somatic mutation was higher for AA than CA women. The interaction between missense p53 mutations and Pro/Pro had a negative effect on survival, particularly for AAs with luminal cancers.For BCs, the survival effect of SNP72 combined with a p53 missense mutation is dependent on race and molecular subtype. Although such a mutation is a marker of poor prognosis, it is relevant to identify the variant Pro/Pro in the case of AAs, especially those with luminal subtypes of BC."
https://openalex.org/W2912044000,"We sought to characterize the association between a forensic event (arrest or incarceration) with housing vulnerability and mental and physical health status over a four-year follow-up among a cohort of homeless and vulnerably housed individuals in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa. Data were obtained from the Health and Housing in Transition Study, a prospective cohort study of homeless and vulnerably housed individuals between 2009 and 2012. Participants were interviewed in-person at baseline (N = 1190) and at four annual follow-up time points. We used generalized estimating equations to characterize the independent associations between a forensic event and the number of residential moves and SF-12 physical and mental health component scores over the four-year follow-up period. We analyzed data from 1173 homeless and vulnerably housed participants. Forensic events were reported by 446 participants at baseline. In multivariate analyses, a history of forensic event in the preceding twelve months was independently associated with an increased number of residential moves over the four-year follow-up period (ARR 1.24; 95% CI 1.19–1.3). It was not, however, independently associated with a change in physical or mental health status (respective ß-estimates; 95% CI: -0.34; -1.02, 0.34, and -0.69; -1.5, 0.2). Female gender and a history of problematic substance use were significantly associated with all three primary outcomes. This suggests arrest or incarceration is associated with increased housing vulnerability. The results underline the importance of supporting individuals experiencing arrest or incarceration with post-release planning in order to obtain stable housing after discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2914561833,"Loxocelism is a neglected medical problem that depends on its severity, can cause a cutaneous or viscero-cutaneous syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by hemostatic effects and necrosis, and the severity of the loxoscelism depends on the amount of venom injected, the zone of inoculation, and the species. In the Chihuahuan desert, the most abundant species is L. apachea. Its venom and biological effects are understudied, including neurological effects. Thus, our aim is to explore the effect of this regional species of medical interest in the United States-Mexico border community, using rat blood and central nervous system (CNS), particularly, two brain structures involved in brain homeostasis, Area postrema (AP) and Choroid plexus (PC). L. apachea specimens were collected and venom was obtained. Different venom concentrations (0, 0.178 and 0.87 μg/g) were inoculated into Sprague-Dawley rats (intraperitoneal injection). Subsequently, blood was extracted and stained with Wright staining; coronal sections of AP were obtained and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and laminin γ immunolabelling, the same was done with CP sections. Blood, AP and CP were observed under the microscope and abnormalities in erythrocytes and fluctuation in leukocyte types were described and quantified in blood. Capillaries were also quantified in AP and damage was described in CP. L. apachea venom produced a segmented neutrophil increment (neutrophilia), lymphocyte diminishment (leukopenia) and erythrocytes presented membrane abnormalities (acanthocytosis). Extravasated erythrocytes were observed in HE stained sections from both, AP and CP, which suggest that near to this section a hemorrhage is present; through immunohistofluorescence, a diminishment of laminin γ was observed in AP endothelial cells and in CP ependymal cells when these structures were exposed to L. apachea venom. In conclusion, L. apachea venom produced leukopenia, netrophilia and acanthocytosis in rat peripheral blood, and also generated hemorrhages on AP and CP through degradation of laminin γ."
https://openalex.org/W2913597712,"Consumer spending on organic food products has grown rapidly. Some claim that organics have ecological, equity, and health advantages over conventional food and therefore should be subsidized. Here we explore the distributive impacts of an organic fruit subsidy that reduces the retail price of organic fruit in the US by 10 percent. We estimate the impact of the subsidy on organic fruit demand in a representative poor, middle income, and rich US household using three analytical methods; including two econometric and one machine learning. We do not find strong evidence of regressive redistribution due to our simulated organic fruit subsidy; the poor household's relative reaction to the subsidy is not much different than the reaction at the other two households. However, the infra-marginal savings from the subsidy tend to be larger in richer households."
https://openalex.org/W2914287807,"Researchers have a limited understanding of the interactions between development patterns and Ignition Probability. This study explores the variation in Ignition Probability as a result of differing development patterns. Based on LANDFIRE datasets, development changes were mapped for two sets of years (2001 and 2012) and the relationship between development and Ignition Probability was assessed. The study area covered the two adjacent counties, Bastrop and Travis located in Texas, USA. These two counties have a high potential for wildfire, and due to expanding development have high vulnerability. Expanding lateral development was organized into one of five categories: infill, radial, isolated, clustered, and linear. The Maximum Entropy algorithm predicted the spatial distribution of ignition probabilities based on several physical and land use characteristics coupled with historic ignition locations. Variation in Ignition Probability was assessed for each category of development using two-way ANOVA’s and post hoc analysis. Ignition Probability maps indicated a fair sensitivity (Area Under the Curve: 0.77–0.78), suggesting that the spatial configuration of development patterns influenced wildfire ignition. Analyses found that isolated, clustered, and linear outlying development patterns had higher Ignition Probability than infill and radial development, and that fire probabilities fell along a development gradient. This trend between the development gradient and ignition probabilities should be used to direct land use planning to reduce fire risk."
https://openalex.org/W2914509542,"Background Different setups and protocols have been developed for investigating insecticide effects on Anopheles (An.) mosquitoes, vectors of malaria. However, chemical uptake resulting from their tarsal contact with insecticide-treated material has seldom been investigated. To address the challenges encountered in the interpretation of bioassay data, a high throughput method for chemical analysis on malaria vectors was developed and validated for five selected insecticides including alpha-cypermethrin (aCYP), deltamethrin (DM), etofenprox (EPX), permethrin (PM), pirimiphos-methyl (PPM). Methods The method includes a single chemical extraction step via an ultrasound probe on mosquito samples and analysis via liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The protocol was established for two malaria vector species, Anopheles gambiae senso stricto (s.s.) and An. stephensi, both males and females. Recovery rates ranged from 70 to 100% without any influence of sex or species. The method was efficiently applied to female An. gambiae s.s. of the KISUMU1 reference strain, after susceptibility tests using the World Health Organization’s standard protocol. Results Susceptibility tests revealed 13.4–18.4 minutes knockdown times for 50% mosquitoes during exposure to EPX and pyrethroids. The mortality rates 24 hours post-exposure to insecticides were mostly 99–100%, except in two PM and three PPM assays suggesting possible or confirmed resistance to these insecticides. The mean insecticide uptake in dead mosquitoes ranged from 23 pg (aCYP) to 1812 pg (EPX) per specimen. However, the mean uptake in survivors to PM and PPM was reduced by at least 25%, suggesting that acute doses were not achieved in these specimens during bioassays. Conclusions The developed and validated UHPLC-MS/MS method could be used to address some limitations of bioassays or to assess the penetration of insecticides in mosquito matrix with reference to cuticle thickness and other insecticide resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2912304818,"Introduction Health professionals are to play an essential and effective role in tobacco control. Toombak is a popular form of smokeless tobacco, locally made and used among Sudanese. It is associated with oral and systemic health hazards, particularly oral cancer. This study was set out to assess health professions students’ perception of their status as future role models for their patients and the public regarding Toombak use cessation and to explore socio-cognitive covariates of perceived role model status. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013–2014 using a self-administered questionnaire among health professions students enrolled in Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Nursing colleges in Khartoum state, Sudan. A total of 1530 participants were recruited from colleges using a cluster stratified sampling procedure. Results The majority of the participants (88.2%) were 19–22 year old, females showed predominance (66.1%). Most of the participants (69.7%) scored good knowledge of Toombak-related therapies. The majority (97%) had a positive attitude towards banning Toombak use in public. Half of the participants (50.4%) confirmed availability of Toombak control policy in their college, while 66% reported receiving training in Toombak cessation. Only 9.2% of the participants reported that they have ever used Toombak; among them, 69.5% were current daily users. Less than half (47.8%) reported a positive perception of their status as a role model. Logistic regression model revealed that tobacco cessation training, availability of college policy and positive attitudes towards banning Toombak use in public were strong predictors of with a positive perception of role model status. Conclusion Imposing Toombak control policies within colleges combined with formal training in cessation methods, would reinforce the positive perception of health professions students as a role model, particularly the students themselves seem to be ready for such systematic training."
https://openalex.org/W2912885102,"The objective of this study was to test if a novel platform could be used for isotype-specific autoantibody testing in humans. Further, we evaluated if testing with this novel platform enables earlier detection of insulin autoantibodies in individuals that have first-degree relatives with type-1 diabetes than currently used approaches. Longitudinal serum samples from participants were collected before and after they converted to become positive for insulin autoantibodies by the current standardly used assays. Using a novel plasmonic gold chip platform, we tested these samples for IgM isotype-specific autoantibodies. Serial serum samples from individuals without diabetes were also tested as a comparison control cohort. Our results demonstrate proof-of-concept that a plasmonic gold chip can specifically detect the IgM insulin autoantibody. Five out of the six individuals that converted to being positive for insulin autoantibodies by standard testing had significant IgM autoantibodies on the plasmonic chip platform. The plasmonic chip platform detected IgM autoantibodies earlier than standard testing by up to 4 years. Our results indicate that the plasmonic gold platform can specifically detect the IgM isotype autoantibodies and suggest that combining isotype-specific testing with currently used approaches enables earlier detection of insulin autoantibodies in individuals that have first-degree relatives with type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2914683135,"Background Despite the fact that Uganda has been a signatory to the global strategy for Infant and Young Children Feeding practices (IYCF) for nearly a decade, the prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age remains tragically high at 17% in Eastern Uganda and twofold higher countrywide. Only 6% of all children aged 6–23 months feed adequately. This study aimed to establish the covariates of complementary feeding (CF) and its effect on attained height among primary school-aged children in Mbale district (Eastern Uganda). Methods This was a community-based prospective cohort study using data from the PROMISE EBF trial. The main exposure variable was adequate complementary feeding (CF) measured in a parent questionnaire at 18–24 months of age. We defined adequate CF as having received animal food, cereals and fruit, juice and/or vegetables during the 24 hours preceding the interview. An adapted minimum acceptable diet was defined as having been given milk or milk products at least twice a day, an adapted meal frequency of two and solid or semi-solid food from at least four food groups on a 24-hour dietary recall based on modified IYCF criteria. The main outcome variable was attained height [(height-for-age Z score (HAZ)] measured between five and eight years of age using the WHO growth standards. Effects of CF on HAZ were estimated using linear regression analyses with cluster-robust standard errors. Results A total of 506 children were studied. The majority (85%) were from rural areas and the average age at the end of the study was 6.9 (standard deviation: 0.63) years. Of these, 23.9% were adequately fed and 2.3% received the adapted minimum acceptable diet. Adequate CF was not associated with HAZ (adjusted β = -0.111; 95% CI: -0.363, 0.141; p = 0.374). Factors significantly associated with attained height were baseline HAZ (0.262; 0.152, 0.374; p<0.001) and WHZ (-0.147; -0.243, -0.051; p = 0.004), child’s age (0.454; -0.592, -0.315; p<0.001) and maternal education (0.030; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.057; p = 0.034). Conclusion Adequate CF at age 18–24 months was worryingly insufficient and not associated with attained HAZ at age 5–8 years. Further strategies need to be considered to improve child nutrition and linear growth in resource-constrained settings."
