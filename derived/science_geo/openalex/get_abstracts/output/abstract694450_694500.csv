https://openalex.org/W4281726376,"Vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in the United States. This study conducted an online survey [N = 3,013] using the Social Science Research Solution [SSRS] Opinion Panel web panelists, representative of U.S. adults age 18 and older who use the internet, with an oversample of rural-dwelling and minority populations between April 8 and April 22, 2021- as vaccine eligibility opened to the country. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and socio-demographics with vaccine intentions [eager-to-take, wait-and-see, undecided, refuse] among the unvaccinated using multinomial logistic regressions [ref: fully/partially vaccinated]. Results showed vaccine intentions varied by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 experience during the period that eligibility for the vaccine was extended to all adults. At the time of the survey approximately 40% of respondents were unvaccinated; 41% knew someone who had died of COVID-19, and 38% had experienced financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. The vaccinated were more likely to be highly educated, older adults, consistent with the United States initial eligibility criteria. Political affiliation and financial hardship experienced during the pandemic were the two most salient factors associated with being undecided or unwilling to take the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4281892456,"The purpose of this study was to explore the association between participation in organized sport and a broad array of mental health difficulties among US children and adolescents. The data (cross-sectional) were from Data Release 3.0 (one-year follow-up visits on the full cohort) of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study—a broadly representative sample of 11,235 US children and adolescents aged 9 to 13 years. Parents/guardians provided self-reports of their child’s mental health difficulties using the Child Behavior Checklist. To assess participation in organized sport, children and adolescents were categorized into one of four groups: 1) participation in team sport, 2) participation in individual sport, 3) participation in team and individual sport, and 4) non-sport participation. Participation in team sport compared to non-sport participation was associated with 10% lower anxious/depressed scores, 19% lower withdrawn/depressed scores, 17% lower social problems scores, 17% lower thought problems scores, and 12% lower attention problems scores. Participation in team sport compared to non-sport participation was also associated with 20% lower rule-breaking behavior scores for females (compared to males). Conversely, participation in individual sport compared to non-sport participation was associated with 16% higher anxious/depressed scores, 14% higher withdrawn/depressed scores, 12% higher social problems scores, and 14% higher attention problems scores. Participation in both team and individual sport compared to non-sport participation was associated with 17% lower rule-breaking behavior scores for females (compared to males). Results indicate that team sport participation was associated with fewer mental health difficulties, whereas individual sport participation was associated with greater mental health difficulties. The findings complement previous research suggesting that team sport participation may be a vehicle to support child and adolescent mental health. Additional research is needed to determine to what extent, and under what circumstances, participation in individual sport may be problematic for younger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W4281808264,"The willingness of Africa's population to patronise the COVID-19 vaccines is critical to the efficiency of national immunisation programmes. This study surveys the views of adult African inhabitants toward vaccination and the possibility of participating or not participating in governments' efforts to get citizens vaccinated.A cross-sectional online survey of adult Africans was undertaken from December 2020 to March 2021. Responses were anonymised. The Pearson Chi-square test was performed to determine whether or not there were any variations in knowledge, awareness, perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines among the participants. Binomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccines and participate in immunisation programmes.The results indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to be used by adult Africans over the age of 18 who are largely technologically savvy (55 percent) if the vaccine is made broadly available. A total of 33 percent of those who responded said they were unlikely to receive the vaccine, with another 15 percent stating they were undecided. Aside from that, we found that vaccine hesitancy was closely associated with socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and source of information. We also found that there were widespread conspiracies and myths about the COVID-19 vaccines.More than one-third of African adults who participated in the survey indicated they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with majority of them expressing skepticisms about the vaccine's efficacy. It is possible that many of the people who would not be vaccinated would have an impact on the implementation of a COVID-19 immunisation programme that is meant for all of society. Majority of the respondents were unwilling to pay for the COVID-19 vaccines when made available. An awareness campaign should be focused on promoting the benefits of vaccination at the individual and population levels, as well as on taking preemptive actions to debunk misconceptions about the vaccines before they become further widespread."
https://openalex.org/W4281867072,"A number of neurologic diseases associated with expanded nucleotide repeats, including an inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have an unconventional form of translation called repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. It has been speculated that the repeat regions in the RNA fold into secondary structures in a length-dependent manner, promoting RAN translation. Repeat protein products are translated, accumulate, and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Nucleotides that flank the repeat region, especially ones closest to the initiation site, are believed to enhance translation initiation. A machine learning model has been published to help identify ATG and near-cognate translation initiation sites; however, this model has diminished predictive power due to its extensive feature selection and limited training data. Here, we overcome this limitation and increase prediction accuracy by the following: a) capture the effect of nucleotides most critical for translation initiation via feature reduction, b) implement an alternative machine learning algorithm better suited for limited data, c) build comprehensive and balanced training data (via sampling without replacement) that includes previously unavailable sequences, and d) split ATG and near-cognate translation initiation codon data to train two separate models. We also design a supplementary scoring system to provide an additional prognostic assessment of model predictions. The resultant models have high performance, with ~85-88% accuracy, exceeding that of the previously published model by >18%. The models presented here are used to identify translation initiation sites in genes associated with a number of neurologic repeat expansion disorders. The results confirm a number of sites of translation initiation upstream of the expanded repeats that have been found experimentally, and predict sites that are not yet established."
https://openalex.org/W4281664169,"Background Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, testing individuals remains a key action. One approach to rapid testing is to consider the olfactory capacities of trained detection dogs. Methods Prospective cohort study in two community COVID-19 screening centers. Two nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), one saliva and one sweat samples were simultaneously collected. The dog handlers (and the dogs…) were blinded with regards to the Covid status. The diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by canine olfaction was assessed as compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR as the reference standard, saliva RT-PCR and nasopharyngeal antigen testing. Results 335 ambulatory adults (143 symptomatic and 192 asymptomatic) were included. Overall, 109/335 participants tested positive on nasopharyngeal RT-PCR either in symptomatic (78/143) or in asymptomatic participants (31/192). The overall sensitivity of canine detection was 97% (95% CI, 92 to 99) and even reached 100% (95% CI, 89 to 100) in asymptomatic individuals compared to NPS RT-PCR. The specificity was 91% (95% CI, 72 to 91), reaching 94% (95% CI, 90 to 97) for asymptomatic individuals. The sensitivity of canine detection was higher than that of nasopharyngeal antigen testing (97% CI: 91 to 99 versus 84% CI: 74 to 90, p = 0.006), but the specificity was lower (90% CI: 84 to 95 versus 97% CI: 93 to 99, p = 0.016). Conclusions Non-invasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by canine olfaction could be one alternative to NPS RT-PCR when it is necessary to obtain a result very quickly according to the same indications as antigenic tests in the context of mass screening."
https://openalex.org/W4281870109,"Nitrogen dioxide is one of the pollutants with the most significant health effects. Advanced information on its concentration in the air can help to monitor and control further consequences more effectively, while also making it easier to apply preventive and mitigating measures. Machine learning technologies with available methods and capabilities, combined with the geospatial dimension, can perform predictive analyses with higher accuracy and, as a result, can serve as a supportive tool for productive management. One of the most advanced machine learning algorithms, Bidirectional convolutional LSTM, is being used in ongoing work to predict the concentration of nitrogen dioxide. The model has been validated to perform more accurate spatiotemporal analysis based on the integration of temporal and geospatial factors. The analysis was carried out according to two scenarios developed on the basis of selected features using data from the city of Madrid for the periods January-June 2019 and January-June 2020. Evaluation of the model's performance was conducted using the Root Mean Square Error and the Mean Absolute Error which emphasises the superiority of the proposed model over the reference models. In addition, the significance of a feature selection technique providing improved accuracy was underlined. In terms of execution time, due to the complexity of the Bidirectional convolutional LSTM architecture, convergence and generalisation of the data took longer, resulting in the superiority of the reference models."
https://openalex.org/W4281689480,"Depression is a top mental health concern among college students, yet there is a lack of research exploring how online college science courses can exacerbate or alleviate their depression. We surveyed 2,175 undergraduates at a large research-intensive institution about the severity of their depression in large-enrollment online science courses. The survey also explored aspects of online science courses that exacerbate or alleviate depression and we used regression analyses to assess whether demographics predicted responses. Over 50% of undergraduates reported experiencing depression and LGBTQ+ students, financially unstable students, and lower division students were more likely to experience severe rather than mild depression compared to their counterparts. Students reported difficulty building relationships and struggling to perform well online as aspects of online science courses that exacerbated their depression and the flexible nature of online courses and caring instructors as aspects of online courses that alleviated their depression. This study provides insight into how instructors can create more inclusive online learning environments for students with depression."
https://openalex.org/W3215013719,"It was discovered several decades ago that eddy covariance measurements systematically underestimate sensible and latent heat fluxes, creating an imbalance in the surface energy budget. Since then, many studies have addressed this problem and proposed a variety of solutions to the problem, including improvements to instruments and correction methods applied during data postprocessing. However, none of these measures have led to the complete closure of the energy balance gap. The leading hypothesis is that not only surface-attached turbulent eddies but also sub-mesoscale atmospheric circulations contribute to the transport of energy in the atmospheric boundary layer, and the contribution from organized motions has been grossly neglected. The problem arises because the transport of energy through these secondary circulations cannot be captured by the standard eddy covariance method given the relatively short averaging periods of time (~30 minutes) used to compute statistics. There are various approaches to adjust the measured heat fluxes by attributing the missing energy to the sensible and latent heat flux in different proportions. However, few correction methods are based on the processes causing the energy balance gap. Several studies have shown that the magnitude of the energy balance gap depends on the atmospheric stability and the heterogeneity scale of the landscape around the measurement site. Based on this, the energy balance gap within the surface layer has already been modelled as a function of a nonlocal atmospheric stability parameter by performing a large-eddy simulation study with idealized homogeneous surfaces. We have further developed this approach by including thermal surface heterogeneity in addition to atmospheric stability in the parameterization. Specifically, we incorporated a thermal heterogeneity parameter that was shown to relate to the magnitude of the energy balance gap. For this purpose, we use a Large-Eddy Simulation dataset of 28 simulations with seven different atmospheric conditions and three heterogeneous surfaces with different heterogeneity scales as well as one homogeneous surface. The newly developed model captures very well the variability in the magnitude of the energy balance gap under different conditions. The model covers a wide range of both atmospheric stabilities and landscape heterogeneity scales and is well suited for application to eddy covariance measurements since all necessary information can be modelled or obtained from a few additional measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4281673578,"Since the 2010 election, the number of laws in the U.S. that create barriers to voting has increased dramatically. These laws may have spillover effects on population health by creating a disconnect between voter preferences and political representation, thereby limiting protective public health policies and funding. We examine whether voting restrictions are associated with county-level COVID-19 case and mortality rates.To obtain information on restricted access to voting, we used the Cost of Voting Index (COVI), a state-level measure of barriers to voting during a U.S. election from 1996 to 2016. COVID-19 case and mortality rates were obtained from the New York Times' GitHub database (a compilation from multiple academic sources). Multilevel modeling was used to determine whether restrictive voting laws were associated with county-level COVID-19 case and mortality rates after controlling for county-level characteristics from the County Health Rankings. We tested whether associations were heterogeneous across racial and socioeconomic groups.A significant association was observed between increasing voting restrictions and COVID-19 case (ß = 580.5, 95% CI = 3.9, 1157.2) and mortality rates (ß = 16.5, 95% CI = 0.33,32.6) when confounders were included.Restrictive voting laws were associated with higher COVID-19 case and mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W4281773642,"The Cueva de Ardales is a hugely important Palaeolithic site in the south of the Iberian Peninsula owing to its rich inventory of rock art. From 2011-2018, excavations were carried out in the cave for the first time ever by a Spanish-German research team. The excavation focused on the entrance area of the cave, where the largest assemblage of non-figurative red paintings in the cave is found. A series of 50 AMS dates from the excavations prove a long, albeit discontinuous, occupation history spanning from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Neolithic. The dating of the Middle Palaeolithic layers agrees with the U/Th dating of some red non-figurative paintings in the entrance area. In addition, a large assemblage of ochre lumps was discovered in the Middle Palaeolithic layers. Human visits of the cave in the Gravettian and Solutrean can be recognized, but evidence from the Aurignacian and Magdalenian cannot be confirmed with certainty. The quantity and nature of materials found during the excavations indicate that Cueva de Ardales was not a campsite, but was mainly visited to carry out non-domestic tasks, such as the production of rock art or the burial of the dead."
https://openalex.org/W4282035070,"Objectives To assess the psychometric characteristics of the Spanish Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale (web-based and paper-based forms) and the test-retest reliability of the web-based form. Study design and setting Cross-sectional study of 125 COVID-19 survivors. The test-retest reliability of the web-based form was assessed at 7 days after the first evaluation. We collected symptoms, functional status (PCFS scale), health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L), activities of daily living limitations [Barthel Index and Global Activity Limitation Index, GALI] and psychological state (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS). Results The paper- and web-based forms of the Spanish PCFS scale showed adequate construct validity, and the web-based form provided substantial test-retest reliability (kappa = 0.63). The percentage of agreement between the web-based and paper-based forms was high (88%). Functional status showed a high correlation with EQ-5D-5L (inverse) and GALI (direct) (both; Rho ≥ .743), a moderate correlation with HADS (Rho ≥ .409) and a low correlation with the Barthel Index (Rho &lt; .30). The Kruskal–Wallis test showed statistically significant differences in EQ-5D-5L, GALI and HADS according to the degree of functional status. Conclusion The Spanish version of the PCFS scale (web-based and paper-based forms) showed adequate construct validity, and the web-based form provided substantial test-retest reliability in COVID-19 survivors."
https://openalex.org/W4281486258,"Many drugs and prebiotics derive their activities from sugar substituents. Due to the prevalence and complexity of these biologically active compounds, enzymatic glycodiversification that facilitates easier access to these compounds can make profound contributions to the pharmaceutical, food, and feed industries. Amylosucrases (ASases) are attractive tools for glycodiversification because of their broad acceptor substrate specificity, but the lack of structural information and their poor thermostability limit their industrial applications. Herein, we reported the crystal structure of ASase from Calidithermus timidus, which displays a homotetrameric quaternary organization not previously observed for other ASases. We employed a workflow composed of five common strategies, including interface engineering, folding energy calculations, consensus sequence, hydrophobic effects enhancement, and B-factor analysis, to enhance the thermostability of C. timidus ASase. As a result, we obtained a quadruple-point mutant M31 ASase with a half-life at 65 °C increased from 22.91 h to 52.93 h, which could facilitate biosynthesis of glucans with a degree of polymerization of more than 20 using sucrose as a substrate at 50 °C. In conclusion, this study provides a structural basis for understanding the multifunctional biocatalyst ASase and presents a powerful methodology to effectively and systematically enhance protein thermostability."
https://openalex.org/W4281565043,"Placental nitric oxide (NO) is critical for maintaining perfusion in the maternal-fetal-placental circulation during normal pregnancy. NO and its many metabolites are also increased in pregnancies complicated by maternal inflammation such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, gestational diabetes, and bacterial infection. However, it is unclear how increased levels of NO or its metabolites affect placental function or how the placenta deals with excessive levels of NO or its metabolites. Since there is uncertainty over the direction of change in plasma levels of NO metabolites in preeclampsia, we measured the levels of these metabolites at the placental tissue level. We found that NO metabolites are increased in placentas from patients with preeclampsia compared to healthy controls. We also discovered by ozone-based chemiluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance that nitrite is efficiently converted into iron nitrosyl complexes (FeNOs) within the human placenta and also observed the existence of endogenous FeNOs within placentas from sheep and rats. We show these nitrite-derived FeNOs are relatively short-lived, predominantly protein-bound, heme-FeNOs. The efficient formation of FeNOs from nitrite in the human placenta hints toward the importance of both nitrite and FeNOs in placental physiology or pathology. As iron nitrosylation is an important posttranslational modification that affects the activity of multiple iron-containing proteins such as those in the electron transport chain, or those involved in epigenetic regulation, we conclude that FeNOs merit increased study in pregnancy complications."
https://openalex.org/W4281725022,"With the growing concerns about research reproducibility and replicability, the assessment of scientific results' fragility (or robustness) has been of increasing interest. The fragility index was proposed to quantify the robustness of statistical significance of clinical studies with binary outcomes. It is defined as the minimal event status modifications that can alter statistical significance. It helps clinicians evaluate the reliability of the conclusions. Many factors may affect the fragility index, including the treatment groups in which event status is modified, the statistical methods used for testing for the association between treatments and outcomes, and the pre-specified significance level. In addition to assessing the fragility of individual studies, the fragility index was recently extended to both conventional pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses of multiple treatment comparisons. It is not straightforward for clinicians to calculate these measures and visualize the results. We have developed an R package called ""fragility"" to offer user-friendly functions for such purposes. This article provides an overview of methods for assessing and visualizing the fragility of individual studies as well as pairwise and network meta-analyses, introduces the usage of the ""fragility"" package, and illustrates the implementations with several worked examples."
https://openalex.org/W4281819868,"The art of making good choices and being consistent in executing them is essential for having a successful and fulfilling life. Individual differences in action control are believed to have a crucial impact on how we make choices and whether we put them in action. Action-oriented people are more decisive, flexible and likely to implement their intentions in the face of adversity. In contrast, state-oriented people often struggle to commit to their choices and end up second-guessing themselves. Here, we employ a model-based computational approach to study the underlying cognitive differences between action and state-oriented people in simple binary-choice decision tasks. In Experiment 1 we show that there is little-to-no evidence that the two groups differ in terms of decision-related parameters and strong evidence for differences in metacognitive bias. Action-oriented people exhibit greater confidence in the correctness of their choices as well as slightly elevated judgement sensitivity, although no differences in performance are present. In Experiment 2 we replicate this effect and show that the confidence gap generalizes to value-based decisions, widens as a function of difficulty and is independent of deliberation interval. Furthermore, allowing more time for confidence deliberation indicated that state-oriented people focus more strongly on external features of choice. We propose that a positive confidence bias, coupled with appropriate metacognitive sensitivity, might be crucial for the successful realization of intentions in many real-life situations. More generally, our study provides an example of how modelling latent cognitive processes can bring meaningful insight into the study of individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W4281553271,"The ubiquinone (UQ) reduction step catalyzed by NADH-UQ oxidoreductase (mitochondrial respiratory complex I) is key to triggering proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structural studies have identified a long, narrow, UQ-accessing tunnel within the enzyme. We previously demonstrated that synthetic oversized UQs, which are unlikely to transit this narrow tunnel, are catalytically reduced by native complex I embedded in submitochondrial particles but not by the isolated enzyme. To explain this contradiction, we hypothesized that access of oversized UQs to the reaction site is obstructed in the isolated enzyme because their access route is altered following detergent solubilization from the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the present study, we investigated this using two pairs of photoreactive UQs (pUQm-1/pUQp-1 and pUQm-2/pUQp-2), with each pair having the same chemical properties except for a ∼1.0 Å difference in side-chain widths. Despite this subtle difference, reduction of the wider pUQs by the isolated complex was significantly slower than of the narrower pUQs, but both were similarly reduced by the native enzyme. In addition, photoaffinity-labeling experiments using the four [125I]pUQs demonstrated that their side chains predominantly label the ND1 subunit with both enzymes but at different regions around the tunnel. Finally, we show that the suppressive effects of different types of inhibitors on the labeling significantly changed depending on [125I]pUQs used, indicating that [125I]pUQs and these inhibitors do not necessarily share a common binding cavity. Altogether, we conclude that the reaction behaviors of pUQs cannot be simply explained by the canonical UQ tunnel model.

These outcomes have led to the consensus that structural and electrostatic rearrangements induced by the quinone reduction, which occurs at the interface between the hydrophilic and membrane arms, transmit to the membrane subunits to trigger proton translocation.

This UQ-accessing tunnel extends from a narrow entry point (∼5 Å diameter), which is located at the middle of the membrane-embedded subunit ND1, to the cluster N2. The so-called quinone-site inhibitors such as piericidin A and rotenone have been considered to block the catalytic reaction of UQ by occupying the tunnel (21Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S.

Recent cryo-EM studies identified the densities attributed to these inhibitors, although two (not one) inhibitor molecules bound inside the tunnel (13Bridges H.R. Fedor J.G. Blaza J.N. Lica A.D.

The coupling mechanism of mammalian respiratory complex I.Science. 2020; 370eabc4209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the rigid and narrow cavity originally modeled in crystallographic maps from Thermus thermophilus complex I (21Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A. Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I.Nature. 2013; 494: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), recent cryo-EM studies of mammalian complex I indicated that the shape of the UQ-accessing tunnel substantially changes depending on the enzyme’s states (e.g., active/deactive or open/closed states) or bound ligands because of large conformational rearrangements of three loops connecting transmembrane helixes (TMHs) 5 to 6 of ND1, TMHs 1 to 2 of ND3, and β1−β2 of 49-kDa subunits (9Agip A.-N.A.

The coupling mechanism of mammalian respiratory complex I.Science. 2020; 370eabc4209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the original idea of a rigid and closed UQ-accessing tunnel based on T. thermophilus complex I (21Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A. Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I.Nature. 2013; 494: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) has been gradually shifting toward a more flexible one. However, this also raises the following question: if the tunnel architecture changes substantially during catalytic turnover, how are redox reactions of UQ in the tunnel insulated from the protons present in the bulk matrix side (or N phase) of the membrane, because premature protonation of reduced UQ intermediates in the tunnel will result in loss of energy. To explain this, various gating mechanisms have been proposed in recent joint structural–computational studies (15Parey K. Lasham J. Mills D.J. Djurabekova A. Haapanen O.

For example, oversized UQs (OS-UQs), which have an extremely bulky “block” (∼13 Å across) attached to their side chains (e.g., OS-UQ2 and OS-UQ3, Fig. S1), were able to function as electron acceptors from native complex I embedded in bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMPs) (27Uno S.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that their transition through the narrow UQ tunnel is not energetically feasible (27Uno S. Masuya T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Lasham J. Haapanen O.

The reduction of these OS-UQs and proton translocation coupled with their reduction were fully inhibitor sensitive, indicating that the reaction of OS-UQs takes place at the physiological catalytic site in the enzyme. In addition, photoaffinity-labeling studies using various inhibitors showed that they do not necessarily enter the UQ-accessing tunnel but rather bind to different positions around the tunnel (25Uno S.

The matrix-side interfacial domain of the 49-kDa, ND1, and PSST subunits, which is peripherally covered by a loop connecting TMHs 1 to 2 of ND3, would be one of the possible areas that bulky ligands can access the UQ reaction cavity (25Uno S.

In support of this, we recently demonstrated that Cys39 of ND3 and Asp160 of 49 kDa, which are located on the matrix-side TMHs 1 to 2 loop and deep inside the cavity, respectively, can be crosslinked by synthetic bifunctional crosslinkers (29Masuya T.

Biol. 2018; 25: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the UQ reaction cavity is accessible from the proposed matrix-side domain covered by the ND3-TMHs 1 to 2 loop. Interestingly, an MD simulation study reported that small UQ1 can leave from the UQ reaction cavity to the matrix-side medium through a route, which is also close to the ND3-TMHs 1 to 2 loop (30Haapanen O. Djurabekova A. Sharma V. Role of second quinone binding site in proton pumping by respiratory complex I.Front. Chem. 2019; 7: 221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent cryo-EM study of porcine complex I demonstrated that short-chain UQs such as UQ1 can diffuse into the deep reaction site near the cluster N2 even in the presence of endogenous UQ10 in the tunnel, suggesting that some alternative route exists to support the entry of short-chain UQs into the site (31Gu J. Liu T. Guo R. Zhang L. Yang M. The coupling mechanism of mammalian mitochondrial complex I.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2022; 29: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Concerning the reaction of OS-UQs, there remains an important question to be addressed: although OS-UQ2 and OS-UQ3 could function as electron acceptors from the native complex I embedded in SMPs, why were they unable to function with the isolated enzyme? (27Uno S. Masuya T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Lasham J. Haapanen O. Shiba T. et al.Oversized ubiquinones as molecular probes for structural dynamics of the ubiquinone reaction site in mitochondrial respiratory complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 2449-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To answer this, we tentatively hypothesized that the head-ring of OS-UQs cannot reach the reaction site near the Fe–S cluster N2 because their access route in the native enzyme is altered by detergent solubilizing from the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (27Uno S. Masuya T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Lasham J. Haapanen O. Shiba T. et al.Oversized ubiquinones as molecular probes for structural dynamics of the ubiquinone reaction site in mitochondrial respiratory complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 2449-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (note that it is unclear whether the access route is the same as the main tunnel identified in the structural studies, and this point is the principal issue to be focused on in this study). Unfortunately, we currently have no direct way of inspecting structural differences, if any, between native and isolated enzymes. To find a clue to the contradiction, further biochemical characterizations of the reaction manners of varying bulky UQs are needed. In particular, it is important to examine whether such different reaction behaviors of OS-UQs between the native and isolated complex I are exceptional cases just for these extremely bulky UQs or if it is also the case for other UQs possessing various chemical blocks in the side chain.With this background, if we are able to produce a pair of UQs satisfying the following two requirements, they may become highly useful chemical tools for investigating the mechanism of UQ reduction as well as the cause of the aforementioned contradictory results. As the first requirement, the pair of UQs must have the same chemical properties except for a subtle difference in widths of their blocks attached to the side chain, namely a pair of narrow and wide UQs. If there are some structural differences in the UQ access route between the native and isolated complex I, as previously hypothesized (27Uno S. Masuya T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Lasham J. Haapanen O. Shiba T. et al.Oversized ubiquinones as molecular probes for structural dynamics of the ubiquinone reaction site in mitochondrial respiratory complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 2449-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the obstruction “threshold,” which restricts the access of UQs to the deep reaction site near the cluster N2, may also be different between the two enzymes. In that case, the wider UQ may function as an electron acceptor from the native complex I but not from the isolated enzyme because of more severe obstruction. In contrast, the narrower UQ may be free from the obstruction and function with both enzymes. Production of the pair of UQs that satisfies the first requirement would enable us to examine this. Here, similar chemical properties of the UQ pair are advantageous in simplifying comparison of their reaction manners; for example, both UQs exhibit similar partitioning behavior between the reaction medium and IMM. As the second requirement, to identify and compare the binding site of the pair of UQs by a photoaffinity-labeling technique, their side chains must be equipped with both a photolabile group (e.g., an azido group) and detecting tag (e.g., 125I or 3H). Although synthesis of the UQ pair solely satisfying the first requirement may not be particularly difficult, the second requirement highly limits available chemical components for constructing the side chain’s framework. The present study was aimed to synthesize a pair of UQs satisfying the two requirements at the same time.Through trial-and-error syntheses, we succeeded in producing two pairs of desired UQs: pUQm-1 and pUQp-1 and their respective hydrophobic analogs pUQm-2 and pUQp-2 (Fig. 1). The wider pUQp-1 and pUQp-2 functioned as efficient electron acceptors from the native complex I but not from the isolated enzyme. Photoaffinity-labeling experiments indicated that the side chains of the four [125I]pUQs predominantly label the ND1 subunit and subsidiarily ND5 and ND2, which are located far from the UQ-accessing tunnel. The labeling profiles against the three subunits varied not only between the narrower and wider UQs but also between the native and isolated complexes. None of the six inhibitors tested, which are considered to occupy the UQ-accessing tunnel (13Bridges H.R. Fedor J.G. Blaza J.N. Lica A.D. Jussupow A.

Based on the results, we discuss the diverse reaction behaviors of UQs in complex I in comparison with the canonical UQ tunnel model. This study presents the first photoaffinity-labeling experiments performed using UQ derivatives with complex I.ResultsMolecular design of photoreactive pUQsTo produce a pair of UQs satisfying the aforementioned two requirements, we synthesized many UQs that have various functionalized benzenes in their side chains. Among them, we obtained two pairs of desired UQs: pUQm-1 and pUQp-1 and their respective hydrophobic derivatives pUQm-2 and pUQp-2 (Fig. 1). The synthetic procedures of these pUQs are described in the supporting information (Schemes S1 and S2). In these pUQs, CF3-diazirine and 125I were used as a photolabile group and detecting tag, respectively. The functionalized benzene part in these pUQs serves not only as the “block” that influences their reaction with the enzyme but also as the essential outfit for photoaffinity labeling. These blocks are significantly less bulky compared with that attached to OS-UQs previously studied (Fig. S1). The chemical properties are the same between pUQm-1 and pUQp-1 and between pUQm-2 and pUQp-2 except for a subtle difference in the width of the benzene part, which was fine-tuned by meta- versus para-substitution patterns of CF3-diazirine and iodine (Fig. 1). The planar molecular width of the para-substituted benzene (pUQp-1 and pUQp-2) is slightly longer (∼1.0 Å) than that of the meta-substituted benzene (pUQm-1 and pUQm-2). Therefore, if these artificial UQs encounter steric obstruction during accessing the reaction site in the enzyme, the para derivatives may be subject to more severe obstruction than the corresponding meta derivatives. Although the difference in their widths is small, it actually served as a key structural factor that differentiates the reaction behaviors between the wider (para) and narrower (meta) pUQs with the isolated complex I, as described hereafter.Modeling and simulations of the binding of pUQs to complex IEarlier chemical biology studies (25Uno S.

https://openalex.org/W4281554265,"Mammalian reproduction depends on the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone, which are secreted by pituitary gonadotrope cells. The zinc-finger transcription factor GATA2 was previously implicated in FSH production in male mice; however, its mechanisms of action and role in females were not determined. To directly address GATA2 function in gonadotropes, we generated and analyzed gonadotrope-specific Gata2 KO mice using the Cre-lox system. We found that while conditional KO (cKO) males exhibited ∼50% reductions in serum FSH levels and pituitary FSHβ subunit (Fshb) expression relative to controls, FSH production was apparently normal in cKO females. In addition, RNA-seq analysis of purified gonadotropes from control and cKO males revealed a profound decrease in expression of gremlin (Grem1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. We show Grem1 was expressed in gonadotropes, but not other cell lineages, in the adult male mouse pituitary. Furthermore, Gata2, Grem1, and Fshb mRNA levels were significantly higher in the pituitaries of WT males relative to females but decreased in males treated with estradiol and increased following ovariectomy in control but not cKO females. Finally, we found that recombinant gremlin stimulated Fshb expression in pituitary cultures from WT mice. Collectively, the data suggest that GATA2 promotes Grem1 expression in gonadotropes and that the gremlin protein potentiates FSH production. The mechanisms of gremlin action have not yet been established but may involve attenuation of BMP binding to activin type II receptors in gonadotropes, facilitating induction of Fshb transcription by activins or related ligands."
https://openalex.org/W4281562265,"BMPR2 is a type II Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β family receptor that is fundamentally associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in humans. BMPR2 shares functional similarities with the type II activin receptors ACVR2A and ACVR2B, as it interacts with an overlapping group of TGF-β family growth factors (GFs). However, how BMPR2 recognizes GFs remains poorly understood. Here, we solved crystal structures of BMPR2 in complex with the GF activin B and of ACVR2A in complex with the related GF activin A. We show that both BMPR2 and ACVR2A bind GFs with nearly identical geometry using a conserved hydrophobic hot spot, while differences in contacting residues are predominantly found in loop areas. Upon further exploration of the GF-binding spectrum of the two receptors, we found that although many GFs bind both receptors, the high-affinity BMPR2 GFs comprise BMP15, BMP10, and Nodal, whereas those of ACVR2A are activin A, activin B, and GDF11. Lastly, we evaluated GF-binding domain BMPR2 variants found in human PAH patients. We demonstrate that mutations within the GF-binding interface resulted in loss of GF binding, while mutations in loop areas allowed BMPR2 to retain the ability to bind cognate GFs with high affinity. In conclusion, the in vitro activities of BMPR2 variants and the crystal structures reported here indicate biochemically relevant complexes that explain how some GF-binding domain variants can lead to PAH."

We purposively selected the Patna and Vaishali districts of Bihar for the survey. Thematic analysis was done to identify the pattern across the data using the Atlas-ti software.Most participants showed a good understanding of registration procedures and birth and death registration benefits. The perceived need for death registration is lower than birth registration. Birth registration was higher among female children than male children. We found that most participants did not report children or adult female death due to lack of financial or property-related benefits. Most participants faced challenges in reporting birth and death due to poor delivery of services at the registration centres, higher indirect opportunity cost, and demand of bribes by the CRS staff for providing certificates. We found a lack of adequate investment, shortage of dedicated staff, and limited computer and internet services at the registration centres.Poor data on birth and death registration could lead decision-makers to target health services inappropriately. Strengthening health institutions' linkage with the registration centres, mobile registration in far-flung areas and regular CRS staff training could increase death registration levels. An adequate awareness campaign on the benefits of birth and death registration is required to increase the reporting of vital events."

https://openalex.org/W4281766681,"Laminins (LMs) are essential components of all basement membranes where they regulate an extensive array of tissue functions. Alternative splicing from the laminin α3 gene produces a non-laminin but netrin-like protein, Laminin N terminus α31 (LaNt α31). LaNt α31 is widely expressed in intact tissue and is upregulated in epithelial cancers and during wound healing. In vitro functional studies have shown that LaNt α31 can influence numerous aspects of epithelial cell behavior via modifying matrix organization, suggesting a new model of laminin auto-regulation. However, the function of this protein has not been established in vivo. Here, a mouse transgenic line was generated using the ubiquitin C promoter to drive inducible expression of LaNt α31. When expression was induced at embryonic day 15.5, LaNt α31 transgenic animals were not viable at birth, exhibiting localized regions of erythema. Histologically, the most striking defect was widespread evidence of extravascular bleeding across multiple tissues. Additionally, LaNt α31 transgene expressing animals exhibited kidney epithelial detachment, tubular dilation, disruption of the epidermal basal cell layer and of the hair follicle outer root sheath, and ~50% reduction of cell numbers in the liver, associated with depletion of hematopoietic erythrocytic foci. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that LaNt α31 can influence tissue morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4281780254,"Background Ethiopia federal ministry of health has been working on increasing access to immunization service by deploying solar refrigerators to primary health care facilities. However, there is limited evidence on cold chain and vaccine management status. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess knowledge of vaccine handlers and status of cold chain and vaccine management and their associated factors in primary health care facilities of Tigray region Northern Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted in four randomly selected districts of Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. In each selected district, all primary health care facilities with functional vaccine refrigerators were included in the study. Data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and then exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for analysis. All variables with p-value of &lt; 0.25 in bivariate logistic regression analysis were included in multi-variable model to identify predictors of the dependent variables. Results In this study, fifty Primary Health Care Facilities (PHCFs) were included with a response rate of 94.4%. The overall level of good knowledge of vaccine handlers and good status of cold chain and vaccine management were 48% (95% CI; 30.7%-62%) and 46% (95%CI; 26.1%-61.3%) respectively. Receiving training on cold chain and vaccine management (AOR = 5.18; 95%CI: 1.48–18.18) was significantly associated with knowledge of vaccine handlers. Furthermore, receiving supportive supervision (AOR = 4.58; 95%CI: 1.04–20.17) and good knowledge of vaccine handlers (AOR = 10.97; 95%CI: 2.67–45.07) were significant associated with cold chain and vaccine management. Conclusions This study showed that knowledge of vaccine handlers on cold chain and vaccine management was poor. Similarly, the cold chain and vaccine management status was also poor. Therefore, on-site training should be provided to vaccine handlers to increase their knowledge, so as to improve their practices on cold chain and vaccine management. In addition, Programme based supportive supervision is needed to improve cold chain and vaccine management."

The following aspects of feasibility were explored: recruitment capability and sample characteristics, data collection procedures and outcome measures, appropriateness, implementation, and practicality of the intervention. Fidelity was explored by evaluating the delivery of intervention components against set criteria. Preliminary effectiveness was investigated by evaluating changes in intervention outcomes pre-post intervention using a range of outcome measures. Study findings are encouraging, suggesting In My Shoes is a feasible and appropriate intervention, and shows promise in improving the self-report school engagement of all student participants, as well the classroom participation and subjective school experiences of students on the autism spectrum. Useful insights into ways the intervention and the design of future research can be improved are discussed."

It is associated with increased maternal, neonatal morbidity and perinatal complications if it is not used appropriately. Instrumental delivery use needs health care providers' skills, knowledge, and decision-making ability for good maternal outcomes.This study aimed to assess immediate unfavorable birth outcomes and associated factors of operative vaginal delivery among women delivered in East Gojjam Zone Public Hospitals, North West Ethiopia.The study design was institution based cross-sectional and consecutive sampling procedure was used to select 313 mothers in the study, from March 1, 2019, to April 30, 2019. We used Epi data version 3.1 for data entry and SPSS version 25 software for cleaning and analysis. A Bivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between each outcome variable and each factor. Again, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with each outcome variable, and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were taken as significant variables.The overall unfavorable maternal outcomes of operative vaginal delivery were found to be 32.9% [95% CI: 27.8, 38.3]. No formal education (AOR = 8.36; 95% CI: 1.01, 69.2), rural residence (AOR: 11.77; 95% CI: 2.02, 68.41), male sex of the neonate (AOR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.08, 7.61) and zero station during instrumental application (AOR: 6.93; 95% CI: 1.75, 27.5) were factors associated with unfavorable maternal outcomes. The study also showed that the magnitude of unfavorable neonatal outcomes was 34.8% (95% CI: 29.7, 40.3). Vaginal first-degree tear (AOR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.951) and blood transfusion (AOR = 7.38, 95% CI: 1.18-46.15) was statistically significant factors associated with unfavorable neonatal outcomes.The overall unfavorable maternal and neonatal outcomes of operative vaginal delivery were high compared with some other studies done in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4281986445,"Background Vaccines are effective in preventing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine hesitancy defined as delay of acceptance or refusal of the vaccine is a major barrier to effective implementation. Methods Participants were recruited statewide through an English and Spanish social media marketing campaign conducted by a local news station during a one-month period as vaccines were becoming available in Rhode Island (from December 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021). Participants completed an online survey about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine hesitancy with constructs and items adopted from the Health Belief Model. Results A total of 2,007 individuals completed the survey. Eight percent (n = 161) reported vaccine hesitancy. The sample had a median age of 58 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 45, 67), were majority female (78%), White (96%), Non-Hispanic (94%), employed (58%), and reported an annual individual income of $50,000 (59%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19. A one unit increase in concern about COVID-19 was associated with a 69% (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.26–0.37) decrease in vaccine hesitancy. A one-level increase in the likelihood of getting influenza vaccine was associated with a 55% (AOR: 0.45 95% CI: 0.41–0.50) decrease in vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was relatively low in a state-wide survey in Rhode Island. Future research is needed to better understand and tailor messaging related to vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4282011662,"There is broad recognition by practicing taxonomists that the field is going through a crisis, which has been dubbed the “taxonomic impediment”. There are many aspects involved in said crisis, but publication practices in taxonomy are often neglected or relegated to the backseat. We provide an initial foray into this topic via a worldwide survey with taxonomists, spanning all botanical and zoological groups, and career stages. Demographically, most of the respondents identified themselves as males (70%), working in Europe or North America (68%), in universities (50%) or museums (27%). Over half of the respondents are established/late-career researchers (only about 25% of full professors were female), with a low number of early-career researchers and graduate students (i.e., taxonomists in training). Nearly 61% of the men acquired their highest title at least eleven years ago, while only 41% of the women did so. Nearly 92% of the respondents have published new species descriptions, while around 60% and 26% have synonymized, respectively, species-level or subspecies-level taxa. In general, respondents perceive the act of describing new species to be easier than synonymizing species ( p = 0.05). Established/late-career researchers and male researchers, particularly in Oceania and North America, found it easier to publish nomenclatural acts such as new species descriptions, while early-career researchers had their acts contested more often. Our results reaffirm the low academic recognition of the field, the lack of funding for research and publishing charges especially in the Global South, and the difficulty in finding specialized outlets (and the low impact factor of those journals) as persistent issues in taxonomy. Other significant problems raised by respondents include ethical issues in the peer-review process, a bias against newcomers in the field coming either from established researchers or committees, and taxonomic vandalism."
https://openalex.org/W4282031535,"We introduce and quantify a relatively new form of influence: the Answer Bot Effect (ABE). In a 2015 report in PNAS, researchers demonstrated the power that biased search results have to shift opinions and voting preferences without people's knowledge-by up to 80% in some demographic groups. They labeled this phenomenon the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), speculating that its power derives from the high level of trust people have in algorithmically-generated content. We now describe three experiments with a total of 1,736 US participants conducted to determine to what extent giving users ""the answer""-either via an answer box at the top of a page of search results or via a vocal reply to a question posed to an intelligent personal assistant (IPA)-might also impact opinions and votes. Participants were first given basic information about two candidates running for prime minister of Australia (this, in order to assure that participants were ""undecided""), then asked questions about their voting preferences, then given answers to questions they posed about the candidates-either with answer boxes or with vocal answers on an Alexa simulator-and then asked again about their voting preferences. The experiments were controlled, randomized, double-blind, and counterbalanced. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that answer boxes can shift voting preferences by as much as 38.6% and that the appearance of an answer box can reduce search times and clicks on search results. Experiment 3 demonstrated that even a single question-and-answer interaction on an IPA can shift voting preferences by more than 40%. Multiple questions posed to an IPA leading to answers that all have the same bias can shift voting preferences by more than 65%. Simple masking procedures still produced large opinion shifts while reducing awareness of bias to close to zero. ABE poses a serious threat to both democracy and human autonomy because (a) it produces large shifts in opinions and voting preferences with little or no user awareness, (b) it is an ephemeral form of influence that leaves no paper trail, and (c) worldwide, it is controlled almost exclusively by just four American tech companies. ABE will become a greater threat as people increasingly rely on IPAs for answers."
https://openalex.org/W4281615881,"Transcriptomic analysis of cancer samples helps identify the mechanism and molecular markers of cancer. However, transcriptomic analyses of pancreatic cancer from the Japanese population are lacking. Hence, in this study, we performed RNA sequencing of fresh and frozen pancreatic cancer tissues from 12 Japanese patients to identify genes critical for the clinical pathology of pancreatic cancer among the Japanese population. Additionally, we performed immunostaining of 107 pancreatic cancer samples to verify the results of RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA sequencing data identified ITGB1 (Integrin beta 1) as an important gene for pancreatic cancer metastasis, progression, and prognosis. ITGB1 expression was verified using immunostaining. The results of RNA sequencing and immunostaining showed a significant correlation (r = 0.552, p = 0.118) in ITGB1 expression. Moreover, the ITGB1 high-expression group was associated with a significantly worse prognosis (p = 0.035) and recurrence rate (p = 0.028). We believe that ITGB1 may be used as a drug target for pancreatic cancer in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4281705068,"Oxygen is an important and often limiting reagent of a firefly's bioluminescent chemical reaction. Therefore, the development of the tracheal system and its subsequent modification to support the function of firefly light organs are key to understanding this process. We employ micro-CT scanning, 3D rendering, and confocal microscopy to assess the abdominal tracheal system in Photinus pyralis from the external spiracles to the light organ's internal tracheal brush, a feature named here for the first time. The abdominal spiracles in firefly larvae and pupae are of the biforous type, with a filter apparatus and appear to have an occlusor muscle to restrict airflow. The first abdominal spiracle in the adult firefly is enlarged and bears an occlusor muscle, and abdominal spiracles two through eight are small, with a small atrium and bilobed closing apparatus. Internal tracheal system features, including various branches, trunks, and viscerals, were homologized across life stages. In adults, the sexually dimorphic elaboration and increase in volume associated with tracheal features of luminous segments emphasizes the importance of gas exchange during the bioluminescent process."
https://openalex.org/W4281756737,"Oral infections, particularly periodontitis, are a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG-LPS) on cardiac function in mice, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected with PG-LPS (0.8 mg/kg/day) with or without an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (TAK-242, 0.8 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Left ventricular ejection function was significantly decreased at 1 week (from 67 ± 0.5 to 58 ± 1.2%) and remained low at 4 weeks (57 ± 1.0%). The number of apoptotic myocytes was increased (approximately 7.4-fold), the area of fibrosis was increased (approximately 3.3-fold) and the number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive myocytes, a sensitive indicator of oxidative DNA damage, was increased (approximately 7.6-fold) at 4 weeks in the heart of PG-LPS treated mice. However, levels of various serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in PG-LPS-treated mice were similar to those in control mice. The impairment of cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice appears to involve activation of TLR4-NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4 signaling, leading to abundant production of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ leakage from sarcoplastic reticulumn induced by calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban (at Thr-17) and ryanodine receptor 2 (at Ser-2448). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 with TAK-242 attenuated the changes in cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice. Our results indicate that TLR4-NOX4 signaling may be a new therapeutic target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients with periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W4281904736,"Children typically prefer to attend to social stimuli (e.g. faces, smiles) over non-social stimuli (e.g. natural scene, household objects). This preference for social stimuli is believed to be an essential building block for later social skills and healthy social development. Preference for social stimuli are typically measured using either passive viewing or instrumental choice paradigms, but not both. Since these paradigms likely tap into different mechanisms, the current study addresses this gap by administering both of these paradigms on an overlapping sample. In this study, we use a preferential looking task and an instrumental choice task to measure preference for social stimuli in 3-9 year old typically developing children. Children spent longer looking at social stimuli in the preferential looking task but did not show a similar preference for social rewards on the instrumental choice task. Task performance in these two paradigms were not correlated. Social skills were found to be positively related to the preference for social rewards on the choice task. This study points to putatively different mechanisms underlying the preference for social stimuli, and highlights the importance of choice of paradigms in measuring this construct."
https://openalex.org/W4281989084,"Cetacean neuropathology is a developing field that aims to assess structural and neurochemical changes involved in neurodegenerative, infectious and traumatic processes, however markers used previously in cetaceans have rarely undergone systematic validation. This is a prerequisite to investigating the potential damage inflicted on the cetacean auditory system by anthropogenic noise. In order to assess apoptotic, neuroinflammatory and structural aberrations on a protein level, the baseline expression of biomarker proteins has to be characterized, implementing a systematic approach to validate the use of anti-human and anti-laboratory animal antibodies in dolphin tissues. This approach was taken to study 12 different antibodies associated with hypoxic-ischemic, inflammatory, plastic and excitatory-inhibitory changes implicated in acoustic trauma within the ventral cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculi of 20 bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ). Out of the 12 tested antibodies, pro-apoptotic protease factor 1 (Apaf-1), diacylglycerolkinase-ζ (DGK-ζ), B-cell lymphoma related protein 2 (Bcl-2), amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and neurofilament 200 (NF200) were validated employing Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results of the validation process indicate specific patterns of immunoreactivity that are comparable to those reported in other mammals, thus suggesting a key panel of IHC biomarkers of pathological processes in the cetacean brain. As a consequence, the antibodies tested in this study may constitute a valid tool for supporting existing diagnostic methods in neurological diseases. The approach of systematic validation of IHC markers in cetaceans is proposed as a standard practice, in order for results to be transparent, reliable and comparable."
https://openalex.org/W4282049744,"A hybrid model integrating chaos theory, support vector machine (SVM) and the difference evolution grey wolf optimization (DEGWO) algorithm is developed to analyze and predict dam deformation. Firstly, the chaotic characteristics of the dam deformation time series will be identified, mainly using the Lyapunov exponent method, the correlation dimension method and the kolmogorov entropy method. Secondly, the hybrid model is established for dam deformation forecasting. Taking SVM as the core, the deformation time series is reconstructed in phase space to determine the input variables of SVM, and the GWO algorithm is improved to realize the optimization of SVM parameters. Prior to this, the effectiveness of DEGWO algorithm based on the fusion of the difference evolution (DE) and GWO algorithm has been verified by 15 sets of test functions in CEC 2005. Finally, take the actual monitoring displacement of Jinping I super-high arch dam as examples. The engineering application examples show that the PSR-SVM-DEGWO model established performs better in terms of fitting and prediction accuracy compared with existing models."
https://openalex.org/W4281562352,"Dengue viruses (DENV serotypes 1–4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are related flaviviruses that continue to be a public health concern, infecting hundreds of millions of people annually. The traditional live-attenuated virus vaccine approach has been challenging for the four DENV serotypes because of the need to achieve balanced replication of four independent vaccine components. Subunit vaccines represent an alternative approach that may circumvent problems inherent with live-attenuated DENV vaccines. In mature virus particles, the envelope (E) protein forms a homodimer that covers the surface of the virus and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. Many neutralizing antibodies bind to quaternary epitopes that span across both E proteins in the homodimer. For soluble E (sE) protein to be a viable subunit vaccine, the antigens should be easy to produce and retain quaternary epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies. However, WT sE proteins are primarily monomeric at conditions relevant for vaccination and exhibit low expression yields. Previously, we identified amino acid mutations that stabilize the sE homodimer from DENV2 and dramatically raise expression yields. Here, we tested whether these same mutations raise the stability of sE from other DENV serotypes and ZIKV. We show that the mutations raise thermostability for sE from all the viruses, increase production yields from 4-fold to 250-fold, stabilize the homodimer, and promote binding to dimer-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our findings suggest that these sE variants could be valuable resources in the efforts to develop effective subunit vaccines for DENV serotypes 1 to 4 and ZIKV.

Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that infect over 350 million people per year in tropical and subtropical regions around the world (1Bhatt S. Gething P.W.

Currently, there is no Food and Drug Administration–approved vaccine for ZIKV, and development of a vaccine for DENVs has been challenging because of the presence of four serotypes (DENV1–4) and the potential for DENV vaccines to stimulate antibodies that enhance WT DENV replication and disease severity. The leading live-attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccines designed to induce simultaneous immunity to the four serotypes have been plagued by imbalanced replication and variable efficacy depending on the DENV serotype and the DENV immune status prior to vaccination (2Hadinegoro S. Arredondo-Garcia J. Capeding M. Al E. Efficacy and long-term safety of a dengue vaccine in regions of endemic disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Dengvaxia, a tetravalent vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur, was efficacious in children who had pre-existing immunity from WT DENV infections. In children with no pre-existing immunity, the vaccine increased the risk of severe dengue disease compared with children who received a placebo (2Hadinegoro S. Arredondo-Garcia J. Capeding M. Al E.

As a result, there continues to be a strong need for safe vaccines that can provide balanced and long-lasting immunity against DENVs and ZIKV.As members of the Flaviviridae family, the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV share common structural features. Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses with 180 copies of an integral membrane glycoprotein, termed the envelope (E) protein that forms a smooth protein coat with icosahedral symmetry covering the outer surface of the mature infectious virus (3Zhang X.

The E protein consists of three β-barrel domains: EDI, EDII, and EDIII. EDII contains a highly conserved epitope responsible for fusion of the virus to host membrane (4Huang C.Y.H. Butrapet S.

Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These mutations are located in clusters that are spread throughout the E protein: in the core of EDI (mutation set called PM4), in the hinge region between EDI and EDII (mutation set called U6), at the central αB helix in EDII (mutation set called I2), and in the fusion loop of EDII (mutation set called I8, (22Kudlacek S.T. Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). I2 includes two mutations, A259W and T262R, that stabilize the E dimer by making pi–cation interactions with the symmetrical mutations on the other chain of the homodimer (Fig. 1). I8 consists of a single mutation, G106D, that forms new electrostatic interactions at the interface between EDII from one chain of the homodimer and EDIII from the other chain of the homodimer. Interestingly, U6 contains two mutations, T280P and F279W, that are not located at the homodimer interface but still stabilize the dimer. The U6 mutations are located in a flexible hinge that connects EDII and EDI and may stabilize the dimer by locking the hinge in a conformation that favors dimer formation (22Kudlacek S.T. Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The PM4 mutations, S29K, T33V, and A35M, are located in the core of EDI and do not stabilize the formation of the DENV2 E dimer, but they raise the thermal unfolding temperature of DENV2 sE by more than 10 °C. Combining the four mutation sets results in a DENV2 sE variant that remains a dimer at concentrations below 1 nM and has a temperature of unfolding (Tm) that is 14.9 °C higher than the WT protein. Mice immunized with this stabilized dimer elicited a population of dimer-specific binding antibodies that were not observed in mice immunized with WT DENV2 E protein. Moreover, the stable dimer elicited higher levels of DENV2-neutralizing antibodies compared with mice immunized with WT sE antigen (22Kudlacek S.T. Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Here, we test if the mutations identified for DENV2 also stabilize the sE dimers from DENV1, DENV3, DENV4, and ZIKV. We find that the mutations improve production yields, thermostability, and dimer affinity, although in some cases, the increases are smaller than observed for DENV2. The stabilized E proteins also show high binding to EDE and type-specific mAbs at 37 °C, unlike their WT counterparts. These designed sE variants are promising candidates for a tetravalent subunit vaccine that can elicit antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes, including EDE antibodies.ResultsRosetta-stabilizing mutations are in conserved regions of sEWe first examined a multiple sequence alignment of sE from the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV to see if the residues that were mutated to stabilize DENV2 sE are conserved in the other proteins (Fig. 1B). Overall, all four mutation sets are in highly conserved regions of sE. The residues mutated at the central αB helix (I2), in the core of EDI (PM4), and in the fusion loop (I8) are identical in all five proteins except that there is a Thr to Ser mutation in DENV4 at position 262 at the αB helix and a Thr to Val mutation in ZIKV at position 33 in the core of EDI. The two residues mutated in the hinge region between EDI and EDII (U6) are similar in the four DENV serotypes (Phe-Ala or Phe-Thr) but are Ser residues in ZIKV. We also examined the structure of sE to see if the residues proximal to the mutation sites are conserved. Aside from two residues located near the EDI and EDII hinge (U6), the residues neighboring the mutations are highly similar (Fig. S1). The high conservation at each mutation site as well as surrounding residues led us to hypothesize that the stabilizing mutations discovered in DENV2 sE would have similar effects when applied to the other DENV serotypes and ZIKV.Rosetta-stabilizing mutations increase protein production yieldsWe selected our best performing stabilizing combinations (SCs) of mutations from our previous work with DENV2 for experimental testing with DENV1/DENV3/DENV4 and ZIKV sE (Figs. 2A and S2). The SCs are named based on the conventions we used in our DENV2 sE study (22Kudlacek S.T. Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For example, DENV2 SC10 and DENV3 SC10 contain the same sets of mutations placed on the DENV2 sE and DENV3 sE background, respectively (specific mutations in Figs. 2 and S2). The Rosetta design variants were expressed in Expi293F cells as secreted proteins and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fig. S3A).Figure 2Rosetta stabilizing combinations (SCs) have increased yield and thermostability compared with WT proteins.

Here, we similarly found that the mutation sets boost levels of DENV1, 3, 4, and ZIKV sE secreted from cells. The largest enhancement was observed for the DENV1 sE protein variants. DENV1 WT sE secreted at very low levels, <0.1 mg protein per liter of culture, whereas the DENV1 variants had yields ranging from 6.9 mg/l (SC10) to 25.6 mg/l (SC12) (Fig. 2A). The SC12 variants were also the highest producing variants for DENV3, DENV4, and ZIKV, boosting production from 4-fold to 250-fold. Larger fold changes in yield were observed for the serotypes in which the WT protein was secreted poorly, particularly DENV1 (Fig. S2).We also added the stabilizing mutations to covalently linked sE dimers (Cm1), which contain a cysteine mutation (A259C in DENV1/2/4, A257C in DENV3, and A264C in ZIKV) in the central αB helix that forms a disulfide with the symmetric cysteine from the other chain in the homodimer (21Rouvinski A. Dejnirattisai W. Guardado-Calvo P. Vaney M.C. Sharma A. Duquerroy S. et al.Covalently linked dengue virus envelope glycoprotein dimers reduce exposure of the immunodominant fusion loop epitope.Nat. Commun. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These covalent dimers have similar or lower expression levels compared with WT, even when expressed in stable cell lines (Fig. S2). When the mutations sets I8, U6, and PM4 were added to the Cm1 variants (SC30), expression yields increased by more than eightfold for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 (Fig. 2A). For DENV1, we were not able to obtain measurable amounts of the Cm1 variant of the WT protein to make a comparison (SC30 expressed at 1.4 mg/l), and for ZIKV, the SC30 variant did not show enhanced yields compared with Cm1.DENV and ZIKV design variants are more thermally stable than their WT counterpartsNext, we characterized the thermal unfolding of the DENV and ZIKV design recombinant proteins using nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nano-DSF) and CD. The thermostability of a protein is reflected by their melting temperature at which half of the proteins are unfolded. Thermal transitions can be observed using nano-DSF via changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins, whereas with CD, it is the loss of secondary structure within the protein that is measured.Our nano-DSF measurements at 8 μM sE showed that all DENV and ZIKV SCs had higher Tm values than their WT counterparts, with increases ranging from 2 to 15 °C (Figs. 2A and S3B). The I2-I8-U6 mutation set (SC10) led to increases in Tm of 4 to 8 °C. Protein stability is increased further in all serotypes with the addition of PM4, which was consistent with our findings in DENV2 (22Kudlacek S.T. Metz S. Thiono D. Payne A.M. Phan T.T.N. Tian S. et al.Designed, highly expressing, thermostable dengue virus 2 envelope protein dimers elicit quaternary epitope antibodies.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabg4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). DENV SCs containing PM4 remain folded up to 60 °C, 10 °C higher than WT proteins (Fig. S2). SC12, which contains I2, I8, U6, and PM4, has the highest thermostability for all four DENV serotypes.For ZIKV, SC2 (I2-I8-PM4) is the most stable variant, raising the Tm from 46.4 °C (WT) to 56.5 °C (Fig. S2). Interestingly, the addition of U6 to SC2 lowers the thermostability of the protein to 53.6 °C (SC12, Fig. 2). This may reflect the low sequence conservation between DENV and ZIKV in the hinge region between EDI and EDII. Although the ZIKV SCs are more thermostable than ZIKV WT sE, the Tm is lower than that of DENV SCs. It is important to note that ZIKV WT sE is 4 to 6 °C less thermally stable than DENVs WT sE, and the SCs did improve Tm of ZIKV sE by 2 to 8 °C.CD spectra of the SC proteins at 10 μM (Fig. 2B) showed the unfolding of all proteins with increasing temperature. CD results corroborated that the SCs (brown and green) have higher Tms than the WT proteins (gray). Tm values extrapolated from CD spectra matched well with our nano-DSF results (Fig. 2A). Overall, these results showed that the thermostabilizing mutations from DENV2 also improved sE protein thermostability in DENV1/DENV3/DENV4 and ZIKV.Rosetta-stabilizing mutations promote sE dimer formationTo assess dimer formation at physiological temperature, we performed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering experiment (SEC-MALS) at 37 °C. We previously established that the WT proteins for DENV and ZIKV are weak homodimers and are primarily monomeric at 37 °C (20Kudlacek S.T. Premkumar L. Metz S.W. Tripathy A. Bobkov A.A.

Chem. 2018; 293: 8922-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). DENV3 WT migrates as three species by SEC. Approximately 13% of the protein eluted with a measured molar mass (MM) from MALS of 100 kDa, consistent with formation of a homodimer. For the remaining protein, which eluted as two species, the light scattering indicates both peaks were monomers (MM near 47 kDa), suggesting that the DENV3 monomer exists in two different monomer conformations. Similarly, DENV4 WT sE eluted in two peaks, both with measured MMs close to that of a monomer. ZIKV WT sE eluted in one peak with a fitted molecular weight of 60.3 kDa, which is between the expected weights for a monomer and dimer. We were unable to purify enough WT DENV1 sE to perform SEC–MALS. These results show that WT sE proteins exist in an equilibrium between monomer and dimer that favors the monomeric state at 37 °C.Figure 3DENV1/3/4 and ZIKV stabilizing combinations (SCs) have higher homodimer affinity than WT.

We found that for all serotypes, SC10 and SC12 eluted in a single peak with a measured MM close to the expected mass for a homodimer (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, the stabilized covalent dimer, SC30, was dimeric via SEC–MALS for all the proteins. We observed that I2 played an important role in stabilizing the sE homodimer for DENV1, DENV3, DENV4, and ZIKV (Fig. S2). SC29, which lacks I2, migrates either as a mixture between monomers and dimers (DENV3 and ZIKV) or as entirely monomer (DENV1).One disadvantage of SEC–MALS is that the protein concentrations needed to make a measurement (∼5 μM for sE) are higher than the typical nanomolar concentrations used during vaccination. To assess dimer stability at lower protein concentrations, we performed mass photometry, a single-molecule tec"

While the development of bioinformatics has helped elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying metabolic engineering of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, the biological information on the metabolic engineering of the morphology of Monascus remains unclear. In this study, the whole genome of M. purpureus CSU-M183 strain was sequenced using combined single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing platforms. The length of the genome assembly was 23.75 Mb in size with a GC content of 49.13%, 69 genomic contigs and encoded 7305 putative predicted genes. In addition, we identified the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and the chitin synthesis pathway in the genome of the high pigment-producing M. purpureus CSU-M183 strain. Furthermore, it is shown that the expression levels of most Monascus pigment and citrinin clusters located genes were significantly enhanced via atmospheric room temperature plasma mutagenesis. The results provide a basis for understanding the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and constructing the metabolic engineering of the morphology of Monascus."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the outcomes of CI, specifically on improvement of pronunciation, among hearing-impaired children already with a substantial degree of language skills as evaluated by Categories of Auditory Perception (CAP) scores or sentence score. Our cohort comprised pediatric CI recipients from July 2018 through October 2020. Among them, cases with CAP scores of 5 or 6 preoperatively were defined as ""borderline cases"". We investigated prevalence and etiologies, and compared speech evaluation data preoperatively and postoperatively at three time points (3, 6 and 9-12 months after implantation). Among 86 pediatric CI recipients, 13 subjects (15.12%) had language development that reached CAP scores of 5 or 6 before implantation. Postoperative speech evaluation data 6 months after implantation revealed significant improvement of pronunciation (Urimal Test of Articulation and Phonation scores: UTAP), Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and word perception scores, but not of CAP and sentence perception scores. Notably, the significant improvement of pronunciation based on UTAP scores outstripped that of other speech parameters and this continued steadily up to one-year postoperatively. The result of the study serves as evidence for what to expect from cochlear implantation in hearing-impaired children who have already achieved a substantial degree of language development in terms of CAP scores or sentence perception scores, preoperatively."
https://openalex.org/W4281720526,"Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder, is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk of the offspring in adulthood. In preeclampsia, endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) are reduced in number and function. Recently, we have shown that miR-1270, which is involved in cancer in vitro proliferation, migration, and tumor progression, is downregulated in fetal ECFC from preeclamptic pregnancies. We now hypothesize that miR-1270 dysregulation contributes to vascular endothelial dysfunction occurring after preeclampsia via ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) overexpression, the key kinase of DNA damage repair. Here, we show that miR-1270 silencing in normal ECFC and downregulation in preeclamptic ECFC are accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of ATM. Furthermore, ATM activation correlates with upregulated tyrosine kinase Src leading to phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin (vascular endothelial-cadherin) which subsequently compromises endothelial barrier permeability and morphodynamic cell parameters. Treatment with specific ATM inhibitors reveals a novel role of ATM upstream of tyrosine kinase Src activation. Subsequently, Src phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin compromise endothelial barrier permeability. Our findings suggest that downregulation of miR-1270 contributes to impaired ECFC function via the associated ATM overexpression, which further identifies ATM as a novel and critical factor for ECFC defects in preeclampsia. Our study provides new insights into the understanding of ECFC impairment associated with cardiovascular risk in preeclamptic offspring and identifies potential novel therapeutic targets."

As a major agricultural product, the sustainability and competitiveness of the apple industry have become important topics. This study analyzes the competitiveness of China's apple industry and the factors affecting it. Using 2004 and 2018 data for eight Chinese provinces, principal component analysis and spatial autocorrelation are used to examine competitiveness in terms of five aspects: market, production, technology, organization, and environment. The results indicate that Shandong, Shaanxi, and Gansu were the most competitive during the study period while Hebei, Henan, and Ningxia lagged behind. Regional differences are obvious, with Shandong in particular showing a clear competitive advantage. Although no spatial agglomeration is observed in China's apple industry, with ongoing industrial development, local spatial correlations in the five aspects of competitiveness in the eight provinces have been increasing and gradually stabilizing. This study's findings suggest that improved scientific production, reasonable capital investment, and an established industrial chain are needed to promote local agriculture, economic development, and the central role of the apple industry."

https://openalex.org/W4282012509,"Biodiversity loss is considered one of the main threats to marine ecosystems. In this framework of biodiversity decline, organisms that provide biogenic habitat play a relevant role by their capacity to structure assemblages and influence ecological processes. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is considered an ecosystem engineer because it alters local environmental conditions maintaining habitat suitability for other organisms, and enhancing local biodiversity. Although it is widely recognized that mussel beds increase diversity, the drivers shaping these assemblages are poorly explored. We investigate whether mussel size homogenisation shapes the abundance, richness and structure of macrobenthic assemblages associated with mussel beds in two shores of the Galician coast (NW Spain). At each shore, two sites, 10 m apart, were selected and at each site, faunal assemblages were compared between mussel clumps showing shells of various sizes (control), and mussel clumps with closely similar-sized mussels, considered as homogenised. Homogenised clumps showed, in general, higher values in total number of individuals and species than control clumps. Regarding the effect of mussel size homogenisation on the multivariate structure of the assemblages, significant differences between control and homogenised clumps were found in three out of the four sites. Most relevant associated species usually reached higher abundances in homogenised clumps than control ones. Therefore, mussel size homogenisation influenced the structure of the macrofaunal assemblages associated with mussel beds but, its effect was context dependent (i.e., varied with sites). Information about the species contribution to dissimilarities among homogenised and control clumps was provided and the potential influence of sediment and algae on mussel clumps was discussed."

Pre-transplant clinical diagnosis was compared with post-transplant pathological diagnosis. The most common misdiagnosed cardiomyopathy was nonischemic cardiomyopathy accounting for 6% (n = 8) of all patients. Histopathological examination of explanted hearts in misdiagnosed patients revealed 2 arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, 2 sarcoidosis, 1 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1 hypersensitivity myocarditis, 1 noncompacted cardiomyopathy, and 1 ischemic cardiomyopathy. Pre-transplant cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) were performed in 33 (26%) and 6 (5%) patients, respectively, with both performed in 3 (3% of patients). None of the patients undergoing both cardiac tests were misdiagnosed. During the 5-years follow-up period, 2 (25%) and 44 (37%) patients with and without pretransplant misdiagnosed cardiomyopathy died. There was no difference in survival rate between the groups (hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% CI:0.11-2.93; P = 0.314).The prevalence of misdiagnosed cardiomyopathy was 6% of patients with stage-D HF undergoing heart transplantation, the misdiagnosis mostly occurred in nonischemic/dilated cardiomyopathy. An accurate diagnosis of newly detected cardiomyopathy gives an opportunity for potentially reversing cardiomyopathy, including sarcoidosis or myocarditis. This strategy may minimize the need for advanced HF therapy or heart transplantation. With advances in cardiac imaging, improvements in diagnostic accuracy of the etiology of HF can improve targeting of treatment."

We aimed to identify meaningful data-driven trajectories of incident type 2 diabetes patients with similarities in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) patterns since diagnosis and to examine their clinical and economic relevance.A cohort of 1540 patients diagnosed in 2011-2012 was retrieved from electronic health records covering primary and specialized healthcare in the North Karelia region, Finland. EHRs data were compiled with medication purchase data. Average HbA1c levels, use of medications, and incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications and deaths were measured annually for seven years since T2D diagnosis. Trajectories were identified applying latent class growth models. Differences in 4-year cumulative healthcare costs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with non-parametric bootstrapping.Four distinct trajectories of HbA1c development during 7 years after T2D diagnosis were extracted: patients with ""Stable, adequate"" (66.1%), ""Slowly deteriorating"" (24.3%), and ""Rapidly deteriorating"" glycaemic control (6.2%) as well as ""Late diagnosed"" patients (3.4%). During the same period, 2.2 (95% CI 1.9-2.6) deaths per 100 person-years occurred in the ""Stable, adequate"" trajectory increasing to 3.2 (2.4-4.0) in the ""Slowly deteriorating"", 4.7 (3.1-6.9) in the ""Rapidly deteriorating"" and 5.2 (2.9-8.7) in the ""Late diagnosed"" trajectory. Similarly, 3.5 (95% CI 3.0-4.0) micro- and macrovascular complications per 100 person-years occurred in the ""Stable, adequate"" trajectory increasing to 5.1 (4.1-6.2) in the ""Slowly deteriorating"", 5.5 (3.6-8.1) in the ""Rapidly deteriorating"" and 7.3 (4.3-11.8) in the ""Late diagnosed"" trajectory.

https://openalex.org/W4281729045,"Motor adaptation can be achieved through error-based learning, driven by sensory prediction errors, or reinforcement learning, driven by reward prediction errors. Recent work on visuomotor adaptation has shown that reinforcement learning leads to more persistent adaptation when visual feedback is removed, compared to error-based learning in which continuous visual feedback of the movement is provided. However, there is evidence that error-based learning with terminal visual feedback of the movement (provided at the end of movement) may be driven by both sensory and reward prediction errors. Here we examined the influence of feedback on learning using a visuomotor adaptation task in which participants moved a cursor to a single target while the gain between hand and cursor movement displacement was gradually altered. Different groups received either continuous error feedback (EC), terminal error feedback (ET), or binary reinforcement feedback (success/fail) at the end of the movement (R). Following adaptation we tested generalization to targets located in different directions and found that generalization in the ET group was intermediate between the EC and R groups. We then examined the persistence of adaptation in the EC and ET groups when the cursor was extinguished and only binary reward feedback was provided. Whereas performance was maintained in the ET group, it quickly deteriorated in the EC group. These results suggest that terminal error feedback leads to a more robust form of learning than continuous error feedback. In addition our findings are consistent with the view that error-based learning with terminal feedback involves both error-based and reinforcement learning."
https://openalex.org/W4281758207,"Purpose Cell membrane penetrating peptide BR2 can bind with ganglioside and introduce foreign drugs into tumor cells. In this study, we employed BR2 to carry the broad-spectrum anti-p21Ras scFv prepared in our laboratory into ganglioside expressing tumor cells for therapy of ras-driven tumors. Methods BR2-p21Ras scFv gene was cloned to prokaryotic expression vector and expressed in E . coli BL21, then the fusion protein was purified with HisPur Ni-NTA. The immunoreactivity of the fusion protein with p21Ras was detected by ELISA and western blotting. The membrane-penetrating and immune co-localization with p21Ras of the fusion protein were determined by immunofluorescence. The antitumor activity was investigated using MTT, wound healing, colone formation, and apoptosis assays in vitro. Results BR2-p21Ras scFv fusion protein was successfully expressed and purified. We found that the fusion protein could specifically penetrate into human tumor cell lines which express ganglioside including human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH, human colon cancer cell line HCT116 and human glioma cell line U251. After entering tumor cells the fusion protein bonded specifically with p21Ras. In vitro experiments revealed that it could significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration, and colone formation of HCT116, SK-N-SH, and U251 cells and promote the apoptosis of these tumor cells. Conclusions BR2-p21Ras scFv can penetrate ganglioside expressing tumor cells and inhibit the growth of ras-driven tumor by binding with p21Ras, and producing an inhibitory effect. It is suggested that BR2-p21Ras scFv is a potential ras-driven tumor therapeutic antibody."
https://openalex.org/W4281762385,"The Blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) is a Neotropical parrot with a large distribution in South America, including areas in Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. A substantial part of the population of this parrot is concentrated in the Pantanal, a large wetland located in the center of South America. There, the clearing of forest and savannas has occurred through the years to accommodate beef-cattle pasture, and crops. Our objective was to understand the direct and indirect effects of time, availability of forest and savannas, and rainfall over the number of nestlings and fledged young of Blue-fronted Amazons inhabiting the southern Pantanal. We surveyed their nests from 1997 to 2018 and counted the number of nestlings produced and the number of fledglings capable to leave the nest in each year. Additionally, we used available data on the area covered by arboreal vegetation, and rainfall data collected at a Meteorological Station located in a central area of the study, as predictors of the numbers of nestlings and fledglings produced every year. Then, we applied structural equation modeling to examine both the direct and indirect effects of time, arboreal habitat availability, and annual cumulative rainfall on the number of nestlings and fledgling per nest. Finally, we estimated the long-term trend of the number of fledglings per nest as a surrogate to the populational trend of Blue-fronted Amazon. We found that none of the variables in our model explained the number of nestlings in nests, but the number of nestlings and the arboreal habitat availability directly and positively affected the number of fledglings. Time indirectly and negatively affected the number of fledglings per nest, whereas rainfall affected it indirectly positively. Additionally, we detected a concerning decrease of about 30% of the fledglings during the 22-years study, which could lead to a change in the species conservational status."
https://openalex.org/W4281896118,"For the Early Neolithic lithic industry in Western Europe (5500–4800 BCE), the study of technical behaviors, recognition of technical traditions, and even more so, idiosyncratic manifestations are not widespread. In this study, we propose an original approach to lithic industries based on the identification of ""communities of practice"" and individuals within housing units. The comparison of lithic series from the Meuse, Rhine and Seine basins allowed us to identify different technical traditions in the Early Neolithic. The study of three dwelling units at two sites in the Aisne Valley in France shows that it is possible to distinguish different flint blade debitages, which we interpreted as the work of different knappers. This novel study of hand-finding in the villages of the first agro-pastoralists populations proves stimulating for the renewal of perspectives on the interpretation of the organization of activities within villages."
https://openalex.org/W4281897831,"Obesity, which has become a major global health problem, involves a constitutive increase in adipocyte differentiation signaling. Previous studies show that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induce weight loss and glycemic control. However, the mechanisms by which MSCs regulate adipocyte differentiation are not yet known. In this study, we investigated the effects of conditioned medium obtained from human tonsil-derived MSCs (T-MSC CM) on adipocyte differentiation. We found that T-MSC CM attenuated adipocyte differentiation from early stages via inhibiting glucocorticoid signaling. T-MSC CM also increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptors and decreased the subsequent nucleus translocation of glucocorticoid receptors. Chronic treatment of mice with synthetic glucocorticoids induced visceral and bone marrow adipose tissue expansion, but these effects were not observed in mice injected with T-MSC CM. Furthermore, T-MSC CM injection protected against reductions in blood platelet counts induced by chronic glucocorticoid treatment, and enhanced megakaryocyte differentiation was also observed. Collectively, these results demonstrate that T-MSC CM exerts inhibitory effects on adipocyte differentiation by regulating glucocorticoid signal transduction. These findings suggest that the therapeutic application of T-MSC CM could reduce obesity by preventing adipose tissue expansion."
https://openalex.org/W4281914732,"Background The proportion of HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy is becoming a growing public health concern, especially in a low-income country setting. However, unlike first-line therapy, to date, very little is known about the outcomes of second-line therapy in the Ethiopia context. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the rate of treatment failure, death, and their predictors among HIV patients receiving second-line therapy. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 642 people living with HIV in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from October 2016 to November 2019. Poisson and competitive risk survival models were computed to explore predictors of treatment failure and death, respectively. Results During follow-up period, 39 (6.87%, 95% CI: 5–9.2%) of 568 patients had second-line treatment failure with 4.07 per 100 person-year rate of failure. Being on anti-TB treatment [Rate ratio, RR = 2.57 (95% CI: 1.25–5.25)], not having optimal medication adherence [RR = 2.29 (95% CI: 1.09–4.78)], and not timely switched [RR = 5.89 (95% CI: 1.36–25.54)] were positively associated with treatment failure. Similarly, 44 (6.85%, 95% CI: 5–9%) of 642 patients died with 4.5 per 100 person-year rate of death. Being on advanced clinical condition [Sub distribution Hazard ratio, SHR = 2.49 (95% CI: 1.31–4.74)], not having optimal medication adherence [SHR = 2.65 (95% CI: 1.31–4.74)], lower CD4 cell counts, and high viral load measurement were positively associated with death. Conclusions A significant number of patients had failed to respond to second-line therapy. A large number of patients had also died. Patient medical profile and monitoring practice were associated with treatment failure and death. Hence, patient-centered monitoring and interventions should be strengthened, besides treatment switch."

Methods A prospective study was performed between April 1 and October 31, 2020, at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit of Songklanagarind Hospital. Transabdominal ultrasonography was performed on Thai singleton pregnant women at 15 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks of gestation to measure IFA, jaw index, MD/MX ratio and ML. All women received standard antenatal care and were followed up until delivery. The exclusion criteria were multifetal gestation, congenital anomaly, chromosomal abnormality, fetal growth restriction, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, suspected abnormality of fetal mandible, maxilla or jaws based on the proposed criteria from previous studies and suspected neonatal structural or genetic abnormalities postnatally. Quantile regression was used to estimate changes in the median, 5th and 95th percentiles of each parameter across gestational ages and to generate formulas for predicting the 5th percentile value for each parameter. Results The results of 291 women were analyzed. Scatter plots and reference ranges of each parameter were generated. IFA, jaw index and ML values significantly increased, while the MD/MX ratio value significantly decreased, with increasing gestational age. The formulas calculated for predicting the 5th percentile value for each parameter were IFA = 55.12 + 0.045*(GA in days—136) jaw index = 37.272 + 0.01693*(GA in days—136) MD/MX ratio = exp(0.027–0.00110*(GA in days—136)) ML = 20.83 + 0.243*(GA in days—136). Conclusions The reference ranges and formulas to calculate the 5th percentile values of mandible parameters in Thai fetuses were developed. Trial registration This study has been reviewed and approved by the Thai Clinical Trials Registry with identification number TCTR20210602003."
