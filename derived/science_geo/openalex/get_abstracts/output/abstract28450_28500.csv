https://openalex.org/W1545503281,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase was purified 27,000-fold from rat liver. The enzyme was purified by acid precipitation of the cytosol followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, Mono-Q, and Mono-S columns. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified phosphoinositide 3-kinase preparation contained an 85-kDa protein and a protein doublet of approximately 110 kDa. The 85- and 110-kDa proteins focus together on native isoelectric focusing gels and are cross-linked by dithiobis(succinylamide propionate), showing that the 110- and 85-kDa proteins are a complex. The apparent size of the native enzyme, as determined by gel filtration, is 190 kDa. The 85-kDa subunit is the same protein previously shown to associate with polyoma virus middle T antigen and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Kaplan, D. R., Whitman, M., Schaffhausen, B., Pallas, D. C., White, M., Cantley, L., and Roberts, T. M. (1987) Cell 50, 1021-1029). The two proteins co-migrate on two-dimensional gels; and, using a Western blotting procedure, 32P-labeled middle T antigen specifically blots the 85-kDa protein. The purified enzyme phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The apparent Km values for ATP were found to be 60 microM with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as the substrate. The apparent Km for phosphatidyinositol is 60 microM, for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is 9 microM, and for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is 4 microM. The maximum specific activity using phosphatidylinositol as the substrate is 0.8 mumol/mg/min. The enzyme requires Mg2+ with an optimum of 5 mM. Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ results in only approximately 10% of the Mg2(+)-dependent activity. Physiological calcium concentrations have no effect on the enzyme activity. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase has a broad pH optimum around 7."

https://openalex.org/W1634064292,"Estrogen sensitizes the MCF-7 estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell line to the mitogenic effect of insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). This sensitization is specific for estrogen and occurs at physiological concentrations of estradiol. Dose-response experiments with insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II suggested that the sensitization is mediated through the type I IGF receptor. Binding experiments with 125I-IGF-I and hybridization of a type I IGF receptor probe to RNA showed that the levels of the type I IGF receptor and its mRNA are increased 7- and 6.5-fold, respectively, by estradiol. IGF-I and estradiol had similar synergistic effects on other estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines, but IGF-I alone increased the proliferation of the MDA MB-231 cell line which is not responsive to estrogens. These experiments suggest that an important mechanism by which estrogens stimulate the proliferation of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells involves sensitization to the proliferative effects of IGFs and that this may involve regulation of the type I IGF receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1501095622,"The lectin concanavalin A (ConA) causes fibroblasts to acquire an arborized morphology and to express elevated levels of collagenase. The temporal and mechanistic aspects of ConA regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) were characterized in early passage human fibroblasts. Collagenase (MMP-1), measured by functional assays in the absence of TIMP and also as immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled protein, was increased 10-20-fold following ConA (20 micrograms/ml, 2 x 10(-7) M) treatment for 24-72 h, with active collagenase comprising approximately 20% of the total collagenase activity. By comparison, MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase; molecular mass, 72 kDa, +dithiothreitol; 66 kDa, -dithiothreitol), analyzed by enzymography and following affinity purification, was increased less than 2-fold by ConA and was present entirely as an activated, 61-kDa (+dithiothreitol; 59 kDa, -dithiothreitol) form. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that ConA elevated the steady-state mRNA levels for MMPs; collagenase mRNA increased approximately 16-fold, MMP-2 increased 2-fold, and Pump-1, a recently described MMP gene, was induced. Concomitantly, a 10-fold reduction in TIMP protein and mRNA levels by ConA occurred. In comparison, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (50 ng/ml, 8 x 10(-8) M), which also stimulates collagenase expression strongly (greater than 30-fold), elevated TIMP protein and mRNA levels (2- and 3-fold, respectively) and did not affect MMP-2 expression. The changes in MMP and TIMP mRNA levels induced by ConA were blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and the half-lives of collagenase and MMP-2 mRNAs (53 and 46 h, respectively) were unaffected, indicating that ConA exerts its effects transcriptionally, through pathways requiring de novo protein synthesis. Increased transcription of the mmp genes was confirmed by nuclear run-on analyses; mmp-1 transcription was increased by greater than 25-fold, mmp-2 by approximately 3-fold, and Pump-1 by approximately 7-fold. In contrast, Timp gene transcription was reduced by approximately 80%, revealing reciprocal regulation of MMPs and TIMP during the induction of a resorptive cell phenotype. Decreased amounts of collagen and fibronectin, but not of SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) in the conditioned medium was the result of MMP activity since steady-state mRNA levels and transcription of the respective matrix protein genes were unaffected by ConA."
https://openalex.org/W1503300213,"Human endonexin II (annexin V) and recombinant human endonexin II can be activated by Ca2+ to interact with acidic phospholipid bilayers formed at the tip of a patch pipette. Once associated with the bilayer, endonexin II forms voltage-gated channels which are selective for divalent cations according to the following series Ca2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Sr2+ much greater than Mg2+. However, endonexin II also expresses a selective affinity for Ca2+ which is manifest by an observed reduced current through the open channel when Ca2+ is the charge carrier. La3+ blocks endonexin II channels, as it does synexin (annexin VII) and other types of Ca2+ channels. However, as with synexin, the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine does not affect endonexin II channel activity. Endonexin II channels are also permeant to Li+, Cs+, Na+, and to a lesser extent, K+, resembling in this manner Ca2+ release channels from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, the low affinity of endonexin II channels for such ions as Cs+ or Li+ have allowed us to use these cations for measurement of the kinetic properties of the channel, with minimal concerns for the ion/channel interactions observed with the physiological substrate, Ca+. Finally, we observed that endonexin II channel activity always occurred in bursts, making necessary the use of two exponential functions to fit open- and closed-time histograms. We conclude from these data that the domain responsible for endonexin II channel activity, first observed by ourselves in the homologue synexin, is probably the C-terminal tetrad repeat common to both molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1488413741,"Previous studies involving transfection of cDNAs for 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and 5-lipoxygenase into osteosarcoma cells have shown that both these proteins are essential for leukotriene synthesis (Dixon, R. A. F., Diehl, R. E., Opas, E., Rands, E., Vickers, P. J., Evans, J. F., Gillard, J. W., and Miller, D. K. (1990) Nature 343, 282-284). In the present study we show that FLAP is present in a variety of cells known to produce leukotrienes, but is absent from a number of cells which do not synthesize leukotrienes. Furthermore, differentiation of the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line towards granulocytic cells following exposure to dimethylsulfoxide is associated with the concurrent induction of both FLAP and 5-lipoxygenase and an increased capacity to synthesize leukotrienes. Cellular leukotriene synthesis in this system is functionally dependent on FLAP as shown by its inhibition by the leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886, a compound which specifically binds to FLAP."
https://openalex.org/W1483915131,"The specificities of methionine aminopeptidase and amino-terminal acetylation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated in vivo by sequencing a series of altered iso-1-cytochrome c. Twenty iso-1-cytochromes c, each having a different penultimate residue in the sequence Met-Xaa-Phe-Leu-, were created by transforming yeast directly with synthetic oligonucleotides. The degree of methionine cleavage and amino-terminal acetylation was estimated from the levels of pertinent peptides separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The results confirmed our earlier hypothesis (Sherman, F., Stewart, J. W., and Tsunasawa, S. (1985) BioEssays 3, 27-31) that methionine is completely removed from penultimate residues having radii of gyration of 1.29 A or less (glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, proline, and valine). However, only partial cleavage occurred in the sequences Met-Thr-Pro-Leu- and Met-Val-Pro-Leu-, demonstrating that proline at the third position inhibits methionine cleavage when the penultimate residue has an intermediate radius of gyration. Acetylation of the retained amino-terminal methionine occurred completely with the Ac-Met-Glu-Phe-Leu- and Ac-Met-Asp-Phe-Leu- sequences and partially with the Ac-Met-Asn-Phe-Leu-sequence. Although the consensus for acetylation of the retained amino-terminal methionine is not completely known, these results and the results of published sequences indicated that Ac-Met-Glu- and Ac-Met-Asp- (methionine followed by an acidic residue) is sufficient for amino-terminal acetylation in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1542279315,"Clearance (C) receptors of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) have an important role of removing ANF from the circulation. In the present study we investigated the cellular mechanisms of this function. 125I-ANF1-28 specifically bound to C-ANF receptors in cultured bovine vascular smooth muscle cells is internalized by a temperature-dependent process at a rate of 5% occupied receptors/min at 37 degrees C. Internalized 125I-ANF1-28 is rapidly metabolized and released to the medium as [125I]monoiodotyrosine, a process that is reversibly inhibited by NH4Cl (10 mM). Retroendocytosis of receptor-ligand complex is detectable when intracellular accumulation of the ligand is maximized by previous incubation with NH4Cl. In the presence of saturating concentrations of 125I-ANF1-28 when cells are warmed from 4 to 37 degrees C, there is first a decrease and then an almost complete replenishment of surface C-ANF receptors, a phenomenon that is not altered by protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide. In the absence of temperature transition, the density of surface C-ANF receptors remains constant, and by 2 h of incubation the amount of ANF hydrolyzed far exceeds the total amount of C-ANF receptors. The total population of surface C-ANF receptors is internalized and recycled every hour, and these processes are constitutive since they also occur in the absence of ligand. Trypsinization and solubilization experiments further indicate that C-ANF receptors are rapidly internalized and recycled to the cell membrane. The results demonstrate that receptor-ligand internalization, extensive receptor recycling, and lysosomal hydrolysis of ANF are the cellular mechanisms by which C-ANF receptors exert their clearance function."
https://openalex.org/W2141655045,"We constructed transgenic mice containing a renin-promoter SV40 T antigen fusion transgene with the intention of inducing neoplasia in renin-expressing cells and isolating renin-expressing cell lines in vitro. We examined six kidney tumors from mice representing three different transgenic lines and found they expressed their endogenous renin gene. Initially, five nonclonal kidney tumor-derived cell lines were established which expressed their endogenous renin gene in addition to the transgene. They retained active renin intracellularly and constitutively secreted an inactive form of renin (prorenin). One of these cell lines was cloned to homogeneity. This line maintained high level expression of renin mRNA throughout 3 months of continuous culture. Although the cells contained an equal proportion of active and inactive renin, the species constitutively secreted into the media was predominantly (95%) prorenin. However, active renin secretion was stimulated 2.3- and 4.6-fold by treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP after 4 and 15 h, respectively. In addition, the presence of multiple secretory granules was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis. These cells, which express renin mRNA and can regulate secretion of active renin, should provide an excellent tool for studying renin gene regulation and secretion. Furthermore, these mice should provide a useful source for the establishment of renin-expressing cell lines from a variety of renin-expressing tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1584322742,"To ascertain the coupling between Ca2+ and H+ fluxes during Ca2+ transport by the Ca2(+)-pumping ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, we used well characterized reconstituted proteoliposomes. The method for the functional reconstitution of the Ca2(+)-ATPase was an extension of our recently published procedure (Rigaud, J. L., Paternostre, M. T., and Bluzat, A. (1988) Biochemistry, 27, 2677-2688). The reconstituted vesicles which sustained high Ca2+ transport activities in the absence of Ca2+ precipitating anions exhibited low ionic passive permeability. Proton fluxes generated by external acid pulses have been monitored by using the fluorescence of the pH-sensitive probe pyranine trapped inside proteliposomes. When K+ was the only permeant ion, low proton-hydroxyl passive permeability was found (permeability coefficient congruent to 5 x 10(-5) cm s-1). In the presence of Cl-1 ions, a higher proton permeability was observed, presumably due to diffusion of HCl molecules. It was further demonstrated that systematic characterization of the passive permeability is essential for understanding and controlling the ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation in the reconstituted liposomes. The first line of evidence for Ca2(+)-H+ countertransport during operation of the Ca2(+)-ATPase came from Ca2+ uptake measurements. The ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation into proteoliposomes was shown to be critically dependent upon the ionic composition of the medium and the presence of ionophores. In K2SO4 medium a very low Ca2+ uptake was obtained which was only slightly affected by the presence of valinomycin. On the contrary, Ca2+ accumulation was increased 3-4-fold in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl-cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, indicating that a transmembrane pH gradient was built up during Ca2+ uptake that inhibited the transport activity of the pump. Accordingly, we found that Ca2+ loading capacity increased with internal buffer capacity. Finally in KCl medium, high Ca2+ accumulation was observed even in the absence of protonophore in agreement with a rapid dissipation of the pH gradient in the presence of chloride ions. Additional evidence that the Ca2+ pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum operated as a Ca2(+)-H+ countertransport was provided by measurements of ATP-dependent intraliposomal alkalinization using entrapped 8-hydroxyl-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate (pyranine) and accumulation of the weak acid acetate. In K2SO4 medium, transmembrane pH gradients of about 1 pH unit were generated with kinetics parallel to those of the Ca2+ uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2114859465,"Rhodopsin, a prototypical G protein receptor, is found both in the plasma membrane and in discs of bovine rod outer segments. The ability of each of these membranes to activate phosphodiesterase upon stimulation by light in the presence of GTP and cGMP was investigated. The plasma membrane showed little or no activity when compared with disc membranes. The plasma membrane contains approximately 28 mol% cholesterol compared to 8 mol % found in discs. Upon oxidation of at least 70 % of the cholesterol in the plasma membrane to cholestenone, the phosphodiesterase activity in the plasma membrane approached that initiated by the disc membranes. When a 50:50 mixture of disc and plasma membrane rhodopsin was tested for phosphodiesterase activity, the results were found to be additive. Therefore, cholesterol is implicated in regulation of the receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2006336910,"In Aplysia sensory and motor neurons in culture, the contributions of the major classes of calcium current can be selectively examined while transmitter release and its modulation are examined. A slowly inactivating, dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current does not contribute either to normal synaptic transmission or to any of three different forms of plasticity: presynaptic inhibition, homosynaptic depression, and presynaptic facilitation. This current does contribute, however, to a fourth form of plasticity—modulation of transmitter release by tonic depolarization of the sensory neuron. By contrast, a second calcium current, which is rapidly inactivating and dihydropyridine-insensitive, contributes to release elicited by the transient depolarization of an action potential and to the other three forms of plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1551449526,"Polyclonal antibodies were raised to a synthetic peptide whose amino acid sequence was derived from the novel gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subunit, gamma 2. These anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies reacted specifically with the GABAA receptor purified from adult bovine cerebral cortex in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity-labeled native receptor in parallel with anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) denatured photoaffinity-labeled receptor by anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies, however, resulted in a significant decrease in the maximum percentage of radioactivity immunoprecipitated compared to that by anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibodies. In immunoblots, anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies reacted with a broad band in the molecular weight range Mr 43,000-49,000 which was distinct from that recognized by anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibodies. The anti-alpha 1 324-341 immunoreactive band was the main subunit irreversibly photoaffinity labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam, i.e. Mr 53,000. These results demonstrate for the first time that the gamma 2 subunit is an integral component of the GABAA receptor but it is the alpha 1 subunit that is the principal site of the agonist benzodiazepine photoaffinity labeling reaction. It supports a role of both the alpha 1 and gamma 2 polypeptides in the formation of the central benzodiazepine binding site within a GABAA receptor oligomer."
https://openalex.org/W2105332322,"A direct interaction of alpha beta gamma trimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins; G0 and Gs) with nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) was investigated with homogeneously purified proteins. There was a progressive release of 32Pi from [gamma-32P]ATP when GDP-bound G0 was incubated together with NDP kinase. The Pi release induced by the interaction of G0 with NDP kinase was not accompanied by the dissociation of GDP bound to the alpha-subunit of G0. This was a sharp contrast to G protein-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis observed with GTP as the substrate; the dissociation of bound GDP was essentially required for the following binding of the substrate, GTP, to be hydrolyzed. A kinetic analysis displayed different properties for the substrate of NDP kinase between free GDP and G protein-bound GDP. NDP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of GDP on G0 was indeed demonstrated with adenosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate as the phosphate donor; there was a formation of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-bound G0 from the ATP analogue. Moreover, purified Gs was readily ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin in the presence of NDP kinase, ATP, and an ADP-ribosylation factor, also suggesting that the nucleotide form on Gs was certainly GTP. These results indicate that NDP kinase can transfer the gamma-phosphate of ATP directly to GDP bound to G proteins and that this phosphorylation results in the activation of the signal-coupling proteins. A possible role of the new activation mechanism of G proteins is discussed in comparison with the previously characterized GDP-GTP exchange pathway by the agonist-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2150468181,"Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Type I and IIa protein phosphatases, was recently found to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake in rat adipocytes (Haystead, T. A. J., Sim, A. T. R., Carling, D., Honnor, R. C., Tsukitani, Y., Cohen, P., and Hardie, D. G. (1989) Nature 337, 78-81). In the present experiments the effect of okadaic acid on the phosphorylation and subcellular distribution of the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (IRGT) was investigated. At maximally effective concentrations, insulin and okadaic acid increased the amount of IRGT in the plasma membrane by 10- and 4-fold, respectively. Thus, the stimulation of glucose transport by okadaic acid was apparently due to an increase in the surface concentration of the IRGT. However, despite its stimulatory actions, okadaic acid partially inhibited the ability of insulin to enhance glucose transport and translocation of the transporter. When cells were incubated with okadaic acid alone or in combination with insulin, phosphorylation of the IRGT in the plasma membrane was increased by approximately 3-fold relative to the intracellular pool of transporters in control cells. Phosphorylation of the IRGT was confined to the presumed cytoplasmic domain at the COOH terminus of the protein. Glucose transporters were dephosphorylated in vitro by Type I or Type IIa protein phosphatases, indicating that inhibition of one or both of these phosphatases could account for the increased phosphorylation produced by okadaic acid. The observation that okadaic acid stimulated translocation of the IRGT implicated a serine/threonine phosphorylation event in triggering movement of the intracellular IRGT-containing vesicles (GTV) to the cell surface. Immunoadsorption of GTV from 32P-labeled adipocytes revealed that the IRGT was the major phosphoprotein in these vesicles. The phosphorylation of at least three other GTV proteins was increased by okadaic acid, and these species would appear to be candidates for regulators of GTV movement to the plasma membrane. It is unlikely that phosphorylation of the IRGT is the signal for translocation because insulin did not increase phosphorylation of the protein. Rather, the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on insulin-stimulated translocation is consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the IRGT promotes its internalization."

https://openalex.org/W1631608759,"We examined whether protein kinase C activation plays a modulatory or an obligatory role in exocytosis of catecholamines from chromaffin cells by using PKC(19-31) (a protein kinase C pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide), Ca/CaM kinase II(291-317) (a calmodulin-binding peptide), and staurosporine. In permeabilized cells, PKC (19-31) inhibited the phorbol ester-mediated enhancement of Ca2(+)-dependent secretion as much as 90% but had no effect on Ca2(+)-dependent secretion in the absence of phorbol ester. The inhibition of the phorbol ester-induced enhancement of secretion by PKC (19-31) was correlated closely with the ability of the peptide to inhibit in situ phorbol ester-stimulated protein kinase C activity. PKC(19-31) also blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced phosphorylation of numerous endogenous proteins in permeabilized cells but had no effect on Ca2(+)-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Ca/CaM kinase II(291-317), derived from the calmodulin binding region of Ca/calmodulin kinase II, had no effect on Ca2(+)-dependent secretion in the presence or absence of phorbol ester. The peptide completely blocked the Ca2(+)-dependent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation but had no effect on TPA-induced phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in permeabilized cells. To determine whether a long-lived protein kinase C substrate might be required for secretion, the lipophilic protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, was added to intact cells for 30 min before permeabilizing and measuring secretion. Staurosporine strongly inhibited the phorbol ester-mediated enhancement of Ca2(+)-dependent secretion. It caused a small inhibition of Ca2(+)-dependent secretion in the absence of phorbol ester which could not be readily attributed to inhibition of protein kinase C. Staurosporine also inhibited the phorbol ester-mediated enhancement of elevated K(+)-induced secretion from intact cells while it enhanced 45Ca2+ uptake. Staurosporine inhibited to a small extent secretion stimulated by elevated K+ in the absence of TPA. The data indicate that activation of protein kinase C is modulatory but not obligatory in the exocytotoxic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W151188916,"In the ubiquitin pathway for intracellular protein breakdown, proteins ligated to ubiquitin are degraded by a large (26 S) ATP-dependent protease complex. It was found previously that the 26 S complex is assembled from three different enzyme components by a process that requires MgATP. In addition, MgATP is also required for the continued action of the 26 S complex in the breakdown of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. In the present study we have tried to gain some insight into the mode of action of ATP by following ATP hydrolysis by the 26 S complex and its three components. It was found that none of the three unassembled components had significant ATPase activity, but such activity appeared following their entry into the 26 S complex. The presence of all three components and of MgATP was required for the formation of complex-associated ATPase activity. GTP and UTP cannot replace ATP for complex assembly, but these nucleotides can substitute for ATP in the stimulation of the conjugate-degrading activity of the 26 S complex. Unlabeled GTP and UTP inhibit the hydrolysis of [gamma-32P] ATP by complex-associated ATPase, indicating that this activity is related to the latter site of ATP action in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1588748174,"Skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels are in vitro substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In the present work, alpha 1 subunits were isolated from cultured skeletal muscle cells by immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody under conditions where proteolysis and dephosphorylation were prevented. Two forms of alpha 1 subunit, 200 and 160 kDa, were identified by back phosphorylation in vitro with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, specific immunoprecipitation, and phosphopeptide mapping. Treatment of cells with forskolin, isoproterenol, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or 8-bromo-cAMP to increase intracellular cAMP reduced 32P incorporation into all phosphopeptides in vitro by 60-80% indicating that increases in cAMP caused endogenous phosphorylation of all sites on both alpha 1(200) and alpha 1(160) to nearly maximal levels. The extents of basal and stimulated phosphorylation in vivo were estimated by back phosphorylation methods to be 35-40% and 83-86%, respectively. In muscle cells metabolically labeled with 32P, 3 mol of phosphate were incorporated into alpha 1 subunits. Forskolin stimulated 32P incorporation into alpha 1 subunits 1.6-fold. Taken together, our results show that skeletal muscle cells contain two forms of the alpha 1 subunit which both are basally phosphorylated on cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites and are further phosphorylated in response to agents that increase intracellular cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1637599331,"Glu1-, Lys77-, miniplasminogens, kringle 1-3, kringle 1-5A, and kringle 1-5R were able to bind with fibrin, while microplasminogen and kringle 4 did not bind significantly. Kringle 1-5A, but not kringle 1-3, effectively inhibited the binding of Glu1-, Lys77-, and miniplasminogens with fibrin. Miniplasminogen also inhibited the binding of Glu1-plasminogen with fibrin. The binding of kringle 1-3 with fibrin was blocked by mini- or Glu1-plasminogen. It is therefore evident that there are two fibrin-binding domains in plasminogen and that the one in kringle 5 is of higher affinity than that in kringle 1-3. CNBr cleavage products of fibrinogen effectively enhanced the activation of Glu1-, Lys77-, or miniplasminogens, but not microplasminogen, by tissue-type plasminogen activator. Kringle 1-5, but not kringle 1-3, dose-dependently inhibited the enhancement by fibrinogen degradation products of Glu1-plasminogen activation by the activator. Lysine and epsilon-aminocaproic acid could inhibit the binding of plasminogens and plasminogen derivatives with fibrin and block the enhancement effect of fibrinogen degradation products on plasminogen activation. The data clearly illustrate that the binding of plasminogen with fibrin, mainly determined by kringle 5, is essential for effective activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator. However, the presence of kringle 1-4 in the plasminogen molecule is required for the full enhancing effect since the kcat/Km of miniplasminogen activation in the presence of fibrinogen degradation products was 8.2 microM-1 min-1 which is significantly less than 52.0 microM-1 min-1 of Glu1-plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1528340834,"Prolonged exposure of Swiss 3T3 cells to vasopressin causes heterologous mitogenic desensitization to bombesin and structurally related peptides including gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) without down-regulation of the bombesin receptor. The number and affinity of bombesin/GRP receptor sites and modulation of 125I-GRP binding by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) are unaffected in membrane preparations from vasopressin-treated cultures. Stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation, mobilization of intracellular calcium, production of diacylglycerol, and transmodulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by bombesin are similarly unaffected. Thus, the heterologous mitogenic desensitization is not due to uncoupling of bombesin receptor from transducing G protein(s) or to an inability to activate phospholipase C. Bombesin, unlike vasopressin, causes a rapid dose-dependent release of [3H]arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 from Swiss 3T3 cells (EC50 approximately 4 nM), which is inhibited by the specific bombesin receptor antagonist [Leu13-psi(CH2NH)-Leu14]bombesin. Crucially, release of [3H]arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2 by bombesin is completely suppressed by prolonged pretreatment with vasopressin (EC50 = 0.6 nM). The mitogenic action of bombesin is restored by adding arachidonic acid to vasopressin-treated cells. We conclude first that arachidonic acid release is an early signal in the mitogenic response to bombesin and second that pretreatment with vasopressin induces heterologous mitogenic desensitization to bombesin by a novel mechanism: inhibition of arachidonic acid release."
https://openalex.org/W1487622456,"Leukotrienes are recognized as important mediators of the inflammatory process. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the role of noninflammatory cells in the regulation of the inflammatory process. To further increase our knowledge of this matter we have, in the present study, investigated leukotriene-induced Ca2+ signaling, using a single cell technique in a human epithelial cell line, Intestine 407. It was evident that both LTD4 and LTE4, at physiological concentrations (10 nM), triggered rapid and pronounced cytosolic free Ca2+ transients, due to both influx across the plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization. Preincubation with pertussis toxin (1200 ng/ml) decreased the level of agonist-induced Ca2+ transients to an extent similar to that caused by depletion of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the toxin affected the influx but not the intracellular mobilization of Ca2+. Indeed, by using the Mn2+ quenching technique, it could be shown that pertussis toxin totally inhibited the influx of Ca2+. The fact that, even after pertussis toxin treatment, direct G-protein activation by AIF4- was still able to trigger a cytosolic free Ca2+ transient, indicates that, in these cells, G-proteins (GTP-binding proteins) that are insensitive to pertussis toxin are capable of mediating a Ca2+ signal. In order to test the idea that such G-proteins regulate mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ induced by LTD4 and LTE4, we electropermeabilized and preincubated the Intestine 407 cells with guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), let them reseal, and, after loading with fura2, investigated the effects on agonist-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. Electropermeabiization and resealing alone did not significantly affect the Ca2+ responses triggered by LTD4 or LTE4. Addition of GDP beta S, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, reduced the Ca2+ responses by approximately 60-70%. In Ca2(+)-depleted medium, GDP beta S also impaired the LTD4-induced response by 65%, however, it had no effect on the Ca2+ response induced by LTE4. In conclusion, LTD4 and LTE4 trigger cytosolic free Ca2+ signaling in a human epithelial cell line by causing both an influx of Ca2+ and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The Ca2(+)-signaling mechanism appears to consist of dual pathways, since the influx is regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, but, the mobilization of Ca2+ is not. Furthermore, our data suggest that the LTD4-induced mobilization is regulated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein whereas the LTE4-induced mobilization is relatively insensitive to both pertussis toxin and GDP beta S."
https://openalex.org/W1571058523,"This work examines the roles of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and stimulation of protein kinase C in agonist and non-agonist-mediated alkaline shift of the cytosolic pH set point for activation of Na+/H+ antiport in human platelets. Ca2(+)-depleted and control platelets were subjected to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thrombin, vasopressin, and ionomycin in 1 mM or Ca2+ free, nominally bicarbonate free media. To measure the cytosolic pH set point for Na+/H+ antiport activation, cells were acidified to different levels using the sodium propionate method. In some experiments protein kinase C was inhibited by staurosporine. Both protein kinase C stimulation and elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ can produce an alkaline shift in the pH set point for activation of Na+/H+ antiport in human platelets. However, the effect of Ca2+i on the pH set point predominates that of protein kinase C stimulation. Cytosolic Ca2+ is a prerequisite for agonist-evoked alkaline shift in the cytosolic pH set point for activation of Na+/H+ antiport. The cytosolic Ca2+ level is also essential for maintaining the basal cytosolic pH. These findings underscore the central role of cytosolic Ca2+ under basal and stimulated states in regulating cytosolic pH of human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1589937997,"The new fluorescent Na+ indicator sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI) was used for determination of the cytosolic free Na+ concentration, [Na+]i, in human platelets. The dye could be loaded into platelets in the form of its acetoxymethyl ester (SBFI-AM). Calibration of the fluorescence in terms of [Na+]i was done by measuring the 345/385 nm excitation ratio (emission 490 nm) at various extracellular Na+ concentrations, [Na+]o, in the presence of gramicidin D. The 345/385 intensity ratio increased almost linearly when [Na+]i was stepwise raised from 20 to 60 mM. The basal value for [Na+]i was found to be 26.0 +/- 4.5 mM (n = 15). Incubation of platelets in Na(+)-free buffer decreased [Na+]i, whereas inhibition of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by 0.5 mM ouabain increased [Na+]i to 56 +/- 4 mM (n = 4) within 60 min. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange by exposing platelets to propionic acid also raised [Na+]i, and a comparable effect was produced by the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin. Activation of platelets with thrombin (0.1-0.5 unit/ml) also increased the 345/385 nm intensity ratio, an effect that was not seen in Na(+)-free buffer or after raising intracellular cAMP by treatment of platelets with prostaglandin E1. On the average, [Na+]i was raised to 59.5 +/- 5.3 mM (n = 15) at 10 min after addition of thrombin without a significant decrease for further 10 min. An increase in [Na+]i was also seen when platelets were challenged with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, an effect that did not occur in the absence of Na+o. Our findings confirm earlier reports which demonstrated a rise in [Na+]i in stimulated platelets and show that SBFI is a useful tool for determination of [Na+]i in resting and stimulated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1578102835,"The laying hen expresses two different lipoprotein transport receptors in cell-specific fashion. On the one hand, a 95-kDa oocyte membrane protein mediates the uptake of the major yolk precursors, very low density lipoprotein, and vitellogenin; on the other hand, somatic cells synthesize a 130-kDa receptor that is involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Hayashi, K., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3131-3139). Here we show that the oocyte-specific receptor binds, in addition to the yolk precursor proteins, an apolipoprotein of mammalian origin, apolipoprotein E. Ligand blotting, a solid-phase binding assay, and antireceptor antibodies were employed to demonstrate that binding of vitellogenin, very low density lipoprotein (via apolipoprotein B), and apolipoprotein E occurs to closely related, if not identical, sites on the 95-kDa oocyte receptor. The binding properties of lipovitellin, which harbors the receptor recognition site of vitellogenin, are analogous to those of apolipoprotein E: both require association with lipid for expression of functional receptor binding. The ligand specificity of the avian oocyte lipoprotein receptor supports the hypothesis that vitellogenin, which has evolved in oviparous species, represents a counterpart to mammalian apolipoprotein E."
https://openalex.org/W137296389,"Aldose reductase was purified from human skeletal and heart muscle by a rapid and efficient scheme involving Red Sepharose chromatography, chromatofocusing on Pharmacia PBE 94, and hydroxylapatite high pressure liquid chromatography. The scheme afforded homogeneous enzyme, 65% recovery, in 2 days. All muscle samples express aldose reductase but not the closely related aldehyde reductase. Aldose reductase is isolated in one of two forms that are distinguishable by their kinetic patterns with glyceraldehyde as substrate and which are interconvertible by treatment with dithiothreitol. Both forms are capable of catalyzing the reduction of glucose (Km = 68 mM), and both are highly sensitive to inhibition by aldose reductase inhibitors. The reduction of glucose was shown to be nearly stoichiometric with production of sorbitol (92 +/- 2%). Dialysis of aldose reductase in the absence of thiols or NADP converts it into a form that shows markedly different kinetic properties, including very weak catalytic activity toward glucose and insensitivity to aldose reductase inhibitors. This modified form can be converted back into the native form by dithiothreitol. Thiol titration of the two forms of aldose reductase with Ellman's reagent indicated that two thiol groups were lost when the enzyme was dialyzed in the absence of dithiothreitol or NADP."
https://openalex.org/W95971780,"It was established previously that the 15-kDa protein phosphorylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin and phenylarsine oxide is O-phospho-Tyr19 422(aP2) protein, a fatty acid-binding protein. To assess its capacity to serve as substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro, native 422(aP2) protein was isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and purified to homogeneity. Receptor-catalyzed phosphorylation of 422(aP2) protein on Tyr19 was markedly activated when long-chain fatty acid, e.g. oleic acid, is bound to the protein. Fatty acid had no effect on autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor by its intrinsic tyrosine kinase. Both saturated (C14, C16, and C18) and unsaturated (all cis-delta 9 C16, -delta 9 C18, and -delta 9,12 C18, -delta 9,12,15 C18, and -delta 5,8,11,14 C20) fatty acids caused substrate activation. The Km for 422(aP2) protein was greatly reduced (from 170 to 3 microM) by oleic acid with little or no effect on Vmax. Upon binding fatty acid to 422(aP2) protein the susceptibility of Tyr19 and Tyr128 to iodination by the lactoperoxidase method increased greatly. These results indicate that upon binding fatty acid, 422(aP2) protein undergoes a conformational change whereby Tyr19, which lies within a consensus-type sequence for tyrosine kinase substrates, becomes accessible for phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and to iodination by lactoperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1503033741,"A nuclear gene (QCR9) encoding the 7.3-kDa subunit 9 of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated from a yeast genomic library by hybridization with a degenerate oligonucleotide corresponding to nine amino acids proximal to the N terminus of purified subunit 9. QCR9 includes a 195-base pair open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 66 amino acids and having a predicted molecular weight of 7471. The N-terminal methionine of subunit 9 is removed posttranslationally because the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein begins with serine 2. The ATG triplet corresponding to the N-terminal methionine is separated from the open reading frame by an intron. The intron is 213 base pairs long and contains previously reported 5' donor, 3' acceptor, and TACTAAC sequences necessary for splicing. The splice junctions, as well as the 5' end of the message, were confirmed by isolation and sequencing of a cDNA copy of QCR9. In addition, the intron contains a nucleotide sequence in which 15 out of 18 nucleotides are identical with a sequence in the intron of COX4, the nuclear gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4. The deduced amino acid sequence of the yeast subunit 9 is 39% identical with that of a protein of similar molecular weight from beef heart cytochrome bc1 complex. If conservative substitutions are allowed for, the two proteins are 56% similar. The predicted secondary structure of the 7.3-kDa protein revealed a single possible transmembrane helix, in which the amino acids conserved between beef heart and yeast are asymmetrically arranged along one face of the helix, implying that this domain of the protein is involved in a conserved interaction with another hydrophobic protein of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Two yeast strains, JDP1 and JDP2, were constructed in which QCR9 was deleted. Both strains grew very poorly, or not at all, on nonfermentable carbon sources and exhibited, at most, only 5% of wild-type ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity. Optical spectra of mitochondrial membranes from the deletion strains revealed slightly reduced levels of cytochrome b. When JDP1 and JDP2 were complemented with a plasmid carrying QCR9, the resulting yeast grew normally on ethanol/glycerol and exhibited normal cytochrome c reductase activities and optical spectra. These results indicate that QCR9 encodes a 7.3-kDa subunit of the bc1 complex that is required for formation of a fully functional complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1569070386,"The pH rate profile for the hydrolysis of diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate catalyzed by the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta shows a requirement for the deprotonation of an ionizable group for full catalytic activity. This functional group has an apparent pKa of 6.1 +/- 0.1 at 25 degrees C, delta Hion of 7.9 kcal/mol, and delta Sion of -1.4 cal/K.mol. The enzyme is not inactivated in the presence of the chemical modification reagents dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), methyl methane thiosulfonate, carbodiimide, pyridoxal, butanedione, or iodoacetic acid and thus cysteine, asparate, glutamate, lysine, and arginine do not appear to be critical for catalytic activity. However, the phosphotriesterase is inactivated completely with methylene blue, Rose Bengal, or diethyl pyrocarbonate. The enzyme is not inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate in the presence of bound substrate analogs, and inactivation with diethyl pyrocarbonate is reversible upon addition of neutralized hydroxylamine. The modification of a single histidine residue by diethyl pyrocarbonate, as shown by spectrophotometric analysis, is responsible for the loss of catalytic activity. The pKinact for diethyl pyrocarbonate modification is 6.1 +/- 0.1 at 25 degrees C. These results have been interpreted to suggest that a histidine residue at the active site of phosphotriesterase is facilitating the reaction by general base catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W52987645,"The hepatitis B virus surface gene is transcribed from two promoters, and the resulting mRNA species code for three distinct forms of the surface antigen. We show here that the viral transcriptional trans-activator, X protein, has no effect on either promoter. However, a cis-acting element in the downstream half of the X gene, distinct from the previously mapped viral enhancer, selectively activates the major surface gene promoter. Nuclease protection and gel-shift assays reveal that multiple cellular factors bind to two sites within this DNA fragment, both of which are necessary for enhancer activity. Since this region of the viral genome is frequently deleted upon integration into the hsot chromosome in chronic hepatitis B, loss of this second enhancer can alter the relative amounts of the three forms of the surface antigen in infected hepatocytes and thus possibly contribute to cellular damage."
https://openalex.org/W1520062797,"Permeabilized cells attached to culture plates were used to evaluate the inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release (IPMCR) by Ca2+. In AR42J cells, a pancreatic acinar cell line, when permeabilization and Ca2+ uptake were carried out at low ionized Ca2+ (0.06 microM), Ca2+ had little effect on IPMCR. On the other hand, when permeabilization and Ca2+ uptake were performed at 5 microM Ca2+, IPMCR was inhibited by Ca2+ with an apparent affinity of 0.24 microM. This inhibition could be modified by exposing the cytosol of permeabilized cells to low Ca2+. Hence, permeabilizing the cells in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ and then exposing them to Ca2+ concentrations between 0.01 and 5 microM before washing and Ca2+ uptake in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ resulted in a Ca2(+)-dependent loss of inhibitory activity. The loss of inhibitory activity occurred with an apparent affinity for Ca2+ of 0.21 microM. A similar phenomenon with a comparable apparent dissociation constant for Ca2+ was found with three other cell types from peripheral tissues: the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106-01, the kidney inner medullary cell line IMCD, and primary culture of urinary bladder smooth muscle cells. The properties of inhibition of IPMCR by Ca2+ in cells from peripheral tissues differ from those previously described in neuronal tissues and suggest that a different factor(s) mediates the inhibition of IPMCR by Ca2+ in cells from peripheral and neuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1603953090,"Recently, an open reading frame which has a deduced amino acid sequence that shows 38% homology to Escherichia coli UvrC protein was found upstream of the aspartokinase II gene (ask) in Bacillus subtilis (Chen, N.-Y., Zhang, J.-J., and Paulus, H. (1989) J. Gen. Microbiol. 135, 2931-2940). We found that plasmids containing this open reading frame complement the uvrC mutations in E. coli. We joined the open reading frame to a tac promoter to amplify the gene product in E. coli and purified the protein to near homogeneity. The apparent molecular weight of the gene product is 69,000, which is consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 69,378 fro the deduced gene product of the open reading frame. The purified gene product causes the nicking of DNA at the 8th phosphodiester bond 5' and the 5th phosphodiester bond 3' to a thymine dimer when mixed with E. coli UvrA and UvrB proteins and a DNA substrate containing a uniquely located thymine dimer. We conclude that the gene product of the open reading frame is the B. subtilis UvrC protein. Our results suggest that the B. subtilis nucleotide excision repair system is quite similar to that of E. coli. Furthermore, complementation of the UvrA and UvrB proteins from a Gram-negative bacterium with the UvrC protein of Gram-positive B. subtilis indicates a significant evolutionary conservation of the nucleotide excision repair system."
https://openalex.org/W7476192,"Membrane fractions from the guinea pig lung had high- and low-affinity binding sites for LTD4 with Kd values of 0.016 and 9.1 nM, respectively. In the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) or by prior treatment of the membrane with islet-activating protein (IAP), the high-affinity site shifted to a low-affinity state. Consistently, a 41-kDa protein was ADP-ribosylated by treatment of the lung membranes with IAP, and this event was inhibited by the addition of GTP gamma S. We solubilized the LTD4 receptor from the lung membranes in an active form with 5 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and 10% glycerol. On a gel filtration column, the binding activity was eluted at the volume corresponding to a Mr of 70,000 or over 500,000 in the presence or absence of Mg2+ (5-20 mM), respectively, in solubilizing buffers. The Kd value of [3H]LTD4 binding to the 70-kDa protein was similar to the low-affinity binding constant of the membrane and was insensitive to GTP gamma S. The preparation solubilized in the absence of Mg2+ showed both high- and low-affinity binding sites for LTD4, and the addition of GTP gamma S shifted the high-affinity site to a low-affinity one. Thus, 1) the LTD4 receptor is coupled to an IAP-sensitive GTP-binding protein, 2) this GTP-binding protein is dissociable from the receptor by solubilizing the lung membrane with CHAPS and Mg2+, and 3) the receptor associated to or dissociated from a GTP-binding protein exhibited a high- or low-affinity state, respectively. These data provide an insight into the molecular mechanism of regulation of the LTD4 receptor signaling process by association and dissociation with an IAP-sensitive GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1664665472,"This study was carried out to clarify the way in which thyrotropin (TSH) and forskolin regulate the adenylylcyclase complex in thyroid follicle cells. We examined the effects of chronic treatment of pig thyroid follicles with TSH or forskolin on the state of G proteins by (a) assaying adenylylcyclase activity, (b) analyzing the ADP-ribosylation of stimulatory G protein (Gs) by cholera toxin, and (c) quantifying the Gs subunits by Western blotting with antipeptide antibodies. Chronic exposure (18 h) of thyroid follicles to a low concentration of TSH (0.01-0.1 milliunit/ml) enhanced the subsequent response of adenylylcyclase to TSH. Higher concentration of TSH (1 milliunit/ml) induced a homologous desensitization of this response. In cells pretreated with forskolin, the TSH-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity was higher than in control cells. The forskolin-or guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido) triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity was always significantly increased after chronic treatment of cells with TSH or forskolin. Treatment of cultured thyroid follicle membranes with [32P]NAD and cholera toxin resulted in labeling of the Gs alpha (45-52-kDa) component. Culturing follicles with TSH (0.001-1 milliunit/ml) or forskolin (0.01-10 microM) greatly affected the cholera toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the Gs alpha subunit. Gs alpha labeling increased progressively to level off at 1 milliunit/ml TSH or 1 microM forskolin (150-200%). Gs alpha immunoreactivity was increased in parallel (200-300%). The immunoreactivity of G beta subunits in cells cultured with TSH or forskolin was also increased compared with control cells. Cycloheximide abolished the effects of TSH and forskolin on the follicles, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required. These results indicate that Gs protein subunits are up-regulated by TSH and forskolin and suggest that their synthesis in thyroid cells is mediated, at least in part, by a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1518175732,The human growth hormone (hGH-N) and the closely related human growth hormone-variant (hGH-V) genes differ in their patterns of splice-site selection. In 9% of hGH-N transcripts exon 2 is spliced to an alternative acceptor site located 45 bases within exon 3. mRNA spliced in this manner encodes a 20-kDa hGH-N isoform instead of the normal 22-kDa hGH-N. The hGH-V transcript fails to utilize this alternative splicing pathway. A region of the hGH-N and hGH-V genes critical to this difference in splice-site selection has been identified by reciprocal exchange of corresponding genomic fragments and has been defined in detail by a series of reciprocal site-specific exchanges. Three base differences located between the two potential splice-acceptor sites are both necessary and sufficient in defining the respective splicing patterns. One of these bases may serve as a lariat branch point critical for the alternative acceptor site activity while the remaining two bases appear to modulate the frequency with which this site is selected.
https://openalex.org/W1545936366,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) rapidly stimulated the production of lactate by hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Our results indicate that enzymes of both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are involved in these actions. EGF stimulated CO2 release from the 1-position of glucose, and caused a small but significant increase in pyruvate kinase activity. In addition, EGF caused a rise in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations, indicating activation of phosphofructokinase. TPA did not alter the concentrations of these sugar phosphates, but did cause an increased lactate production and CO2 production from the 1-position of glucose similar to EGF. Furthermore, the EGF stimulation of lactate formation was independent of the presence of medium Ca2+. Phenylephrine stimulation of this process, in parallel incubations, was entirely dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. We conclude that EGF stimulates glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats. The duplication of these actions by TPA suggests that protein kinase C is a mediator of EGF action in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1593741449,"Four monoclonal antibodies, designated 4H11, 6E10, 2C5, and 3E9 were prepared against partially purified rat hepatic glucagon receptor. These antibodies were characterized by their ability to recognize the glucagon receptor in target tissues using immunoblot and immunoprecipitation procedures. The antibodies recognized a 62-kDa receptor band in rat liver, kidney, and adipose tissue but not in lung, adrenals, and erythrocytes, indicating a high degree of specificity. These antibodies recognize different antigenic determinants; the 6E10 and 2C5 bind protein epitopes, while 4H11 and 3E9 bind carbohydrate epitopes. Furthermore, proteolytic mapping of the glucagon receptor established that monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and 2C5 recognize different domains of the receptor molecule. These antibodies were used to study the immunochemical similarities among the receptors from different species and to assess the topological location of the ligand-binding site. By combining the techniques of affinity cross-linking, proteolytic mapping, and antibody binding, we have identified the location of the glucagon-binding site near to the COOH-terminal domain of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514828500,"To examine the role of endocytosis in insulin action, hormone responsiveness was studied in transfected Rat 1 fibroblasts stably expressing a noninternalizing insulin receptor. The latter receptor (hIR delta ex16) was engineered by deleting the immediately submembranous 22 amino acids encoded by the 16th exon of the human insulin receptor and has previously been shown not to internalize despite having normal insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. It is shown in the present study that hIR delta ex16 receptors do mediate insulin action. Insulin dose-response curves both for activation of glycogen synthetase and for mitogenic stimulation demonstrate greater insulin sensitivity in hIR delta ex16 cells compared with untransfected Rat 1 cells. In addition, increases in the absolute levels of glycogen synthetase activity are seen in the hIR delta ex16 cells. Species-specific agonistic antibodies to the insulin receptor also stimulate hIR delta ex16 cells, confirming the activity of the mutant receptor. The non-internalizing receptors are rapidly dephosphorylated after removal of insulin, and the activation of glycogen synthetase decays no more slowly in hIR delta ex16 cells than in cells expressing wild-type receptors. The results demonstrate that receptor endocytosis is not necessary for activation or deactivation of the insulin response."
https://openalex.org/W1536977199,"The traffic of ions through the kainic acid (KA) receptor/channels present on chick cerebellar glia is modulated by intracellular events likely to involve phosphorylation reactions. The protein carrying the KA binding sites has been isolated from chick cerebellum and shown to be composed of a 49-kDa polypeptide. Its primary structure, established via cDNA cloning, shows the presence of two putative phosphorylation sites. We report here that this 49-kDa polypeptide is a substrate of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase which catalyzes the incorporation of up to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of KA binding site. KA prevents this phosphorylation reaction in a concentration range similar to that needed to activate the KA receptor/channels but higher by 3 orders of magnitude than that needed to saturate the KA binding sites. Kainatergic ligands produce similar effects to those of KA, but 1 mM N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and 1 mM quisqualic acid have no effect. However, 0.01 mM quisqualic acid prevents the inhibitory action of KA. These results raise the possibility that the phosphorylation of KA receptor/channels in their cellular environment is negatively regulated by KA."

https://openalex.org/W1539447301,"Abstract The properties of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (bc1 complex) have been studied in respiratory defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae bearing lesions in the core 1 subunit. All the cor1 mutants examined have greatly reduced concentrations of mitochondrial cytochrome b and display succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities near the limits of detection. Two mutants (E576 and C7), however, had 5% of wild type activity when the cells were grown at 23 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. The temperature-sensitive phenotype was determined to result from substitution of either Arg or Glu for Gly68 of the core 1 subunit. The respiratory competent revertants E576/R8 and C7/R4 derived from E576 and C7 retain the temperature sensitivity of the original mutants. Both revertants are temperature sensitive in vivo, but only mitochondria isolated from E576/R8 are temperature sensitive in vitro. The bc1 complex of mitochondria isolated from this revertant displays a normal value of the ratio Kcat/Km for cytochrome c and four times higher than the wild type for duroquinol. The succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity of E576/R8 is almost completely abolished after incubation at 37 degrees C for 90 min. It is inferred that the quaternary structure of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex is more labile at the nonpermissive temperature in the mutant and undergoes an alteration such that cytochrome b is no longer able to receive electrons through either the o or the i site pathway. The temperature lability and kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme point to a requirement of the core 1 not only for assembly but also for the catalytic activity of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1566174199,"Nucleotide sequence analysis and transposon 5 (Tn5) insertional mutagenesis indicate that the Escherichia coli gene pheR encodes tRNA(Phe) and not a repressor protein as previously reported. The coding region of pheR is identical to that of three other cloned tRNA(Phe) genes, pheU, pheV, and pheW. Multicopy plasmids carrying pheR, like those carrying pheU, pheV, or pheW, complement a temperature-sensitive lesion in the gene for the alpha-subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheS). The nucleotide sequences of the 5'-flanking DNA of pheR, pheU, and pheW are almost identical but are quite different from the same region of pheV. By comparison with pheV, which has two tandem promoters, pheR was found to have a single promoter. The expression of pheA (encoding chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase) in strains carrying the pheR374 allele was decreased to similar extents by multicopy plasmids containing either pheR or pheV. It is proposed that this decrease in pheA expression and the increase in expression of pheA previously reported for chromosomal pheR mutants are both mediated through the attenuation control mechanism that regulates pheA."
https://openalex.org/W1590781211,"Nuclear proteins isolated from untreated lymphoid cells formed complexes with the interferon-inducible transcriptional enhancer (IITE) containing a 73- and an 84-kDa protein, whereas the nuclear proteins of untreated myeloid cells formed complexes with the IITE which contained 50-, 65-, and 73-, but not 84-kDa nuclear proteins. The difference in the molecular masses of the nuclear proteins binding to the IITE in lymphoid and myeloid cells was due to a phosphatase present in the cytoplasm of the myeloid cells. Induction of transcriptional activation by interferon was accompanied by the binding of a 95-kDa nuclear protein to the IITE 1-4 h after the start of exposure to interferon. Cycloheximide did not inhibit the binding of the 95-kDa nuclear protein or the transcriptional activation of alpha-interferon-inducible genes. These data suggest that the induction of gene transcription by alpha-interferon in hematopoietic cells may be associated with post-translational changes in a 95-kDa nuclear protein that binds to IITE, thereby leading to transcriptional activation."
