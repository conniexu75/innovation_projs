Several forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3) and microglial and astrocyte activation were measured. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Acute injections of Aβ oligomers had no effect on p-tau epitopes but did result in elevation of phosphorylated/activated GSK3 (pGSK3). Chronic infusion of Aβ oligomers into the right hippocampus resulted in 3- to 4-fold elevations in several p-tau isoforms with no changes in total tau levels. A significant elevation in pGSK3 accompanied these changes. Microglial staining with CD68 paralleled the increase in tau phosphorylation, however, CD45 staining was unaffected by Aβ. Control experiments revealed that the infusion of Aβ from the minipumps was largely complete by 10 days after implantation. Thus, the elevation in p-tau 2 months after implantation implies that the changes are quite persistent. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Soluble Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; oligomers have long-lasting effects on tau phosphorylation in the rTg4510 model, possibly due to elevations in GSK3. These data suggest that even brief elevations in Aβ production, may have enduring impact on the risk for tauopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2045957511,"Adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency was the first disease investigated for gene therapy because of a postulated production or survival advantage for genecorrected T lymphocytes, which may overcome inefficient gene transfer. Four years after three newborns with this disease were given infusions of transduced autologous umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells, the frequency of gene-containing T lymphocytes has risen to 1–10%, whereas the frequencies of other hematopoietic and lymphoid cells containing the gene remain at 0.01–0.1%. Cessation of polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase enzyme replacement in one subject led to a decline in immune function, despite the persistence of gene-containing T lymphocytes. Thus, despite the long-term engraftment of transduced stem cells and selective accumulation of gene-containing T lymphocytes, improved gene transfer and expression will be needed to attain a therapeutic effect."

Primer extension analysis was performed to map the transcription start points of theqacA and divergently transcribed qacRmRNAs. Each gene utilized a single promoter element, the locations of which were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Fusions of theqacA and qacR promoters to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene were used to demonstrate that QacR is a trans-acting repressor of qacA transcription that does not autoregulate its own expression. An inverted repeat overlapping the qacA transcription start site was shown to be the operator sequence for control of qacA gene expression. Removal of one half of the operator prevented QacR-mediated repression of the qacA promoter. Purified QacR protein bound specifically to this operator sequence in DNase I-footprinting experiments. Importantly, addition of diverse QacA substrates was shown to induce qacA expression in vivo, as well as inhibit binding of QacR to operator DNA in vitro, by using gel-mobility shift assays. QacR therefore appears to interact directly with structurally dissimilar inducing compounds that are substrates of the QacA multidrug efflux pump.

Closely following the discovery of mammalian P-glycoprotein (1Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Ling V. Science. 1983; 221: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar,2Gros P. Croop J. Housman D. Cell. 1986; 47: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), the phenomenon of multidrug resistance was also described for a bacterial system, the Staphylococcus aureus QacA pump (3Tennent J.M. Lyon B.R. Gillespie M.T. May J.W. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and has since been found to be widespread among both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (4Lewis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 5Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 6Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance involves the active transport of a structurally diverse range of toxic compounds, typically hydrophobic cations, from the cell by a single efflux system. In the case of P-glycoprotein, the ability to export many anticancer agents (7Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) has prompted investigations into its mode of action. Biochemical studies and the generation of mutants with altered drug binding capabilities have suggested P-glycoprotein interacts directly with various substrates (7Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 8Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent progress has been made toward determining the structure of P-glycoprotein (9Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the basis of multidrug recognition by P-glycoprotein is still not understood. The functional similarities of bacterial multidrug efflux systems with P-glycoprotein, together with their presence in significant human pathogens, such as S. aureus (3Tennent J.M. Lyon B.R. Gillespie M.T. May J.W. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar),Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10Li X.-Z. Nikaido H. Poole K. Antimicrob.

Immunol. 1997; 4: 23-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), makes elucidation of their molecular mechanisms an important research goal. Some progress has been made toward delineating the significance that various motifs and individual amino acids hold for determining the specificity of transport and overall mechanism of action for the QacA (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis Bmr (14Ahmed M. Borsch C.M.

Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the strong association of efflux pumps with the membrane makes isolation and in depth analysis of these proteins difficult. Considerable effort has also been directed toward identifying the factors involved in regulation of multidrug transporter gene expression. For mammalian P-glycoprotein (15Kato S. Nishimura J. Yufu Y. Ideguchi H. Umemura T. Nawata H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), as well as the Bmr (17Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vázquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Escherichia coli EmrB (18Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2328-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) bacterial multidrug efflux systems, increased gene expression followed the addition of some of the structurally diverse compounds exported by these pumps. Indeed, a certain degree of regulatory control over the genes for membrane transport proteins is to be expected, given their toxic nature toward the cell if overexpressed, as has been observed for the Gram-negative bacterial tetracycline resistance gene, tetA (19Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Control of tetA expression by the specific repressor protein, TetR, is the best understood example of the regulation of a gene encoding a drug transporter (19Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Induction of tetA expression occurs when TetR binds a tetracycline/divalent metal cation complex, inducing a conformational change in the protein such that TetR no longer binds the tetA operator, thereby liberating the promoter site (20Hinrichs W. Kisker C. Duvel M. Muller A. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. Science. 1994; 264: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A similar style of regulation may also be responsible for the induction of expression observed for some bacterial multidrug efflux genes. However, for this to be effective, both the transporter and the regulatory protein would need to recognize the structurally diverse compounds that these systems efflux from the cell. Despite this, regulation of some bacterial multidrug efflux genes involves specifictrans-acting regulatory proteins, such as the B. subtilis BmrR (17Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vázquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli EmrR (18Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2328-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and N. gonorrhoeae MtrR (21Lucas C.E. Balthazar J.T. Hagman K.E. Shafer W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4123-4128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteins. Importantly, the B. subtilis BmrR transcriptional activator protein binds directly to at least some of the compounds that both induce bmrexpression and are also substrates for the Bmr transporter (17Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vázquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Markham P.N. Ahmed M. Neyfakh A.A. J.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Analysis of the region immediately upstream from the S. aureus qacA gene revealed a putative regulatory element, qacR, previously called orf188 (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Based on homology comparisons, QacR, together with TetR, belong to a family of regulatory proteins which all share common features associated with a multi-helical DNA-binding domain at their N-terminal ends and have highly divergent C termini postulated to be involved in the binding of inducing compounds (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Aramaki H. Yagi N. Suzuki M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this paper, we make the first steps toward understanding how QacR regulates the expression ofqacA, by demonstrating it is a negative regulator that both binds to an operator site adjacent to the qacA promoter and also appears to interact directly with a diverse range of inducing compounds. The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are described in TableI.

All strains were cultured at 37 °C in LB media containing, where appropriate, 100 μg of ampicillin, 50 μg of kanamycin, 30 μg of chloramphenicol, or 20 μg of gentamicin per ml. The plasmid pSK616, containingqacA-qacR DNA originally derived from pSK1 (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol.

The vector pSK5201, used to generate promoter fusions to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat reporter gene, was constructed by replacing the 1.4-kilobase pairPvuI-NdeI fragment in pKK232–8 (26Brosius J.

Some primers contain additional nucleotides (underlined) at their 5′ ends for the incorporation of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, an improved ribosome binding site, or a hexahistidine encoding tag. Open table in a new tab PCR utilizing the primers 671HindIII and 865BamHI (Table I), which contained additional sequences at their 5′ ends encoding HindIII or BamHI sites, respectively, were performed to generate a fragment encoding theqacR-qacA intergenic region (see Fig. 1). This was then cloned into pSK5201, producing pSK5202, with the predicted promoter for qacR, PqacR, placed upstream of the cat gene ribosome binding site. pSK5203 was constructed with cat gene expression under the control of the predicted promoter for qacA, PqacA. Mutations were created in the putative “−10” regions of the qacR (pSK5202) and qacA(pSK5203) promoters by site-directed mutagenesis producing pSK5211 and pSK5206, respectively. The primer used to mutate PqacR was 5′-GAGTATTAAGTACTATCAAGATCTGCACAAAAAATTCAAAGAAT-3′ (corresponding to qacA sense nucleotides, mutations underlined), and that for PqacA was 5′-GCGATCGGTCTATAAGGGTACCAATCTATTTTTTTACATATTACAAC-3′ (corresponding to qacA antisense nucleotides, mutations underlined). An additional plasmid, pSK5212, with qacR in cis to PqacA controlling cat, was constructed by cloning the product of a PCR reaction with the primers 108HindIIIH6 and 867HindIII into pSK5201. To delete one half of the putative qacA operator sequence (nucleotides 818–835; Fig. 1), a 750-bp fragment from pSK5212 was obtained using the Sau3AI site separating the two halves of IR1 and another Sau3AI site in the polylinker adjacent to the 3′ end of qacR in pSK5212. This fragment was ligated into the BamHI site of pSK5201 and a resultant clone, withcat transcription under the control of PqacA, designated pSK5215. The plasmid pSK4238, which was constructed to enable the expression ofqacR in trans, contained a PCR-generated qacRfragment preceded by a strong ribosome binding site inserted behind thelacZ promoter of pK184 (27Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5315-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a vector compatible with the pSK5201-based constructs. To facilitate the overexpression and purification of QacR, the primers 678BamHI and 108HindIIIH6 were used to obtain a PCR product that consisted of the qacR gene preceded by a strong ribosome binding site and also containing a hexahistidine-encoding sequence (His tag) at the 3′ end. This fragment was ligated into the E. coli expression vector pTTQ18 (28Stark M.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) to produce pSK5210, withqacR expression placed under the control of the strong IPTG-inducible tac promoter. All clones produced from the products of PCR reactions were sequenced to confirm that no errors had been incorporated during amplification. Total cellular RNA was purified from S. aureus strains SK982 and SK982 containing the qacA+,qacR+ plasmid pSK1 by the hot phenol method as described by Miller (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), modified for use with S. aureus by an initial incubation on ice in protoplast lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm EDTA, 450 mmsucrose, pH 8.0) containing 0.25 mg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma) for 45 min to generate protoplasts. Double- and single-stranded plasmid DNA preparations, DNA manipulations, transformations, and site-directed mutagenesis were by standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded DNA. the Sequitherm kit (Epicentre Technologies) was utilized. PCR was performed using Pfu enzyme (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer extension analysis was performed essentially as described by Ausubelet al. (31), utilizing the primers 899EcoRI forqacA and 557 and 672BamHI for qacR(Fig. 1). Primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Bresatec), mixed with 50 μg of total RNA, denatured by heating at 80 °C for 3 min, and then hybridized at 42 °C for 90 min before being extended by the addition of dNTPs and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The primer extension products were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed alongside dideoxy sequencing ladders generated with the same primers. Overnight cultures of E. coliDH5α cells harboring a promoter fusion construct alone, or together with pSK4238 providing qacR in trans, were diluted 1:40 in 200 ml of LB media and grown overnight with the appropriate antibiotics and in some cases the addition of a sub-MIC of a potentialqacA inducing compound. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and lysed by sonicating (Branson Sonifier B-12) twice for 30 s at 75 watts. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation before the level of CAT activity was determined using acetyl-CoA (Sigma) according to the method of Shaw (32Shaw W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Triplicate experiments were performed on 3 separate days. An overnight culture of E. coli DH5α cells freshly transformed with pSK5210 was diluted 1:50 in 1 liter of prewarmed LB media and grown to an OD600 of 0.5, at which stage overexpression of QacR was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm IPTG. After another 2–2.5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of cold sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% v/v glycerol, pH 7.8). The cells were frozen overnight at −70 °C and then thawed on ice before addition of lysozyme (Sigma) to 1 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by sonication (75 watts, 30 s, 1 min of cooling, repeated eight times), followed by the addition of RNase A to 10 μg/ml and DNase I to 5 μg/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min before being mixed with 10 ml of 50% Ni2+-NTA metal chelate affinity resin (Qiagen) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resin was then packed into a column at 4 °C and washed at a flow rate of 15 ml/h with 40 ml of sonication buffer and then overnight with 200 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% v/v glycerol, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.3). Purified QacR was eluted in wash buffer containing 300 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide) using the buffer system of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and proteins visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Molecular size standards were purchased from Bio-Rad, and protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) as a standard. Gel-filtration chromatography was performed on a FPLC Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, as the buffer. Gel-filtration molecular weight markers MW-GF-200 were purchased from Sigma. Low pH native PAGE was performed as described in Ref. 35Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. IRL Press Limited, Oxford1981Google Scholar. Western analysis using a 6×His monoclonal antibody to detect hexahistidine-tagged proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's (CLONTECH) instructions. Purified QacR (6 μg) in a final volume of 40 μl was incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing the indicated amounts of divalent metal cations for 3 h at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 30 mm EDTA. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min without reducing agent unless otherwise stated, cooled on ice for 2 min, and 5-μl aliquots analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining to visualize the proteins. Labeled probes obtained by PCR amplification using primers end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP were purified with the Wizard DNA purification kit (Promega). Initial experiments utilized a 212-bp PCR product corresponding to the wholeqacR-qacA intergenic region (bp 672–867; Fig. 1) generated with the primers 672BamHI and 867HindIII. Subsequent experiments in which substrates of QacA were added to some of the binding mixtures used a smaller 137-bp PCR product (bp 738–867; Fig. 1), which included the qacA promoter and IR1 portions of the intergenic region, produced with the primers 738 and 867HindIII. A 186-bp PCR fragment from the 3′ end of theqacR gene that acted as a specificity control was generated using the primers 108HindIIIH6 and 262. The QacR fractions obtained from the affinity column were immediately exchanged into GMS buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 7.5% v/v glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column previously equilibrated with this buffer and stored in single-use aliquots at −70 °C until required. The32P-labeled DNA fragments, approximately 2000 cpm/reaction, were incubated with the indicated amounts of QacR in GMS buffer containing 0.3 mm DTT, 75 μg of bovine serum albumin per ml, and 75 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) per ml in a total volume of 20 μl. Some reactions also had substrates of QacA or divalent metal cations added at the indicated concentrations. After 15 min of incubation at 22 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by high ionic strength PAGE and autoradiographed as described by Ausubelet al. (31). Footprinting of the qacAcoding strand utilized the 137-bp DNA fragment used in gel-mobility shift experiments, generated using primers 738 (end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP) and 867HindIII. For footprinting of the qacA non-coding strand, a 154-bp fragment (bp 738–899; Fig. 1) was prepared using the primers 899EcoRI (end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP) and 738. Approximately 40,000 cpm/reaction of labeled DNA was incubated in GMS buffer containing 0.3 mm DTT, 75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 60 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at 22 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. Selected reactions also contained 600 ng of purified QacR. One unit of DNase I (Promega) in 20 μl of DNase I buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) was then added, mixed, and the digestion allowed to proceed for exactly 1 min at 22 °C before being terminated with the addition of 40 μl of stop solution (0.6m sodium acetate, 25 mm EDTA, pH 4.8). The reactions were extracted once with phenol-chloroform (3:1 v/v) and the DNA ethanol precipitated overnight at −20 °C. The resulting pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 6.5 μl of loading dye (49% formamide, 0.0125% xylene cyanol, 0.0125% bromphenol blue). After heating at 95 °C for 3 min, 2-μl aliquots of the DNA were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Sequencing ladders were generated in each case with the same primer as was end-labeled for the PCR reaction. Previous inspection of the sequence upstream of qacA had revealed a divergently transcribed open reading frame, qacR, postulated to regulate qacAtranscription by binding to a region of dyad symmetry (IR1; Fig. 1) that partially overlapped the most likely sequence for the qacA promoter (PqacA; Fig. 1) (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Additionally, a potential promoter for qacR (bp 794–827 in Fig. 1) was identified, which would overlap IR1 and possibly subject qacR expression to auto-regulation (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, on further analysis of theqacR-qacA intergenic sequence, we identified another potential promoter-like element for qacR(PqacR; bp 702–729 in Fig. 1) that lies closer to the start of the gene and has its own distinct region of dyad symmetry (IR2; Fig. 1), suggesting that expression of qacRcould be initiated from multiple promoters. To ascertain the actual promoter(s) used by each gene, the tsp for bothqacA and qacR were determined in the S. aureus strain SK982 (36Lyon B.R. May J.W. Skurray R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) harboring theqacA+, qacR+multiresistance plasmid pSK1 (24Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) using primer extension analysis. For each reaction, only one extension product was observed. The tsp forqacA in S. aureus corresponded to a G at position 810 and that for qacR to be a C at position 693 (Fig. 2). Ther"

However, because heat shock gene expression is deleterious to growth and development, we have examined mechanisms for HSF1 repression at growth temperatures, focusing on the role of phosphorylation. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) of the ERK family phosphorylate HSF1 and represses transcriptional function. The mechanism of repression involves initial phosphorylation by MAP kinase on serine 307, which primes HSF1 for secondary phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 on a key residue in repression (serine 303).In vivo expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (α or β) thus represses HSF1 through phosphorylation of serine 303. HSF1 is also phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro on a second residue (serine 363) adjacent to activation domain 1, and this residue is additionally phosphorylated by protein kinase C. In vivo, HSF1 is repressed through phosphorylation of this residue by protein kinase Cα or -ζ but not MAPK. Regulation at 37 °C, therefore, involves the action of three protein kinase cascades that repress HSF1 through phosphorylation of serine residues 303, 307, and 363 and may promote growth by suppressing the heat shock response.

Exposure of cells to elevated temperatures leads to the expression of the heat shock response, in which the induction of a cohort of heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock factor; HSE, heat shock element; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKAP K2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; wt, wild-type; PKC, protein kinase C. is accompanied by the expression of heat resistance (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar, 2Georgopolis C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, HSP genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a sequence-specific transcription factor that interacts with heat shock elements (HSEs) in their promoters (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 4Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Euk. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 5Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 269: 1409-1410Crossref Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Much evidence now suggests that although HSPs protect cells during hyperthermia, growth of cells under nonstress conditions is incompatible with the expression of the heat shock response (6Krebs R.A. Feder M.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Heat shock arrests cells in G1 (7Marui N. Nishimo H. Sakai T. Aoike A. Kawai K. Fukushima M. Biochem.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Feder J.H. Rossi J.M. Soloman J. Soloman N. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1402-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, HSF1 represses the ability of Ras protein to activate the promoters of immediate early genes such as c-fos (10Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There evidently exists, however, a well-conserved mechanism to inhibit the activity of HSF1 at 37 °C and prevent these deleterious effects on cell growth. We have examined molecular mechanisms involved in the repression of HSF1 by signaling pathways involved in growth regulation. Activation of HSF1 involves the conversion of HSF1 from a latent cytoplasmic monomer to a trimeric nuclear protein complex that controls the transcription of heat shock genes (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 4Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Euk. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 5Morimoto R.I.

Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, although necessary, nuclear localization and DNA binding are not sufficient for the full transcriptional competence of HSF1, which can be activated to an intermediate state in which it binds to HSE sequences but does not stimulate transcription (13Hensold J.O.

Much evidence suggests a role for phosphorylation in the conversion of HSF1 from this intermediate state into a transcriptionally active form (13Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K. Houseman D.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, HSF from yeast and HSF1 from mammalian cells both undergo hyperphosphorylation during heat shock, and their hyperphosphorylation correlates well with transcriptional activation (17Xia W.

Our previous studies showed that HSF1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites mostly on serine residues and that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) of the ERK-1 family phosphorylate HSF1 on serine and repress the transcriptional activation of the heat shock protein 70B (HSP70B) promoter by HSF1 in vivo (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These experiments and a number of other reports thus indicate that HSF1 is antagonized by Ras-MAPK signaling and that this may be a mechanism for HSF1 repression at 37 °C (20Chu B. Soncin F.

The repressive effects of MAPK were transmitted through a specific serine residue (Ser-303) in a proline-rich sequence within the transcriptional regulatory domain of human HSF1 (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of Ser-303 in transmitting the signal from the MAPK cascade to HSP70 transcription, there was no evidence that Ser-303 could be phosphorylated by MAPKin vitro, although an adjacent residue (Ser-307) was avidly phosphorylated by MAPK (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggested that Ser-303 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) through a mechanism dependent on primary phosphorylation of Ser-307 by MAPK (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we have demonstrated the sequential phosphorylation by MAPK and GSK3 and its role in HSF1 repression. NIH 3T3 cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum and passaged at a 1/10 ratio. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the pALTER-1 vector as described previously (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Following mutation, DNA sequences were checked by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector for mammalian expression and into the pET22B vector for expression inEscherichia coli. For purification, wild-type human HSF1 cDNA and point-mutated forms S303G, S307G, and S363G (25Rabindran S.K. Gioorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) were induced in E. coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment, extracted, and purified to homogeneity as described (26Soncin F. Prevelige R. Calderwood S.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified MAPK from P. ochraceus (p44mpk), PKCα from rabbit brain and GSK3α, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP K2), and pp90rskS6 kinase isoform RSK2 from rabbit muscle were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). In vitro phosphorylation of HSF1 by MAP kinase and GSK3 was carried out as described previously (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Purified enzymes (MAPK and GSK3α) were tested for contamination with other kinases that might phosphorylate HSF1 by assaying with peptides specific for MAPKAP K2, RSK2, and PKCα. RSK2 activity was assayed as described using substrate peptide RRRLSSRA, utilizing purified RSK2 enzyme as a positive control (27Lane H.A. Thomas G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 269-291Google Scholar). Assays were carried out with or without MAPK addition, because MAPK is a potent activator of RSK2. MAPKAP K2 activity in the GSK3α preparation (with or without the addition of MAPK) was assayed as for RSK2 using MAPKAP K2 substrate peptide (KKLNRTLSVA) (28Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified to greater than 90% by high performance liquid chromatography. Neither the MAPK nor GSK3α preparation was significantly contaminated with MAPKAP K2, RSK2, or PKCα. HSF1 can also be phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase 2 and calmodulin kinase II; however, the phosphopeptide maps obtained from HSF1 treated with either enzyme were completely different from the MAPK or GSK3α maps (data not shown), indicating that HSF1 phosphorylation with MAPK or GSK3α does not reflect contamination with either casein kinase 2 or calmodulin kinase II. To phosphorylate HSF1 with PKCα, 5 μg of HSF1 was incubated with enzyme (25 ng), phosphatidylserine (100 μg/ml), CaCl2 (1 mm), ATP (5 μm), and 32P-labeled ATP (1 μCi/μl) in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EGTA) to a final volume of 50 μl. Incubations were for 12 min at 25 °C. Protein kinase C activity was assayed using the peptide QKRPSQRSKYL. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was carried out after digestion with trypsin as described previously (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 28Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For sequencing, peptides were eluted from the TLC medium and subjected to multiple cycles of Edman degradation, and amino acids were identified by high performance liquid chromatography elution time (29Matsudaira P. Deutscher M.P. Guide to Protein Purification. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 602-613Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed by the Biopolymer Laboratory, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. Binding of rHSF1 or nuclear HSF1 to HSE was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (14Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,30Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSF1 constructs were co-transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct p2500CAT, which contains 2.5 kilobase pairs of 5′-noncoding sequence from the heat-inducible human HSP70B gene (31Schiller P. Amin J. Ananthan J. Brown M.E. Scott W.A. Voellmy R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 per 100-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transfection carried out using calcium phosphate precipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Cells were harvested 48 h after incubation with plasmids for assay of CAT protein expression (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and assayed for β-galactosidase as described (10Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In some experiments, HSF1 was co-transfected with MEK-1 expression vector (pCMV-MKK-1) from Dr. N. G. Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) (32Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M.

Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute), and for pPKCα and pPKCζ expression plasmids and purified recombinant hGSK3β, we thank Dr. B. Price, Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). In order to investigate the hypothesis that HSF1 is phosphorylated on the key regulatory serine residue 303 by GSK3 only after a priming phosphorylation by MAPK, we first examined the effect of mutating serines 303 and 307 on sequential phosphorylation by MAPK and GSK3 (Fig. 1). Wild-type recombinant HSF1 (wtHSF1) was not phosphorylated by recombinant GSK3β (Fig 1,lane 3) as shown previously with purified rabbit GSK3β (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) but was phosphorylated by purified GSK3α (lane 2). MAPK phosphorylated wtHSF1 (Fig. 1, lane 1) and led to a marked increase in phosphorylation by GSK3α and -β (lanes 4 and 5). When similar experiments were carried out on HSF1 with a serine to glycine mutation (S303G), the levels of phosphorylation in incubations with MAPK, GSK3α, and GSK3β were similar to those in the wt control when used individually. (Fig. 1,lanes 6–8). However, we did not observe increased phosphorylation by GSK3α and -β when combined with MAPK (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, inactivation of the putative GSK3 site (Ser-303) prevents MAPK stimulation of HSF1 phosphorylation by GSK3 (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of HSF1 observed with GSK3α alone, without MAPK priming, is evidently at residues other than Ser-303 as similar levels of 32P uptake were observed in wtHSF1 and S303G when incubated with GSK3α (Fig. 1,lanes 2 and 7). Substitution of glycine for serine at Ser-307 (S307G) led to a HSF1 with similar properties to S303G, with phosphorylation by MAPK and GSK3α (Fig. 1, lanes 11 and 12), but no stimulation of GSK3 induced phosphorylation by MAPK (lanes 14 and 15); this indicates a requirement for intact Ser-307 and MAPK for GSK3 phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser-303, consistent with a priming role for MAPK in HSF1 regulation by GSK3 (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The experiments also show that despite loss of the phosphorylation site at serine 307, S307G is still phosphorylated by MAPK (lane 11). This is, however, consistent with previous studies indicating two major MAPK sites on HSF1 (Fig. 1; Ref. 20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the changes in levels of 32P incorporation observed in HSF1 treated sequentially with MAPK and GSK3α (Fig. 1) were due to hierarchical phosphorylation, we examined the relative levels of phosphorylation of Ser-303 and Ser-307 using tryptic two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2). We used GSK3α in this study due to its more ready availability. Incubation of HSF1 with purified MAPK in vitro followed by two-dimensional mapping led to the resolution of two major phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 A, a and b) as shown previously (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A number of minor spots were also seen. Two of these, which occur at positions to the left of spots a and b in Fig. 2, were observed in most experiments and may correspond to higher phosphorylated forms of peptides a and b, with similar hydrophobicity to a and b but with lower electrophoretic mobility due to their greater negative charge (28Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The spots closer to the origin were not observed consistently and may be products of incomplete digestion or minor phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Although incubation in vitro with GSK3α did lead to phosphorylation of HSF1 on residues other than Ser-303 (Fig. 1), no clear spots were resolved by two-dimensional mapping (not shown). Treatment of HSF1 with GSK3α after preincubation with MAPK led to increased phosphorylation (Fig. 1) and caused the appearance of a new spot (spot c) and the concomitant depletion of spot a (Fig. 2 B). These experiments therefore suggest that spot c is produced through the phosphorylation by GSK3α of the polypeptide sequence in HSF1 that migrates as spot a and that the resulting spot (c) is retarded in the electrophoretic field (relative to a) due to the increase in negative charge resulting from double phosphorylation of this sequence (Fig. 2 B). A previous study using purified rabbit GSK3β had indicated the phosphorylation of HSF1 on four sites in addition to peptide c (phosphopeptides w, x, y, and z) by GSK3β (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This appeared to be due to contamination of the GSK3β used in that study with another kinase (MAPKAP K2), which is activated by MAP kinase. We have subsequently shown that highly purified MAPKAP K2 phosphorylates HSF1 on sites w–z and that purified rabbit GSK3α and human recombinant GSK3β, which are both free of MAPKAP K2 contamination, do not (data not shown). Our previous studies showed that the peptide that migrates to form spot a comprises amino acids 299–309 (EEPPSPPQSPR), containing sites at position 307 for MAPK phosphotransferase activity and a potential site at position 303 for GSK3 (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Spot a thus consists of amino acids 299–309 singly phosphorylated at Ser-307, and it is predicted that spot c is doubly phosphorylated, at Ser-307 by MAPK and at Ser-303 by GSK3α. Mutation of Ser-307 to glycine (S307G) abolished both spot a and spot c after serial treatment with MAPK and GSK3α (Fig. 2 C). Mutation of HSF1 at Ser-303 (S303G) abolished the appearance of spot c and prevented the depletion of spot a after serial phosphorylation, indicating that spot c is the product of double phosphorylation by MAPK and GSK3α and that Ser-303 is phosphorylated by GSK3α (Fig. 2 D). These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis of primary phosphorylation of HSF1 on Ser-307 being a prerequisite for secondary phosphorylation on Ser by GSK3α. We next examined the potential role of GSK3 in the regulation of HSF1 activity in vivo. We used a system described previously in which HSF1 expression from the pcDNA3.1.HSF1 (pHSF1) vector activates a heat shock promoter reporter construct in the absence of heat shock (20Chu B.

HSF1 expression strongly inducedHSP70B promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells, whereas co-expression of a GSK3α expression vector repressed the effects of HSF1 by 80%, and co-expression of pMEK-1, which increases cellular MEK-1 levels and specifically activates ERK1 and ERK2 (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), further reduced activity (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with a GSK3β expression vector (not shown). When similar experiments were carried out using HSF1 mutant S303G, we found that repression of HSP70B promoter activity by GSK3α was effectively abolished, identifying serine 303 as the target for HSF1 repression by GSK3α in vivo (Fig. 3). Neither mutation of HSF1 at Ser-303 or Ser-307 nor treatment with GSK3α or MAPK affected the binding of HSF1 to heat shock elements, indicating that the effects observed are exerted downstream of DNA binding, at the level of transcriptional transactivation (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B., D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7). However, Ser-303 mutation did not completely block the repression of HSF1 by MEK1, suggesting further effects of MAPK on HSF1 function (Fig. 3).Figure 7Phosphorylation of HSF1 by PKCα in vitro. Recombinant wtHSF1 or S363A was incubated with PKCα and [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incubations were terminated by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and phosphoproteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For a positive control, wtHSF1 was incubated with MAPK as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the data in Fig. 3 suggest that MAPK exerts repressive effects on HSF1 in addition to those mediated through Ser-303, we next analyzed the second major site on HSF1 phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro. We showed in Fig. 1 A that two major phosphopeptides, a and b, are resolved in HSF1 after MAPK treatmentin vitro. Phosphopeptide a contains serines 303 and 307 (Fig. 1). Analysis of phosphopeptide b isolated from the TLC plates after two-dimensional mapping indicated a sequence correspond to amino acids 362–372 in the human HSF1 sequence (25Rabindran S.K. Gioorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on serine 363 contained within phosphopeptide b, which forms part of a sequence (PPSP) that conforms to a MAPK consensus motif (PX(S*/T*)P (where the asterisk indicates the phosphorylation of a threonine or serine residue (34Marshall C.J. Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 35Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 36Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 121-135Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar)). Mutation of Ser-363 to alanine, to create S363A, had a profound effect on the phosphopeptide map of HSF1 after MAPK phosphorylation and major spot b was eliminated (although a faint spot was detected in some experiments) (Fig. 4). The peptide sequence contains other serine/threonine residues (notably, amino acids 368 and 369) within a proline-rich region that could potentially be phosphorylated at a low rate by MAPK. These experiments implicate Ser-363 as the second residue in HSF1 that undergoes phosphorylation after treatment with MAPKin vitro. To investigate the functional importance of Ser-363, we next examined the ability of MEK-1 expression to repress transcriptional activation of the HSP70B promoter by the S363A mutant (Fig. 5). Contrary to expectations, although Ser-363 is avidly phosphorylated by MAPKin vitro (Figs. 1 and 4), the S363A mutant was equally sensitive to MEK-1 repression compared with the wt control (Fig. 5). Thus, either Ser-363 phosphorylation does not affect the transcriptional activity of HSF1 or this site is not phosphorylated by MAPK in vivo. This region in HSF1 (360–365; RPPSPP) contains overlapping consensus motifs for both MAPK (PXS*/T*P) and PKC (RXXS*/T*) (36Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 121-135Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of expressing two isoforms of protein kinase C (PKCα and PKCζ) on the activities of co-transfected wtHSF1 and S363A (37Parker P.J. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 68-84Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown the existence of at least 11 PKC family members, which belong to three distinct classes based on structure and responsiveness to activators: PKC isoforms α, β1, βII, and γ are Ca2+- and phorbol ester-dependent; PKC isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ require phorbol esters but are Ca2+-independent; and the atypical isoforms ζ and λ require neither activator (38Nishizuka Y.

Trans. 1992; 20: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We chose PKCα and PKCζ as representative members of the family, ranging from the “classical” Ca2+- and phorbol ester-dependent PKCα to the atypical PKCζ, which is dependent on neither factor (37Parker P.J.

We have identified and purified a kinase that was activated after the stimulation of Fas on human thymoma-derived HPB–ALL cells. Partial amino acid sequencing of the purified kinase revealed it to be MST/Krs, member of the yeast STE20 family of protein kinases. MST/Krs was activated by proteolytic cleavage and proteolytic activation was blocked by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FK. A mutant MST with Asp→Asn replacement at a putative caspase cleavage site was resistant to either the proteolytic cleavage or the activation of the kinase activity. These findings suggest that proteolytic activation is one activation mechanism of MST and plays a role in apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2331805935,"Cell cycle regulation of the cyclin A gene is determined by a bipartite repressor binding site in the region of the basal promoter, termed CDE-CHR, which also controls the expression of cell cycle genes upregulated in S or G2 (such as cdc25C). The CDE–CHR in the cyclin A promoter is recognized by both E2F complexes and CDF-1, but the contribution of each of these factors in cell cycle regulation is unknown. In the present study, we have introduced mutations into the cyclin A promoter which lead to either a loss or enhancement of E2F binding, while having only marginal effects on the interaction with CDF-1. Unlike mutants deficient for CDF-1 binding, promoter variants lacking E2F binding showed an unchanged repression in G0, thus identifying CDF-1 as the principal repressor of the cyclin A gene. The same mutants did show, however, a delayed derepression while a mutation leading to increased E2F binding resulted in premature up-regulation. These findings clearly suggest that E2F contributes to the correct timing of cyclin A transcription, presumably by acting as an anti-repressor. In agreement with this conclusion, we find that the cyclin A promoter only poorly interacts with E2F-4, which is the major E2F family member in G0 cells, while a clear binding is seen with E2F-1 and -3, which are up-regulated in late G1."

As constitutive components of most normal tissues, resident Mφ mediate or regulate the clearance of senescent or apoptotic cells, cytokine production, hemopoiesis, bone resorption, antigen transport, and neuro-endocrine regulation. Activated Mφ recruited to sites of infection or injury by immune or inflammatory stimuli play a crucial role in acute and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, immunopathology, and in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis (1Leenen P.J.M.

The distribution and functional heterogeneity of Mφ derive in part from their specialized plasma membrane receptors. Cell surface markers such as F4/80, sialoadhesin, mannose receptor, and the scavenger receptor (SR-AI/SR-AII) have all contributed significantly to current understanding of Mφ ontogeny and function (5Gordon S.

Yet, in comparison with other immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes, relatively few Mφ-restricted cell surface molecules have been identified, and much regarding their various physiological and pathological roles remains unknown.

In this paper we document the identification and cloning of another novel putative Mφ-restricted C-type lectin using DD-PCR. Media and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Primary Mφ were harvested in sterile, endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) by peritoneal lavage of Balb/c mice at 10–12 weeks of age. Four days before harvest the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 2% Bio-Gel (Bio-Rad) or 1 ml of thioglycollate broth (Difco) or not injected (for resident Mφ). 3 × 106 cells were plated/well of a 6-well plate in 3 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) and allowed to adhere for 3 h. The cells were then washed twice in Opti-MEM to remove all nonadherent cells and incubated overnight in Opti-MEM. The following day the cells were washed in PBS before lysis. L929, NS0, EL-4, J558L, PG19, MEL707, RAW 264.7 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. WEHI-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2 × 10−5m 2-β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). J774.2 and BW5147 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640. CTLL-2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10 IU/ml interleukin-2. CHO.K1 cells were grown in nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's). All cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from 3 × 106 cells from the cell lines listed above was harvested using the QuickPrep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 0.5 μg of mRNA was resuspended in 12 μl of sterile water, 2.5 mm oligo (dT) primer T12 MA (M represents an equimolar mixture of A, C, G) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. After snap-cooling on ice, the reaction was continued in 20 μl containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (Life Technologies), 20 μm dNTP (Amersham), 200 units of Superscript RNase H-ve reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) for 1 h at 37 °C before denaturing for 5 min at 95 °C. 2 μl of a 1:10 dilution of each cDNA were randomly amplified in a 20-μl reaction containing 1.2 mmMgCl2 (Life Technologies), 0.05% W-1 detergent (Life Technologies), 2 μm dNTPs (Amersham), 5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), 2 μCi [33P]dATP (Amersham), 2.5 μmT12 MA primer, 0.5 μm random 10-mer primer 4158 (TGGTAAAGGG). Cycling parameters were 94 °C for 30 s, then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. 5 μl of each reaction product were run on a 6% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. After drying, the gel was exposed for 16 h to Hyperfilm-HP (Amersham). Selected bands were excised from the gel, eluted in 100 μl of sterile water, precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of sterile water. 4 μl of each PCR product were reamplified in a 40 μl of reaction volume with conditions similar to the original PCR except for the use of 20 μm dNTPs and 10 units of Taq polymerase. Reamplified PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega UK, Southampton, UK). Adapter-ligated cDNA, synthesized from 1 μg of murine spleen poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECHLaboratories UK Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), was resuspended in sterile water. A 5′-RACE reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.2 at 25 °C), 16 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2.25 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP (Amersham), 1 μl of DNA polymerase mix (a 20-μl stock solution consisted of 14.3 μl of Expand Long Template PCR system enzyme mix (Boehringer Mannheim) plus 5.7 μl of TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH)), 200 nm Marathon adapter primer AP-1, 200 nm mMCL-specific primer complementary to residues 57–81 of the DD-PCR fragment (residues 856–880 of the cDNA sequence reported here in Fig. 2 A), and 5 μl of adapter-ligated cDNA diluted 1:250 in sterile water. Reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. The resulting 871-base pair (bp) product was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK) subcloned into the pGEM-T vector and sequenced. A cDNA library was constructed in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from the J774.2 cell line. A Sv/129 mouse liver genomic DNA library in the λFixII vector was purchased from Stratagene. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques from each library were screened with a [32P]-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the 871-bp RACE product. Positive plaques from the cDNA library were enriched after a further two rounds of screening, resulting in seven independent cDNA clones that were isolated in pBluescriptII-SK(−) (Stratagene). All seven cDNA clones were sequenced to obtain unambiguous overlapping readings from both strands. Positive plaques from the genomic library were enriched after three further rounds of screening. DNA from two independent clones was purified using the Wizard prep kit (Promega) and digested with NotI to release the full-length genomic DNA inserts. The inserts were then subcloned into NotI-digested pBluescript SK(−) and sequenced to obtain unambiguous overlapping readings from both strands. DNA sequence reactions were performed using the PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an ABI 373A DNA sequencer, read automatically, and recorded using ABI Prism Model Version 2.1.1 software (PE Applied Biosystems). Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, GenBank™ and EMBL data bases were searched for homologous sequences using the BLAST algorithm (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Protein alignment, alignment consensus sequence, and percent identity were calculated by the Pileup, the Prettybox, and the Gap programs, respectively, included in the EGCG extensions to the Wisconsin Package Version 8.1.0, (13Rice P. Program Manual for the EGCG Package. The Sanger Center, Hinxton Hall, Cambridge, England1996Google Scholar,14Genetic Computer GroupProgram Manual for the Wisconsin Package Version 8. 1994; (Madison, WI)Google Scholar). A gap penalty value of 3.0 and a gap length weight of 0.1 were used with the Pileup and Gap programs. 15 μg (cell lines) or 20 μg (tissues) of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis through a denaturing 1.2% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Genescreen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products). Equal loading of samples was confirmed by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. The filter was screened with a probe corresponding to the 5′-RACE product described above, washed with 1 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham) at −70 °C for 10 days (cell lines) or 21 days (tissues). For strongly positive tissue samples as shown in Fig. 1 C, a shorter 4-h exposure was also performed. The cell lines used were J774.2, RAW 264.7, NS0, NIH-3T3, PG19, BW5147, WEHI-231, CTLL-2, J558L, and MEL 707. All cell lines were obtained from mycoplasma-free strains at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. The tissues used were bone marrow, brain, descending colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, small intestine, spleen, thymus, fetal liver, and resident peritoneal Mφ. These tissues, excluding the fetal liver, were obtained from healthy Balb/c mice, 10–12 weeks of age and bred and housed at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. Fetal tissue was obtained from day 14 Balb/c embryos. C3H/HeJ-gld and Mus spretus (Spain) mice and ((C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus)F1 × C3H/HeJ-gld) interspecific back-cross mice were bred and maintained as described previously (15Seldin M.F. Morse H.C. Reeves J.P. Scribner J.P. LeBoeuf R.C. Steinberg A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Mus spretus was chosen as the second parent in this cross because of the relative ease of detection of informative restriction fragment length variants in comparison with crosses using conventional inbred laboratory strains. DNA isolated from mouse organs by standard techniques was digested with restriction endonucleases, and 10-μg samples were electrophoresed in 0.9% agarose gels. DNA was transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schull, Inc.), hybridized at 65 °C with probes labeled by random-primed method with [32P]dCTP, and washed under stringent conditions, all as described previously (16Watson M.L. Seldin M.F. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 369-387Google Scholar). Gene linkage was determined by segregation analysis. Gene order was determined by analyzing all haplotypes and minimizing crossover frequency between all genes that were determined to be within a linkage group. This method resulted in determination of the most likely gene order (17Bishop D.T. Genet. Epidemiol. 1985; 2: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment encoding the entire mMCL open reading frame was amplified in a 100-μl reaction containing 200 μm dNTP (Amersham), 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 at 25 °C, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 1 μm primer 7745, 1 μm primer 8354, 3 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs (UK) Ltd., Hitchin, UK), and 100 ng of the 871-bp 5′-RACE product. Cycling parameters were 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer 7745 (sense), 5′- TAG TAG TGA TCA ACA CAC ATA ATG TGG CTG GAA G-3′, contains template sequence (in bold face) corresponding to the first 4 amino acids of the 871-bp 5′-RACE product as well as a BclI restriction enzyme site (underlined). Primer 8354 (antisense), 5′- TAG TAG TGA TCATCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC CTT CGA GGG CTT CCA ATT GAA TG-3′ contains a BclI restriction enzyme site (underlined), a translation termination codon (normal font), a FLAG peptide coding sequence (italics), and template sequence (boldface) corresponding to the extreme COOH terminus of the 871-bp RACE open reading frame, excluding the TGA stop codon. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with BclI, subcloned into BamHI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands), and sequenced to confirm its orientation and integrity. The pcDNA3-mMCL-FLAG construct was stably transfected into CHO.K1 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. FLAG-tagged mMCL-expressing cells were selected with 2 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies). Briefly, 20 μg of the construct were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25 m CaCl2 (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK) and precipitated by slowly adding it to an equal volume of 2 × HBS (1.64% w/v NaCl (BDH), 1.18% HEPES (free acid) (Sigma), 0.04% Na2HPO4 (anhydrous) (BDH), pH 7.05). The precipitate was added to 1 × 106CHO.K1 cells cultured in an 80-cm2 flask in medium and supplements as described above. After 3.5 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 2 ml of 15% glycerol, 1 × HBS for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were allowed to recover overnight in fresh medium. Geneticin, 2 mg/ml, was added the following morning. FLAG-tagged mMCL-expressing cells were enriched 1 week after transfection by selection with the Anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal (UK) Ltd., Wirral Merseyside, UK). Transfected cells were stripped with 0.5 mm EDTA, washed in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma), and incubated on ice for 1 h in 20 μg/ml M2 mAb in PBS/BSA. After further washing in PBS/BSA, the cells were incubated on ice for 40 min in 200 μl of PBS/BSA and 3 μl of Dynabeads. Cells selected by magnetic attraction during subsequent extensive PBS/BSA washes were allowed to recover overnight in a 25-cm2 flask in geneticin-free medium. The medium and detached beads were removed the following morning and replaced with fresh medium containing 2 mg/ml geneticin. Two rounds of limiting dilution cloning and subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with the anti-FLAG M2 mAb yielded a stable FLAG-tagged, mMCL-expressing clone. 200 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–16 of mMCL (H2N-WLEESQMKSKGTRHP-COOH) (Multiple Sclerosis Peptide Laboratory, Oxford Brookes University) were diluted in 500 μl of PBS, combined with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma), and injected subcutaneously into adult New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections were given as above, except using Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma), at weeks 3, 5, and 10. Pre-immune serum was designated as sample 16P. A test bleed was taken at 8 weeks to check for anti-peptide antibody activity, and a final bleed (50 ml) was collected 3 weeks after the final injection. 5 ml of the serum were absorbed with 4 × 107 CHO.K1 cells, which had been fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (BDH) and permeabilized with 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma). This absorbed serum was designated rabbit antiserum 16T. Transfected and wild-type CHO.K1 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h, quenched in 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min, washed, blocked in PBS, 15% normal goat serum for 30 min, and then stained for 1 h at 4 °C with either 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) or a 1:300 dilution of either rabbit serum 16P or 16T in PBS, 15% normal goat serum. After additional washes, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a 1:300 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), then analyzed by fluorescent microscopy or FACS. Cells analyzed by FACS were detached from the culture flasks with 0.5 mm EDTA before fixation. To permeabilize cells, 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 was added to all PBS, 15% normal goat serum solutions. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in a solution of 1% v/v Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmiodoacetamide. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were boiled for 3 min in 4% SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were reduced by boiling them in a sample buffer containing a final concentration of 5% 2-β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) before electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membrane was treated with blocking solution (5% milk protein, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, 15% normal goat serum) and blotted for 1 h in blocking solution containing 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 or a 1:500 dilution of either rabbit serum 16P or 16T. After washing with blocking solution, a second 1-h incubation was performed, again in blocking solution, using a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). For competition assays, saturating amounts of either mMCL peptide or FLAG peptide was combined with the primary antibody before its application to the blot. DD-PCR analysis was performed on cDNA from the following mouse cell lines: J774.2 (Mφ), RAW 264.7 (Mφ), EL-4 (thymoma), NS0 (myeloma), and L929 (fibroblast). This panel of cell lines was chosen to provide a range of immune and nonimmune cell types as well as two independent Mφ and three non-Mφ internal controls to facilitate the selection of Mφ-restricted genes. DD-PCR products amplified from both Mφ cell lines but absent from the non-Mφ cell lines (Fig. 1 A) were eluted, re-amplified, subcloned into the pGEM-T vector, and sequenced. A 272-bp cDNA fragment amplified exclusively from both Mφ cDNA samples was selected for further study because it contained a putative polyadenylation signal site downstream of a TGA stop codon, indicating that it might be a segment of a functional gene. Subsequently, 5′-RACE-PCR was performed on adapter-ligated mouse spleen cDNA using adapter-specific sense and DD-PCR fragment-specific antisense primers. This reaction generated an 871-bp product. Sequence analysis of the 5′-RACE product showed that it included 601 bp of novel sequence and 257 bp of sequence corresponding to the amplified portion of the original DD-PCR fragment. The novel sequence included a second in-frame TAA stop codon 678 bp upstream of the original DD-PCR stop codon, suggesting that the 5′-RACE product contained a complete open reading frame. Downstream of the TAA stop codon found in the 5′-untranslated region, two potential in-frame start codons were found 20 bp apart. Although neither of these codons lies in a perfect context for translation initiation, the codon at position 161–163 is believed to be the translation start site. It is the first initiation codon downstream of an in-frame stop codon and the only initiation codon with an adenosine in the −3 position (18Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar, 19Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). As a means of testing the expression specificity of this putative gene, Northern blot analysis was performed on an expanded range of 11 mouse cell lines including CTLL-2 (interleukin-2-dependent T cell), J558L (myeloma), BW5147 (thymoma), WEHI-231 (B cell lymphoma), PG19 (melanoma), NS0, RAW 264.7, L929, MEL 707 (erythroleukemia), J774.2, and NIH-3T3 (fibroblast). Total RNA from these cell lines probed with the 32P-labeled 5′-RACE product showed a pair of 1.1-kb and 700-bp bands solely in the J774.2 and RAW 264.7 cell lines (Fig. 1 B) and confirmed that the gene was expressed in a Mφ-restricted manner. Using gene-specific sense and antisense primers, a more sensitive reverse transcription-PCR assay of cDNA from J774.2, NS0, L929, EL-4, RAW 264.7, MEL 707, and P388.1D (Mφ) cell lines was also conducted. Again, specific amplified bands were found only in the three Mφ cell lines (data not shown). To determine whether the same Mφ-restricted expression pattern exists in vivo, Northern blot analysis was conducted on RNA isolated from 12 different normal mouse tissues. The 871-bp 5′-RACE probe recognized a 1.1-kb transcript in resident peritoneal Mφ ≫ bone marrow ≫ spleen = lung ≫ lymph nodes (Fig. 1 C). The intensity and distribution pattern of the bands were in accordance with known Mφ populations and supported the evidence of Mφ-restricted expression as seen in the cell lines. In particular, the strong expression in bone marrow correlated well with previous studies, which showed that mice bone marrow is the richest source of Mφ as determined by the Mφ-restricted marker F4/80 (20Lee S.-H. Starkey P.M. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The presence of the 1.1-kb band alone (tissues) or at a higher intensity (cell lines) on both Northern blots strongly suggests that the 1.1-kb transcript is the predominant form of the modified mRNA in tissue Mφ. The possibility that alternatively spliced transcripts might account for the 700-bp band, which appeared only in the murine Mφ cell lines, was investigated by screening a J774.2 cDNA library with the 5′-RACE probe. Sequence analysis of seven independent clones isolated from the library revealed no alternatively spliced variants. Two of the clones were found to lack three consecutive base pairs (390–392), leading to an in-frame deletion of Gly-77. Three of the seven clones were also found to have matching 3′-untranslated regions, which extended an additional 74 bp past the site of the start of the poly(A) tail in the original DD-PCR clone. These three longer clones included a second, rarer AAUAUA polyadenylation signal sequence (21Hu Z.Z. Buczko E. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) 25 bp upstream of the start of their poly(A) tails. The physiological abundance and importance of the Gly-77 deletion and the extended 3′-untranslated sequence have yet to be determined. A 918-bp cDNA consensus sequence, including Gly-77, was constructed from the overlapping regions of each cDNA clone using a minimum of two independent cDNA clones to confirm each nucleotide. In total, the consensus sequence consists of 160 bp of 5′ noncoding sequence, a 660-bp open reading frame, and 98 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig. 2 A). No discrepancies were found between the open reading frame of this consensus sequence and that of the 5′-RACE PCR product amplified from mouse spleen, thereby confirming that the gene expressed in the cell lines was the same gene expressed in normal mouse tissue and the same gene that was amplified in he original DD-PCR. Translation of the open reading frame of the cDNA beginning at the 161–163 start codon yielded a deduced 219-amino acid protein sequence (Fig. 2 A). The lack of an identifiable signal peptide and a hydropathy profile displaying a hydrophobic anchor sequence near the amino terminus (Fig. 2 B) suggested that the gene encoded a type II integral membrane protein. The complete protein sequence was unique insofar as it displayed no overall sequence homology or identity to any other protein sequence entered in a variety of protein data bases. The final 130 carboxyl-terminal amino acids showed similarity to a wide range of carbohydrate-binding proteins, namely C-type lectins, with the greatest degree of homology to chicken hepatic lectin. The carboxyl terminus of the putative protein sequence was aligned with the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) of four of the lectins with which it had the highest similarity scores: mouse Kupffer cell fucose receptor, human macrophage lectin, human gp120 binding lectin, and chicken hepatic lectin. The sequence of rat mannose binding lectin (rMBL-A), although apparently more distantly related to the novel protein, was included because it has an extensively studied C-type lectin CRD (22Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 23Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

The alignment showed that the putative sequence is 29, 37, 36, 39, and 31 percent identical to the CRDs of these proteins, respectively. In addition it indicated that apart from Gly-158, Pro-173, Gly-191, and Arg-204, the novel protein shares 11 of the 14 invariant and 17 of the 18 highly conserved amino acids used to define C-type lectins (26Drickamer K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 207-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Sequence data from two independent clones isolated from a λFixII mouse liver genomic DNA library screened with the 5′-RACE probe also revealed that the protein is encoded within six exons. As is characteristic of Group-II C-type lectins, the region corresponding to its CRD is encoded by three exons, and the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail and anchor sequence are encoded by two exons (26Drickamer K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 207-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The final two introns of this protein precisely match the position of introns found in the CRDs of other Group-II C-type lectins: CD23 (27Suter U. Bastos R. Hofstetter H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7295-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the major form of the rat asialoglycoprotein receptor (28Leung J.O. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12523-12527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Kupffer cell fucose receptor (29Hoyle G.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1850-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken hepatic lectin (30Bezouska K. Crichlow G.V. Rose J.M. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number, position, and phasing of all the intron/exon splice sites of the putative protein are analogous to those of chicken hepatic lectin (30Bezouska K. Crichlow G.V. Rose J.M. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11604"

https://openalex.org/W2330797517,"Transitions from small cell (SCLC) to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have been documented both in vitro and in vivo and are thought to be an important step during tumor progression of human small cell lung cancer towards a treatment-resistant tumor state. We have screened NSCLC and SCLC cell lines for differences in the composition of nuclear transcription factors using consensus oligonucleotide sequences (SRE, Ets, TRE, CRE, B-motif, GAS, E-box). We found NSCLC cells to exhibit significantly higher AP-1 binding activity than SCLC cells consistent with the increased expression of CD44, an AP-1 target gene. To gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences, we analysed SCLC cell lines (NCI-N592 and NCI-H69) which were phenotypically transformed into NSCLC-type cells by transfection with activated H-ras and c-myc oncogenes. In these cells, ras-induced transition is accompanied by a strong induction of AP-1-binding activity along with increased expression of CD44 mRNA and protein. When analysing the composition of the AP-1 complex in more detail and comparing ras-induced versus phorbol ester-induced changes, we found Fra-1 to be the major component induced in ras-transfected but not in phorbol-ester treated or non-treated parental SCLC cells. This finding is paralleled by the observation that among the various members of the Fos and Jun family analysed (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunD, JunB) fra-1 is the only gene to be exclusively expressed in NSCLC cells but not in cells of SCLC origin. Our data, thus, point to a histiotype-related mechanism of recruitment among AP-1 proteins which may have bearings on the fate of lung cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2065624759,"We examined the expression of p53 in three lines of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) and ES cells. p53 mRNA and protein levels were constitutively high in two lines but absent from one. In the P19 line of EC cells neither p53 protein nor mRNA was detected. The first intron of the p53 gene in these cells had been invaded by a murine leukemia virus and there was extensive hypermethylation of the p53 gene accompanying its inactivation. In all three cell lines, irradiation resulted in arrest of the cells in the G2 but not in the G1 phase of the cell cycle despite the induction of p21cip1 in the cell lines expressing p53. Thus, the chromosomal stability of EC and ES cells appears to be not dependent on the p53 protein and we interpret our results to suggest that these cells may require the deletion of p53 dependent cell cycle regulation in order to become immortalized."

https://openalex.org/W2321487805,"SHPS-1 is an approximately 120 kDa glycosylated receptor like protein that contains three immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region as well as four potential tyrosine phosphorylation and SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain binding sites in its cytoplasmic region. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulated the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its subsequent association with SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase containing SH2 domains in Rat-1 fibroblasts. LAP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 was inhibited by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (which inactivates RHO) but not by pertussis toxin. The protein kinase C activator phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1; however, down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged exposure of cells to TPA did not affect LAP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1. LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 was markedly reduced in either focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-deficient mouse cells or CHO cells overexpressing the tyrosine kinase CSK. Overexpression of a catalytically inactivate SHP-2 markedly inhibited MAP kinase activation in response to low concentrations of LPA in CHO cells, whereas overexpression of a wild-type SHPS-1 did enhance this effect of LPA. Furthermore, MAP kinase activation in response to a low concentration of LPA was inhibited by botulinum C3 exoenzyme. These results indicate that LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 may be mediated by a RHO-dependent pathway that includes FAK and a SRC family kinase. Thus, in addition to its role in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated MAP kinase activation, the formation of a complex between SHPS-1 and SHP-2 may, in part, play an important role in the activation of MAP kinase in response to low concentrations of LPA."
https://openalex.org/W1984144365,"Abstract The B cell-specific transcription factor Pax-5 has been shown previously to interact with the promoter of theblk gene in vitro. blk encodes a tyrosine kinase associated with the B cell receptor, which is expressed during the early but not the final stages of B cell development. To investigate whether Pax-5 regulates expression of the blkgene in vivo during B cell development and/or activation,Pax-5a was overexpressed in B cell lines. Increases inblk promoter activity using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene system suggested a role for Pax-5a as a transcriptional activator. Subsequent site-specific mutagenesis studies showed that mutations of the Pax-5 binding site on blksignificantly alter promoter activity, although results suggested that other factors could bind to this region as well. Using mobility shift assays, we detected an inducible transcription factor that interacts strongly with a sequence overlapping the Pax-5 site on theblk promoter and identified this as a homodimer of NF-κB/p50, a member of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors. This factor was present at high levels in lipopolysaccharide-activated normal B cells and in plasma cell lines but either at low levels or undetectable levels in resting normal B cells or pre-B or mature B cell lines. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide induction of a pre-B cell line (703/Z) induced a complex that contained both NF-κB/p50 and p65. These studies suggest that different NF-κB complexes are able to interact with a sequence overlapping the Pax-5 site on the blk promoter and that the relative levels of “bound” factor influence levels of blk expression. Since p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers of the NF-κB complex should have opposing effects on blk transcription, this could provide a mechanism to differentially regulate blkexpression during B cell development and activation."

https://openalex.org/W2313454522,"The human c-H-ras1 gene contains within the first intron a p53 element, which functions as a transcriptional enhancer. Using nuclear extracts from human endometrial and ovarian tumours in gel retardation assays, we examined the binding levels of the P53 protein to the H-ras element in tumour versus the adjacent normal tissue. Elevated P53 binding in the tumour tissue was found in 5/12 (42%) endometrial and in 2/5 (40%) ovarian specimens and these cases were found to overexpress wild-type P53. Loss of P53 binding to the H-ras element due to p53 mutations, was observed in 3/12 (25%) endometrial and in 1/5 (20%) ovarian cases. Similar P53 binding levels to the H-ras element were found in 4/12 (33%) endometrial and in 2/5 (40%) ovarian pairs showing normal expression of wild-type P53. Overexpression of the Ras p21 protein correlated with elevated binding and increased nuclear levels of wild-type P53. Our results suggest that P53 protein alterations, participate in the development of human gynecological neoplasias through aberrant transcriptional regulation of the H-ras proto-oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2061878936,"Cell transformation by Polyomavirus middle T (MT) oncoprotein involves binding and activation of several cytoplasmic proteins that participate in growth factors-induced mitogenic signal transduction to the nucleus. We have previously reported that the AP-1 transcriptional complex is a target for MT during cell transformation. To analyse the interactions between MT and cellular proteins that are required for constitutive AP-1 activation, we compared wild type and transformation-defective MT mutant cell lines. High AP-1 activity, assessed by gel mobility shift assays, displayed by MT-overexpressing cells, is dependent on MT binding to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (P13K). Treatment with wortmannin (a specific P13K inhibitor) leads to decreased AP-1 activity. Supershift and Western blot analysis with specific antisera, indicate that JunB and cJun, but not cFos or FosB are present in the AP-1 complex. The results confirm the AP-1 complex as a downstream MT target and indicate that AP-1 activation may not be sufficient for cell transformation, since two transformation-defective MT mutants (250phe and MT322) display high AP-1 activity."
