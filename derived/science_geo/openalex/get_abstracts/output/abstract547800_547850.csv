https://openalex.org/W2192952483,"In the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, two major emergency disease-control measures were cremation of bodies and enforcement of quarantine for asymptomatic individuals suspected of being in contact with a positive case. Enforced by State-related actors, these were promoted as the only method to curtail transmissions as soon as possible. However, as with other harsh measures witnessed by Liberian citizens, in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities (stigma; fear) that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended.The research has been conducted in two phases, for a total of 8 weeks. Ethnography of local practices was carried out in 7 neighbourhoods in Monrovia and 5 villages in Grand Cape Mount County in Liberia. 45 Focus Group Discussions (432 participants) and 30 semi-structured interviews sustained the observing participation. Randomly selected people from different social layers were targeted. The principal investigator worked with the help of two local assistants. Perceptions and practices were both analysed.Participants stressed how cremation perpetuated the social breakdown that started with the isolation for the sickness. Socio-economical divides were created by inequitable management of the dead: those who could bribe the burial teams obtained a burial in a private cemetery or the use of Funeral Homes. Conversely, those in economic disadvantage were forced to send their dead for cremation. State-enforced quarantine, with a mandatory prohibition of movement, raised condemnation, strengthened stigmatization and created serious socio-economic distress. Food was distributed intermittently and some houses shared latrines with non-quarantined neighbours. Escapes were also recorded. Study participants narrated how they adopted local measures of containment, through local task forces and socially-rooted control of outsiders. They also stressed how information that was not spread built up rumours and suspicion.Populations experiencing an epidemic feel a high degree of social insecurity, in addition to the health hazards. Vertical and coercive measures increase mistrust and fear, producing a counter-productive effect in the containment of the epidemic. On the other hand, local communities show a will to be engaged and a high degree of flexibility in participating to the epidemic response. Efforts in the direction of awareness and community involvement could prove to be better strategy to control the epidemic and root the response on social participation."

Serotonin neurons located in the raphe nucleus of the hindbrain have crucial roles in regulating brain functions and have been implicated in various psychiatric disorders. Yet functional human serotonin neurons are not available for in vitro studies. Through manipulation of the WNT pathway, we demonstrate efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to cells resembling central serotonin neurons, primarily those located in the rhombomeric segments 2-3 of the rostral raphe, which participate in high-order brain functions. The serotonin neurons express a series of molecules essential for serotonergic development, including tryptophan hydroxylase 2, exhibit typical electrophysiological properties and release serotonin in an activity-dependent manner. When treated with the FDA-approved drugs tramadol and escitalopram oxalate, they release or uptake serotonin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting the utility of these cells for the evaluation of drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2270324082,"Identifying bacterial strains in metagenome and microbiome samples using computational analyses of short-read sequences remains a difficult problem. Here, we present an analysis of a human gut microbiome using TruSeq synthetic long reads combined with computational tools for metagenomic long-read assembly, variant calling and haplotyping (Nanoscope and Lens). Our analysis identifies 178 bacterial species, of which 51 were not found using shotgun reads alone. We recover bacterial contigs that comprise multiple operons, including 22 contigs of >1 Mbp. Furthermore, we observe extensive intraspecies variation within microbial strains in the form of haplotypes that span up to hundreds of Kbp. Incorporation of synthetic long-read sequencing technology with standard short-read approaches enables more precise and comprehensive analyses of metagenomic samples."
https://openalex.org/W2189685066,"Ticks and other arthropods often are hosts to nutrient providing bacterial endosymbionts, which contribute to their host’s fitness by supplying nutrients such as vitamins and amino acids. It has been detected, in our lab, that Ixodes pacificus is host to Rickettsia species phylotype G021. This endosymbiont is predominantly present, and 100% maternally transmitted in I. pacificus. To study roles of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, bioinformatic and molecular approaches were carried out. MUMmer genome alignments of whole genome sequence of I. scapularis, a close relative to I. pacificus, against completely sequenced genomes of R. bellii OSU85-389, R. conorii, and R. felis, identified 8,190 unique sequences that are homologous to Rickettsia sequences in the NCBI Trace Archive. MetaCyc metabolic reconstructions revealed that all folate gene orthologues (folA, folC, folE, folKP, ptpS) required for de novo folate biosynthesis are present in the genome of Rickettsia buchneri in I. scapularis. To examine the metabolic capability of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, genes of the folate biosynthesis pathway of the bacterium were PCR amplified using degenerate primers. BLAST searches identified that nucleotide sequences of the folA, folC, folE, folKP, and ptpS genes possess 98.6%, 98.8%, 98.9%, 98.5% and 99.0% identity respectively to the corresponding genes of Rickettsia buchneri. Phylogenetic tree constructions show that the folate genes of phylotype G021 and homologous genes from various Rickettsia species are monophyletic. This study has shown that all folate genes exist in the genome of Rickettsia species phylotype G021 and that this bacterium has the genetic capability for de novo folate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2192408393,"Background The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) collects reports about patient safety incidents in England. Government regulators use NRLS data to assess the safety of hospitals. This study aims to examine whether annual hospital incident reporting rates can be used as a surrogate indicator of individual hospital safety. Secondly assesses which hospital characteristics are correlated with high incident reporting rates and whether a high reporting hospital is safer than those lower reporting hospitals. Finally, it assesses which health-care professionals report more incidents of patient harm, which report more near miss incidents and what hospital factors encourage reporting. These findings may suggest methods for increasing the utility of reporting systems. Methods This study used a mix methods approach for assessing NRLS data. The data were investigated using Pareto analysis and regression models to establish which patients are most vulnerable to reported harm. Hospital factors were correlated with institutional reporting rates over one year to examine what factors influenced reporting. Staff survey findings regarding hospital safety culture were correlated with reported rates of incidents causing harm; no harm and death to understand what barriers influence error disclosure. Findings 5,879,954 incident reports were collected from acute hospitals over the decade. 70.3% of incidents produced no harm to the patient and 0.9% were judged by the reporter to have caused severe harm or death. Obstetrics and Gynaecology reported the most no harm events [OR 1.61(95%CI: 1.12 to 2.27), p<0.01] and pharmacy was the hospital location where most near-misses were captured [OR 3.03(95%CI: 2.04 to 4.55), p<0.01]. Clinicians were significantly more likely to report death than other staff [OR 3.04(95%CI: 2.43 to 3.80) p<0.01]. A higher ratio of clinicians to beds correlated with reduced rate of harm reported [RR = -1.78(95%Cl: -3.33 to -0.23), p = 0.03]. Litigation claims per bed were significantly negatively associated with incident reports. Patient satisfaction and mortality outcomes were not significantly associated with reporting rates. Staff survey responses revealed that keeping reports confidential, keeping staff informed about incidents and giving feedback on safety initiatives increased reporting rates [r = 0.26 (p<0.01), r = 0.17 (p = 0.04), r = 0.23 (p = 0.01), r = 0.20 (p = 0.02)]. Conclusion The NRLS is the largest patient safety reporting system in the world. This study did not demonstrate many hospital characteristics to significantly influence overall reporting rate. There were no association between size of hospital, number of staff, mortality outcomes or patient satisfaction outcomes and incident reporting rate. The study did show that hospitals where staff reported more incidents had reduced litigation claims and when clinician staffing is increased fewer incidents reporting patient harm are reported, whilst near misses remain the same. Certain specialties report more near misses than others, and doctors report more harm incidents than near misses. Staff survey results showed that open environments and reduced fear of punitive response increases incident reporting. We suggest that reporting rates should not be used to assess hospital safety. Different healthcare professionals focus on different types of safety incidents and focusing on these areas whilst creating a responsive, confidential learning environment will increase staff engagement with error disclosure."
https://openalex.org/W2192469637,"Slow progress has been made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 in Ghana. Ensuring continuum of care (at least four antenatal visits; skilled birth attendance; postnatal care within 48 hours, at two weeks, and six weeks) for mother and newborn is crucial in helping Ghana achieve these goals and beyond. This study examined the levels and factors associated with continuum of care (CoC) completion among Ghanaian women aged 15-49.A retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted among women who experienced live births between January 2011 and April 2013 in three regions of Ghana. In a two-stage random sampling method, 1,500 women with infants were selected and interviewed about maternal and newborn service usage in line with CoC. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with CoC completion.Only 8.0% had CoC completion; the greatest gap and contributor to the low CoC was detected between delivery and postnatal care within 48 hours postpartum. About 95% of women had a minimum of four antenatal visits and postnatal care at six weeks postpartum. A total of 75% had skilled assisted delivery and 25% received postnatal care within 48 hours. Factors associated with CoC completion at 95% CI were geographical location (OR = 0.35, CI 0.13-0.39), marital status (OR = 0.45; CI 0.22-0.95), education (OR = 2.71; CI 1.11-6.57), transportation (OR = 1.97; CI 1.07-3.62), and beliefs about childhood illnesses (OR = 0.34; CI0.21-0.61).The continuum of care completion rate is low in the study site. Efforts should focus on increasing postnatal care within 48 hours and overcoming the known obstacles to increasing the continuum of care completion rate."
https://openalex.org/W2193451828,"Human monocytes are a heterogeneous cell population classified into three different subsets: Classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes. These subsets are distinguished by their differential expression of CD14 and CD16, and unique gene expression profile. So far, the variation in inter-cellular gene expression within the monocyte subsets is largely unknown. In this study, the cellular variation within each human monocyte subset from a single healthy donor was described by using a novel single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis tool. We investigated 86 different genes mainly encoding cell surface markers, and proteins involved in immune regulation. Within the three human monocyte subsets, our descriptive findings show multimodal expression of key immune response genes, such as CD40, NFⱪB1, RELA, TLR4, TLR8 and TLR9. Furthermore, we discovered one subgroup of cells within the classical monocytes, which showed alterations of 22 genes e.g. IRF8, CD40, CSF1R, NFⱪB1, RELA and TNF. Additionally one subgroup within the intermediate and non-classical monocytes also displayed distinct gene signatures by altered expression of 8 and 6 genes, respectively. Hence the three monocyte subsets can be further subdivided according to activation status and differentiation, independently of the traditional classification based on cell surface markers. Demonstrating the use and the ability to discover cell heterogeneity within defined populations of human monocytes is of great importance, and can be useful in unravelling inter-cellular variation in leukocyte populations, identifying subpopulations involved in disease pathogenesis and help tailor new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2193038774,"Molting is one of the most important biological processes in shrimp growth and development. All shrimp undergo cyclic molting periodically to shed and replace their exoskeletons. This process is essential for growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction in shrimp. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying shrimp molting remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated global expression changes in the transcriptomes of the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, the most commonly cultured shrimp species worldwide. The transcriptome of whole L. vannamei was investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) throughout the molting cycle, including the inter-molt (C), pre-molt (D0, D1, D2, D3, D4), and post-molt (P1 and P2) stages, and 93,756 unigenes were identified. Among these genes, we identified 5,117 genes differentially expressed (log2ratio ≥1 and FDR ≤0.001) in adjacent molt stages. The results were compared against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein/nucleotide sequence database, Swiss-Prot, PFAM database, the Gene Ontology database, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database in order to annotate gene descriptions, associate them with gene ontology terms, and assign them to pathways. The expression patterns for genes involved in several molecular events critical for molting, such as hormone regulation, triggering events, implementation phases, skelemin, immune responses were characterized and considered as mechanisms underlying molting in L. vannamei. Comparisons with transcriptomic analyses in other arthropods were also performed. The characterization of major transcriptional changes in genes involved in the molting cycle provides candidates for future investigation of the molecular mechanisms. The data generated in this study will serve as an important transcriptomic resource for the shrimp research community to facilitate gene and genome annotation and to characterize key molecular processes underlying shrimp development."
https://openalex.org/W2190510948,"Large size, protein binding and intracellular sequestration are well known to limit dialytic removal of compounds. In studying the normal renal and dialytic handling of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), a molecule associated with cardiovascular disease in the general population, we discovered two largely unrecognized additional limitations to sustained reduction of a solute by chronic hemodialysis. We measured solute levels and handling in subjects on chronic hemodialysis (ESRD, n = 7) and compared these with levels and clearance in normal controls (NLS, n = 6). The ESRD patients had much higher peak predialysis plasma levels of TMAO than NLS (77 ± 26 vs 2±1 μM, mean ± SD, p 0.05). However, TMAO has a volume of distribution about one half that of urea. Also in NLS the urinary clearance of TMAO was high (219±78 ml/min) compared to the urinary urea and creatinine clearances (55±14 and 119±21 ml/min, respectively). Thus, TMAO levels achieve multiples of normal much greater than those of urea due mainly to 1) TMAO's high clearance by the normal kidney relative to urea and 2) its smaller volume of distribution. Modelling suggests that only much more frequent dialysis would be required to lower levels Thus, additional strategies such as reducing production should be explored. Furthermore, using urea as the sole marker of dialysis adequacy may be misleading since a molecule, TMAO, that is dialyzed readily accumulates to much higher multiples of normal with urea based dialysis prescriptions."

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a cellular quality-control mechanism that is thought to exacerbate the phenotype of certain pathogenic nonsense mutations by preventing the expression of semi-functional proteins. NMD also limits the efficacy of read-through compound (RTC)-based therapies. Here, we report a gene-specific method of NMD inhibition using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and combine this approach with an RTC to effectively restore the expression of full-length protein from a nonsense-mutant allele."
https://openalex.org/W2191839207,"The prevalence of Salmonella from chicken and pig slaughterhouses in Henan, China and antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to antibiotics was determined. From 283 chicken samples and 240 pig samples collected, 128 and 70 Salmonella isolates were recovered with an isolation rate of 45.2 and 29.2% respectively. The predominant serovars in chicken samples were S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Hadar and S. enterica serovar Indiana, while those in pig samples were S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Derby and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was 8.6 and 10.0% for isolates from chickens and pigs respectively, whereas resistance to cefotaxime was 5.5 and 8.6%, respectively. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial agent) was markedly higher in pig isolates (57.1%) than in chicken isolates (39.8%). Of particular concern was the detection of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates, which pose risk to public health. All 16 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates detected were resistant to ciprofloxacin, among which 11 were co-resistant to cefotaxime. The S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates accumulated point mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions of gyrA (S83F/D87G or S83F/D87N) and parC (T57S/S80R). Two plasmid mediated quinolone resistant determinants were found with aac (6')-Ib-cr and oqxAB in 16 and 12 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates respectively. Cefotaxime-resistance of S. enterica serovar Indiana was associated with the acquisition of a blaCTX-M-65 gene. The potential risk of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana infection is a significant concern due to limited alternative treatment options. Reduction of Salmonella in chicken and pig slaughterhouses, in particular, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana will be an important measure to reduce the public health burden of Salmonella infections."
https://openalex.org/W2238455915,"Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles that are able to transfer RNA and proteins to target cells. The emerging role of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes as promoters of aerobic ATP synthesis restoration in damaged cells, prompted us to assess whether they contain an extramitochondrial aerobic respiration capacity. Exosomes were isolated from culture medium of human MSCs from umbilical cord of ≥37-wk-old newborns or between 28- to 30-wk-old newborns (i.e.,term or preterm infants). Characterization of samples was conducted by cytofluorometry. Oxidative phosphorylation capacity was assessed by Western blot analysis, oximetry, and luminometric and fluorometric analyses. MSC exosomes express functional respiratory complexes I, IV, and V, consuming oxygen. ATP synthesis was only detectable in exosomes from term newborns, suggestive of a specific mechanism that is not completed at an early gestational age. Activities are outward facing and comparable to those detected in mitochondria isolated from term MSCs. MSC exosomes display an unsuspected aerobic respiratory ability independent of whole mitochondria. This may be relevant for their ability to rescue cell bioenergetics. The differential oxidative metabolism of pretermvs.term exosomes sheds new light on the preterm newborn's clinical vulnerability. A reduced ability to repair damaged tissue and an increased capability to cope with anoxic environment for preterm infants can be envisaged.-Panfoli, I., Ravera, S., Podestà, M., Cossu, C., Santucci, L., Bartolucci, M., Bruschi, M., Calzia, D., Sabatini, F., Bruschettini, M., Ramenghi, L.

https://openalex.org/W2193012934,"Enzymes are capable of directing complex stereospecific transformations and of accelerating reaction rates many orders of magnitude. As even the simplest known enzymes comprise thousands of atoms, the question arises as to how such exquisite catalysts evolved. A logical predecessor would be shorter peptides, but they lack the defined structure and size that are apparently necessary for enzyme functions. However, some very short peptides are able to assemble into amyloids, thereby forming a well-defined tertiary structure called the cross-β-sheet, which bestows unique properties upon the peptides. We have hypothesized that amyloids could have been the catalytically active precursor to modern enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we designed an amyloid peptide library that could be screened for catalytic activity. Our approach, amenable to high-throughput methodologies, allowed us to find several peptides and peptide mixtures that form amyloids with esterase activity. These results indicate that amyloids, with their stability in a wide range of conditions and their potential as catalysts with low sequence specificity, would indeed be fitting precursors to modern enzymes. Furthermore, our approach can be efficiently expanded upon in library size, screening conditions, and target activity to yield novel amyloid catalysts with potential applications in aqueous-organic mixtures, at high temperature and in other extreme conditions that could be advantageous for industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2304280740,"Aedes aegypti is responsible for the transmission of dengue, a disease that infects millions of people each year. Although essential oils are well recognized as sources of compounds with repellent and larvicidal activities against the dengue mosquito, much less is known about their oviposition deterrent effects. Commiphora leptophloeos, a tree native to South America, has important pharmacological properties, but the chemical profile and applicability of its essential oil in controlling the spread of the dengue mosquito have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the composition of C. leptophloeos leaf oil and to evaluate its larvicidal and oviposition deterrent effects against A. aegypti. Fifty-five components of the essential oil were detected by gas chromatography (GC)—mass spectrometry, with α-phellandrene (26.3%), (E)-caryophyllene (18.0%) and β-phellandrene (12.9%) identified as the major constituents. Bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong oviposition deterrent effects against A. aegypti at concentrations between 25 and 100 ppm, and possessed good larvicidal activity (LC50 = 99.4 ppm). Analysis of the oil by GC coupled with electroantennographic detection established that seven constituents could trigger antennal depolarization in A. aegypti gravid females. Two of these components, namely (E)-caryophyllene and α-humulene, were present in substantial proportions in the oil, and oviposition deterrence assays confirmed that both were significantly active at concentrations equivalent to those present in the oil. It is concluded that these sesquiterpenes are responsible, at least in part, for the deterrent effect of the oil. The oviposition deterrent activity of the leaf oil of C. leptophloeos is one of the most potent reported so far, suggesting that it could represent an interesting alternative to synthetic insecticides. The results of this study highlight the importance of integrating chemical and electrophysiological methods for screening natural compounds for their potential in combating vectors of insect-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2190389820,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of deaths in America. The major cause of mortality can be attributed to metastasis. Cancer metastasis involves sequential and interrelated events. miRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are implicated in this process. miR-195 is downregulated in many human cancers. However, the roles of miR-195 in PCa metastasis and EMT remain unclear. In this study, data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prostate cancer database were re-analysed to detect miR-195 expression and its roles in PCa. miR-195 was then overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3. The role of miR-195 in migration and invasion in vitro was also investigated, and common markers in EMT were evaluated through Western blot analysis. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-195; were validated in PCa cells. In MSKCC data re-analyses, miR-195 was poorly expressed in metastatic PCa; miR-195 could be used to diagnose metastatic PCa by measuring the corresponding expression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was 0.705 (P = 0.017). Low miR-195 expression was characterised with a shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) time. miR-195 overexpression suppressed cell migration, invasion and EMT. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was confirmed as a direct target of miR-195. FGF2 knockdown also suppressed migration, invasion and EMT; by contrast, increased FGF2 partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-195. And data from ONCOMINE prostate cancer database showed that PCa patients with high FGF2 expression showed shorter RFS time (P = 0.046). Overall, this study demonstrated that miR-195 suppressed PCa cell metastasis by downregulating FGF2. miR-195 restoration may be considered as a new therapeutic method to treat metastatic PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2214266235,"Impaired function of the Ikaros (IKZF1) protein is associated with the development of high-risk B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The mechanisms of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity in leukemia are unknown. Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that Ikaros represses transcription of the histone H3K4 demethylase, JARID1B (KDM5B). Transcriptional repression of JARID1B is associated with increased global levels of H3K4 trimethylation. Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B is dependent on the activity of the histone deacetylase, HDAC1, which binds to the upstream regulatory element of JARID1B in complex with Ikaros. In leukemia, JARID1B is overexpressed, and its inhibition results in cellular growth arrest. Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B in leukemia is impaired by pro-oncogenic casein kinase 2 (CK2). Inhibition of CK2 results in increased binding of the Ikaros-HDAC1 complex to the promoter of JARID1B, with increased formation of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 and decreased histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation. In cases of high-risk B-ALL that carry deletion of one Ikaros (IKZF1) allele, targeted inhibition of CK2 restores Ikaros binding to the JARID1B promoter and repression of JARID1B. In summary, the presented data suggest a mechanism through which Ikaros and HDAC1 regulate the epigenetic signature in leukemia: via regulation of JARID1B transcription. The presented data identify JARID1B as a novel therapeutic target in B-ALL and provide a rationale for the use of CK2 inhibitors in the treatment of high-risk B-ALL."

Each Kv channel gene encodes a single protein, and functional Kv channels consist on homo- or heterotretrameric complexes within the same subfamily members (Kv1–Kv12).

Kv1.3 channels have been described as modulators of cell proliferation in many different tissues, most notably T-cells and VSMCs, but also in several cancer cell types, macrophages, microglia, and oligodendrocyte progenitors (10Kotecha S.A.

In fact, the pro-proliferative effect of Kv1.3 could be also reproduced by its overexpression in a heterologous system in cells that do not normally express the protein (13Cidad P. Jiménez-Pérez L.

However, although the contribution of the Kv1.3 channels to activation, migration, and proliferation seems to be well established, the mechanisms by which Kv1.3 expression modulates these processes are mostly unknown to date. Several mechanisms, which may not be mutually exclusive, have been proposed, including the interaction of Kv1.3 with integrin receptors (14Levite M. Cahalon L. Peretz A. Hershkoviz R. Sobko A.

In addition to this role of Kv1.3 channels in cell proliferation, there is evidence of a reciprocal modulation, as certain mitogens induce Kv1.3 channel up-regulation (5DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G.

This observation led us to hypothesize that the Kv1.3/Kv1.5 ratio could be a landmark to define VSMCs phenotype, as proliferation of VSMCs derived from different vascular beds in both mice and human associates with an expression switch from Kv1.5 to Kv1.3 (13Cidad P. Jiménez-Pérez L. García-Arribas D. Miguel-Velado E. Tajada S. Ruiz-McDavitt C. López-López J.R. Pérez-García M.T.

Furthermore, in support of this hypothesis we have previously described that heterologous expression of Kv1.3 increased HEK cell proliferation, whereas Kv1.5 expression decreases basal HEK proliferation (13Cidad P. Jiménez-Pérez L. García-Arribas D. Miguel-Velado E. Tajada S. Ruiz-McDavitt C. López-López J.R. Pérez-García M.T.

Biol. 2012; 32: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An important question regarding the mechanisms linking Kv1.3 expression to proliferation is whether this association depends on the ion-conducting properties of the channel (and hence of the feedback regulation of EM (17Hu L. Gocke A.R. Knapp E. Rosenzweig J.M. Grishkan I.V. Baxi E.G. Zhang H. Margolick J.B. Whartenby K.A. Calabresi P.A.

There are previous studies demonstrating that the effects of several K channels on cell proliferation are not dependent on conducting properties of the channel proteins (13Cidad P. Jiménez-Pérez L.

Calcium-activated K+ channels increase cell proliferation independent of K+ conductance.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C792-C802Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the first study we found that poreless Kv1.3 mutants can induce proliferation to the same extent that wild type channels, an effect that is lost in mutant voltage-insensitive channels or channels unable to localize to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Kv1.3 proteins are docking sites that allow the activation of proliferative signaling cascades. In native VSMCs we found that PDGF-induced proliferation could be inhibited by either selective Kv1.3 blockers (Margatoxin or 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen) or by blockers of MEK/ERK and PLCγ pathways, both effects being non-additive (22Cidad P. Miguel-Velado E. Ruiz-McDavitt C. Alonso E. Jiménez-Pérez L. Asuaje A. Carmona Y. García-Arribas D. López J. Marroquín Y. Fernández M. Roqué M. Pérez-García M.T. López-López J.R. Kv1.3 channels modulate human vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation independently of mTOR signaling pathway.Pflugers Arch. 2015; 467: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which suggests a shared mechanism. However, the detailed description of the role of Kv1.3 channels modulating mitogen-induced signaling cascades awaits further characterization. In this work we sought to explore in more detail the contribution of Kv1.3 channels to cell proliferation by addressing some of the questions raised above. First, on the basis of the opposite effects of Kv1.5 and Kv1.3 channels on HEK cell proliferation, we constructed chimeric Kv1.3/Kv1.5 channels to identify the molecular determinants involved in those effects. Our data pointed to the intracellular C-terminal domain of Kv1.3 as responsible for the increased proliferation rate. Next, we explored the contribution of individual residues within this C-terminal region by mutation to alanine of the eight predicted phosphorylation residues. This approach identified a short region in the C terminus (the YS segment) comprising two residues (Tyr-447 and Ser-459) whose mutation abolished Kv1.3-induced proliferation. The contribution of YS segment to Kv1.3-induced proliferation was confirmed by designing several mutant channels, including a C-terminal-truncated Kv1.3 channel retaining the YS segment and chimeric Kv1.5 channels harboring the YS segment at different positions within their C terminus. Second, we also identified one signaling pathway that could link Kv1.3 phosphorylation and proliferation, as genetic or pharmacological blockade of MEK/inhibited Kv1.3 induced proliferation and phosphotyrosine labeling of the channel. Finally, we observed that voltage-induced conformational changes of Kv1.3 channels are important for proliferation, regulating the accessibility of these tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Channel phosphorylation increased by maneuvers that facilitate the closed to open transition and was diminished in mutant channels that reside in the inactivated state. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml each), 5 μg/ml Fungizone, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. HEK cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of DNA by using LipofectamineTM 2000 or TransIT-X2® reagent (Mirrus). For siRNA experiments, HEK cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of DNA together with one or a mixture of siRNA at a final concentration of 5 nm. Transfection efficiency was quantified in each experiment by fluorescence microscopy (35–60%). Treatments with specific inhibitors (PD98059 20 μm, Tocris Bioscience) or with modified media were applied during 4 h before determinations. Full-length hKv1.5 and hKv1.3 were obtained from either cDNA or genomic uterine artery VSMC DNA (MagNA Pure Systems, Roche Applied Science) to generate C-terminal fusion proteins when subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (addgene) or pmCherry-N1 (Clontech), respectively: pEGFP-N1-hKv1.5 and pmCherry-N1-hKv1.3. Chimeric K5N3 and K5C3 channels were generated by PCR using Phusion® Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). N or C termini from the Kv1.5 backbone were replaced by the corresponding domains of Kv1.3, creating the fusion proteins: pmCherry-N1-K5N3 and pEGFP-N1-K5C3. YS fragment is a 16-amino acid-residue fragment located at the proximal region of the C-terminal of Kv1.3 and containing residues Tyr-447 and Ser-459. The YS fragment was inserted within the hKv1.5 COOH terminus at two different positions, amino acid 532 (Kv1.5-YS532) by overlap extension PCR or at the end of the C terminus (amino acid 613, Kv1.5-YS613), by designing overlapping oligos. A truncated Kv1.3 containing the YS fragment and lacking C-terminal amino acids 461–523 (Kv1.3-YS) was also generated with overlapping oligos. Alanine substitutions were introduced at any of the potential phosphorylation residues Ser, Thr, and Tyr (predicted by NetPhos 2.0 Server) of Kv1.3 C terminus. With the exception of T439A that served as a control, all the selected residues were out of the Kv1.3-Kv1.5 consensus amino acid sequence. Mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kits using pmCherry-N1-hKv1.3 fusion protein as template. All constructs were sequence-verified. Once transfected, cells were counted with a hemocytometer and seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well on 12-mm poly-lysine-coated coverslips. Proliferation was determined 24 h after seeding cells using a commercial kit (ClickiT® EdU Imaging Cell Proliferation Assay, Invitrogen) following previously described protocols (22Cidad P. Miguel-Velado E. Ruiz-McDavitt C. Alonso E. Jiménez-Pérez L. Asuaje A. Carmona Y. García-Arribas D. López J. Marroquín Y. Fernández M. Roqué M. Pérez-García M.T. López-López J.R. Kv1.3 channels modulate human vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation independently of mTOR signaling pathway.Pflugers Arch. 2015; 467: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells at the S phase was quantified using 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation for a 30-min period. Determinations were carried out in triplicate samples, and controls were included in all experiments. HEK cells were transfected with Ambion, Silencer® Select siRNAs. The siRNAs used were MAP2K1 (s11176 and s11168), MAP2K2 (s11170), and negative control (AM-4611). 48 h afer transfection total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA levels were determined by qPCR with Taqman® probes in a Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Corbett Research). Data were analyzed with the threshold cycle relative quantification method (ΔΔCt), normalized to an endogenous control (ribosomal protein L18). Taqman assays used were Hs00983247_g1 (MAP2K1) and Hs01673993_m1 (MAP2K2). The corresponding siRNAs reduced MAP2K1 mRNA by 10-fold (from 0.96 ± 0.08 to 0.1 ± 0.003) and MAP2K2 by 3-fold (from 1.05 ± 0.1 to 0.36 ± 0.6). No cross-reactivity was observed. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL method (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Roche Applied Science) 24 h after seeding transfected HEK293 cells. Experimental positive and negative controls were also performed. Ionic currents were recorded at room temperature using the whole-cell or the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique as previously described (13Cidad P. Jiménez-Pérez L.

For the whole cell experiments we used an internal solution (High-K+i) containing (125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP (pH 7.2 with KOH)). The composition of the bath solution (Standard-e) was 141 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200 patch clamp amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz (−3 db, 4-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 10 kHz. When leak subtraction was performed, an online P/4 protocol was used. Recordings were digitized with a Digidata 1200 A/D interface driven by CLAMPEX 8 software (Axon Instruments). Outward K+ currents were elicited by depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV to +40 mV applied in 10-s intervals. In some cells full current/voltage curves were constructed from potentials ranging from −60 to +100mV in 10-mV steps. Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 were defined by their sensitivity to the selective blockers 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (100 nm) and diphenyl phosphine oxide-1 (DPO; 1 μm), respectively. Cell attached recordings were used for the kinetic characterization of the currents, with a pipette solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH) and a bath solution (High-K+e) with 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2 with KOH). Currents were elicited by 500 ms depolarizing pulses to +40 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. IV curves were constructed with 800-ms-depolarizing pulses from −80 to +100 mV in 20-mV steps applied every 10 s. Conductance curves were obtained from the amplitude of the fit to a mono-exponential function of the tail currents upon repolarization to −80 mV. After normalization to the maximal conductance (Gmax) the data were fitted to a Boltzmann function to obtain the V0.5 of activation and the slope of the curve. The steady-state inactivation was studied with a two-pulse protocol, in which a 200-ms pulse to +40 mV was preceded by a family 1.8-s depolarizing pulses from −100 to +40 mV in 20-mV intervals applied every 20 s. The peak current amplitude of the +40-mV pulse was normalized to the maximal amplitude (obtained with the −100-mV prepulse), plotted as a function of the prepulse potential, and fitted to a Boltzmann function. To determine the membrane potential in the cell-attached patch, we assumed that in the High-K+e there was no voltage difference across the cell membrane. This was confirmed with the measurement of the K+i from an instantaneous IV curve. 100-ms depolarizing prepulses to +60 mV were followed by repolarization to potentials from −100 to +60 mV. The IV curve obtained allowed determination of the reversal potential of the current and calculation of the K+i so that we could correct the estimated transmembrane potentials. Transfected HEK293 cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde 24 h after seeding and blocked in 2% of normal goat serum with PBS (nonpermeabilized cells) or Triton X-100 0.1% (permeabilized cells). Non-permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-Kv1.3 or anti Kv1.5 extracellular primary antibodies (APC101 or APC150, Alomone Labs), whereas permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-Kv1.3 COOH (75-009, NeuroMab) or anti-Kv1.5 COOH (APC004, Alomone Labs), all at a final concentration of 1:50. Goat anti-rabbit 488 (A-11008, Molecular Probes), goat anti-rabbit 532 (A-11009, Molecular Probes), or goat anti-mouse 532 (A-11002, Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000. Hoechst 33342 (1:2000)-labeled nuclei and coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Photomicrographs were acquired with a LEICA SP5 confocal microscope using LAS software. Confocal images from non-permeabilized transfected HEK293 cells were used to assess the relative expression of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 constructs at the plasma membrane. 63× (1.4NA) objectives were used to capture images and Z-stacks with a pinhole aperture of 1 airy unit (95.5 μm with our experimental settings) and a voxel size compatible with the Nyquist criterion. Images were binarized using a threshold that was automatically defined by Fiji software rsb.info.nih.gov). EGFP (488ex/507em) or mCherry fluorescence (587ex/610em) was taken as a measure of total expression of the fusion proteins (ATotal), whereas secondary antibody images, 532 (531ex/554em) or 488 (495ex/519em) defined the membrane area (AMembrane). Both values were used to compute the % of membrane expression. Transfected HEK293 cells incubated with the corresponding treatments were treated with 250 μm pervanadate during the last 5 min of incubation. Cell lysates collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phosphatase inhibitors NaF and Na3VO4 were incubated with RFP/GFP-Trap_A beads (ChromoTek) for 2–3 h and used for immunoblotting. They were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Millipore), rat monoclonal anti-RFP antibody (5F8, ChromoTek), rat monoclonal anti-GFP (3H9, ChromoTek), rabbit anti p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling 9101), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (ab8226, Abcam) were u"

However, knowledge on this subject is currently very limited. The primary aim of this study was to characterize composition and short- and long-term stability of the intestinal microbiota in healthy children. Between November 2011 and June 2014, 61 children 2 to 18 yr of age from different areas in The Netherlands were included and instructed to collect fecal samples weekly, for 6 wk, and a follow-up sample after 18 mo. The intergenic spacer profiling technique (IS-pro) was used to analyze all available fecal samples. Microbial diversity was calculated by the Shannon diversity index and individual compositional stability by comparing all collection time points. Microbial stability varied per phylum (P < 0.0005), declined rapidly in a short time period, and subsequently stabilized on the long run with very gradual variation, leading to an overall compositional stability of 70% on average over a period of 18 mo. Higher species diversity was correlated to a higher overall compositional stability (P< 0.001). We observed an age-independent bacterial shared core consisting of a limited number of species. In conclusion, in this study, we showed that microbial composition stability in children varied per phylum, at both short-term and long-term intervals.

Deregulated expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 is observed in colorectal cancer. Hairy/enhancer of split (HES) family, the most characterized targets of Notch, involved in the development of many cancers. In this study, we explored the role of Hes1 in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer. Knocking down Hes1 induced CRC cell senescence and decreased the invasion ability, whereas over-expression of Hes1 increased STAT3 phosphorylation activity and up-regulated MMP14 protein level. We further explored the expression of Hes1 in human colorectal cancer and found high Hes1 mRNA expression is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. These findings suggest that Hes1 regulates the invasion ability through the STAT3-MMP14 pathway in CRC cells and high Hes1 expression is a predictor of poor prognosis of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2195864324,"One of the fundamental principles of social organization, age polyethism, describes behavioral maturation of workers leading to switches in task preference. Here we present a system that allows for studying division of labor (DOL) by taking advantage of the relative short life of Cardiocondyla obscurior workers and thereby the pace of behavioral transitions. By challenging same-age young and older age cohorts to de novo establish DOL into nurse and foraging tasks and by forcing nurses to precociously become foragers and vice versa we studied expression patterns of one of the best known candidates for social insect worker behavior, the foraging gene. Contrary to our expectations we found that foraging gene expression correlates with age, but not with the task foraging per se. This suggests that this nutrition-related gene, and the pathways it is embedded in, correlates with physiological changes over time and potentially primes, but not determines task preference of individual workers."
https://openalex.org/W2193221771,"The transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM)-3 channel is critical for various physiologic processes. In somatosensory neurons, TRPM3 has been implicated in temperature perception and inflammatory hyperalgesia, whereas in pancreatic β-cells the channel has been linked to glucose-induced insulin release. As a typical representative of the TRP family, TRPM3 is highly polymodal. In cells, it is activated by heat and chemical agonists, including pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and nifedipine (Nif). To define the nuances of TRPM3 channel activity and its modulators, we succeeded in incorporating the TRPM3 protein into planar lipid bilayers. We found that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or clotrimazole is necessary for channel opening by PS. Unlike PS, the presence of Nif alone sufficed to induce TRPM3 activity and demonstrated distinct gating behavior. We also performed an extensive thermodynamic analysis of TRPM3 activation and found that TRPM3 exhibited slight temperature sensitivity in the bilayers. In the absence of other agonists TRPM3 channels remained closed upon heat-induced stimulation, but opened in the presence of PIP2, although with only a low open-probability profile. Together, our results elucidate the details peculiar to TRPM3 channel function in an isolated system. We confirmed its direct gating by PS and PIP2, but found a lack of the strong intrinsic temperature sensitivity common to other thermosensitive TRP channels."
https://openalex.org/W2195125755,"AtNHX5 and AtNHX6, the endosomal Na+,K+/H+ antiporters in Arabidopsis, play an important role in plant growth and development. However, their function in K+ and pH homeostasis remains unclear. In this report, we characterized the function of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in K+ and H+ homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Using a yeast expression system, we found that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 recovered tolerance to high K+ or salt. We further found that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 functioned at high K+ at acidic pH while AtCHXs at low K+ under alkaline conditions. In addition, we showed that the nhx5 nhx6 double mutant contained less K+ and was sensitive to low K+ treatment. Overexpression of AtNHX5 or AtNHX6 gene in nhx5 nhx6 recovered root growth to the wild-type level. Three conserved acidic residues, D164, E188, and D193 in AtNHX5 and D165, E189, and D194 in AtNHX6, were essential for K+ homeostasis and plant growth. nhx5 nhx6 had a reduced vacuolar and cellular pH as measured with the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF or semimicroelectrode. We further show that AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 are localized to Golgi and TGN. Taken together, AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 play an important role in K+ and pH homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Three conserved acidic residues are essential for K+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W2195856678,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, affecting many biological processes. As yet, their roles in the response of chrysanthemum to aphid feeding have not been explored. Here, the identity and abundance of miRNAs induced by aphid infestation have been obtained using high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Three leaf small RNA libraries were generated, one from plants infested with the aphid Macrosiphoniella sanbourni (library A), one from plants with mock puncture treatment (library M), and the third from untreated control plants (library CK). A total of 7,944,797, 7,605,251 and 9,244,002 clean unique reads, ranging from 18 to 30 nucleotides (nt) in length, were obtained from library CK, A and M, respectively. As a result, 303 conserved miRNAs belonging to 276 miRNAs families and 234 potential novel miRNAs were detected in chrysanthemum leaf, out of which 80, 100 and 79 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the comparison of CK-VS-A, CK-VS-M and M-VS-A, respectively. Several of the differentially abundant miRNAs (in particular miR159a, miR160a, miR393a) may be associated with the plant's response to aphid infestation."
https://openalex.org/W2195969592,"To investigate whether cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) is altered in normal weight young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who exhibit mild insulin resistance.Seven women with PCOS were compared to eleven healthy female controls of similar age, education and body mass index. Regional brain glucose uptake was quantified using FDG with dynamic positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and its potential relationship with insulin resistance assessed using the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR). A battery of cognitive tests was administered to evaluate working memory, attention and executive function.The PCOS group had 10% higher fasting glucose and 40% higher HOMA2-IR (p ≤ 0.035) compared to the Controls. The PCOS group had 9-14% lower CMRglu in specific regions of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (p ≤ 0.018). A significant negative relation was found between the CMRglu and HOMA2-IR mainly in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices as well as in the hippocampus and the amygdala (p ≤ 0.05). Globally, cognitive performance was normal in both groups but scores on the PASAT test of working memory tended to be low in the PCOS group.The PCOS group exhibited a pattern of low regional CMRglu that correlated inversely with HOMA2-IR in several brain regions and which resembled the pattern seen in aging and early Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that a direct association between mild insulin resistance and brain glucose hypometabolism independent of overweight or obesity can exist in young adults in their 20s. Further investigation of the influence of insulin resistance on brain glucose metabolism and cognition in younger and middle-aged adults is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2419163840,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity has been shown to be involved in the sperm acrosome reaction (AR), but the molecular identity of PLA2 isoforms has remained elusive. Here, we have tested the role of two intracellular (iPLA2β and cytosolic PLA2α) and one secreted (group X) PLA2s in spontaneous and progesterone (P4)-induced AR by using a set of specific inhibitors and knock-out mice. iPLA2β is critical for spontaneous AR, whereas both iPLA2β and group X secreted PLA2 are involved in P4-induced AR. Cytosolic PLA2α is dispensable in both types of AR. P4-induced AR spreads over 30 min in the mouse, and kinetic analyses suggest the presence of different sperm subpopulations, using distinct PLA2 pathways to achieve AR. At low P4 concentration (2 μm), sperm undergoing early AR (0-5 min post-P4) rely on iPLA2β, whereas sperm undergoing late AR (20-30 min post-P4) rely on group X secreted PLA2. Moreover, the role of PLA2s in AR depends on P4 concentration, with the PLA2s being key actors at low physiological P4 concentrations (≤2 μm) but not at higher P4 concentrations (~10 μm)."
https://openalex.org/W2193976266,"Pigment-based coloration is a common trait found in a variety of organisms across the tree of life. For example, calcareous avian eggs are natural structures that vary greatly in color, yet just a handful of tetrapyrrole pigment compounds are responsible for generating this myriad of colors. To fully understand the diversity and constraints shaping nature’s palette, it is imperative to characterize the similarities and differences in the types of compounds involved in color production across diverse lineages. Pigment composition was investigated in eggshells of eleven paleognath bird taxa, covering several extinct and extant lineages, and shells of four extant species of mollusks. Birds and mollusks are two distantly related, calcareous shell-building groups, thus characterization of pigments in their calcareous structures would provide insights to whether similar compounds are found in different phyla (Chordata and Mollusca). An ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction protocol was used to analyze the presence and concentration of biliverdin and protoporphyrin, two known and ubiquitous tetrapyrrole avian eggshell pigments, in all avian and molluscan samples. Biliverdin was solely detected in birds, including the colorful eggshells of four tinamou species. In contrast, protoporphyrin was detected in both the eggshells of several avian species and in the shells of all mollusks. These findings support previous hypotheses about the ubiquitous deposition of tetrapyrroles in the eggshells of various bird lineages and provide evidence for its presence also across distantly related animal taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2194211564,"Overabundant populations of ungulates have caused environmental degradation and loss of biological diversity in ecosystems throughout the world. Culling or regulated harvest is often used to control overabundant species. These methods are difficult to implement in national parks, other types of conservation reserves, or in residential areas where public hunting may be forbidden by policy. As a result, fertility control has been recommended as a non-lethal alternative for regulating ungulate populations. We evaluate this alternative using white-tailed deer in national parks in the vicinity of Washington, D.C., USA as a model system. Managers seek to reduce densities of white-tailed deer from the current average (50 deer per km2) to decrease harm to native plant communities caused by deer. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model using 13 years of population estimates from 8 national parks in the National Capital Region Network. We offer a novel way to evaluate management actions relative to goals using short term forecasts. Our approach confirms past analyses that fertility control is incapable of rapidly reducing deer abundance. Fertility control can be combined with culling to maintain a population below carrying capacity with a high probability of success. This gives managers confronted with problematic overabundance a framework for implementing management actions with a realistic assessment of uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W2191934635,"A large number of experimental studies using young adult subjects have shown that ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) protects against ischemia heart disease. However, ginseng has not been explored for its anti-I/R effect and mechanism of action in the aged myocardium. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the long-term consumption of ginseng extract on myocardial I/R in an in vivo rat model and explore the potential underlying mechanism.Young (6-mo-old) and intermediate-aged (18-mo-old) rats were gavaged with either standardized ginseng extract (RSE) at 80 mg/kg or vehicle for 90 days. The rats were sacrificed after LAD coronary artery ligation was performed to induce 30 min of ischemia, followed by 90 min of reperfusion. The myocardial infarct size was measured. Left ventricular function was evaluated using pressure-volume loops. The levels of survival, apoptotic and longevity protein expression were assessed through Western blot analysis. Myocardial pathology was detected through H&E or Masson's trichrome staining. We observed higher infarct expansion with impairment in the LV functional parameters, such as LVSP and LVEDP, in aged rats compared with young rats. Enhanced Akt phosphorylation and eNOS expression in RSE-treated aged hearts were accompanied with reduced infarct size, improved cardiac performance, and inducted survival signals. In contrast, p-Erk and caspase 7 were significantly downregulated in aged rats, suggesting that cardiomyocyte apoptosis was suppressed after RSE treatment. RSE also inhibited caspase-3/7 activation and decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Consistent with the results of apoptosis, Sirt1 and Sirt3 were significantly increased in the RSE-treated aged heart compared with vehicle-treated I/R, suggesting that the anti-aging effect was correlated with the anti-apoptotic activity of RSE.These findings suggest that the long-term consumption of ginseng extract reduced the susceptibility of intermediate-aged hearts to acute ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. These effects might be mediated through the activation of Akt/eNOS, suppression of Erk/caspase 7 and upregulation of Sirt1 and Sirt3 in intermediate-aged rats."

The cells were fixed, incubated with the anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Absorbances at 450 and 540 nm were determined using a microplate reader (model 3550; Bio-Rad). The proliferations of mouse colonic epithelial cells treated with or without CopA3 were also measured. Colonic explants were obtained from male CD1 mice (Daehan Biolink, Daejeon, South Korea); washed in PBS, treated with or without CopA3 for 36 h in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin; cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C; and then further incubated with the BrdU mixture for 12 h. The conditioned tissues were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h, incubated with the anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The tissues were washed with H2O, sonicated in PBS containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and centrifuged (11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Clear supernatants were collected, and the amount of BrdU in supernatants was measured. CopA3 (2 μg/ml in the drinking water) was administered to male C57BL/6 mice for 5 days. The mice were euthanized, and their colons were isolated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (17Yui S.

The mice were anesthetized, and both renal pedicles were ligated with 5–0 silk to prevent urinary excretion of the fluorescent probe. Silk ligation was used to prepare loops in the colons of mice exposed to CopA3 with or without DSS-induced colitis and in the ilea of the small intestine in mice subjected to toxin A-induced enteritis. Each loop was lumenally injected with normal saline (0.3 ml, PBS) containing fluorescein-labeled dextran (molecular weight, 4,000; 25 mg/ml; Sigma) using a 0.5-ml U-100 insulin syringe. To keep the animals warm and protect the dye from light exposure, each mouse was covered with an aluminum foil blanket. After 3 h, 0.5 ml of blood was collected by cardiac stab. The blood was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was diluted 1:2 in PBS (pH 7.3). The concentration of fluorescein-labeled dextran was determined with a GloMax 20/20 (Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described (19Alscher K.T. Phang P.T. McDonald T.E. Walley K.R.

Hematoxylin- and eosin-stainedcolonic sections were coded for blind microscopic assessment of inflammation. Histological scoring was based on two parameters. Severity of inflammation was scored as follows: 0, rare inflammatory cells in the lamina propria; 1, increased numbers of granulocytes in the lamina propria; 2, confluence of inflammatory cells extending into the submucosa; and 3, transmural extension of the inflammatory infiltrate. Epithelial damage was scored as follows: 0, intact crypts; 1, loss of the basal one-third; 2, loss of the basal two-thirds; and 3, entire crypt loss.

PCR for human p21Cip1/Waf1 (370 bp) was performed using primers 5′-GGCAGACCAGCATGACAGATTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCGGATTAGGGCTTCCTCT-3′ (antisense). β-Actin was amplified as the control. PCR was conducted for an optimal number of cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min.

While the scientific utility of replications is unquestionable, the impact of failed replication efforts and the discussions surrounding them deserve more attention. Specifically, the debates about failed replications on social media have led to worry, in some scientists, regarding reputation. In order to gain data-informed insights into these issues, we collected data from 281 published scientists. We assessed whether scientists overestimate the negative reputational effects of a failed replication in a scenario-based study. Second, we assessed the reputational consequences of admitting wrongness (versus not) as an original scientist of an effect that has failed to replicate. Our data suggests that scientists overestimate the negative reputational impact of a hypothetical failed replication effort. We also show that admitting wrongness about a non-replicated finding is less harmful to one's reputation than not admitting. Finally, we discovered a hint of evidence that feelings about the replication movement can be affected by whether replication efforts are aimed one's own work versus the work of another. Given these findings, we then present potential ways forward in these discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2190887878,"To explore the perspectives of a diverse group of stakeholders engaged in medicines decision making around what constitutes an ""essential"" medicine, and how the Essential Medicines List (EML) concept functions in a high income country context.In-depth qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 Australian stakeholders, recognised as decision makers, leaders or advisors in the area of medicines reimbursement or supply chain management. Participants were recruited from government, pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical wholesale/distribution companies, medicines non-profit organisations, academic health disciplines, hospitals, and consumer groups. Perspectives on the definition and application of the EML concept in a high income country context were thematically analysed using grounded theory approach.Stakeholders found it challenging to describe the EML concept in the Australian context because many perceived it was generally used in resource scarce settings. Stakeholders were unable to distinguish whether nationally reimbursed medicines were essential medicines in Australia. Despite frequent generic drug shortages and high prices paid by consumers, many struggled to describe how the EML concept applied to Australia. Instead, broad inclusion of consumer needs, such as rare and high cost medicines, and consumer involvement in the decision making process, has led to expansive lists of nationally subsidised medicines. Therefore, improved communication and coordination is needed around shared interests between stakeholders regarding how medicines are prioritised and guaranteed in the supply chain.This study showed that decision-making in Australia around reimbursement of medicines has strayed from the fundamental utilitarian concept of essential medicines. Many stakeholders involved in medicine reimbursement decisions and management of the supply chain did not consider the EML concept in their approach. The wide range of views of what stakeholders considered were essential medicines, challenges whether the EML concept is out-dated or underutilised in high income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2193758905,"Living sperm whales are represented by only three species (Physeter macrocephalus, Kogia breviceps and Kogia sima), but their fossil record provides evidence of an ecologically diverse array of different forms, including morphologies and body sizes without analog among living physeteroids. Here we provide a redescription of Ontocetus oxymycterus, a large but incomplete fossil sperm whale specimen from the middle Miocene Monterey Formation of California, described by Remington Kellogg in 1925. The type specimen consists of a partial rostrum, both mandibles, an isolated upper rostrum fragment, and incomplete tooth fragments. Although incomplete, these remains exhibit characteristics that, when combined, set it apart morphologically from all other known physeteroids (e.g., a closed mesorostral groove, and the retention of enameled tooth crowns). Kellogg originally placed this species in the genus Ontocetus, a enigmatic tooth taxon reported from the 19th century, based on similarities between the type specimen Ontocetus emmonsi and the conspicuously large lower dentition of Ontocetus oxymycterus. However, the type of the genus Ontocetus is now known to represent a walrus tusk (belonging to fossil Odobenidae) instead of a cetacean tooth. Thus, we assign this species to the new genus Albicetus, creating the new combination of Albicetus oxymycterus, gen. nov. We provide new morphological observations of the type specimen, including a 3D model. We also calculate a total length of approximately 6 m in life, using cranial proxies of body size for physeteroids. Lastly, a phylogenetic analysis of Albicetus oxymycterus with other fossil and living Physeteroidea resolves its position as a stem physeteroid, implying that large body size and robust dentition in physeteroids evolved multiple times and in distantly related lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2194551304,"According to classic niche theory, species can coexist in heterogeneous environments by reducing interspecific competition via niche partitioning, e.g. trophic or spatial partitioning. However, support for the role of competition on niche partitioning remains controversial. Here, we tested for spatial and trophic partitioning in feather mites, a diverse and abundant group of arthropods. We focused on the two dominant mite species, Microspalax brevipes and Zachvatkinia ovata, inhabiting flight feathers of the Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis. We performed mite counts across and within primary and tail feathers on free-living shearwaters breeding on an oceanic island (Gran Canaria, Canary Islands). We then investigated trophic relationships between the two mite species and the host using stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen on mite tissues and potential host food sources. The distribution of the two mite species showed clear spatial segregation among feathers; M. brevipes showed high preference for the central wing primary feathers, whereas Z. ovata was restricted to the two outermost primaries. Morphological differences between M. brevipes and Z. ovata support an adaptive basis for the spatial segregation of the two mite species. However, the two mites overlap in some central primaries and statistical modeling showed that Z. ovata tends to outcompete M. brevipes. Isotopic analyses indicated similar isotopic values for the two mite species and a strong correlation in carbon signatures between mites inhabiting the same individual host suggesting that diet is mainly based on shared host-associated resources. Among the four candidate tissues examined (blood, feather remains, skin remains and preen gland oil), we conclude that the diet is most likely dominated by preen gland oil, while the contribution of exogenous material to mite diets is less marked. Our results indicate that ongoing competition for space and resources plays a central role in structuring feather mite communities. They also illustrate that symbiotic infracommunities are excellent model systems to study trophic ecology, and can improve our understanding of mechanisms of niche differentiation and species coexistence."
https://openalex.org/W2196376684,"We describe a new treefrog species of Dendropsophus collected on rocky outcrops in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Ecologically, the new species can be distinguished from all known congeners by having a larval phase associated with rainwater accumulated in bromeliad phytotelms instead of temporary or lentic water bodies. Phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data confirms that the new species is a member of Dendropsophus; our analysis does not assign it to any recognized species group in the genus. Morphologically, based on comparison with the 96 known congeners, the new species is diagnosed by its small size, framed dorsal color pattern, and short webbing between toes IV-V. The advertisement call is composed of a moderate-pitched two-note call (~5 kHz). The territorial call contains more notes and pulses than the advertisement call. Field observations suggest that this new bromeligenous species uses a variety of bromeliad species to breed in, and may be both territorial and exhibit male parental care."

We investigated the role of TLR4 in lung protection, using used bone marrow chimeras; cell-specific transgenic modeling; and lentiviral delivery in vivo to knock down or express TLR4 in various lung compartments; and lung-specific VEGF transgenic mice to investigate the effect of TLR4 on VEGF-mediated protection. C57/BL6 mice were exposed to 100% oxygen in an enclosed chamber and assessed for survival and lung injury. Primary endothelial cells were stimulated with recombinant VEGF and exposed to hyperoxia or hydrogen peroxide. Endothelium-specific expression of human TLR4 (as opposed to its expression in epithelium or immune cells) increased the survival of TLR4-deficent mice in hyperoxia by 24 h and decreased LDH release and lung cell apoptosis after 72 h of exposure by 30%. TLR4 expression was necessary and sufficient for the protective effect of VEGF in the lungs and in primary endothelial cells in culture. TLR4 knockdown inhibited VEGF signaling through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), Akt, and ERK pathways in lungs and primary endothelial cells and decreased the availability of VEGFR2 at the cell surface. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism through which TLR4, an innate pattern receptor, interacts with an endothelial survival pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2288410918,"We hypothesized that α-lipoic acid (α-LA) might interact with the transcriptional control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)b in skeletal muscle. Molecular mechanisms were investigated using differentiated C2C12 myotubes treated with α-LA and/or PPARβ agonist GW0742. In vivo studies with 3-mo-old C57Bl6 mice were realized: voluntary wheel running (VWR) training (7 wk), and a 6 wk diet containing (or not) α-LA (0.25% wt/wt). This last condition was combined with (or not) 1 bout of treadmill exercise (18 m/min for 1 h). Using a reporter assay, we demonstrate that α-LA is not an agonist of PPARβ but regulates PPARβ target gene expression through an active PPARβ pathway. GW0742-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA is potentiated by α-LA. In C2C12, α-LA lowers the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and increases PPARβ mRNA and protein levels (2-fold) to the same extent as with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Similarly to VWR training effect, PPARβ expression increases (2-fold) in vastus lateralis of animals fed an α-LA-enriched diet. However, α-LA treatment does not further stimulate the adaptive up-regulation of PPARβ observed in response to 1 bout of exercise. We have identified a novel mechanism of regulation of PPARβ expression/action in skeletal muscle with potential physiologic application through the action of α-LA, involving the JNK pathway.—Rousseau, A.-S., Sibille, B., Murdaca, J., Mothe-Satney, I., Grimaldi, P.

To reveal the relationship between syllable sequencing and timing, we analyzed how variation in the probability of syllable transitions at branch points, nodes in song with variable sequencing across renditions, correlated with variation in the duration of silent gaps between syllable transitions (‘gap durations’) for adult Bengalese finch song. We observed a significant negative relationship between transition probability and gap duration: more prevalent transitions were produced with shorter gap durations. We then assessed the degree to which long-term age-dependent changes and acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing followed this inverse relationship. Age- but not context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing were inversely related. On average, gap durations at branch points decreased with age, and the magnitude of this decrease was greater for transitions that increased in prevalence than for transitions that decreased in prevalence. In contrast, there was no systematic relationship between acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing. Gap durations at branch points decreased when birds produced female-directed courtship song compared to when they produced undirected song, and the magnitude of this decrease was not related to the direction and magnitude of changes to transition probabilities. These analyses suggest that neural mechanisms that regulate syllable sequencing could similarly control syllable timing but also highlight mechanisms that can independently regulate syllable sequencing and timing."
https://openalex.org/W2291739823,"To explore why some oligonucleotides in denaturing polyacrylamide gel could not be silver-stained, 134 different oligonucleotides were analyzed using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with silver and asymmetric cyanine. As a result, we found that the sensitivity of oligos (dA), (dC), (dG) and (dT) to silver staining could be ranged as (dA) > (dG) > (dC) > (dT) from high to low. It was unexpected that oligo (dT) was hard to be silver-stained. Moreover, the silver staining of an oligonucleotide containing base T could be partially or completely inhibited by base T. The inhibition of silver staining by base T was a competitive inhibition which could be affected by the amounts of the argyrophil nucleobase and base T, the cis-distance between the argyrophil nucleobase and base T, and the gel concentration. The changes of the intensity of an oligonucleotide band caused by the changes of DNA base composition were diverse and interesting. The intensity of some oligonucleotide bands would significantly change when the changes of DNA base composition accumulated to a certain extent (usually ≥ 4 nt). The sensitivity of cyanine staining of ≤ 11-nt long oligonucleotides could be enhanced about 250-fold by fixing the gels with methanol fixing solution."
https://openalex.org/W2192143572,"In this study, we develop a microdensitometry method using full width at half maximum (FWHM) analysis of the retinal vascular structure in a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) image and present the application of this method in the morphometry of arteriolar changes during hypertension.Two raters using manual and FWHM methods measured retinal vessel outer and lumen diameters in SD-OCT images. Inter-rater reproducibility was measured using coefficients of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficient and a Bland-Altman plot. OCT images from forty-three eyes of 43 hypertensive patients and 40 eyes of 40 controls were analyzed using an FWHM approach; wall thickness, wall cross-sectional area (WCSA) and wall to lumen ratio (WLR) were subsequently calculated.Mean difference in inter-rater agreement ranged from -2.713 to 2.658 μm when using a manual method, and ranged from -0.008 to 0.131 μm when using a FWHM approach. The inter-rater CVs were significantly less for the FWHM approach versus the manual method (P < 0.05). Compared with controls, the wall thickness, WCSA and WLR of retinal arterioles were increased in the hypertensive patients, particular in diabetic hypertensive patients.The microdensitometry method using a FWHM algorithm markedly improved inter-rater reproducibility of arteriolar morphometric analysis, and SD-OCT may represent a promising noninvasive method for in vivo arteriolar morphometry."

At time of admission to hospital, 72% of the patients had still an AKI and thrombocytopenia was present in 64% of the patients. The 335 patients were treated in 29 different hospitals and 6 of which had nephrology departments. 10 out of 335 patients received treatment in university hospitals and 63% of patients admitted themselves to hospital. Initially, the patients were admitted to 12 different clinical departments (29% of the patients were referred to a nephrology department) and during the course of the disease, 8% of the patients were transferred to another department in the same hospital and 3% were transferred to a nephrology department at another hospital. Regarding diagnostic procedures, in 28% of the inpatients computed tomography to exclude pulmonary embolism or due to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis, magnetic resonance tomography of the brain owing to suspected stroke because of visual disorders, gastroscopy, or colonoscopy due to gastrointestinal symptoms was performed at time of admission to hospital.NE must be considered by physicians across the borders of nephrology to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures especially in areas where NE is endemic."
https://openalex.org/W2194761452,"Background Umbilical Cord blood (UCB), which contains a substantive number of stem cells, could be widely used in transplants to treat a variety of oncologic, genetic, hematologic, and immunodeficiency disorders. However, only a small portion of mothers preserve or donate their UCB in China. The limited availability of UCB has hampered stem cell research and therapy nowadays. To date, no systemic investigations regarding factors that influence a mother’s willingness to preserve UCB have been performed in China. In the current study, we are trying to determine those factors which will provide useful information for national health policy development and will raise awareness of the importance of UCB preservation. Methods During 2011 to 2013, 5120 mothers with the average age of 26.1±8.4 years were included in this study. Those mothers participated in a standardized survey. The information gathered consisted of delivery time, occupation, level of education, knowledge of preservation of UCB, willingness to store UCB, and related concerns. The results have been analyzed with SPSS 16.0. Results The results showed that first-time mothers showed a greater willingness to preserve their UCB (73.3%) compared to those having their second (48.9%) or third child (40.3%). Mothers who were employed at Government Agencies and Organizations were more willing to preserve their UCB (87.3%) than those employed at factories (62.0%), and those who were unemployed (27.3%). Mothers holding master’s or college degrees were more willing to preserve their UCB (72.5% and 71.1%, respectively) than mothers with high school diplomas (48.7%) or those who only went to preliminary school or middle school (40.7%). The two strongest factors that influenced an unwillingness to preserve UCB were the high cost and concerns regarding the safety of the preservation. Conclusions The results showed that mothers with higher education or those having better occupations are more likely to preserve their UCB in China. These mothers have related knowledge and understand the importance of the preservation and they could more readily afford the relatively high cost. The government, clinicians and UCB banks should combine efforts to take measures, such as increasing public knowledge of the importance of UCB preservation and decreasing the high cost for its storage will most likely increase the frequency of UCB preservation which will further benefit stem cell research and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2269246870,"Although Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, inhibits zebrafish cardiac valve formation, the detailed molecular pathway is still unclear. Here, we proved that Amiodarone acts as an upstream regulator, stimulating similar to versican b (s-vcanb) overexpression at zebrafish embryonic heart and promoting cdh-5 overexpression by inhibiting snail1b at atrioventricular canal (AVC), thus blocking invagination of endocardial cells and, as a result, preventing the formation of cardiac valves. A closer investigation showed that an intricate set of signaling events ultimately caused the up-regulation of cdh5. In particular, we investigated the role of EGFR signaling and the activity of Gsk3b. It was found that knockdown of EGFR signaling resulted in phenotypes similar to those of Amiodarone-treated embryos. Since the reduced phosphorylation of EGFR was rescued by knockdown of s-vcanb, it was concluded that the inhibition of EGFR activity by Amiodarone is s-vcanb-dependent. Moreover, the activity of Gsk3b, a downstream effector of EGFR, was greatly increased in both Amiodarone-treated embryos and EGFR-inhibited embryos. Therefore, it was concluded that reduced EGFR signaling induced by Amiodarone treatment results in the inhibition of Snail functions through increased Gsk3b activity, which, in turn, reduces snail1b expression, leading to the up-regulation the cdh5 at the AVC, finally resulting in defective formation of valves. This signaling cascade implicates the EGFR/Gsk3b/Snail axis as the molecular basis for the inhibition of cardiac valve formation by Amiodarone."
https://openalex.org/W2290394770,"The decision to engage in corruption-public and private corruption, nepotism, and embezzlement-is often attributed to rational actors maximizing benefits to themselves. However, the importance of reciprocal relationships in humans suggests that an actor may weigh the costs of harms of her corrupt behavior to individuals who may generate future benefits for her. We hypothesize that actors who have a larger circle of actual and potential social partners will have more individuals to consider when generating harms and will thus be less likely to find corrupt acts permissible than actors with smaller circles of valued others. Using data from the World Values Survey and European Values Study (WVS), we explore whether participants with a larger geographic identity or a greater number of group memberships (i.e. a larger scope of actual and potential social partners) are less likely to find accepting bribes permissible. We find mixed support for our hypotheses, but consistently find that WVS participants with local, country, continent, or world geographic identities are less likely to find accepting a bribe permissible than those with regional identities-that is, actors whose primary identities that encompass more than their region find corruption less permissible. We discuss the importance of considering an actor's valuation of others when modeling corruption persistence, noting that establishing scopes of positive valuation is a precursor to predicting where actors will target benefits and shunt costs."
https://openalex.org/W2190350186,"Background & Aim Whether inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene polymorphisms predict anemia during interferon-free therapy in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients is unknown. We examined the relationship between two ITPA polymorphisms, anemia, and sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) in patients receiving the NS3/4A protease inhibitor faldaprevir, the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor deleobuvir, and ribavirin. Methods HCV genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve patients (N = 362) were randomized and treated in one of five treatment arms with faldaprevir and deleobuvir with or without ribavirin. Two ITPA polymorphisms (rs1127354 and rs6051702) were genotyped and defined as ITPA-deficient (rs1127354 AA or AC; rs6051702 CC or CA) or ITPA-non-deficient (rs1127354 CC; rs6051702 AA) according to their association with ITPA deficiency. Baseline and on-treatment variables associated with anemia and SVR12 were identified using logistic regression. Results In the pooled ribavirin-containing arms, 10.1% (32/316) of patients experienced on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL, and 32.6% (103/316) experienced on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL or a change from baseline ≥3.5 g/dL. Of the latter group, 99% (102/103) had the ITPA-non-deficient rs1127354 genotype. Other variables associated with on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL or a decrease ≥3.5 g/dL were age, baseline hemoglobin, rs6051702 genotype, and plasma ribavirin concentration. In a multivariate analysis, high plasma ribavirin concentration, low baseline hemoglobin, HCV genotype 1b, and IL28B genotype CC were associated with higher SVR12. Conclusions The ITPA rs1127354 CC and rs6051702 AA genotypes may predict ribavirin-induced anemia during treatment with interferon-free, ribavirin-containing regimens. With this interferon-free regimen, SVR was associated with ribavirin levels, but not with anemia or ITPA genotypes. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01132313"
https://openalex.org/W2193166069,"The kidney is a specialized low-regenerative organ with several different types of cellular lineages. The BrdU label-retaining cell (LRCs) approach has been used as part of a strategy to identify tissue-specific stem cells in the kidney; however, because the complementary base pairing in double-stranded DNA blocks the access of the anti-BrdU antibody to BrdU subunits, the stem cell marker expression in BrdU-labeled cells are often difficult to detect. In this study, we introduced a new cell labeling and detection method in which BrdU was replaced with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and examined the time-dependent dynamic changes of EdU-labeled cells and potential stem/progenitor markers in the development of kidney.Newborn rats were intraperitoneally injected with EdU, and their kidneys were harvested respectively at different time points at 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post-injection. The kidney tissues were processed for EdU and cellular markers by immunofluorescence staining.At the early stage, LRCs labeled by EdU were 2176.0 ± 355.6 cells at day one in each renal tissue section, but dropped to 168 ± 48.4 cells by week 6. As time increased, the numbers of LRCs were differentially expressed in the renal cortex and papilla. At the postnatal day one, nearly twice as many cells in the cortex were EdU-labeled as compared to the papilla (28.6 ± 3.6% vs. 15.6 ± 3.4%, P<0.05), while there were more LRCs within the renal papilla since the postnatal week one, and at the postnatal week 6, one third as many cells in the cortex were EdU-labeled as compared to the papilla (2.5 ± 0.1% vs. 7.7 ± 2.7%, P<0.05). The long-term LRCs at 6-week time point were associated exclusively with the glomeruli in the cortex and the renal tubules in the papilla. At 6 weeks, the EdU-labeled LRCs combined with expression of CD34, RECA-1, Nestin, and Synaptopodin were discretely but widely distributed within the glomeruli; Stro-1 around the glomeruli; and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in arteries. Conversely, co-expression of CD34, RECA-1, and Nestin with the long term EdU-labeled LRCs was significantly lower in renal tubules (P<0.01), while Stro-1 and Synaptopodin were not detected.Our data found that at 6-week time point, EdU-labeled LRCs existing in the glomeruli expressed undifferentiated podocyte and endothelial markers at high rates, while those in the renal tubules expressed Nestin and vascular markers at low rates. To understand the characterization and localization of these EdU-LRCs, further studies will be needed to test cell lineage tracing, clonogenicity and differentiation potency, and the contributions to the regeneration of the kidney in response to renal injury/repair."
https://openalex.org/W2195795801,"This study begins with constructing the mini metabolic networks (MMNs) of beta amyloid (Aβ) and acetylcholine (ACh) which stimulate the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Then we generate the AD network by incorporating MMNs of Aβ and ACh, and other MMNs of stimuli of AD. The panel of proteins contains 49 enzymes/receptors on the AD network which have the 3D-structure in PDB. The panel of drugs is formed by 5 AD drugs and 5 AD nutraceutical drugs, and 20 non-AD drugs. All of these complexes formed by these 30 drugs and 49 proteins are transformed into dyadic arrays. Utilizing the prior knowledge learned from the drug panel, we propose a statistical classification (dry-lab). According to the wet-lab for the complex of amiloride and insulin degrading enzyme, and the complex of amiloride and neutral endopeptidase, we are confident that this dry-lab is reliable. As the consequences of the dry-lab, we discover many interesting implications. Especially, we show that possible causes of Tacrine, donepezil, galantamine and huperzine A cannot improve the level of ACh which is against to their original design purpose but they still prevent AD to be worse as Aβ deposition appeared. On the other hand, we recommend Miglitol and Atenolol as the safe and potent drugs to improve the level of ACh before Aβ deposition appearing. Moreover, some nutrients such as NADH and Vitamin E should be controlled because they may harm health if being used in wrong way and wrong time. Anyway, the insights shown in this study are valuable to be developed further."
https://openalex.org/W2195557586,"Variability is inherent in any population, regardless whether the population comprises humans, plants, biological cells, or manufactured parts. Is the variability beneficial, detrimental, or inconsequential? This question is of fundamental importance in manufacturing, agriculture, and bioengineering. This question has no simple categorical answer because research shows that variability in a population can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Here we ask whether there is a certain level of variability that can maximize benefit to the population as a whole. We answer this question by using a model composed of a population of individuals who independently make binary decisions; individuals vary in making a yes or no decision, and the aggregated effect of these decisions on the population is quantified by a benefit function (e.g. accuracy of the measurement using binary rulers, aggregate income of a town of farmers). Here we show that an optimal variance exists for maximizing the population benefit function; this optimal variance quantifies what is often called the ""right mix"" of individuals in a population."
