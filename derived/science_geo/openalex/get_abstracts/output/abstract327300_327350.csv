https://openalex.org/W2013000142,"Five prominent ice-edge eddies in Fram Strait on the scale of 30 to 40 kilometers were observed over deep water within 77 degrees N to 79 degrees N and 5 degrees W to 3 degrees E. The use of remote sensing, a satellite-tracked buoy, and in situ oceanographic measurements showed the presence of eddies with orbital speeds of 30 to 40 centimeters per second and lifetimes of at least 20 days. Ice ablation measurements made within one of these ice-ocean eddies indicated that melting, which proceeded at rates of 20 to 40 centimeters per day, is an important process in determining the ice-edge position. These studies give new insight on the formation, propagation, and dissipation of ice-edge eddies."
https://openalex.org/W1996259205,"One-sixth of the value of all goods manufactured in the United States involves catalytic processes. However, in spite of this dramatic economic impact, little is known about this broad subject at the molecular level. In the last two decades a variety of techniques have been developed for studying at the atomic level the structure, composition, and chemical bonding at surfaces. These techniques have been used to study adsorption and reaction on metal single crystals in an ultrahigh vacuum environment or to analyze catalysts before and after reaction. An important new development has been the coupling of an apparatus for the measurement of reaction kinetics at elevated pressures with an ultrahigh vacuum system for surface analysis. This approach has demonstrated that metal single crystals can be used to successfully model many important catalytic reactions and has established a direct link between the results of ultrahigh vacuum surface measurements and the chemistry that occurs under typical catalytic-processing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2091973661,"It is estimated that 84 percent of the ice exiting the Arctic Basin through Fram Strait during June and July 1984 was multiyear ice and that a large percentage of this ice is ridged or otherwise deformed. While freeboard and thickness data, together with salinity measurements on cores, usually sufficed to distinguish between first and multiyear floes, preliminary identification could usually be made on the basis of snow cover measurements with snow cover being much thicker on multiyear ice. Cores from the top half meter of multiyear floes were generally very much harder and more transparent than cores from first-year floes. Age estimates of multiyear floes, based on petrographic and salinity characteristics of cores, did not exceed 4 to 5 years for any of the floes that were observed exiting Fram Strait."
https://openalex.org/W2071895046,"Sequential remote sensing images of the Fram Strait marginal ice zone played a key role in elucidating the complex interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice. Analysis of a subset of these images covering a 1-week period provided quantitative data on the mesoscale ice morphology, including ice edge positions, ice concentrations, floe size distribution, and ice kinematics. The analysis showed that, under light to moderate wind conditions, the morphology of the marginal ice zone reflects the underlying ocean circulation. High-resolution radar observations showed the location and size of ocean eddies near the ice edge. Ice kinematics from sequential radar images revealed an ocean eddy beneath the interior pack ice that was verified by in situ oceanographic measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2078127291,"A major component of the Fram Strait Marginal Ice Zone Experiment was the investigation of air-sea-ice interactions, processes, and circulation patterns found behind the local ice edge and on scales greater than 10 kilometers (mesoscale and large scale). Neutrally buoyant floats, ice-tethered cyclesondes, and helicopter-based measurements were used to obtain uniquely integrated and consistent views of the mesoscale ocean features beneath the ice cover of Fram Strait. Within the vicinity of the Yermak Plateau, three distinct regions of mesoscale motion were observed that coincided with the shallow topography of the plateau, the northward flowing Atlantic water over the western flank of the plateau, and the strong current-shear zone of the East Greenland Polar Front. A subice meander of the front was also observed, which was probably occluded subsequently."
https://openalex.org/W2091964443,"Acoustic waves transmitted over a 100-kilometer path in the Fram Strait marginal ice zone undergo Doppler shifts and fluctuations around these shifts, the former due to quasi-steady motion of both acoustic source and receiver and the latter to unsteady motions of the water column and ice cover. Internal waves and differential Doppler shift usually account for such fluctuations in the deep temperate ocean but only partially explain the results obtained in the marginal ice zone. There the fluctuations are more energetic and may be caused alternatively or additionally by comparably energetic fluctuations in ice-edge eddies or other mesoscale motions."

https://openalex.org/W4254118041,"The farthest of the galaxies that can be seen through the large ground-based telescopes of modern astronomy, such as those on La Palma in the Canary Islands, are so far away that they appear as they did close to the time of the origin of the universe, perhaps some 10 billion years ago. Much has been learned, and much has still to be learned, about the young universe from optical and radio telescopes, but these instruments cannot be used to look directly at the universe in its first few hundred thousand years. Instead, they are used to search the relatively recent past for relics of much earlier times. Together with experiments planned for the next generation of elementary particle accelerators, astronomical observations should continue to extend what is known about the universe backward in time to the Big Bang and may eventually help to reveal the origins of the physical laws that govern the universe."

https://openalex.org/W2077421974,"Until the 1980s the outstanding indebtedness of government and private-sector borrowers in the United States exhibited sufficient negative covariation that total outstanding debt remained steady relative to nonfinancial economic activity. Three hypotheses-one based on lenders' behavior, one on borrowers' behavior, and one on credit market institutional arrangements-provide potential explanations for this phenomenon. Since 1980 the U.S. debt markets have departed from these previously prevailing patterns, however, as both government and private borrowing have risen sharply."

These stages are saperficial phenomena which merely reflect the extent of fibrin-formation. Coagulation is a gradual continuous process of fibrin-formation; and in the clotting of normal plasma, fibrin needles can be demonstrated in the earliest appreciable coagulum, however delicate, transparent or gellike."
