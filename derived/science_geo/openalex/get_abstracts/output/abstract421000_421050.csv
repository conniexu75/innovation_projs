A Majorana fermion, on the other hand, is a neutral particle, which is its own antiparticle. No sightings of a Majorana have been reported in the elementary particle world, but recently they have been proposed to exist in solid-state systems and suggested to be of interest as a quantum computing platform. Mourik et al. (p. 1003 , published online 12 April; see the cover; see the Perspective by Brouwer ) set up a semiconductor nanowire contacted on each end by a normal and a superconducting electrode that revealed evidence of Majorana fermions."
https://openalex.org/W1999097254,"Harnessing the Magnetoelectric Effect Some multiferroic materials exhibit the so-called magnetoelectric effect, in which an external magnetic field can cause electric polarization and an electric field can cause magnetic order. This is important because the manipulation of magnetic structures by electric means is technologically highly desirable. Seki et al. (p. 198 ) discovered spin whirlpools called skyrmions in the multiferroic material Cu 2 OSeO 3 and observed a magnetoelectric coupling exerted by the skyrmions. The existence of skyrmions in an insulating magnetoelectric material holds promise for their future manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W1976612131,"microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through translational repression and/or messenger RNA (mRNA) deadenylation and decay. Because translation, deadenylation, and decay are closely linked processes, it is important to establish their ordering and thus to define the molecular mechanism of silencing. We have investigated the kinetics of these events in miRNA-mediated gene silencing by using a Drosophila S2 cell-based controllable expression system and show that mRNAs with both natural and engineered 3' untranslated regions with miRNA target sites are first subject to translational inhibition, followed by effects on deadenylation and decay. We next used a natural translational elongation stall to show that miRNA-mediated silencing inhibits translation at an early step, potentially translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1975126030,"Manipulating Optical Topology Phase transitions in solid-state systems are often associated with a drastic change in the properties of that system. For example, metal-to-insulator transition or magnetic-to-nonmagnetic states find wide application in memory storage technology. An exotic electronic phase transition is the Lifshitz transition, whereby the Fermi surface undergoes a change in topology and a drastic change in the electronic density of states. Krishnamoorthy et al. (p. 205 ) now show that the notion of such a phase transition can be carried over to the optical regime by the suitable design of a metamaterial structure. This effect could be used to control the interaction between light and matter."
https://openalex.org/W2000884742,"Quantum networks are distributed quantum many-body systems with tailored topology and controlled information exchange. They are the backbone of distributed quantum computing architectures and quantum communication. Here we present a prototype of such a quantum network based on single atoms embedded in optical cavities. We show that atom-cavity systems form universal nodes capable of sending, receiving, storing and releasing photonic quantum information. Quantum connectivity between nodes is achieved in the conceptually most fundamental way: by the coherent exchange of a single photon. We demonstrate the faithful transfer of an atomic quantum state and the creation of entanglement between two identical nodes in independent laboratories. The created nonlocal state is manipulated by local qubit rotation. This efficient cavity-based approach to quantum networking is particularly promising as it offers a clear perspective for scalability, thus paving the way towards large-scale quantum networks and their applications."

https://openalex.org/W2097889308,"Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems faster than classical computers. To exploit their power, it is necessary to perform interqubit operations and generate entangled states. Spin qubits are a promising candidate for implementing a quantum processor because of their potential for scalability and miniaturization. However, their weak interactions with the environment, which lead to their long coherence times, make interqubit operations challenging. We performed a controlled two-qubit operation between singlet-triplet qubits using a dynamically decoupled sequence that maintains the two-qubit coupling while decoupling each qubit from its fluctuating environment. Using state tomography, we measured the full density matrix of the system and determined the concurrence and the fidelity of the generated state, providing proof of entanglement."
https://openalex.org/W2077082977,"Open and Shut Case Voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) control the activity of voltage-gated ion channels to regulate the ion flow that underlies nerve conduction. Structural and biophysical studies have provided insight into voltage gating; however, understanding has been hindered by the lack of a crystal structure of a fully closed state. Starting from a structure of an open conducting state, a voltage-gated K + channel, Jensen et al. (p. 229 ) used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to show the conformational changes involved in switching to the closed, nonconducting state. Additional simulations revealed the major steps of channel activation. The computational determination of a closed state may guide development of drugs to treat channelopathies associated with this resting state."
https://openalex.org/W2077594514,"Disrupting Drug Memories In drug recovery programs, conditioned responses to drug cues can be inhibited by extinction protocols. However, extinguished behavioral responses can return after renewed exposure to the drug itself, or to drug-associated paraphernalia, and sometimes these responses reemerge spontaneously. Attempts have been made to disrupt cue-memory reconsolidation or to strengthen extinction learning, but these efforts have often relied on pharmacological agents that either are not approved for human use or cause problematic side effects. Xue et al. (p. 241 ; see the Perspective by Milton and Everitt ) have tried to circumvent the limitations of pharmacological approaches in daily retrieval trials conducted in rats within the short timeframe of the “reconsolidation window” before the extinction sessions reduced drug-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of drug seeking. When translated to heroin-addicted humans, similar retrieval trials before extinction sessions impaired cue-induced heroin craving up to 6 months later. This retrieval-extinction procedure is thus a promising non-pharmacological treatment for addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2127071442,"Reaction-Diffusion Patterning Six decades ago, Alan Turing proposed the reaction-diffusion model to explain how complex patterns emerge during morphogenesis. In this model, an activator activates both itself and an inhibitor (the “reaction”), with the activator being less mobile than the inhibitor (“diffusion”). Many activator/inhibitor pairs have been described, but the role of differential mobility versus differential clearance of activators and inhibitors is often unclear. Now, Müller et al. (p. 721 , published online 12 April) show that during zebrafish embryogenesis, the activator Nodal has lower diffusivity than the inhibitor Lefty, while both molecules are cleared at similar rates, which supports the idea that Nodal and Lefty form a classical reaction-diffusion system."
https://openalex.org/W1998671100,"During animal development, several planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways control tissue shape by coordinating collective cell behavior. Here, we characterize by means of multiscale imaging epithelium morphogenesis in the Drosophila dorsal thorax and show how the Fat/Dachsous/Four-jointed PCP pathway controls morphogenesis. We found that the proto-cadherin Dachsous is polarized within a domain of its tissue-wide expression gradient. Furthermore, Dachsous polarizes the myosin Dachs, which in turn promotes anisotropy of junction tension. By combining physical modeling with quantitative image analyses, we determined that this tension anisotropy defines the pattern of local tissue contraction that contributes to shaping the epithelium mainly via oriented cell rearrangements. Our results establish how tissue planar polarization coordinates the local changes of cell mechanical properties to control tissue morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001528153,"Colorectal Cancer Signature The mutations and genome aberrations that characterize cancer result in often dramatically altered gene and protein expression patterns. It is these altered expression patterns that directly and indirectly drive progression of the disease. In human primary colorectal cancer cells, Akhtar-Zaidi et al. (p. 736 , published online 12 April) analyzed the pattern of epigenetically modified chromatin at “enhancer” sequences that are known to be critical in the control of gene expression. An epigenetic enhancer signature was defined that was specifically associated with colorectal cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068193025,"Starvation and Autophagy Starvation stimulates withdrawal from the cell cycle, as well as stimulating autophagy. Are these two events connected? Lee et al. (p. 225 ) show a direct and nutrient-sensitive interaction between the tumor suppressor p53 and the essential autophagy gene Atg7. Further, in the absence of Atg7, the p53-dependent induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is inhibited. This leads to Atg7-deficient cells being unable to properly withdraw from the cell cycle under starved conditions. While Atg7 deletion leads to an impairment of p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, the Atg7-deficient cells hyperactivate p53-mediated cell-death pathways. The physiological importance of this hyperactivation is underscored by the observation that genetic blocking of p53-mediated cell death significantly extended neonatal survival of mice in which Atg7 had been deleted."
https://openalex.org/W2008226163,"Dynamic access to genetic information is central to organismal development and environmental response. Consequently, genomic processes must be regulated by mechanisms that alter genome function relatively rapidly. Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments measure transcription factor occupancy, but give no indication of kinetics and are poor predictors of transcription factor function at a given locus. To measure transcription-factor-binding dynamics across the genome, we performed competition ChIP (refs 6, 7) with a sequence-specific Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor, Rap1 (ref. 8). Rap1-binding dynamics and Rap1 occupancy were only weakly correlated (R(2) = 0.14), but binding dynamics were more strongly linked to function than occupancy. Long Rap1 residence was coupled to transcriptional activation, whereas fast binding turnover, which we refer to as 'treadmilling', was linked to low transcriptional output. Thus, DNA-binding events that seem identical by conventional ChIP may have different underlying modes of interaction that lead to opposing functional outcomes. We propose that transcription factor binding turnover is a major point of regulation in determining the functional consequences of transcription factor binding, and is mediated mainly by control of competition between transcription factors and nucleosomes. Our model predicts a clutch-like mechanism that rapidly engages a treadmilling transcription factor into a stable binding state, or vice versa, to modulate transcription factor function."

Columnar liquid crystals with a ferroelectric nature have potential use in ultrahigh-density memory devices, if electrical polarization occurs along the columnar axis. However, columnar liquid crystals having an axial nonzero polarization at zero electric field and its electrical invertibility have not been demonstrated. Here, we report a ferroelectric response for a columnar liquid crystal adopting a core-shell architecture that accommodates an array of polar cyano groups confined by a hydrogen-bonded amide network with an optimal strength. Under an applied electric field, both columns and core cyano groups align unidirectionally, thereby developing an extremely large macroscopic remnant polarization."
https://openalex.org/W1974928278,"The dust shells of three intermediate-mass stars are observed to lie remarkably close to the photosphere and to be composed of unexpectedly large grains, consistent with mass loss from such stars occurring by means of ejection of this dust by photon scattering rather than as a result of radiation pressure. Towards the ends of their lives, intermediate-mass stars lose much of their mass in the form of gas and dust ejected in a slow, dense wind. The underlying processes driving these outflows are poorly understood, owing in part to difficulties in observing such ejected material. Norris et al. use an innovative technique that combines interferometric imaging with high-precision differential polarimetry to observe three red giants. Their images reveal circumstellar dust shells with remarkably small radii (less than two times the radius of the star), made up of unexpectedly large dust grains approximately 300 nanometres in radius. The authors suggest that these observations support a wind-driving model based on acceleration of dust grains by the scattering, rather than absorption, of starlight. An intermediate-mass star ends its life by ejecting the bulk of its envelope in a slow, dense wind1,2,3. Stellar pulsations are thought to elevate gas to an altitude cool enough for the condensation of dust1, which is then accelerated by radiation pressure, entraining the gas and driving the wind2,4,5. Explaining the amount of mass loss, however, has been a problem because of the difficulty of observing tenuous gas and dust only tens of milliarcseconds from the star. For this reason, there is no consensus on the way sufficient momentum is transferred from the light from the star to the outflow. Here we report spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations of circumstellar dust shells of three stars on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. When imaged in scattered light, dust shells were found at remarkably small radii (less than about two stellar radii) and with unexpectedly large grains (about 300 nanometres in radius). This proximity to the photosphere argues for dust species that are transparent to the light from the star and, therefore, resistant to sublimation by the intense radiation field. Although transparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure to drive a wind6,7, the radiation field can accelerate these large grains through photon scattering rather than absorption8—a plausible mass loss mechanism for lower-amplitude pulsating stars."

https://openalex.org/W1965621240,"The pleiotropic features of obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, kidney abnormalities, cognitive impairment, hypertension, and diabetes found in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) make this disorder an important model disorder for identifying molecular mechanisms involved in common human diseases. To date, 16 BBS genes have been reported, seven of which (BBS1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9) code for proteins that form a complex known as the BBSome. The function of the BBSome involves ciliary membrane biogenesis. Three additional BBS genes (BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12) have homology to type II chaperonins and interact with CCT/TRiC proteins and BBS7 to form a complex termed the BBS-chaperonin complex. This complex is required for BBSome assembly. Little is known about the process and the regulation of BBSome formation. We utilized point mutations and null alleles of BBS proteins to disrupt assembly of the BBSome leading to the accumulation of BBSome assembly intermediates. By characterizing BBSome assembly intermediates, we show that the BBS-chaperonin complex plays a role in BBS7 stability. BBS7 interacts with BBS2 and becomes part of a BBS7-BBS2-BBS9 assembly intermediate referred to as the BBSome core complex because it forms the core of the BBSome. BBS1, BBS5, BBS8, and finally BBS4 are added to the BBSome core to form the complete BBSome."
https://openalex.org/W2093583253,"In the bacterial chemotaxis network, receptor clusters process input, and flagellar motors generate output. Receptor and motor complexes are coupled by the diffusible protein CheY-P. Receptor output (the steady-state concentration of CheY-P) varies from cell to cell. However, the motor is ultrasensitive, with a narrow operating range of CheY-P concentrations. How the match between receptor output and motor input might be optimized is unclear. Here we show that the motor can shift its operating range by changing its composition. The number of FliM subunits in the C-ring increases in response to a decrement in the concentration of CheY-P, increasing motor sensitivity. This shift in sensitivity explains the slow partial adaptation observed in mutants that lack the receptor methyltransferase and methylesterase and why motors show signal-dependent FliM turnover. Adaptive remodelling is likely to be a common feature in the operation of many molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W2013958121,"Pull Me-No!-Push You The Drosophila dorsal-ventral (DV) axis is polarized by the movement of the nucleus from the posterior end of the oocyte to its anterior margin. It has long been assumed that the nucleus is pulled to the anterior end by the molecular motor dynein along the polarized microtubule cytoskeleton that defines the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Using live imaging, Zhao et al. (p. 999, published online 12 April; see the Perspective by Bowerman and O'Rourke ) now demonstrate that the nucleus is pushed toward the anterior by the force exerted by growing microtubules hitting its posterior side. DV polarity thus depends on the posterior positioning of the microtubule organizing center rather than on AP axis formation."
https://openalex.org/W1972244213,"Monkey See, Monkey Read An orthographic object such as a set of letters, and the ability to recognize such sets as words, is a key component of reading. The ability to develop these skills has often been attributed to the prior acquisition of a complex language. For example, we learn how letters sound and thus recognize when a particular letter makes up part of a word. However, orthographic processing is also a visual process, because we learn to recognize words as discrete objects, and the ability to read may thus be related to an ability to recognize and classify objects. Grainger et al. (p. 245 ; see the Perspective by Platt and Adams ) tested orthographic skills in baboons. Captive, but freely ranging, baboons were trained to distinguish real English words from combinations of similar letters that are not words, and they were able to distinguish real words with remarkable accuracy. Thus, a basic ability to recognize words as objects does not require complex linguistic understanding."
https://openalex.org/W2070235586,"Hepatitis B virus encoded X antigen (HBx) is a trans-regulatory protein that alters the activity of selected transcription factors and cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways. HBx transcriptionally up-regulates the expression of a unique gene, URG11, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates β-catenin, thereby contributing importantly to hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx and URG11 also alter the expression of multiple microRNAs, and by miRNA array analysis, both were shown to promote the expression of miR-148a. Elevated miR-148a was also seen in HBx positive liver samples from infected patients. To study the function of miR-148a, anti-148a was introduced into HepG2 and Hep3B cells stably expressing HBx or stably over-expressing URG11. Anti-miR-148a suppressed cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration, anchorage independent growth in soft agar and subcutaneous tumor formation in SCID mice. Introduction of anti-miR-148a increased PTEN protein and mRNA expression, suggesting that PTEN was targeted by miR-148a. Anti-miR-148a failed to suppress PTEN expression when co-transfected with reporter gene mutants in the 3′UTR of PTEN mRNA. Introduction of anti-miR-148a also resulted in depressed Akt signaling by HBx and URG11, resulting in decreased expression of β-catenin. Thus, miR-148a may play a central role in HBx/URG11 mediated HCC, and may be an early diagnostic marker and/or therapeutic target associated with this tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W1972430217,"The two age-prevalent diseases Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus share many common features including the deposition of amyloidogenic proteins, amyloid β protein (Aβ) and amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide), respectively. Recent evidence suggests that both Aβ and amylin may express their effects through the amylin receptor, although the precise mechanisms for this interaction at a cellular level are unknown. Here, we studied this by generating HEK293 cells with stable expression of an isoform of the amylin receptor family, amylin receptor-3 (AMY3). Aβ1-42 and human amylin (hAmylin) increase cytosolic cAMP and Ca(2+), trigger multiple pathways involving the signal transduction mediators protein kinase A, MAPK, Akt, and cFos. Aβ1-42 and hAmylin also induce cell death during exposure for 24-48 h at low micromolar concentrations. In the presence of hAmylin, Aβ1-42 effects on HEK293-AMY3-expressing cells are occluded, suggesting a shared mechanism of action between the two peptides. Amylin receptor antagonist AC253 blocks increases in intracellular Ca(2+), activation of protein kinase A, MAPK, Akt, cFos, and cell death, which occur upon AMY3 activation with hAmylin, Aβ1-42, or their co-application. Our data suggest that AMY3 plays an important role by serving as a receptor target for actions Aβ and thus may represent a novel therapeutic target for development of compounds to treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease."

The channel properties of human TPC1 have not been studied before, and its cellular function is not known. In the present study, we characterized TPC1 incorporated into lipid bilayers. The native and recombinant TPC1 channels are activated by NAADP. TPC1 activity requires acidic luminal pH and high luminal Ca2+. With Ba2+ as the permeable ion, luminal Ca2+ activates TPC1 with an apparent Km of 180 μm. TPC1 operates in two tightly coupled conductance states of 47 ± 8 and 200 ± 9 picosiemens. Importantly, opening of the large conductance markedly increases the small conductance mean open time. Changes in membrane potential from 0 to −60 mV increased linearly both the small and the large conductances and NPo, indicating that TPC1 is regulated by voltage. Intriguingly, the apparent affinity for activation of TPC1 by its ligand NAADP is not constant. Rather, hyperpolarization increases the apparent affinity of TPC1 for NAADP by 10 nm/mV. The concerted regulation of TPC1 activity by luminal Ca2+ and by membrane potential thus provides a potential mechanism to explain NAADP-induced Ca2+ oscillations.

https://openalex.org/W2136956348,"This study characterizes the effect of glucose-induced activation of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) and Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) expression on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) actions in glomerular podocytes in cultures and in glomeruli of diabetic rodents. Elevation of glucose levels induced PKCδ and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to increase SHP-1 expression, increased podocyte apoptosis, and inhibited VEGF activation in podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells. The adverse effects of high glucose levels can be negated by molecular inhibitors of PKCδ, p38MAPK and SHP-1 and only partially reduced by antioxidants and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor. Increased PKCδ activation and SHP-1 expression correlated with loss of VEGF signaling and podocyte numbers in the glomeruli of diabetic rats and mice. In contrast, diabetic PKCδ-knockout (Prkcd–/–) mice did not exhibit activation of p38 MAPK and SHP-1 or inhibition of VEGF signaling in renal glomeruli. Functionally, diabetic Prkcd–/– mice had decreased expressions of TGFβ, VEGF, and extracellular matrix and less albuminuria than diabetic Prkcd+/+ mice. Hyperglycemia and diabetes can cause glomerular podocyte apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction partly due to increased PKCδ/p38 MAPK activation and the expression of SHP-1 to cause VEGF resistance, independent of NF-κB activation.—Mima, A., Kitada, M., Geraldes, P., Li, Q., Matsumoto, M., Mizutani, K., Qi, W., Li, C., Leitges, M., Rask-Madsen, C., King, G.

The first step in MAC assembly is cleavage of C5 to generate metastable C5b, which forms a stable complex with C6, termed C5b-6. C5b-6 initiates pore formation via the sequential recruitment of homologous proteins: C7, C8, and 12–18 copies of C9, each of which comprises a central MAC-perforin domain flanked by auxiliary domains. We recently proposed a model of pore assembly, in which the auxiliary domains play key roles, both in stabilizing the closed conformation of the protomers and in driving the sequential opening of the MAC-perforin β-sheet of each new recruit to the growing pore. Here, we describe an atomic model of C5b-6 at 4.2 Å resolution. We show that C5b provides four interfaces for the auxiliary domains of C6.

We recently determined the crystal structure of complement C6 and proposed a mechanism for MAC assembly, including the structural basis for sequential and unidirectional assembly (14Aleshin A.E.

Based on comparisons with C8 and perforin, we proposed that the auxiliary domains play key roles in regulating conformation and assembly of the MAC. Specifically, we suggested how the rotation of auxiliary modules at the leading edge of the nascent MAC could mediate optimal packing interactions with the new recruit and trigger the opening of its β-sheet, leading to the release of clusters of helices (CH), which would ultimately form the membrane attachment/spanning elements (14Aleshin A.E. Schraufstatter I.U. Stec B. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Discipio R.G.

In the absence of direct structural data, our model remained speculative, particularly in the early steps of initiation by C5b. To address this, we have crystallized C5b-6 and solved its structure to a resolution of 4.2 Å. The map is of excellent quality, allowing an almost complete atomic model of the biomolecular ∼300-kDa complex to be built. The complex structure provides a wealth of new insights into how C5b primes C6 for MAC assembly, allowing us to refine and extend our model (14Aleshin A.E. Schraufstatter I.U. Stec B. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Discipio R.G. Structure of complement C6 suggests a mechanism for initiation and unidirectional, sequential assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC).J. Biol.

In particular, it shows how C5b engages the auxiliary domains of C6 in an intimate embrace that “primes” C6 for initiating MAC assembly. C5 and C6 were purified from a single batch of human plasma as described previously (14Aleshin A.E. Schraufstatter I.U. Stec B. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Discipio R.G.

C5 (6 mg/ml) and C6 (3 mg/ml) in 5 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.6, and 80 mm Li2SO4 were incubated with the fluid phase C5 convertase, CVF-Bb (EC 3.4.21.47), a complex of cobra venom factor and the Bb subunit of complement factor B, as described (16DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. The activation of human complement component C5 by a fluid phase C5 convertase.J. Biol.

The reactants were incubated in 300-μl polypropylene tubes at room temperature for 2–4 weeks. During this time, orthorhombic crystals of C5b-6 formed spontaneously as long thin plates. C5b-6 hemolytic activity was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes (Colorado Serum Co.) pretreated for 1 h with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA. After washing several times, cells were suspended in 0.14 m dextrose, 0.1% gelatin, 2.5 mm sodium barbital pH 8.0, 70 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Samples of C5b-6 (0–0.2 μg) were preincubated for 1 min with 107 erythrocytes, followed by the addition of C8 (0.05 μg) and C9 (0.4 μg). Finally, C7 (0.05 μg) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. One ml of buffer was then added to each tube, and the samples were centrifuged. Hemolysis was measured by optical density measurement of the supernatants at 413 nm, and complement hemolysis CH50 activity units were determined as previously described (17Whaley K. North J. Haemolytic assays for whole complement activity and individual components.in: Dodds A.W. Sim R.B. Complement: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 19-47Google Scholar). Crystals with a typical size ∼0.1 × 0.06 × 0.4 mm were suspended in mother liquor and mounted in glass capillaries for room temperature data collection. The best crystals diffracted to ∼4 Å resolution but were radiation-sensitive. The diffraction data were collected at SSRL, Beamline 11-1, equipped with a Pilatus 6M detector. The data were collected at a rate of 1 frame/s in a beam collimated to 0.15 × 0.1 mm, without attenuation. One or two batches of data were collected from distinct volumes of each crystal. Each batch contained ∼15 frames with 0.5° rotation per frame. Each crystal volume typically survived for ∼10 frames (5°) before radiation damage became severe. Because most crystals adopted a similar orientation when mounted in the capillary, we were able to manually align them for data collection, so that reasonable completeness was obtained using 17 batches from 10 crystals. The data were processed using HKL2000, and radiation damage was assessed by changes in scale and B factor, as well as Rmerge. Frames with Rmerge > 25–30% were rejected. Table 1 summarizes data collection and refinement statistics. The structure was solved initially by placing the major domains, using a molecular replacement method implemented in the program PHASER from CCP4 (18McCoy A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar).

Template 1 contained the first seven domains of C5 overlaid onto the equivalent domains of C3b; template 2 comprised the MAC-perforin (MACPF) and selected auxiliary domains of C6; and templates 3–5 comprised C5d, the C1r/C1s, Uegf, and BMP-1 (bone morphogenetic protein-1) (CUB) domain, and C345C from the structure of C5. Template 6 comprised the C-terminal auxiliary domains (complement control proteins (CCPs) and factor I modules (FIMs) of C6). The missing parts of both proteins, including the linker regions, were built manually into difference Fourier maps.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionNumber of crystals/segments10/17Temperature (K)298Resolution (Å)30–4.2Space groupI212121Cell dimensions (Å)159, 228, 278Rmerge0.16 (0.56)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.I/σI5.7 (1.6)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.Completeness (%)82 (67)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.Redundancy3.0 (2.6)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.Refinement statisticsNumber of reflections (work/free)28,605/1529Completeness (%)82Rwork0.221 (0.33)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.Rfree0.278 (0.37)aThe value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A.Mean B (Å2)167Wilson B, Å2120Number of protein atoms19,517Root mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.01Angle (°)1.7Ramachandran plot (from PROCHECK)Favored (%)82.6Allowed (%)16.2Generally allowed (%)1.0Disallowed (%)0.3a The value for the outer resolution shell, 4.4–4.2 A. Open table in a new tab The model was refined using REFMAC5 (version 6), which has a number of tools that enable reliable atomic models to be built at relatively low (∼4 Å) resolution, including anisotropic scaling and water components modeled by Babinet's principle (21Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S. Steiner R.A. Nicholls R.A. Winn M.D. Long F. Vagin A.A. REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2011; 67: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). In addition, “jelly body” restraints (σ = 0.012) enabled atomic coordinates and B-factors to be refined. Reciprocal space refinement was iterated with manual model building and real space refinement in COOT (22Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17196) Google Scholar). The final cycles of refinement were conducted with TLS (translation, libration, screw) in five groups, with B-factor restraints increased by 1.5 from the default values. The quality of the structure was validated with CCP4. The final R factors are 0.21 (Rwork) and 0.27 (Rfree). Portions of the final electron density map are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The final model comprises 2450 residues (of a total of 2495), 15 saccharide units at eight attachments sites, and one divalent metal ion (modeled as Ca2+) bound at the C6 low density lipoprotein receptor (LR) element. The only missing elements are four loops within C5. The entire C6 structure is defined, with the exception of part of the CH1 domain (which was also disordered in crystals of C6) and the CCP2-FIM1 linker. C5b-6 was previously shown to form paracrystals at concentrations ∼1 mg/ml (23Podack E.R. Esser A.F. Biesecker G. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Membrane attack complex of complement. A structural analysis of its assembly.J. Exp. Med. 1980; 151: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By using higher protein concentrations (>5 mg/ml), we obtained orthorhombic crystals of C5b-6 that grew spontaneously from the reaction mixture, comprising C5, C6, and a soluble C5 convertase (CVF-Bb). The integrity of the complex was confirmed by dissolving crystals in 30% glycerol followed by the dialysis and assaying for specific hemolytic activity. The measured value (∼2 × 104 CH50 units/mg was comparable with that of the initially prepared soluble C5b-6 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Crystals diffracted to ∼4 Å resolution at room temperature but were highly radiation-sensitive. We were unable to freeze crystals without substantial loss of diffraction quality; we therefore collected room temperature data from multiple capillary-mounted crystals. The data from 10 crystals merged satisfactorily to a resolution of 4.2 Å. The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement and ab initio model building of novel elements, notably a key linker region that was invisible in the structure of C6 alone. Refinement utilized jelly body restraints to stabilize convergence and minimize overfitting (21Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S. Steiner R.A. Nicholls R.A. Winn M.D. Long F. Vagin A.A. REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2011; 67: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). The quality of the final electron density and derived model are exceptionally good for this resolution (Fig. 1, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S1). C5b (Mr = ∼185,000) is the major proteolytic product of C5 after cleavage by C5 convertase, which excises a 74-residue helical domain, the C5a anaphylatoxin, from the center of the molecule. The two chains of C5b remain covalently linked via a disulfide bond. Although the structure of C5 (20Laursen N.S. Gordon N. Hermans S. Lorenz N. Jackson N. Wines B. Spillner E. Christensen J.B.

The conversion of C5 to C5b is accompanied by large conformational changes that are similar in nature to those observed in the homologous C3b, but with several important differences. C5b contains 12 domains. The first seven comprise ∼100-residue α-macroglobulin-like (MG) domains, each of which folds as a small β-sandwich. MG1–MG7 assemble into a large “MG scaffold” that supports the more flexible C-terminal domains. The anaphylatoxin C5a was an insert into the MG6 domain, connected via long loops to the opposite side of the protein. The link domain (residues 608–673) retains a similar conformation in C5b and includes two helical elements that form part of the MG scaffold. The chain continues as a CUB domain, which is another β-sandwich into which a large α-helical domain, C5d (Mr∼35,000), has been inserted. After returning to complete the CUB domain, the chain continues as another MG domain (MG8) and finally a C-terminal α/β-domain, related to members of the netrin family, called C345C (27Bányai L. Patthy L. The NTR module. Domains of netrins, secreted frizzled related proteins, and typ I procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein are homologous with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Mr = ∼17,000) that sits at the top of the molecule (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). In the transition from C5 to C5b, the subset of the MG scaffold comprising MG1, MG2, MG5, and MG6 is quite rigid (superposing with an root mean square difference of only 1.2 Å (Cα)), providing a convenient reference frame. The other domains rotate about their centers of mass, especially MG3 and MG7, which directly contact the C-terminal elements. In C5, the CUB, C5d, MG8, and C5a domains form a compact bundle that packs against the MG scaffold (24Fredslund F. Laursen N.S. Roversi P. Jenner L. Oliveira C.L. Pedersen J.S. Nunn M.A. Lea S.M. Discipio R. Sottrup-Jensen L. Andersen G.R. Structure of and influence of tick complement inhibitor on complement component 5.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Following the excision of C5a, MG8 moves ∼20 Å laterally to fill the cavity created by the loss of C5a. This releases constraints on the CUB-C5d unit, and C5d “unfurls” from the CUB, rotating ∼120° and shifting (downward and outward (away from the MG scaffold) by ∼40 Å (Fig. 2A). The CUB domain accommodates this movement by rotating ∼40° and by making a new interface with MG2. C345C is perched at the top of the MG scaffold in a loose association and is displaced in the complex partly in response to the shift of MG8. A related conformational change in the transition from C3 to C3b has been described (19Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structure of C3b reveals conformational changes that underlie complement activity.Nature. 2006; 444: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The most obvious difference is the final position of C3d vis-à-vis C5d. In C3b and all of its complexes determined thus far (19Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P.

In the C5b-6 complex, the CUB-C5d linkage is much more compact, and although C5b swings downward, it does not move as far (∼40Å); its direction is also different, such that it remains 50 Å from the base of MG1. This distinct location for C5d appears to be stabilized by the unique packing of C6 against C5b (see below). We recently reported the crystal structure of C6 in its uncomplexed form (14Aleshin A.E. Schraufstatter I.U. Stec B. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Discipio R.G. Structure of complement C6 suggests a mechanism for initiation and unidirectional, sequential assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10210-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It comprises a central α/β globular MACPF domain, with a highly bent four-stranded β-sheet at its center; in addition, nine “auxiliary” domains (Fig. 1C) either wrap around or extend from the body of the MACPF. The last four domains (two CCP modules and two FIMs) extend upward from the MACPF body, attached via a flexible linker. In the C5b-6 complex, the linker and its flanking domains are sequestered by C5b, such that the C-terminal domains adopt a very different conformation (supplemental Fig. S2). FIM2 was poorly defined in crystals of C6, but in the C5b-6 complex, both FIMs are clearly seen to fold as a single module that is distinct from the structure of the C7 FIM pair (33Phelan M.M. Thai C.T. Soares D.C. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. Bramham J. Solution structure of factor I-like modules from complement C7 reveals a pair of follistatin domains in compact pseudosymmetric arrangement.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19637-19649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) because of the insertion of a helix and disulfide-linked loop. More subtle C5b-induced changes in C6, which we propose to be linked to activation, are described below. C5b-6 is a bimolecular complex of Mr∼300,000. In the view shown in Fig. 1, C5b sits on top of C6, and because both domains stand “upright,” the complex is very tall (>200 Å). This packing mode is distinct from any known C3b-ligand interaction. In the complex, C5b grabs the top of C6 like a pair of pincers. On one side, the rigid MG scaffold of C5b locks onto the TS2 and LR domains of C6. On the other, the C5d and CUB domains of C5b engage the top of the third thrombospondin module (TS3), the TS3-CCP1 linker, and the first CCP domain in an extensive and intimate interface. Table 2 lists the buried interfaces for all C5b-C6 interactions in the crystal lattice and estimates and energy for each of them.TABLE 2Interacting surface areas and estimated energetic contributionsC5bC6AreaΔGÅ2kcal/molC5dLinker + TS31480−17.8CCP1350−1.6CCP2410+0.2Total2320−19.2MG1–6CCP1180−0.6LR + TS2540− 1.0Total720−1.6CUBCCP1430−1.2C345CFIM2560−7.2C6C5bAreaΔGÅ2kcal/molCCP1C5d350−1.6CUB430−1.2MG1–6180−0.6Total960−3.4 Open table in a new tab An additional contact is made by the C-terminal FIMs, which form an extensive contact with the C345C domain of C5b across a 2-fold symmetry axis in the crystal; although the domains belong to different molecules in the crystal, there is reason to believe that a similar intramolecular contact exists in solution (i.e., this may be an example of domain swapping; see below). We will now describe each interface in detail. Two auxiliary domains of C6 (TS2, the LR module and the linker between them) form a continuous ridge at the top of the MACPF that packs against the base of the MG scaffold (contacting MG1, MG4, and MG5), burying ∼550 Å2 of protein surface. The interface has reasonable charge and shape complementarity, and docking involves only minor conformational changes on either side of the interface; however, the predicted binding energy is relatively small (Fig. 3B and Table 2). The long linker segment (from TS3 to CCP1) emanating from the last β-strand of TS3 (residues 590–623), together with the adjacent β-hairpin at the top of TS3 (residues 556CDATY560), bury a total of ∼1500 Å2 of protein surface (Fig. 4). This is by far the largest interface in the complex, and energy calculations suggest that it dominates the overall binding (ΔG"
https://openalex.org/W2165330108,"During human uterine spiral artery (SpA) remodeling, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are lost and replaced by fibrinoid, incorporating extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. The aim of the current study was to determine the relative contributions of apoptosis and migration to VSMC loss during SpA remodeling. Immunohistochemistry (Apoptag, active caspase 3, lamin) of placental bed biopsies (8-20 wk gestation) demonstrated apoptotic cells in all samples; double immunolabeling identified these as trophoblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. In total, 294 SpAs were studied, and only one apoptotic VSMC was identified. H-caldesmon-immunopositive VSMCs were observed surrounding and separate from SpA walls in partially remodeled vessels; the highest level of VSMC migration was observed in vessels with associated EVT cells (number of migrated cells 6.4 ± 1.2; distance migrated 3.5 ± 0.3 pixels) compared with those without (number of migrated cells 3.6 ± 0.5, P<0.001; distance migrated 2.8 ± 0.1 pixels, P<0.0001). VEGF-A, VEGF-C, TGF-β1, and Ang-2 all stimulated human aorta VSMC invasion in vitro, although EVT cell culture supernatants did not. In summary, apoptosis is unlikely to play a major role in loss of VSMCs from SpAs during remodeling in normal pregnancy, but VSMCs appear to migrate away from the wall of the SpA, an effect enhanced by the presence of EVT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109895287,"Many trees species form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient and water acquisition of their host. Until now it is unclear whether the species richness of ECM fungi is beneficial for tree seedling performance, be it during moist conditions or drought. We performed a pot experiment using Pinus sylvestris seedlings inoculated with four selected ECM fungi (Cenococcum geophilum, Paxillus involutus, Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus) to investigate (i) whether these four ECM fungi, in monoculture or in species mixtures, affect growth of P. sylvestris seedlings, and (ii) whether this effect can be attributed to species number per se or to species identity. Two different watering regimes (moist vs. dry) were applied to examine the context-dependency of the results. Additionally, we assessed the activity of eight extracellular enzymes in the root tips. Shoot growth was enhanced in the presence of S. granulatus, but not by any other ECM fungal species. The positive effect of S. granulatus on shoot growth was more pronounced under moist (threefold increase) than under dry conditions (twofold increase), indicating that the investigated ECM fungi did not provide additional support during drought stress. The activity of secreted extracellular enzymes was higher in S. granulatus than in any other species. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ECM fungal species composition may affect seedling performance in terms of aboveground biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2067740392,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, exists in nature through a complex life cycle involving ticks of the Ixodes genus and mammalian hosts. During its life cycle, B. burgdorferi experiences fluctuations in oxygen tension and may encounter reactive oxygen species (ROS). The key metalloenzyme to degrade ROS in B. burgdorferi is SodA. Although previous work suggests that B. burgdorferi SodA is an iron-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD), later work demonstrates that B. burgdorferi is unable to transport iron and contains an extremely low intracellular concentration of iron. Consequently, the metal cofactor for SodA has been postulated to be manganese. However, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis remains lacking. In this study, we provide biochemical and genetic data showing that SodA is a manganese-dependent enzyme. First, B. burgdorferi contained SOD activity that is resistant to H(2)O(2) and NaCN, characteristics associated with Mn-SODs. Second, the addition of manganese to the Chelex-treated BSK-II enhanced SodA expression. Third, disruption of the manganese transporter gene bmtA, which significantly lowers the intracellular manganese, greatly reduced SOD activity and SodA expression, suggesting that manganese regulates the level of SodA. In addition, we show that B. burgdorferi is resistant to streptonigrin, a metal-dependent redox cycling compound that produces ROS, and that SodA plays a protective role against the streptonigrin. Taken together, our data demonstrate the Lyme disease spirochete encodes a manganese-dependent SOD that contributes to B. burgdorferi defense against intracellular superoxide."
https://openalex.org/W2056184328,"Osteoporosis is associated with both atherosclerosis and vascular calcification attributed to hyperlipidemia. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining the parallel progression of these diseases remain unclear. Here, we used low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR(-/-)) mice to elucidate the role of LDLR in regulating the differentiation of osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption. Culturing wild-type osteoclast precursors in medium containing LDL-depleted serum decreased receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation, and this defect was additively rescued by simultaneous treatment with native and oxidized LDLs. Osteoclast precursors constitutively expressed LDLR in a RANKL-independent manner. Osteoclast formation from LDLR(-/-) osteoclast precursors was delayed, and the multinucleated cells formed in culture were smaller and contained fewer nuclei than wild-type cells, implying impaired cell-cell fusion. Despite these findings, RANK signaling, including the activation of Erk and Akt, was normal in LDLR(-/-) preosteoclasts, and RANKL-induced expression of NFATc1 (a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis), cathepsin K, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was equivalent in LDLR-null and wild-type cells. In contrast, the amounts of the osteoclast fusion-related proteins v-ATPase V(0) subunit d2 and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein in LDLR(-/-) plasma membranes were reduced when compared with the wild type, suggesting a correlation with impaired cell-cell fusion, which occurs on the plasma membrane. LDLR(-/-) mice consistently exhibited increased bone mass in vivo. This change was accompanied by decreases in bone resorption parameters, with no changes in bone formation parameters. These findings provide a novel mechanism for osteoclast differentiation and improve the understanding of the correlation between osteoclast formation and lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1985060612,"The extra domain A (EDA)-containing fibronectin (EDA-FN), an alternatively spliced form of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, is predominantly expressed in various malignancies but not in normal tissues. In the present study, we investigated the potential pro-lymphangiogenesis effects of extra domain A (EDA)-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) secretion in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). We detected the expressions of EDA and VEGF-C in 52 human colorectal tumor tissues and their surrounding mucosae by immunohistochemical analysis, and further tested the correlation between the expressions of these two proteins in aforementioned CRC tissues. Both EDA and VEGF-C were abundantly expressed in the specimens of human CRC tissues. And VEGF-C was associated with increased expression of EDA in human CRC according to linear regression analysis. Besides, EDA expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation and clinical stage by clinicopathological analysis of tissue microarrays containing tumor tissues of 115 CRC patients. Then, human CRC cell SW480 was transfected with lentivectors to elicit expression of shRNA against EDA (shRNA-EDA), and SW620 was transfected with a lentiviral vector to overexpress EDA (pGC-FU-EDA), respectively. We confirmed that VEGF-C was upregulated in EDA-overexpressed cells, and downregulated in shRNA-EDA cells. Moreover, a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway was found to be involved in EDA-mediated VEGF-C secretion. The in vivo result demonstrated that EDA could promote tumor growth and tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis in mouse xenograft models. Our findings provide evidence that EDA could play a role in tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis via upregulating autocrine secretion of VEGF-C in colorectal cancer, which is associated with the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2084610235,"We recently reported that lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) knock-out mice, particularly in the LDL receptor knock-out background, are hypersensitive to insulin and resistant to high fat diet-induced insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. We demonstrated that chow-fed Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ mice have elevated hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which promotes IR, compared with wild-type controls, and this effect is normalized in Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hepatic ER cholesterol metabolism differentially regulates ER stress using these models. We observed that the Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ mice accumulate excess hepatic total and ER cholesterol primarily attributed to increased reuptake of biliary cholesterol as we observed reduced biliary cholesterol in conjunction with decreased hepatic Abcg5/g8 mRNA, increased Npc1l1 mRNA, and decreased Hmgr mRNA and nuclear SREBP2 protein. Intestinal NPC1L1 protein was induced. Expression of these genes was reversed in the Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice, accounting for the normalization of total and ER cholesterol and ER stress. Upon feeding a 2% high cholesterol diet (HCD), Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice accumulated a similar amount of total hepatic cholesterol compared with the Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ mice, but the hepatic ER cholesterol levels remained low in conjunction with being protected from HCD-induced ER stress and IR. Hepatic ER stress correlates strongly with hepatic ER free cholesterol but poorly with hepatic tissue free cholesterol. The unexpectedly low ER cholesterol seen in HCD-fed Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice was attributable to a coordinated marked up-regulation of ACAT2 and suppressed SREBP2 processing. Thus, factors influencing the accumulation of ER cholesterol may be important for the development of hepatic insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2008540730,"Certain parasites have evolved to evade the immune response and establish chronic infections that may persist for many years. T cell responses in these conditions become muted despite ongoing infection. Upregulation of surface receptors with inhibitory properties provides an immune cell-intrinsic mechanism that, under conditions of chronic infection, regulates immune responses and limits cellular activation and associated pathology. The negative regulator, CD200 receptor, and its ligand, CD200, have been shown to regulate macrophage activation and reduce pathology following infection. We show that CD4 T cells also increase expression of inhibitory CD200 receptors (CD200R) in response to chronic infection. CD200R was upregulated on murine effector T cells in response to infection with bacterial, Salmonella enterica, or helminth, Schistosoma mansoni, pathogens that respectively drive predominant Th1- or Th2-responses. In vitro chronic and prolonged stimuli were required for the sustained upregulation of CD200R, and its expression coincided with loss of multifunctional potential in T effector cells during infection. Importantly, we show an association between IL-4 production and CD200R expression on T effector cells from humans infected with Schistosoma haematobium that correlated effectively with egg burden and, thus infection intensity. Our results indicate a role of CD200R:CD200 in T cell responses to helminths which has diagnostic and prognostic relevance as a marker of infection for chronic schistosomiasis in mouse and man."

Previous work involving bioinformatics and radioactive N-glycan analyses indicated that the structure of the dolichol-linked N-glycosylation precursor in the ER of C. neoformans is Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol with no addition of glucose residues due to a lack of Alg glucosyltransferases (Alg6p, Alg8p, and Alg10p), implying different processing of cryptococcal N-glycans in the ER (30Samuelson J.

In addition, C. neoformans was predicted to lack most of the genes encoding M-pol I and II subunits, suggesting N-glycans have less elongated α1,6-mannan chains compared with those of S. cerevisiae (31Klutts J.S.

However, only limited information is available on the structural characteristics of the N-linked glycans in Cryptococcus species. In this study, we performed a comparative N-glycan profile analysis of C. neoformans species complex using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and HPLC, and we present the first report on the serotype-specific presence of a β1,2-xylose residue in high mannose type N-glycans in C. neoformans. In addition, we showed that the OCH1 and MNN2 genes play major roles in cryptococcal N-glycan processing in the Golgi. Furthermore, we provide a line of data supporting the presence of xylose phosphate residues on the core and outer regions of N-glycans in Cryptococcus. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1 and were generally cultured in YPD broth medium (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, 2% w/v glucose) with shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C. YPDNAT (YPD solid medium containing 100 μg/ml nourseothricin, Werner BioAgents; where NAT is nourseothricin acetyltransferase) or YPDG418 (YPD solid medium containing 200 μg/ml geneticin, Sigma) was used for selection of C. neoformans transformants. The primer sets used for disruption and reintegration of genes in this study are listed in supplemental Table 2. Each gene was disrupted in the C. neoformans serotype A H99 (MATα) strain background using overlap PCR or double joint-PCR strategies followed by biolistic transformation as described previously (32Kim M.S.

Genomic DNA of C. neoformans transformants grown on YPDNAT was isolated from cell lysate using acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma), and deletion of CnOCH1, CnMNN2, and CnKTR3 was confirmed by PCR (supplemental Fig. 1). For reintegration of wild-type genes into the corresponding mutant strains, genomic DNA fragments of CnOCH1 and CnMNN2 were obtained and introduced into the original genomic locus using pJAF1 (33Fraser J.A.

To obtain cell wall mannoproteins (cwMPs), C. neoformans cells freshly grown on YPD plates for 2 days were inoculated in 200 ml of YPD and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. The cells at the stationary phase (A600 = 40–50) were harvested and washed with water. To reduce the possibility of capsular polysaccharide contamination, the washed cells were incubated twice for 30 min at room temperature in an equal volume of DMSO as described previously (34Bryan R.A. Zaragoza O. Zhang T. Ortiz G. Casadevall A. Dadachova E. Radiological studies reveal radial differences in the architecture of the polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans.Eukaryot.

The washed cells were then resuspended in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 7.0, autoclaved at 121 °C for 120 min, and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (35Chiba Y. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Yoshida A.

The supernatants (mixture of crude cell wall proteins and capsular polysaccharides) were recovered, and capsular polysaccharides were precipitated from the supernatants by slowly adding an equal volume of cold ethanol to the supernatants and removed by filtration with a syringe filter (0.45-μm, Sartorius Stedim Biotech). After addition of 3 volumes of ethanol to the filtrate and incubation at 4 °C overnight, crude cell wall proteins were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The dried cell wall proteins were then dissolved with 10 ml of concanavalin A (ConA) binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2) and incubated with 1 ml of ConA-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in a column for 2 h with slow rotation. The beads were then washed with 10 ml of ConA binding buffer, and cwMPs were eluted by addition of 5 ml of 1 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. For isolation of secretory mannoproteins (sMPs), supernatants from 500 ml of YPD cultures incubated for 48 h at 30 °C were obtained by centrifugation and filtration using a 0.45-μm filter membrane, concentrated, and then exchanged with PBS buffer by tangential flow filtration using a 30-kDa cassette (PXC030C50, Millipore). The supernatants were further concentrated by using an Amicon-15 (30,000 molecular weight cutoff, Millipore). sMPs were purified from the concentrated culture supernatants using ConA, as described for the purification of cwMPs, except that PBS buffer was used instead of Tris-HCl buffer. The eluted glycoproteins were dialyzed with water for 2 days and dried using a vacuum evaporator (Hanil Scientific). The dried glycoproteins were dissolved in water and quantified by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermoscientific). From purified cwMPs or sMPs (100–200 μg), N-linked glycans were isolated using 3 μl of peptide:N-glycanase F (500 units/μl, New England Biolabs) and then purified by Carbograph Extract-CleanTM column (150 mg, Alltech). For MALDI-TOF analysis, a matrix solution consisting of 6-aza-2-thiothymine and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) (v/v, 1:1) in 0.25% acetonitrile (Burdick & Jackson) and 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed with samples of equal volume. The glycan samples were dried and then analyzed using MicroflexTM mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) operated in the reflective positive mode for neutral glycan analysis or in the linear negative mode for acidic glycan analysis. Alternatively, isolated N-glycans were dried, resuspended in 50 μl of fresh 1% (w/v) sodium acetate·3H2O, and then labeled with 100 μl of 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA) solution (30 mg of 2-AA and 30 mg of NaBH3CN in 1 ml of 4% sodium acetate·3H2O, 2% boric acid, in methanol) at 80 °C for 45 min. Labeled N-glycans were purified using a SampliQ Cyano cartridge (100 mg, Agilent) to remove excess 2-AA. Purified N-glycans were reacted with 1 μl of α1,2-mannosidase (α1,2-MNS, 0.1 milliunit/μl, Prozyme) in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 12 h at 37 °C, and half of the mixture with an additional 1 μl of α1,2-MNS was further incubated for 12 h. The other half of the α1,2-MNS-treated mixture was subsequently reacted with 1 μl of α1,6-mannosidase (α1,6-MNS, 40 units/μl, New England Biolabs) for 12 h at 37 °C. Enzymes were removed using a 10K Microcon (Millipore), dried in a vacuum evaporator (Hanil Scientific), and reconstituted with 3–5 μl of water for mass analysis. To determine the presence of xylose residue, 2-AA labeled N-glycans in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, were mixed with 2 μl of jack bean α-mannosidase (JBM, 150 milliunits/μl, Prozyme), incubated for 48 h at 25 °C, and then successively treated with 1 μl of β1,2-xylosidase (from Xanthomonas sp., 20 microunits/μl, Calbiochem) for 24 h at 37 °C. After removal of exoglycosidases by filtration through a 10K Microcon, glycan profiles were analyzed by normal phase HPLC. Two peaks generated after JBM treatment were fractionated and further analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Membrane fractions were obtained as described previously with slight modification (21Kim M.W. Kim E.J.

Pre-cultured C. neoformans in YPD was inoculated in 500 ml of YPD medium at initial optical density (A600 = 0.5), and cultured to mid-log phase (A600 = 5). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min), washed with water, and resuspended in 5 ml of PMS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Aliquots (500 μl) were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes; glass beads were added at half the volume of the cell suspension, and cell lysis was then carried out through 5–10 cycles of alternating 1-min vortexing and 1-min cooling on ice. After ∼50% of the cells were disrupted (as assessed by microscopy), lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was separated, and an equal volume of PMS buffer was added to the pellets. After a second round of cell lysis, the supernatant was removed and added to the first round supernatant. Total supernatant (S1) was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. High speed pellets were collected, resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, plus 5% glycerol, and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of high speed pellets were determined using the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). α1,6-Mannosyltransferase activity was assayed as described previously with slight modification (21Kim M.W. Kim E.J. Kim J.Y. Park J.S. Oh D.B. Shimma Y. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Rhee S.K. Kang H.A.

High speed pellets (500 μg) were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm GDP-mannose, 0.5 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and 0.1 μg of Man8GlcNAc2-AA (Prozyme) as an acceptor at 30 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Microcon (YM-10, Millipore), and the filtrate was analyzed by HPLC. To identify linkage, the Golgi reaction mixture was treated with α1,2-MNS. Normal phase HPLC was conducted using an Asahipak NH2P-50 4E column (0.46 × 25 cm, 5 μm, Shodex) at a rate of 1.0 ml/min with Solvent A (100% acetonitrile) and Solvent B (50 mm ammonium formate in water, pH 4.4). The column was equilibrated with a solution containing 50% Solvent A and 50% Solvent B. After sample injection, the proportion of Solvent B was increased in a linear fashion to 68% for 50 min. 2-AA-oligosaccharides were analyzed with a Waters HPLC system composed of 515 dual pumps, a 717 plus autosampler, and a 2475 fluorescence detector with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 425 nm, respectively. Data were collected using EmpowerTM 2 chromatography data software (Waters). For acidic glycan analysis, the column was equilibrated with a solution containing 90% Solvent C (2% acetic acid, 1% tetrahydrofuran in acetonitrile) and 10% Solvent D (5% acetic acid, 3% triethylamine, 1% tetrahydrofuran in water). After sample injection (50 μl), the proportion of Solvent D was increased in a linear fashion up to 90% for 60 min. 2-AA-oligosaccharides were detected using the same Waters HPLC system described above. After fractionation, each sample was dried and dissolved in water. The peaks separated on HPLC were further identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using the linear negative mode. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise. To obtain general information on the structure of neutral N-glycans of the Cryptococcus species complex, MALDI-TOF analysis was carried out in the positive mode with N-linked oligosaccharides assembled on cwMPs derived from serotype A strain H99 (α-mating type) (Fig. 1A). A series of major peaks observed at m/z of 1258.1, 1420.1, 1582.1, 1744.1, 1906.0, 2067.9, 2230.1, and 2392.1 were matched well to high mannose type N-glycans ranging from Hex5HexNAc2 to Hex12HexNAc2 (H5–12), originating from the ascomycetous yeast and fungal species (glycan structure database of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics). In contrast, other major peaks with a mass value 30.0 m/z smaller than those of HexnHexNAc2 could not be assigned to any reported glycans. Considering that the mass difference of each peak corresponds to the molecular weight of C1H2O1, it was speculated that the unassigned glycan structures might be oligosaccharides containing a pentose residue (P1H5–20, Pen1Hex5–20HexNAc2). Given that most fungal N-glycans are of high mannose type, we predicted that N-linked oligosaccharides of C. neoformans would also be mostly constituted of mannose residues. As expected, digestion of N-glycans from serotype A strain H99 with α1,2-MNS resulted in the convergence of most peaks to H5–6 and P1H6–8, indicating that the outer chains of cryptococcal N-glycans were mostly extended by α1,2-mannose residues without a terminal α1,3-mannose cap (Fig. 1B). Subsequent digestion with α1,6-MNS resulted in the shift of H6 to H5 and P1H6 to P1H5, although the peak of Pen1Hex8GlcNAc2 (P1H8) was not shifted (Fig. 1C). The P1H8 glycan seems to be an incompletely digested product that was derived from a fraction of glycans lacking α1,6-mannose extension, because it was converted to P1H5 by additional prolonged digestion with α1,2-mannosidase (data not shown). These results indicate"

https://openalex.org/W2066742532,"Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Its major environmental risk factor is UVB radiation in sunlight. In response to UVB damage, epidermal keratinocytes activate a specific repair pathway, i.e. nucleotide excision repair, to remove UVB-induced DNA lesions. However, the regulation of UVB response is not fully understood. Here we show that the long isoform of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1 (Nrf1, also called NFE2L1), a cytoprotective transcription factor critical for the expression of multiple antioxidant response element-dependent genes, plays an important role in the response of keratinocytes to UVB. Nrf1 loss sensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bik through reducing glutathione levels. Knocking down Bik reduced UVB-induced apoptosis in Nrf1-inhibited cells. In UVB-irradiated surviving cells, however, disruption of Nrf1 impaired nucleotide excision repair through suppressing the transcription of xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC), a factor essential for initiating the global genome nucleotide excision repair by recognizing the DNA lesion and recruiting downstream factors. Nrf1 enhanced XPC expression by increasing glutathione availability but was independent of the transcription repressor of XPC. Adding XPC or glutathione restored the DNA repair capacity in Nrf1-inhibited cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Nrf1 levels are significantly reduced by UVB radiation in mouse skin and are lower in human skin tumors than in normal skin.

Proper maintenance of DNA integrity is vital for the viability and the health of organisms. The genome is under constant threats from endogenous metabolic byproducts and environmental factors that can alter its chemical structure and corrupt its encoded message. The resulting DNA lesions must be effectively repaired to prevent loss or incorrect transmission of genetic information as errors can cause developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis, including skin cancer, the most common cancer in the United States. As major building blocks of the skin, keratinocytes are constantly challenged by ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. In particular, UVB (280–315 nm) causes DNA damage and is the major environmental risk factor for skin cancer. Each year, more than one million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States alone, accounting for 40% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases (1.Bowden G.T.

Pharmacol. 2010; 244: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the biological functions of Nrf1. In particular, the involvement of Nrf1 in skin cancer and UVB response remains unknown. Here we used mouse skin, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from human skin, and the human HaCaT keratinocyte cell line to determine the role of Nrf1 in UVB response. We found that Nrf1 plays an important role in cell survival and DNA repair after UVB irradiation and likely acts as a tumor suppressor in skin carcinogenesis. All human specimens were studied after approval by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board. Frozen tissues were obtained under consent (Department of Medicine, University of Chicago). Protein lysate was used to determine Nrf1 levels by Western blotting. Human HaCaT keratinocytes were obtained from Professor N. Fusenig. HaCaT cells were transduced with MISSION lentiviral particles for short hairpin RNAs targeting Nrf1 to knock down the expression of the long isoform NRF1 gene (NRF1-KD; 3Throughout this article, the designation NRF1-KD indicates Nrf1 knockdown HaCaT cells, and the designation Scr indicates HaCaT cells transduced with scrambled negative control short hairpin RNA.

The selected cells were cultured in medium without puromycin. Scr and NRF1-KD cells were maintained in a monolayer culture in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). All animal procedures have been approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. B6 mice were shaved and 2 days later exposed to UVB (400, 750, and 1000 mJ/cm2) dorsally or sham-irradiated, three times a week for 1 week. Mouse skin was snap-frozen at 72 h after the final irradiation for immunoblotting analysis. Mice were housed no more than five animals per cage. For UVB treatment, a Stratalinker 2400 equipped with 312-nm UVB bulbs (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (UVC 0%, UVB 51%, and UVA 49%) was used. The UVB exposure was performed in PBS after washing the cells with PBS twice to avoid the photosensitization effect of components in culture medium on the cells. Our UVB radiation was monitored every other week to measure the exposure output and dose. Cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (siNC) or siRNA (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, Dharmacon) targeting Bik (siBik) (5 μg), using an Amaxa Nucleofector according to the manufacturer's instructions for HaCaT cells. For overexpression of XPC, cells were transfected with a vector expressing human XPC (OriGene, 1 μg) using an Amaxa Nucleofector according to the manufacturer's instructions for HaCaT cells. Empty vector was used as a transfection control. Briefly, HaCaT cells were resuspended, transfected with siRNAs or plasmids using the Amaxa Nucleofector II device, and then treated with or without UVB at 72 h after transfection. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed in triplicate using antibodies including Nrf1, DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) and 2 (DDB2), XPC, HR23B, PARP, β-actin (equal loading control), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Bcl-2 family proteins (Cell Signaling Technology and Epitomics) according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. The blots shown were representative of three replicates. β-Actin blots were done by stripping each blot. In Figs. 2A and 4A, the β-actin shown is a representative of each stripping. Approximate molecular mass is marked in each blot.FIGURE 4Nrf1 promotes UVB-induced DNA damage repair through regulating XPC.

Sub-G1 flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine apoptosis. Briefly, cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide. The percentage of cells at the sub-G1 phase was quantified by flow cytometry. For the promoter reporter assay, the plasmid mixtures, containing 1 μg of XPC promoter luciferase construct (XPC-Luc in pGL3 vector, kindly provided by Dr. Pradip Raychaudhuri at the University of Illinois at Chicago) and 0.025 μg of pRL-TK (Promega, used as a transfection efficiency control), were transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luciferase activity was measured with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems) and normalized with the values of pRL-TK luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter (DLR) assay kit (Promega). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using an ABI7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 96-well plates with the SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers for XPC (HP207915) and Bik (HP205127) were obtained from OriGene. Slot blot assays of CPD and 6-4PP were performed as described previously (28.Maeda T. Chua P.P. Chong M.T. Sim A.B. Nikaido O. Tron V.A. Nucleotide excision repair genes are up-regulated by low-dose artificial ultraviolet B: evidence of a photoprotective SOS response?.J. Invest.

Briefly, mouse skin or cells were collected at different time points after UVB, and DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm using NanoDrop 1000 (Thermofisher). The CPD and 6-4PP in DNA were quantified by slot blot (Bio-Rad) with monoclonal antibodies (TDM-2 for CPD and 64 M-2 for 6-4PP, COSMO BIO Co., Koto-Ku, Tokyo, Japan) (28.Maeda T. Chua P.P. Chong M.T.

For examining repair kinetics, the percentage of repair was calculated by comparing the optical density at the indicated time with that of the corresponding absorbance at time 0, when there was no opportunity for repair and 100% of CPDs (or 6-4PPs) were present after UVB. Cells were treated with or without UVB radiation and then incubated with 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (2 μm, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS three times, and oxidative stress was analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were expressed as the mean of three independent experiments and analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (supplemental Materials and Methods). To determine the role of Nrf1 in apoptosis, we first assessed cell viability in parental and Nrf1-inhibited HaCaT cells after sham or after UVB irradiation. UVB irradiation decreased cell viability in scrambled control (Scr) cells at 30 mJ/cm2 but not 20 mJ/cm2 (Fig. 1A). Nrf1 knockdown significantly increased cell death in cells exposed to UVB at both doses (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Nrf1 knockdown significantly increased UVB-induced apoptosis in both serum-starved and nonstarved HaCaT cells (Fig. 1, B–E). Immunoblot analysis showed that Nrf1 knockdown increased PARP cleavage in UVB-irradiated cells (Fig. 1F), further supporting the conclusion that Nrf1 inhibition sensitized cells to UVB-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that Nrf1 is essential for cell survival upon UVB irradiation. To determine the mechanism of the antiapoptotic function of Nrf1, we analyzed the effect of Nrf1 inhibition on the expression of the key apoptosis-regulating Bcl-2 family members. Nrf1 inhibition had no effect on the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, or Bcl-2 or the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bax, Bad, or Bid (Fig. 2A). However, Nrf1 knockdown increased the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bik (Fig. 2A). Real-time PCR analysis showed that Nrf1 knockdown increased the mRNA levels of Bik (Fig. 2B). To determine whether Bik up-regulation played an active role in apoptosis sensitized by Nrf1 inhibition, we used siRNA targeting Bik to inhibit Bik (Fig. 2C). As compared with NRF1-KD cells transfected with siNC, cells transfected with siBik significantly reduced UVB-induced and basal apoptosis (Fig. 2D), indicating that Nrf1 promotes cell survival, at least partially through suppressing Bik expression. To determine the mechanism of Bik regulation by Nrf1, we analyzed the role of oxidative stress. Knockdown of Nrf1 in HaCaT cells (supplemental Fig. S1A) increased cellular oxidative stress (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas it had no effect on the mitochondrial redox status (supplemental Fig. S1C). Nrf1 knockdown also increased oxidative stress in UVB-irradiated cells, similar to that in sham-irradiated cells (supplemental Fig. S1D). These data indicate that Nrf1 is essential for maintaining redox homeostasis in HaCaT cells prior to and after UVB damage. Furthermore, Nrf1 knockdown significantly reduced GSH levels (supplemental Fig. S2; p < 0.05, Student's t test). Treating Nrf1 knockdown cells with a cell-permeable form of GSH, GSH-monoethyl ester, increased intracellular GSH levels (supplemental Fig. S2; p < 0.05, Student's t test). In HaCaT cells, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased oxidative stress (Fig. 2E) and Bik protein levels (Fig. 2F). Treatment of Nrf1-inhibited cells with glutathione (GSH) reduced Bik protein levels (Fig. 2G). These data demonstrated that Nrf1 suppresses Bik expression through maintaining glutathione levels. To further determine the role of Nrf1 in the UVB response, we investigated the function of Nrf1 in DNA repair in surviving cells as these cells are the potential sources for cancer formation. As compared with Scr cells, repair of UVB-induced CPDs was significantly reduced in Nrf1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, A and B; p < 0.05, Student's t test). In contrast, it had no effect on the repair of 6-4PPs (Fig. 3, C and D). To determine the mechanism by which Nrf1 regulates DNA repair, we analyzed the difference in levels of proteins specifically involved in UVB-induced DNA repair, including DDB1, DDB2, HR23B, and XPC (8.Volker M.

Nrf1 inhibition had no effect on DDB1, DDB2, or HR23B, whereas it decreased XPC levels (Fig. 4A). Real-time PCR analysis and the promoter reporter assay indicated that Nrf1 knockdown suppressed XPC mRNA levels and its transcription (Fig. 4, B and C). However, it seems that the transcription repressor complex E2F4/p130 had no role in the regulation of XPC by Nrf1 as Nrf1 inhibition decreased nuclear localization of both E2F4 and p130 (supplemental Fig. S3), and mutation of the E2F binding site failed to restore XPC transcription in Nrf1-inhibited cells (Fig. 4D). To determine whether XPC plays an important role, we overexpressed XPC in Nrf1-inhibited cells (Fig. 4E). An increase in XPC levels significantly increased CPD repair (Fig. 4, F and G; p < 0.05, Student's t test), whereas it did not affect 6-4PP repair (Fig. 4, H and I). Our results demonstrate that Nrf1 promotes UVB-induced DNA damage repair through regulating XPC transcription. To determine the mechanism by which Nrf1 regulates XPC, we investigated the role of redox status and GSH availability. Increasing GSH levels in Nrf1-inhibited cells increased XPC protein levels (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, it also significantly increased CPD repair (Fig. 5, B and C; p < 0.05, Student's t test), but had no effect on 6-4PP repair (Fig. 5, D and E). Taken together, these data indicate that a proper GSH level is essential for Nrf1-promoted XPC expression. To determine the involvement of Nrf1 in skin cancer, we analyzed the difference in Nrf1 protein levels between normal human skin and human skin SCC and between sham and UVB-irradiated mouse skin. Nrf1 was expressed in two of the three normal human skin samples, whereas its expression was lost in all three SCCs (Fig. 6A), suggesting that Nrf1 acts as a tumor suppressor. In mouse skin, repeated UVB radiation down-regulated Nrf1 protein levels (Fig. 6B), implying that Nrf1 is a molecular target of UVB in vivo during skin tumorigenesis. In this study, we have identified the transcription factor Nrf1 as a critical player in UVB response, including apoptosis and DNA repair, in epidermal keratinocytes. As compared with normal skin, Nrf1 was down-regulated in human SCC. UVB radiation reduced Nrf1 levels in mouse skin. Nrf1 inhibition sensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis through oxidative stress-dependent Bik up-regulation. Furthermore, Nrf1 is required for UVB-induced DNA damage repair through GSH-dependent regulation of XPC expression. Our findings indicate that Nrf1 is likely a tumor suppressor in skin cancer development. In keratinocytes, Nrf1 is a vital factor to promote cell survival. In both untreated and UVB-irradiated cells, Nrf1 knockdown particularly induced the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bik but had no effect on the other members of the Bcl-2 family members. Containing a conserved BH3 domain, Bik binds and regulates the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Mcl-1 and Bxl-XL to induce apoptosis (29.Shimazu T. Degenhardt K. Nur-E-Kamal A. Zhang J. Yoshida T.

https://openalex.org/W2094447964,"The medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily consists of a large group of enzymes with a broad range of activities. Members of this superfamily are currently the subject of intensive investigation, but many aspects, including the zinc dependence of MDR superfamily proteins, have not yet have been adequately investigated. Using a density functional theory-based screening strategy, we have identified a strictly conserved glycine residue (Gly) in the zinc-dependent MDR superfamily. To elucidate the role of this conserved Gly in MDR, we carried out a comprehensive structural, functional, and computational analysis of four MDR enzymes through a series of studies including site-directed mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics analysis. Gly substitution by other amino acids posed a significant threat to the metal binding affinity and activity of MDR superfamily enzymes. Mutagenesis at the conserved Gly resulted in alterations in the coordination of the catalytic zinc ion, with concomitant changes in metal-ligand bond length, bond angle, and the affinity (K(d)) toward the zinc ion. The Gly mutants also showed different spectroscopic properties in EPR compared with those of the wild type, indicating that the binding geometries of the zinc to the zinc binding ligands were changed by the mutation. The present results demonstrate that the conserved Gly in the GHE motif plays a role in maintaining the metal binding affinity and the electronic state of the catalytic zinc ion during catalysis of the MDR superfamily enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2065957593,"DNA helicases are directly responsible for catalytically unwinding duplex DNA in an ATP-dependent and directionally specific manner and play essential roles in cellular nucleic acid metabolism. It has been conventionally thought that DNA helicases are inhibited by bulky covalent DNA adducts in a strand-specific manner. However, the effects of highly stable alkyl phosphotriester (PTE) lesions that are induced by chemical mutagens and refractory to DNA repair have not been previously studied for their effects on helicases. In this study, DNA repair and replication helicases were examined for unwinding a forked duplex DNA substrate harboring a single isopropyl PTE specifically positioned in the helicase-translocating or -nontranslocating strand within the double-stranded region. A comparison of SF2 helicases (RecQ, RECQ1, WRN, BLM, FANCJ, and ChlR1) with a SF1 DNA repair helicase (UvrD) and two replicative helicases (MCM and DnaB) demonstrates unique differences in the effect of the PTE on the DNA unwinding reactions catalyzed by these enzymes. All of the SF2 helicases tested were inhibited by the PTE lesion, whereas UvrD and the replication fork helicases were fully tolerant of the isopropyl backbone modification, irrespective of strand. Sequestration studies demonstrated that RECQ1 helicase was trapped by the PTE lesion only when it resided in the helicase-translocating strand. Our results are discussed in light of the current models for DNA unwinding by helicases that are likely to encounter sugar phosphate backbone damage during biological DNA transactions.

Our results are discussed in light of the current models for DNA unwinding by helicases that are likely to encounter sugar phosphate backbone damage during biological DNA transactions. A number of mutagenic and carcinogenic alkylating agents exist in the environment. In addition to modification of DNA bases, such chemical genotoxins can react with the oxygen atoms of the sugar phosphate backbone to form phosphotriester (PTE) 2The abbreviations used are: PTEphosphotriesterSFsuperfamilyXPxeroderma pigmentosum. adducts (1Jones G.D. Le Pla R.C. Farmer P.B. Phosphotriester adducts (PTEs). DNA's overlooked lesion.Mutagenesis. 2010; 25: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Esterification by covalent attachment of an alkyl moiety from an alkylating carcinogen to a non-carbon-bonded oxygen results in the introduction of a hydrophobic group into the nucleic acid backbone and neutralization of the negatively charged phosphodiester moiety. The PTE configuration is dependent on which oxygen atom is esterified, potentially leading to an alkyl group that projects perpendicular to the double helix axis (Sp) or projects into the major groove (Rp). Evidence suggests that PTEs are chemically stable under physiological conditions, persist in DNA long after cellular exposure to the alkylating agent, and can inhibit processes of DNA repair by affecting the catalytic functions of DNA metabolic enzymes, such as certain DNA polymerases, and endo- or exonucleases. phosphotriester superfamily xeroderma pigmentosum. The inhibitory effect of PTEs on DNA repair systems was of interest to us because a number of superfamily 1 (SF1) and SF2 DNA helicases, defined by their amino acid sequence homology within the helicase core domain (2Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Two related superfamilies of putative helicases involved in replication, recombination, repair and expression of DNA and RNA genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), are implicated in various DNA repair pathways. For example, a key DNA helicase in Escherichia coli that is required for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and methyl-directed mismatch repair is the SF1 UvrD enzyme, also known as DNA helicase II (3Matson S.W. DNA helicases of Escherichia coli.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 289-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SF2 DNA helicases have achieved prominence because a number of them have been implicated in hereditary diseases characterized by chromosomal instability and defects in DNA repair. These would include the RecQ family members (WRN (Werner syndrome protein), BLM (Bloom syndrome protein), and RECQL4) that are genetically linked to Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively, and two others, RECQ(L)1 and RECQ(L)5 (4Brosh Jr., R.M.

RecQ helicases: caretakers of the genome.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although RECQ1 and RECQ5 have not yet been implicated in a hereditary disorder, they are also important for maintenance of genomic stability (6Aygün O. Svejstrup J.Q. RECQL5 helicase.

The SF2 helicase family also includes the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster helicases FANCJ (Fanconia anemia Group J protein) and ChlR1, which are genetically linked to Fanconi anemia (9White M.F. Structure, function, and evolution of the XPD family of iron-sulfur-containing 5′ → 3′ DNA helicases.Biochem. Soc.

Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Warsaw breakage syndrome, a cohesinopathy associated with mutations in the XPD helicase family member DDX11/ChlR1.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 86: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), respectively. FANCJ is thought to have a role in the recombinational repair phase after interstrand cross-link processing, whereas ChlR1 is involved in the suppression of sister chromatid cohesion and resistance to DNA cross-linking agents and topoisomerase I inhibitors by a mechanism that is not well understood. In addition, mutations in the Fe-S helicase XPD that is implicated in eukaryotic NER and transcription can give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), XP combined with Cockayne syndrome, or trichothiodystrophy (11Lehmann A.R. The xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) gene. One gene, two functions, three diseases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). From a biochemical standpoint, the SF1 and SF2 DNA helicases are believed to function by different mechanisms; however, the details are only beginning to emerge (12Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). For SF1 helicases, the major contacts between the protein and DNA are with the bases; however, electrostatic interactions with the sugar phosphate backbone also exist. An unwinding mechanism known as the “Mexican Wave” has been described for a SF1 helicase PcrA in which DNA bases are flipped out as they make hydrophobic contacts with aromatic amino acids of the helicase (12Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Analysis of SF1 UvrD crystal structures provided evidence that UvrD unwinds one base pair at a time per ATP bound, followed by translocation on the emerging single strand with ATP hydrolysis (13Lee J.Y. Yang W. UvrD helicase unwinds DNA one base pair at a time by a two-part power stroke.Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Auxiliary domains in addition to the conserved helicase motifs are likely to play a role in the DNA unwinding reaction for SF1 and SF2 helicases. For example, RecQ helicases contain a RecQ C-terminal region located just after the helicase core domain that mediates interaction with DNA and other proteins (4Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A.

Structural insights into RecQ helicase mechanisms.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4098-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Fe-S helicases contain a conserved Fe-S cluster and an Arch motif that together form an Arch domain that is proposed to channel one strand of the unwound duplex (15Fan L. Fuss J.O. Cheng Q.J.

For SF2 helicases, the major contacts are thought to be with the phosphodiester backbone through ionic interactions with the helicase protein; however, based on the recently solved XPD-DNA crystal structure and biochemical characterization of site-directed mutants, it was speculated that certain aromatic residues near the Fe-S domain of the SF2 helicase could be involved in stacking interactions with DNA bases (16Kuper J.

In addition to the DNA repair helicases, ringlike helicases operate at the replication fork to mediate unwinding of the parental duplex to provide the single-stranded DNA template for DNA synthesis by the polymerase. In E. coli, the SF4 DNA helicase DnaB unwinds forked duplex DNA substrates by translocating 5′ to 3′ with respect to the strand that the hexameric helicase is bound to with the unwound 3′ single strand extruded outside the central channel of the protein (19Kaplan D.L. The 3′-tail of a forked duplex sterically determines whether one or two DNA strands pass through the central channel of a replication fork helicase.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes (20Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The Mcm complex. Unwinding the mechanism of a replicative helicase.Microbiol. Mol.

Microbiol. 2009; 72: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), MCM, belonging to the AAA+ SF of ATPases, is the replicative ringlike helicase that unwinds duplex DNA with a 3′ to 5′ polarity. A significant area of interest in cellular replication of damaged DNA is the signaling mechanism established by uncoupling of the replicative helicase duplex unwinding at the replication fork from DNA polymerase synthesis, which can be delayed or blocked by a base or sugar phosphate backbone lesion (22Forsburg S.L. The MCM helicase. Linking checkpoints to the replication fork.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mechanistic and biological aspects of helicase action on damaged DNA has become a topic of considerable interest (23Suhasini A.N. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mechanistic and biological aspects of helicase action on damaged DNA.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2317-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, there has been no previous report on the biochemical effect of sugar phosphate backbone alkylation damage on the unwinding reaction catalyzed by a DNA helicase. Given the potential mutagenic and carcinogenic consequences of such lesions, we thought that it was important to evaluate the impact of a defined alkyl modification on helicase function. In this study, we have investigated the effects of a single isopropyl PTE (Scheme 1) specifically positioned in the helicase-translocating or -nontranslocating strand within the double-stranded region of a forked duplex DNA substrate. A comparison of a SF1 DNA repair helicase (UvrD), SF2 helicases (RecQ, RECQ1, WRN, BLM, FANCJ, and ChlR1), and replicative helicases (MCM and DnaB) demonstrates unique differences in the effect of the PTE on the DNA unwinding reactions catalyzed by these enzymes. Our results are discussed in light of the current models for DNA unwinding by these helicases that are likely to encounter PTEs during biological DNA transactions.

Unless specified otherwise, DNA unwinding reactions were initiated by the addition of helicase and incubated for 15 min. Reactions were quenched with the addition of 20 μl of 2× Stop buffer (17.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol). A 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand was included in the quench to prevent reannealing. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on non-denaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated by using the formula, % Unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with S.D. values shown by error bars. For helicase sequestration studies, RECQ1 (7.8 nm) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations (0–12.5 nm) of the specified unlabeled forked duplex competitor DNA molecule harboring an isopropyl PTE lesion in either the top strand, bottom strand, or neither strand in standard helicase reaction buffer in the presence of ATP (2 mm) for 3 min at 30 °C. Ten fmol of radiolabeled forked 19-bp duplex molecules (tracker substrate (35Gupta R. Sharma S. Doherty K.M. Sommers J.A. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M. Inhibition of BACH1 (FANCJ) helicase by backbone discontinuity is overcome by increased motor ATPase or length of loading strand.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) was subsequently added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 7 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as described above. The percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated as described above. Typically, 90% of the tracker substrate was unwound in reactions lacking competitor DNA molecule. Helicase data (percentage of control) were expressed relative to the control reactions lacking the competitor DNA. The DNA substrates used for this study are composed of specifically designed oligonucleotides that contain a single isopropyl PTE lesion (Scheme 1) positioned in either the top or bottom strand within the duplex region of a forked duplex substrate (Table 1). There are 12 bp residing between the 19-nucleotide single-stranded tails and the site of the PTE and 12 bp residing between the PTE and blunt duplex DNA end on the opposite end of the forked duplex substrate. As a control, a forked duplex of identical sequence without any modification in either strand was tested for DNA unwinding by various helicases. The DNA helicases examined in this study are listed in Table 2. The two replication fork helicases (MCM and DnaB) are hexameric ringlike helicases with opposite polarities of translocation. The SF2 RecQ helicases studied are human RECQ1, BLM, and WRN as well as E. coli RecQ. For comparison, we examined the SF1 E. coli helicase UvrD, which has the same polarity (3′ to 5′) as the RecQ helicases. Finally, we tested two SF2 Fe-S cluster helicases, FANCJ and ChlR1, which unwind with a 5′ to 3′ polarity. Unless stated otherwise, the helicase reactions were initiated by the addition of helicase enzyme to the DNA substrate reaction mixture containing ATP. Reaction conditions (temperature, salt, and pH) were used that had been previously shown to be optimal for DNA unwinding by the helicase under investigation and are described under “Experimental Procedures.”TABLE 2Helicases examined in this studya See “Discussion” for details and references.b Evidence for multiple assembly states. Open table in a new tab a See “Discussion” for details and references. b Evidence for multiple assembly states. Initially, we tested the human 3′ to 5′ RECQ1 helicase on a set of DNA fork substrates (Table 1) containing an isopropyl PTE backbone modification positioned in either the top (nontranslocating) or bottom (translocating) strand. The control undamaged DNA substrate or substrate with PTE damage in the top strand (PTE-C) was unwound by RECQ1 in a protein concentration-dependent manner throughout a titration range of 0.03–17.6 nm RECQ1 monomer (Fig. 1, A and B). Eighty percent of substrate was unwound at 5 nm RECQ1. At higher concentrations of RECQ1, more substrate was unwound; however, the percentage of unwinding began to plateau, presumably due to substrate depletion effects. Significantly lower RECQ1 helicase unwinding was observed for the forked duplex substrate containing the isopropyl PTE damage in the bottom (translocating) strand (PTE-B) compared with the forked duplex substrate with the alkyltriester lesion in the top strand or control DNA substrate without any damage. For instance, only 28% of the substrate with the PTE lesion in the translocating stand was unwound at 5 nm RECQ1 compared with ∼85% of the control substrate or substrate with the PTE in the top (nontranslocating) strand. Quantitation of helicase product unwound at the lower RECQ1 protein concentrations (Fig. 1B, inset) showed a modest inhibition of RECQ1 by the PTE in the nontranslocating strand; however, it was evident that this inhibition could be overcome by higher RECQ1 protein concentrations. To further examine the effect of the PTE lesion on RECQ1 helicase activity, we performed a kinetic analysis using the same concentration of DNA substrate (0.5 nm) as that used for the RECQ1 protein titration experiments but a fixed RECQ1 concentration of 18 nm (Fig. 1C). Initial rates of DNA unwinding were determined through 3 min of incubation. This rate analysis demonstrated that RECQ1 helicase activity was reduced ∼5-fold by the translocating strand lesion compared with the control substrate and less than 2-fold by the nontranslocating strand lesion (Fig. 1D). The greater but still incomplete inhibition of RECQ1 helicase activity by the PTE damage when the lesion was positioned in the translocating strand suggested that the multiturnover conditions may provide RECQ1 the opportunity to overcome the obstacle and unwind the entire duplex. To disfavor this situation, we increased the DNA substrate 10-fold (final concentration 5 nm) and kept the RECQ1 protein concentration (18 nm) the same (Fig. 1E). RECQ1 and DNA substrate were preincubated for 3 min at 24 °C, followed by the simultaneous addition of ATP and a large excess of dT120 (500 nm) to dissuade excess RECQ1 molecules from loading on to forked duplex substrates that were only partially unwound by RECQ1 during the course of the 40-s reaction time. Under these conditions, we observed for all three substrates that there was an increase in product as a function of time throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig. 1F). RECQ1 unwound significantly less of the DNA substrate with the PTE lesion in the translocating strand compared with the control undamaged substrate. The substrate with the nontranslocating strand PTE was unwound slightly less efficiently than the control substrate, consistent with the rate analysis (Fig. 1D) and RECQ1 protein titration data (Fig. 1B). The stronger inhibition of RECQ1 helicase activity by a PTE lesion in the translocating strand suggested that during unwinding, RECQ1 might become sequestered. To address this issue, protein trapping experiments were performed to evaluate if RECQ1 was sequestered differentially during unwinding of DNA molecules containing the isopropyl triester linkage in the translocating versus nontranslocating strand. If sequestration of RECQ1 occurs by the PTE damage, preincubation of RECQ1 in the presence of ATP and the unlabeled DNA substrate containing the PTE lesion in the translocating strand should trap the RECQ1 helicase and prevent it from unwinding a radiolabeled control forked duplex tracker substrate subsequently added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 2A). Increasing concentrations of unlabeled forked duplex molecules containing the PTE in the translocating strand, nontranslocating strand, or neither strand were preincubated with RECQ1 (8.7 nm) for 3 min in the presence of ATP, and a radiolabeled tracker DNA substrate was added subsequently to the reaction mixtures. Throughout competitor DNA concentrations of 2.2–12.5 nm, greater inhibition of RECQ1 helicase activity on the tracker substrate was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with unlabeled forked duplex containing the translocating strand PTE lesion compared with the forked duplex containing PTE in the nontranslocating strand or neither strand (Fig. 2B). The greatest difference of ∼3-fold was observed at 5.5 nm competitor DNA. These results suggest that during unwinding, RECQ1 becomes sequestered by the PTE lesion when the damage is on the translocating strand. In contrast, the ability of the forked duplex with the nontranslocating strand isopropyl phosphotriester linkage to sequester RECQ1 was markedly less and comparable with that of the undamaged fork duplex at all concentrations of competitor DNA tested. To determine if the inhibitory effect of the PTE lesion was generalizable to other RecQ helicases that unwind with a 3′ to 5′ directionality, we tested purified recombinant WRN and BLM helicases on the forked duplex DNA substrate series. A WRN protein titration demonstrated that a similarly reduced level of WRN helicase activity was observed for DNA subst"

In contrast to humans and mammals that have a single Kiss1 gene and a single Kiss1r gene, multiple Kiss ligand and receptor genes are found in nonmammalian vertebrates. Their functional relationship, however, is poorly understood. Here, we report that the duplicated zebrafish kiss1r genes have evolved a distinct gene expression pattern, different ligand selectivity, and novel nuclear isoforms. While a single kiss1ra mRNA was detected exclusively in the brain, 5 kiss1rb transcripts were found in many peripheral tissues. Functional assays showed that kiss1ra encodes a receptor activated by both Kiss1 and Kiss2, while kiss1rb encodes a receptor that has a preference for Kiss1. The four alternatively spliced kiss1rb mRNAs encoded 4 truncated isoforms, denoted kiss1rb-derived protein (KRBDP)1-4. When their subcellular localization was examined, KRBDP3 and KRBDP4 were found in the nucleus in cultured mammalian cells and in zebrafish embryos. One-hybrid transcription activation assays revealed that KRBDP3, but not KRBDP4, possesses ligand-independent transactivation activity. These findings highlight how the duplication of Kiss1r genes may facilitate their adaptation of specialized functions. The discovery of a nuclear Kiss1r isoform raises the possibility of novel function of Kiss1r in the nucleus."

Innate immune-activated primary murine astrocytes were assayed for GDNF expression and secretion. Controls were agent vehicle exposure and wild-type mice. Rank order for up to 10-fold selectively increased GDNF expression was activators of TLR3 > TLR2 or TLR4 > TLR9. TLR3 activator-stimulated GDNF expression was selectively JNK-dependent, followed cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, was coincident with membranous PGE(2) synthase, and was not significantly altered by a nonspecific COX- or a COX-2-selective inhibitor. Specific eicosanoid receptors had opposing effects on TLR3 activator-induced GDNF expression: ∼60% enhancement by blocking or ablating of PGE(2) receptor subtype 1 (EP1), ∼30% enhancement by activating PGF(2α) receptor or thromboxane receptor, or ∼15% enhancement by activating EP4. These results demonstrate functionally antagonistic eicosanoid receptor subtype regulation of innate immunity-induced astrocyte GDNF expression and suggest that selective inhibition of EP1 signaling might be a means to augment astrocyte GDNF secretion in the context of innate immune activation in diseased regions of brain in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2077600223,"Background The mechanisms by which smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular disease risk are unclear. We evaluated longitudinal changes in carotid intima-media thickness among current smokers enrolled in a prospective, randomized smoking cessation clinical trial. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5 smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and underwent carotid ultrasonography with carotid intima-media thickness measurement. Subjects were classified as continuously abstinent (biochemically confirmed abstinence at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years post-quit attempt), intermittently abstinent (reported smoking at one of the three time points), or smoked continuously (reported smoking at all three time points). The primary endpoint was the absolute change (mm) in carotid intima-media thickness (ΔCIMTmax) before randomization and 3 years after the target quit date. Pearson correlations were calculated and multivariable regression models (controlling for baseline CIMTmax and research site) were analyzed. Among 795 subjects (45.2±10.6 years old, 58.5% female), 189 (23.8%) were continuously abstinent, 373 (46.9%) smoked continuously, and 233 (29.3%) were abstinent intermittently. There was a greater increase in carotid intima-media thickness among subjects who were continuously abstinent than among those who smoked continuously (p = 0.020), but not intermittently (p = 0.310). Antihypertensive medication use (p = 0.001) and research site (p<0.001) independently predicted ΔCIMTmax – not smoking status. The greatest increase in carotid intima-media thickness among continuous abstainers was related to increases in body-mass index (p = 0.043). Conclusions/Significance Smoking status did not independently predict ΔCIMTmax; increasing body-mass index and antihypertensive medication use were the most important independent predictors. The rapid reduction in cardiovascular disease events observed with smoking cessation is unlikely to be mediated by changes in subclinical atherosclerosis burden.

https://openalex.org/W2022145625,"F. Sherwood (“Sherry”) Rowland died on 10 March at age 84. He was a distinguished scientist, first in physical chemistry and radiochemistry as a hot-atom chemist and later as an atmospheric chemist ([ 1 ][1]). He was also famous for his leadership in discovering and publicizing the danger to the ozone layer posed by continued human release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

The research that led Sherry Rowland to become a public figure began with curiosity. In the early 1970s, CFCs were an industrial success story as near-ideal refrigerants and as propellants in many aerosol-spray products. At a 1972 Atomic Energy Commission conference, Rowland heard that James Lovelock had detected CFC-11 in air over the North and South Atlantic Ocean. Rowland wondered what would eventually happen to this synthetic chemical in the atmosphere. In 1973, one of us (M.J.M.) joined Rowland at the University of California (UC) at Irvine. As chemists, Rowland and Molina knew that CFCs had been designed to be inert and nonsoluble and were, thus, unlikely to be decomposed by common atmospheric processes. However, they realized from laboratory data and chemical insight that the CFCs would be decomposed by ultraviolet light (wavelengths below 220 nm) in the upper atmosphere, above much of the ozone layer.

Rowland and Molina continued their detective work, asking what would become of the fragments of CFCs: carbon, chlorine, and fluorine atoms. They discovered that chlorine attacks ozone catalytically and that continued release of CFCs into the atmosphere could destroy substantial amounts of the global ozone layer. After confirming that there were no errors in the calculations, they publicized these results at a press conference in September 1974, soon after their first paper on the topic was published. In his many subsequent interviews and public appearances, Rowland was unfailingly polite and clear, and he never exaggerated. Consequently, his credibility grew.

A great deal of media and public attention in CFCs ensued, especially between 1974 and 1978, including hearings in state legislatures, city councils, and the U.S. Congress. While Cicerone and Molina testified at a number of these hearings, Rowland was particularly generous with his time when asked for comments or advice by legislators who were considering laws or regulations concerning the production, sale, and distribution of CFCs.

During this time of intense public debate, Rowland and Molina discovered a complication to the originally proposed chemical mechanism by which chlorine would destroy ozone: It became clear that chlorine nitrate would form in the atmosphere, thereby linking reactions of chlorine oxides and nitrogen oxides. This insight led to a brief period of uncertainty about the impact of CFC-derived chlorine on ozone, due to two factors: The three-molecule reaction rate to form chlorine nitrate in the lower stratosphere was not known with sufficient accuracy, and the mathematical techniques in use at the time in some mathematical models were unsuitable. Both issues were resolved within a few months. It was extremely important that this modification to the originally proposed reaction scheme was introduced by Rowland and a colleague (M.J.M), not by a critic of the theory.

By the time the Antarctic ozone hole was discovered in 1985, Rowland had already raised the idea that hydrogen chloride and chlorine nitrate were unlikely to undergo only gas-phase reactions; laboratory studies had shown them to be “sticky,” surface-reactive chemicals. Later, surface reactions of these two chlorine-containing species were shown to be responsible for releasing active chlorine into the Antarctic stratosphere and destroying ozone.

In many public appearances, Rowland presented his case that continued use of CFCs would greatly diminish the ozone layer, thereby increasing the intensity of biologically damaging ultraviolet light at Earth's surface. He was always up-to-date scientifically, and he showed his data: Those who opposed him had few easy opportunities to discredit him. He also became very active in evaluating atmospheric ozone data, searching for the predicted decreasing trends. With his students, including one of us (D.R.B.), he published analyses of air samples from all over the word, showing that atmospheric methane concentrations were rising.

Sherry Rowland contributed enormously to the public understanding and credibility of science. Along the way, he was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993 to 1994); the AAAS building reflects his work with its designers. He insisted on a human-friendly design and no CFC-based refrigerants. He also served as foreign secretary of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1994 to 2002), was instrumental in starting the field of atmospheric chemistry, and was a founding faculty member of UC Irvine. In 1995, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (with Paul J. Crutzen and Mario J. Molina). His many friends treasured his affinity for operatic music, his interest in sports (he had played semiprofessional baseball and basketball), and his occasionally memorable jokes.

Sherry Rowland's engaging personality was obvious, but nowhere more so than in a tense 1986 U.S. Senate hearing. Asked what he would do, if he were king, about the widespread usage of CFCs in light of their threat to stratospheric ozone, he replied, turning to his wife, Joan: “I would ask the queen.”
