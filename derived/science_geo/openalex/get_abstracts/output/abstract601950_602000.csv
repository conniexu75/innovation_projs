https://openalex.org/W2776526327,"Background Colorectal cancers (CRCs) expressing programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have poor prognosis. In the multicohort KEYNOTE-028 trial, the anti–PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab was evaluated in 20 PD-L1–positive advanced solid tumors. Herein, we report results for the advanced CRC cohort. Methods Patients with advanced, treatment-resistant PD-L1–positive carcinoma of the colon or rectum were enrolled, regardless of microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg was administered every 2 weeks for up to 2 years or until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Response was assessed every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were safety and overall response rate by investigator review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Data cutoff was June 20, 2016. Results Of 137 patients with CRC and samples evaluable for PD-L1 expression, 33 (24%) had PD-L1–positive tumors, of which 23 were enrolled. Median follow-up was 5.3 months, and 8 patients (35%) reported treatment-related adverse events (AEs), most commonly fatigue (n = 3, 13%), stomatitis (n = 2, 9%), and asthenia (n = 2, 9%). One patient (4%) experienced grade 4 treatment-related increased blood bilirubin. No grade 3 AEs, discontinuations, or deaths were attributed to treatment. Most patients (n = 15, 65%) experienced progressive disease. One partial response occurred in a patient (4%) with MSI-high CRC. Conclusion Pembrolizumab demonstrated a favorable safety profile in advanced PD-L1–positive CRC. Antitumor activity was observed in a single patient with MSI-high CRC, warranting further evaluation in this patient population. (Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT02054806)"
https://openalex.org/W2776868171,"Assembled tau can transfer between cells and seed the aggregation of soluble tau. This process is thought to underlie the amplification and propagation of tau inclusions throughout the brain in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the mechanisms involved may provide strategies for limiting assembled tau propagation. Here, we sought to determine how assembled tau seeds gain access to the cytosol and whether this access triggers cellular defenses. We show that tau assemblies enter cells through clathrin-independent endocytosis and escape from damaged endomembranes into the cytosol, where they seed the aggregation of soluble tau. We also found that the danger receptor galectin-8 detects damaged endomembranes and activates autophagy through recruitment of the cargo receptor nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52). Inhibition of galectin-8- and NDP52-dependent autophagy increased seeded tau aggregation, indicating that autophagy triggered by damaged endomembranes during the entry of assembled tau seeds protects against tau aggregation, in a manner similar to cellular defenses against cytosol-dwelling microorganisms. A second autophagy cargo receptor, p62, then targeted seeded tau aggregates. Our results reveal that by monitoring endomembrane integrity, cells reduce entry of tau seeds into the cytosol and thereby prevent seeded aggregation. The mechanisms described here may help inform the development of therapies aimed at inhibiting the propagation of protein assemblies in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2777443219,"Empirical research on the bodily self has shown that the body representation is malleable, and prone to manipulation when conflicting sensory stimuli are presented. Using Virtual Reality (VR) we assessed the effects of manipulating multisensory feedback (full body control and visuo-tactile congruence) and visual perspective (first and third person perspective) on the sense of embodying a virtual body that was exposed to a virtual threat. We also investigated how subjects behave when the possibility of alternating between first and third person perspective at will was presented. Our results support that illusory ownership of a virtual body can be achieved in both first and third person perspectives under congruent visuo-motor-tactile condition. However, subjective body ownership and reaction to threat were generally stronger for first person perspective and alternating condition than for third person perspective. This suggests that the possibility of alternating perspective is compatible with a strong sense of embodiment, which is meaningful for the design of new embodied VR experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2779117413,"Aggregation of huntingtin protein arising from expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences in the exon-1 region of mutant huntingtin plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. The huntingtin aggregation pathways are of therapeutic and diagnostic interest, but obtaining critical information from the physiologically relevant htt exon-1 (Httex1) protein has been challenging. Using biophysical techniques and an expression and purification protocol that generates clean, monomeric Httex1, we identified and mapped three distinct aggregation pathways: 1) unseeded in solution; 2) seeded in solution; and 3) membrane-mediated. In solution, aggregation proceeded in a highly stepwise manner, in which the individual domains (N terminus containing 17 amino acids (N17), polyQ, and proline-rich domain (PRD)) become ordered at very different rates. The aggregation was initiated by an early oligomer requiring a pathogenic, expanded Gln length and N17 α-helix formation. In the second phase, β-sheet forms in the polyQ. The slowest step is the final structural maturation of the PRD. This stepwise mechanism could be bypassed by seeding, which potently accelerated aggregation and was a prerequisite for prion-like spreading in vivo. Remarkably, membranes could catalyze aggregation even more potently than seeds, in a process that caused significant membrane damage. The N17 governed membrane-mediated aggregation by anchoring Httex1 to the membrane, enhancing local concentration and promoting collision via two-dimensional diffusion. Considering its central roles in solution and in membrane-mediated aggregation, the N17 represents an attractive target for inhibiting multiple pathways. Our approach should help evaluate such inhibitors and identify diagnostic markers for the misfolded forms identified here."
https://openalex.org/W2780516944,"Reading primary research literature is an essential skill for all scientists and students on science degree programmes, however little is known about how researchers at different career stages interact with and interpret scientific papers. To explore this, we conducted a survey of 260 undergraduate students and researchers in Biological Sciences at a research intensive UK university. Responses to Likert scale questions demonstrated increases in confidence and skill with reading the literature between individuals at each career stage, including between postdoctoral researchers and faculty academics. The survey indicated that individuals at different career stages valued different sections of scientific papers, and skill in reading the results section develops slowly over the course of an academic career. Inexperienced readers found the methods and results sections of research papers the most difficult to read, and undervalued the importance of the results section and critical interpretation of data. These data highlight a need for structured support with reading scientific literature at multiple career stages, and for senior academics to be aware that junior colleagues may prioritise their reading differently. We propose a model for the development of literature processing skills, and consider the need for training strategies to help inexperienced readers engage with primary literature, and therefore develop important skills that underpin scientific careers. We also encourage researchers to be mindful of language used when writing papers, and to be more inclusive of diverse audiences when disseminating their work."
https://openalex.org/W2776018323,"In mammalian cells, bulky DNA adducts located in the template but not the coding strand of genes block elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The blocked RNAPII targets these transcription-blocking adducts to undergo more rapid excision repair than adducts located elsewhere in the genome. In excision repair, coupled incisions are made in the damaged DNA strand on both sides of the adduct. The fate of RNAPII in the course of this transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway is unclear. To address the fate of RNAPII, we used methods that control transcription to initiate a discrete of elongation complexes. Analyzing genome-wide transcription and repair by next-generation sequencing, we identified locations of elongation complexes and transcription-repair coupling events in genes throughout the genome. Using UV-exposed human skin fibroblasts, we found that, at the dose used, a single wave of elongation complexes was blocked within the first 25 kb of genes. TCR occurred where the elongation complexes were blocked, and repair was associated with the dissociation of these complexes. These results indicate that individual elongation complexes do not engage in multiple rounds of TCR with successive lesions. Our results are consistent with a model in which RNAPII is dissociated after the dual incision of the transcription-blocking lesion, perhaps by Cockayne syndrome group B translocase, or during the synthesis of a repair patch."
https://openalex.org/W2777685938,"Framed within Self-Determination Theory, the purpose of the present study was to test the effects of a training program with physical education (PE) teachers. Participants were 21 high school PE teachers (experimental group, n = 10; control group, n = 11), and their 836 students, aged 12 to 16 years. Teachers in the experimental group received a training program consisting of strategies to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction. A repeated measures ANCOVA was carried out for each dependent variable. After the intervention, students in the experimental group significantly increased their scores on autonomy support, relatedness support, autonomy satisfaction, autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and intention to be physically active, as compared to the control group. These findings emphasize the utility of a training program with PE teachers to promote the students' psychological need satisfaction, and hence, self-determined motivation toward PE classes."
https://openalex.org/W2778575859,"To satisfy future demands, the increase of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield is inevitable. Simultaneously, maintaining high crop productivity and efficient use of nutrients, especially nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), are essential for sustainable agriculture. NUE and its components are inherently complex and highly influenced by environmental factors, nitrogen management practices and genotypic variation. Therefore, a better understanding of their genetic basis and regulation is fundamental. To investigate NUE-related traits and their genetic and environmental regulation, field trials were evaluated in a Central European wheat collection of 93 cultivars at two nitrogen input levels across three seasons. This elite germplasm collection was genotyped on DArTseq® genotypic platform to identify loci affecting N-related complex agronomic traits. To conduct robust genome-wide association mapping, the genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium were examined. Population structure was investigated by various methods and two subpopulations were identified. Their separation is based on the breeding history of the cultivars, while analysis of linkage disequilibrium suggested that selective pressures had acted on genomic regions bearing loci with remarkable agronomic importance. Besides NUE, genetic basis for variation in agronomic traits indirectly affecting NUE and its components, moreover genetic loci underlying response to nitrogen fertilisation were also determined. Altogether, 183 marker-trait associations (MTA) were identified spreading over almost the entire genome. We found that most of the MTAs were environmental-dependent. The present study identified several associated markers in those genomic regions where previous reports had found genes or quantitative trait loci influencing the same traits, while most of the MTAs revealed new genomic regions. Our data provides an overview of the allele composition of bread wheat varieties anchored to DArTseq® markers, which will facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of NUE and agronomically important traits."
https://openalex.org/W2780354703,"Chlamydial disease continues to be one of the main factors threatening the long-term survival of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Despite this, large epidemiological studies of chlamydial infection and disease in wild koala populations are lacking. A better understanding of the prevalence, transmission and pathogenesis is needed to improve control measures, such as the development of vaccines. We investigated the prevalence of Chlamydia pecorum infection and disease in 160 koalas in a peri-urban wild population in Queensland, Australia and found that 31% of koalas were Chlamydia PCR positive and 28% had clinically detectable chlamydial disease. Most infections were at the urogenital site (27%; both males and females) with only 14% at the ocular site. Interestingly, we found that 27% (4/15) of koalas considered to be sexually immature (9–13 months) were already infected with C. pecorum, suggesting that a significant percentage of animals are infected directly from their mother. Ocular infection levels were less prevalent with increasing age (8% in koalas older than 4 years), whereas the prevalence of urogenital tract infections remained high into older age (26% in koalas older than 4 years), suggesting that, after mother-to-young transmission, C. pecorum is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection. While 28% of koalas in this population had clinically detectable chlamydial disease (primarily urogenital tract disease), many PCR positive koalas had no detectable disease and importantly, not all diseased animals were PCR positive. We also observed higher chlamydial loads in koalas who were C. pecorum infected without clinical disease than in koalas who were C. pecorum infected with clinical disease. These results shed light on the potential mechanisms of transmission of C. pecorum in koalas and also guide future control measures, such as vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2776254904,"Microbial communities play critical roles in soil nitrogen (N) cycle; however, we have limited understanding of the distribution of N-cycling microbial groups in deeper soil horizons. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to characterize the changes of microbial populations (16S rRNA and 18S rRNA) and five key N-cycling gene abundances involved in N fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA) by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and nitrite reduction (nirS and nirK) along profiles (0-100 cm depth) of different paddy soils from three regions (Hailun, Changshu, Yingtan) across China from north to south. We found that most microbial and N-cycling functional genes significantly decreased with soil depth; however, AOA were enriched in deeper soil layers (20-40 cm). The abundances of microbial and N-cycling functional genes generally decreased by one to two orders of magnitude in the deeper horizons relative to topsoils. The AOA gene abundance was higher than that of AOB in the paddy soil profile, and the nirS and nirK abundances were dominant in topsoil and deeper soil, respectively. All N functional genes except AOA were more abundant in Changshu than Hailun and Yingtan. High abundances and low vertical changes of N-cycling genes in Changshu suggest more dynamic N-transformations in this region. Correlation analysis showed that soil properties and climate parameters had a significant relationship with N-cycling gene abundances. Moreover, the abundance of different N-cycling genes was affected by different environmental parameters, which should be studied further to explore their roles in N cycling for sustainable agriculture and environmental management."
https://openalex.org/W2779111337,"Background Anemia is a global public health problem affecting 305 million school children (SC) worldwide. It has deleterious effects in SC, including lower school achievement due to impaired cognitive development and physical growth, fatigue and poor attention span, and increased morbidity because of reduced resistance to infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anemia among SC attending public primary schools in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A school-based cross sectional study was conducted on a total of 523 SC aged from 6–14 years old. Multi-stage sampling followed by systematic random sampling techniques were employed to select study participants. Data on socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and dietary status of children were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaire through face-to-face interview of children’s caregivers. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was determined by using HemoCue 301+analyser. Stool and blood samples were collected in the school premises, and examined for intestinal and hemoparasites, respectively. Data were entered into Epi Info version 3.5.3 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of anemia. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result Of the total SC participated in the study, 269 (51.4%) were males. The median (inter quartile range (IQR)) age was 12 (10–13) years, and 332 (63.5%) of them were in the age group 11–14 years. About 81 (15.5%; 95%CI: 12.4%, 18.7%) of them were anemic: 56 (69.1%) and 25 (38.9%) of them were mildly and moderately anemic, respectively. Low maternal education (AOR = 2.30; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.78), stunting (AOR = 2.22; 95%CI: 1.30, 3.80), severe food insecurity (AOR = 5.11; 95%CI: 1.53, 17.13), and soil-transmitted helminthic (STH) infection (AOR = 7.13; 95%CI: 3.16, 16.86) were found significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion Anemia among SC was found to be a mild public health problem. It was strongly associated with low maternal education, food insecurity, stunting and intestinal helminthic infection. Focused policies and strategies towards the above factors should be designed to reduce anemia among SC."

Decades of effort to develop direct Ras inhibitors for clinical use have thus far failed, largely because of a lack of adequate small-molecule–binding pockets on the Ras surface. Here, we report the discovery of Ras-binding miniproteins from a naïve library and their evolution to afford versions with midpicomolar affinity to Ras. A series of biochemical experiments indicated that these miniproteins bind to the Ras effector domain as dimers, and high-resolution crystal structures revealed that these miniprotein dimers bind Ras in an unprecedented mode in which the Ras effector domain is remodeled to expose an extended pocket that connects two isolated pockets previously found to engage small-molecule ligands. We also report a Ras point mutant that stabilizes the protein in the open conformation trapped by these miniproteins.

Ras proteins are cytosolic, membrane-bound GTPases that bind guanine nucleotides and are regulated by their nucleotide state: guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–bound Ras adopts a conformation that binds Ras effector proteins with high affinity (8Nassar N.

The nucleotide state is controlled by a combination of slow, spontaneous GTP hydrolysis with accelerated GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins and nucleotide exchange stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors.

Despite intensive efforts spanning more than two decades, no such therapeutic agents have entered human clinical trials, the principal difficulty being that the Ras proteins are intracellular and thus outside the reach of protein-based therapeutics, and they lack an accessible hydrophobic pocket invariably required for targeting by cell-penetrant small molecules. Although Ras proteins do contain a pocket that is capable of binding GTP and GDP, these endogenous cofactors bind Ras with picomolar affinity and are present at millimolar concentrations in the cell, rendering effectively impossible any competition by an exogenously added small molecule. The remainder of the Ras protein surface is relatively flat and hence lacks pockets suitable for high-affinity engagement by small molecules (12Spiegel J. Cromm P.M. Zimmermann G. Grossmann T.N.

These tool ligands should prove useful in biochemical studies of Ras, and they reveal new opportunities for both small-molecule and cell-penetrating miniprotein approaches toward direct Ras targeting. In an effort to develop miniprotein inhibitors of the Ras effector domain, we initiated a screening campaign to identify novel Ras binders, selecting a number of small, conformationally stabilized miniprotein scaffolds that we randomized at a subset of surface-exposed residues. We performed the screens to identify KRas-binding miniproteins using yeast surface display (YSD) 6The abbreviations used are: YSDyeast surface displayaPPavian pancreatic polypeptidePPIItype II polyprolineRBDRas-binding domainSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationSOSSon of SevenlessGppNHpguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphatemant3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)GppCpguanosine 5′-(β,γ-methyleno)triphosphatedPTP2′-deoxy-P-nucleoside 5′-triphosphate8-oxo-dGTP8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphateIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideTROSYtransverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy.

We obtained three screening hits from a library based on the avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP), a miniprotein that Schepartz and co-workers (22Smith B.A. Daniels D.S. Coplin A.E. Jordan G.E.

The particular scaffold that afforded these hits (Fig. 1B) was a 32-amino acid aPP mutant containing eight randomized positions on the outward face of the α-helix. The three hits shared a consensus of identical residues at five of these positions (His-18, Trp-21, Trp-25, Asn-26, and Tyr-29) (Fig. 1C). yeast surface display avian pancreatic polypeptide type II polyproline Ras-binding domain surface plasmon resonance heteronuclear single quantum correlation Son of Sevenless guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine 5′-(β,γ-methyleno)triphosphate 2′-deoxy-P-nucleoside 5′-triphosphate 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy. To further improve the KRas binding affinity of the hit miniproteins, we performed three rounds of directed evolution, beginning with random mutagenesis of the hit sequences followed by YSD at a lower concentration of KRas target. Of note, Round 2 afforded improvements in KRas binding due to two unexpected changes in the sequences: a Y7C mutation and a 9-base pair extension encoding a Pro-Arg-Arg (PRR) extension on the N terminus of the miniprotein, the latter caused most likely by primer slipping during PCR amplification (Fig. 1, B and C). The Y7C mutation was surprising because the consensus residues from the original hits and the mutations from Round 1 suggested that the miniprotein-Ras interaction occurred on the opposite side of the miniprotein from position 7. Wary of a binding mechanism that involved disulfide formation to an exposed KRas cysteine such as Cys-118, which would not be favored under the reducing conditions of mammalian cells, we chose to remove this mutation from our subsequent libraries. For Round 3 of directed evolution, we shuffled the residues from Rounds 1 and 2 at any positions lacking a consensus and then incorporated the PRR extension, affording the 225-3 miniprotein (Fig. 1, B and C). To gain preliminary insight into the binding mechanism of these miniproteins, we tested the binding of yeast-displayed 225-3 to either KRas or KRas premixed with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf, a canonical Ras effector (8Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. The 2.2 Å crystal structure of the Ras-binding domain of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf1 in complex with Rap1A and a GTP analogue.Nature. 1995; 375 (7791872): 554-560https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the Raf RBD led to a decrease in KRas-miniprotein binding (Fig. 1B), suggesting that 225-3 might compete with effectors for KRas. Encouraged by this finding, we sought to biochemically characterize the KRas-miniprotein binding interaction in detail using recombinantly produced miniproteins and Ras proteins containing the oncogenic G12V mutation and bound to GppNHp, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, unless otherwise noted. 225-3 bound to KRas, HRas, and NRas in solution with midnanomolar affinity (Fig. 2A). To determine whether 225-3 bound specifically to the Ras proteins, we tested binding to Rap1a, a GTPase whose effector domain is similar enough to Ras that it can bind the Raf RBD (8Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. The 2.2 Å crystal structure of the Ras-binding domain of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf1 in complex with Rap1A and a GTP analogue.Nature. 1995; 375 (7791872): 554-560https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RalA and Rab25, two other GTPases in the Ras superfamily. The 225-3 miniprotein bound these proteins with an affinity reduced at least ∼100-fold relative to that for KRas (Fig. 2A). To further characterize the KRas-miniprotein interaction, we performed nucleotide dissociation assays using the mant-GppNHp reporter (25John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Kinetics of interaction of nucleotides with nucleotide-free H-ras p21.Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (2200519): 6058-6065https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found 225-3 to slow the rate of dissociation as is the case for Ras effectors such as the Raf RBD (Fig. 2B). This effect was not observed for the N26A mutant, which does not bind KRas (Fig. 2, D and E). To confirm that the 225-3 miniprotein could bind endogenous Ras expressed in human cancer cells, we performed pulldown assays in Capan-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lysates, capturing Raf RBD and assessing Ras-Raf binding by Western blotting. The Raf RBD pulled down Ras, and this interaction was inhibited in the presence of 225-3 (Fig. 2C). Curiously, we found that Ras-miniprotein binding could be detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) when biotinylated Ras was immobilized onto the streptavidin sensor chip and free miniprotein was flowed over it but not when biotinylated miniprotein was immobilized and free Ras was flowed over it (Fig. 2F). To map the specific miniprotein-binding site on KRas, we performed 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy on 15N-labeled KRas(WT)-GDP, chosen because of the availability of published assignments (26Vo U. Embrey K.J. Breeze A.L. Golovanov A.P. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignment for the human K-Ras at physiological pH.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2013; 7 (22886485): 215-219https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of unlabeled 225-1 miniprotein, which was used in place of 225-3 for solubility reasons (Fig. 3, A and B). Comparison of shifted cross-peaks with the published assignments revealed that the residues perturbed by miniprotein binding were clustered at the Ras effector domain (Fig. 3C). In sum, these data demonstrated that the 225 miniproteins bound to the Ras effector domain and competed directly with effectors and that these binding properties were preserved in cancer cell lysates with endogenous Ras. To identify the key miniprotein residues that contribute to KRas binding, we performed an alanine mutagenesis scan of residues predicted to be on the miniprotein surface (Fig. 2E). Unexpectedly, every position we mutated led to a partial or full loss in KRas binding, even for residues on the PPII helix and in the loop. This suggested a more complex binding mode than a simple interaction focused around the consensus hit residues on the α-helix. We subsequently performed 1H-15N HSQC on 15N-labeled 225-1 miniprotein in the presence or absence of unlabeled KRas and found that the number of cross-peaks in the 1H-15N spectrum approximately doubled upon adding excess KRas to the miniprotein (Fig. 4A). This surprising observation could be explained either by (i) the miniprotein having two distinct binding modes, each represented approximately equally in population and in slow exchange on the NMR time scale, or (ii) a single complex being formed but containing two distinct miniprotein-Ras interfaces, i.e. the miniprotein binding as a dimer. In an isolated C2-symmetric miniprotein dimer, each residue would experience an identical environment in both protomers and would thus have a single chemical shift. Upon binding to an asymmetric target such as KRas, however, this symmetry would be broken, and at least some residues would be differentially perturbed, leading to splitting in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. aPP is known to form C2-symmetric antiparallel dimers (23Hodges A.M. Schepartz A. Engineering a monomeric miniature protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129 (17705497): 11024-11025https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 24Blundell T.L. Pitts J.E. Tickle I.J. Wood S.P.

In contrast, a dimeric binding mode was appealing in that it provided a straightforward explanation for the puzzling intolerance to mutational substitution observed in the alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 2E): nearly all the residues contribute either to binding KRas or to stabilization of the miniprotein dimer. It is also consistent with the lack of Ras-miniprotein binding observed by SPR when biotinylated miniprotein was immobilized onto a sensor chip (Fig. 2F): as streptavidin binds biotin with femtomolar affinity, pre-immobilizing a biotinylated miniprotein dimer on a surface with excess streptavidin could wedge apart the two miniprotein protomers in a manner that would prohibit dimerization and thus abrogate KRas binding. The dimer hypothesis also suggested an intriguing explanation for the Y7C mutant that was observed in Round 2 of the directed evolution. Tyr-7 exists at the C2 symmetry point in the aPP dimer (23Hodges A.M. Schepartz A. Engineering a monomeric miniature protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129 (17705497): 11024-11025https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and because the YSD system expresses library members via the yeast secretory pathway (21Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Yeast surface display for screening combinatorial polypeptide libraries.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15 (9181578): 553-557https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it occurred to us that cysteines at this position could be oxidized to form a disulfide bond that covalently dimerized two miniproteins. To test this, we recombinantly expressed the 225-1 Y7C miniprotein (which we named 225-11) in Escherichia coli and found that it spontaneously formed a disulfide-bonded dimer that bound Ras more strongly relative to the same miniprotein reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 4B). The 225-11 miniprotein with selenocysteine incorporated in place of cysteine (27Strub M.P. Hoh F. Sanchez J.F. Strub J.M. Böck A. Aumelas A. Dumas C. Selenomethionine and selenocysteine double labeling strategy for crystallographic phasing.Structure. 2003; 11 (14604526): 1359-1367https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.816348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) formed a diselenide bond that could not be reduced and that bound Ras regardless of the presence of 2 mm DTT, consistent with its significantly greater redox potential (28Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. The redox potential of selenocystine in unconstrained cyclic peptides.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997; 36: 883-885Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the 225 miniproteins bind KRas as a dimer that can be covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond between the two cysteines at position 7. The non-disulfide–linked 225-1 and 225-3 miniproteins failed to afford diffraction-quality crystals with KRas, but the disulfide-linked 225-11 miniprotein afforded a crystal that enabled us to determine the structure of the KRas/225-11 complex to 2.1 Å (Fig. 5A). This structure revealed a disulfide-dimerized 225-11 miniprotein bound to KRas in an extended, open conformational state in which the switch I loop and β-strand 2 of the effector domain are peeled away from KRas by the invading miniprotein dimer, exposing one face of the bound GppNHp nucleotide (Fig. 5, B and C). This structure confirms direct miniprotein binding to the Ras effector domain, which is remodeled to expose an extended binding pocket (see “Discussion”). The dramatic disengagement of the switch I loop appears to be a more open version of the previously noted “state 1” conformation of Ras (29Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R.

A fourth cysteine (Cys71) is not essential for [4Fe–4S] cluster coordination but for catalysis (10Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D.

During the catalytic reaction for the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX, the [4Fe–4S]2+ cluster first gets reduced. This leads to the homolytic cleavage of the SAM S–C(5′) bond and the formation of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. The generated radical then removes stereospecifically one hydrogen atom from a propionate side chain of the substrate to yield 5′-deoxyadenosine and a substrate radical, which in turn leads to the desired decarboxylation reaction (9Layer G.

However, the presence of HemN proteins (also named coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase (CPDH)) carrying the CX3CX2CXC motif is limited to a few classes of bacteria (12Dailey H.A. Gerdes S. Dailey T.A. Burch J.S. Phillips J.D. Noncanonical coproporphyrin-dependent bacterial heme biosynthesis pathway that does not use protoporphyrin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Multiple hemN-like genes encoding proteins of significant amino acid sequence homology were found in most classes of organisms with the exception of fungi and were originally annotated as coproporphyrinogen III oxidase. Recently, the corresponding Lactococccus lactis protein was observed to bind heme and considered to play a role in maturation of the cytochrome oxidoreductase of the bacterium. It was therefore renamed HemW (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). L. lactis HemW (NP_267295.1) displays high homology to Escherichia coli coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase HemN (50% amino acid sequence similarity). Surprisingly, L. lactis HemW did not show CPDH activity in vitro and in vivo (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli HemN, L. lactis HemW is missing 47 N-terminal amino acids and the fourth cysteine residue of the conserved CX3CX2CXC motif (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). E. coli possesses HemN and additionally a HemW-like protein annotated as YggW (NP_417430.1), a protein of hypothetical function. Because of the high degree of amino acid sequence identity of 36% (58% homology) to L. lactis HemW, we renamed YggW to HemW in the present work. Relatedly, the corresponding Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein (WP_003128950) with an amino acid sequence identity of 31% (50% homology) to L. lactis HemW was also renamed to HemW. Similar to L. lactis HemW, the HemWs of E. coli and P. aeruginosa display a truncated N terminus and the conserved cysteine motif lacking the fourth cysteine. A corresponding amino acid sequence alignment is shown in Fig. S1. The only well characterized systems for the insertion of heme into proteins are the different cytochrome c biogenesis machineries (14Kranz R.G. Richard-Fogal C. Taylor J.S. Frawley E.R. Cytochrome c biogenesis: mechanisms for covalent modifications and trafficking of heme and for heme-iron redox control.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73 (19721088): 510-52810.1128/MMBR.00001-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c is involved in multiple electron transport chains. For cytochrome c formation, protoheme IX and the apocytochrome are transported through the membranes of prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Subsequently, a covalent thioether bond is actively formed between at least one cysteine and a vinyl group of the heme. Currently, five different systems are proposed to perform the processes of heme insertion into a c-type cytochrome; these systems differ in their level of complexity and are found in distinct organisms (14Kranz R.G. Richard-Fogal C. Taylor J.S. Frawley E.R. Cytochrome c biogenesis: mechanisms for covalent modifications and trafficking of heme and for heme-iron redox control.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Sporadically, reports on other heme-binding and potential heme-inserting proteins occur in the literature, as for NikA, an E. coli periplasmic nickel protein (15Shepherd M. Heath M.D. Poole R.K. NikA binds heme: a new role for an Escherichia coli periplasmic nickel-binding protein.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17411076): 5030-503710.1021/bi700183uCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (16Hannibal L.

Furthermore, a putative role for the protein Surf1 of Paracoccus denitrificans as a heme a chaperone involved in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) biogenesis was described (17Hannappel A. Bundschuh F.A. Ludwig B. Role of Surf1 in heme recruitment for bacterial COX biogenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1817 (21945856): 928-93710.1016/j.bbabio.2011.09.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, we described the heme-binding protein HemW from L. lactis, hypothesizing that HemW is involved in heme trafficking (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we provide biochemical, genetic, and biophysical evidence that the bacterial HemW proteins are heme chaperones for the insertion of heme b into enzymes of respiratory chains. E. coli HemN and HemW amino acid sequences are 33% identical but differ in two major features. E. coli HemN carries an extra 46 N-terminal amino acid residues that have been proposed to be crucial for substrate binding (9Layer G. Moser J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Crystal structure of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase reveals cofactor geometry of radical SAM enzymes.EMBO J. 2003; 22 (14633981): 6214-622410.1093/emboj/cdg598Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fourth cysteine of the HemN CX3CX2CXC motif is replaced by a phenylalanine in HemW. These differences are found in all HemW-like proteins (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HemW carries CPDH activity, it was first analyzed in vitro. For this purpose, E. coli HemN and HemW were recombinantly produced and purified to apparent homogeneity. In contrast to HemN (18Layer G. Pierik A.J. Trost M. Rigby S.E. Leech H.K. Grage K. Breckau D. Astner I. Jänsch L. Heathcote P. Warren M.J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. The substrate radical of Escherichia coli oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN.J. Biol.

In a next step, in vivo complementation experiments using the E. coli ΔhemN strain JKW3838 under anaerobic growth conditions were performed. Due to the presence of the oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemF, this mutant grew efficiently under aerobic conditions (data not shown). However, in the absence of oxygen, a severe growth impairment was detected. Minimal remaining growth might result from fermentative energy generation or residual HemF activity. Clearly, E. coli hemN (pET3-hemN) complemented the ΔhemN E. coli strain to wildtype-comparable growth, whereas E. coli pGEXhemW failed to restore anaerobic growth of the mutant (Fig. 1). Both results clearly indicate that E. coli HemW does not harbor coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase activity as was also observed for L. lactis HemW (13Abicht H.K. Martinez J. Layer G. Jahn D. Solioz M. Lactococcus lactis HemW (HemN) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in haem trafficking.Biochem. J. 2012; 442 (22142238): 335-34310.1042/BJ20111618Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with heme auxotrophy reported for a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium hemF/hemN double mutant carrying an intact hemW (19Xu K. Delling J. Elliott T. The genes required for heme synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium include those encoding alternative functions for aerobic and anaerobic coproporphyrinogen oxidation.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174 (1317844): 3953-396310.1128/jb.174.12.3953-3963.1992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the deviating N terminus and the missing fourth cysteine residue were responsible for the observed behavior, we constructed a HemW-F25C protein carrying the fourth cysteine and a HemW-HemN hybrid protein carrying the 46 N-terminal amino acids of HemN fused to HemW-F25C (HemWF25C+46N-term). Nevertheless, HemWF25C+46N-term did not show any coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase activity in vitro. In agreement, no complementation of the E. coli ΔhemN strain under anaerobic conditions was observed with any other of the HemW variants. Obviously, additional structural elements are required for efficient HemN activity. Consequently, HemW is not an inactivated potential coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase. For the biochemical and biophysical characterization, E. coli HemW was produced as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3). After anaerobic chromatographic purification and removal of the GST tag by PreScission protease cleavage, an apparent homogenous protein was obtained. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single protein band after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A). The protein had a relative molecular weight of ˜45,000 ± 5,000, which nicely corresponds to the calculated molecular mass for the HemW monomer of 42,584 Da. Approximately 12.5 mg of purified HemW were obtained per liter of culture. To elucidate whether E. coli HemW coordinates an iron–sulfur cluster, the iron and sulfur contents of the protein were determined. For native, purified HemW, no obvious absorption around A410–A425 was detectable in the UV/visible absorption spectrum. Purified HemW exhibited 0.5 mol of iron and 0 mol of sulfur/mol of HemW, and an A420:A280 ratio of 0.04. Consequently, we carried out reconstitution of the obviously labile [Fe–S] cluster via treatment of the protein with iron ammonium citrate and lithium sulfide. After reconstitution, the iron and sulfur content of HemW increased to 3.8 mol of iron and 2.5 mol of sulfur/mol of HemW and an A420:A280 ratio of 0.19. As a consequence, the typical absorbance for [Fe–S] clusters at 420 nm became clearly visible (Fig. 2B). To further characterize the cluster type of HemW, the iron–sulfur cluster of HemW was reconstituted with ammonium [57Fe]ferric citrate, and Mössbauer spectroscopy of 57Fe-reconstituted HemW was performed. Mössbauer spectra were recorded for samples containing HemW. Spectra without further addition revealed one dominant quadrupole doublet (83% of the total intensity) with an isomer shift (δ) of 0.49 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting parameter (ΔEQ) of 1.00 mm/s, which are typical of [4Fe–4S]2+ clusters (Fig. 2C, dashed line). Moreover, a second quadrupole doublet (17% of the total intensity) with an isomer shift (δ) of 1.48 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting parameter (ΔEQ) of 3.30 mm/s was detected (Fig. 2C, dotted line). The solid line in Fig. 2 represents the superposition of the two quadrupole doublets. This spectrum is consistent with a coordination of the iron–sulfur cluster by three cysteine ligands and one potential nitrogen/oxygen ligand. The three cysteine residues are likely the Cys16, Cys20, and Cys23 of the CX3CX2C motif at the N terminus of the protein sequence. The high isomer shift of the second quadrupole doublet excludes an origin from [Fe–S] clusters but reveals high-spin Fe(II) sites with six hard oxygen or nitrogen ligands; the component is therefore assigned to adventitiously bound Fe(II) in the protein, presumably remaining from the reconstitution procedure. However, various attempts to reduce the [4Fe–4S]2+ cluster with different electron donor systems (e.g. sodium dithionite and titanium III citrate with redox mediators) for subsequent EPR analysis failed. In contrast, the [4Fe–4S] cluster of the related E. coli HemN could be reduced at such conditions (18Layer G. Pierik A.J. Trost M. Rigby S.E. Leech H.K. Grage K. Breckau D. Astner I. Jänsch L.

Surprisingly, cyclic voltammetry measurements clearly indicated a redox transition of the iron–sulfur cluster of HemW at around −410 mV (Fig. 3). The potential of −410 mV is in the range of values found for other radical SAM enzymes (20Kuehner M. Schweyen P. Hoffmann M. Ramos J.V. Reijerse E.J. Lubitz W. Broering M. Layer G. The auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster of the radical SAM heme synthase from Methanosarcina barkeri is involved in electron transfer.Chem. Sci. 2016; 7: 4633-464310.1039/C6SC01140CCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this redox potential, both dithionite and titanium III citrate should serve as efficient electron donors for HemW. Obviously, electron donor compounds are prevented from accessing the [4Fe–4S] cluster for reduction; consequently, no radical reaction can be initiated. A similar explanation has been suggested for the [Fe–S] cluster in succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, which appears to be inaccessible for oxidants and toxins (21Rouault T.A. Mammalian iron-sulphur proteins: novel insights into biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol.

NHE, normal hydrogen electrode.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the influence of the iron–sulfur cluster on the oligomerization state of HemW, experiments using size-exclusion chromatography of anaerobically purified and reconstituted HemW and of a HemW variant (C16S/C20S/C23S) lacking the [4Fe–4S] cluster were performed (Fig. 4). For the [4Fe–4S] cluster–containing HemW, two fractions corresponding to monomeric (fraction 16) and dimeric protein (fraction 14) were detected (Fig. 4A). Calibration of the column revealed that fraction 16 for the monomeric protein corresponded to an Mr of 45,000 ± 5000 and fraction 14 for the dimeric protein corresponded to an Mr of 87,000 ± 6000. Interestingly, an increased amount of iron–sulfur cluster was spectroscopically detected at 420 nm for the dimeric HemW species compared with the monomeric form (Fig. 4A, dashed line). Nevertheless, iron–sulfur clusters were also detected in monomeric HemW, which indicated a dynamic transition between monomeric and dimeric HemW. This transition between monomeric and dimeric proteins was tested by rechromatography of the collected separated monomeric and dimeric HemWs in fraction 14 and fraction 16 on the gel filtration column. We observed that rechromatography of the dimeric HemW in fraction 14 resulted again in two equal-sized protein absorption peaks in fractions 14 and 16 (Fig. 4C). However, most iron–sulfur cluster absorption was detected for the dimeric protein in fraction 14. Analogously, rechromatography of monomeric protein in fraction 16 also generated two absorption maxima in fractions 14 and 16; however, the bigger peak in fraction 16 represented the monomeric protein (Fig. 4D). An analytical gel filtration analysis of HemW without [Fe–S] cluster, caused by the replacement of cysteines 16, 20, and 23 with serines in the iron–sulfur cluster binding motif, revealed only one single peak in fraction 16 corresponding to a monomeric protein (Fig. 4B). The HemW-C16S/C20S/C23S variant was subjected to iron–sulfur cluster reconstitution experiment analogously to the wildtype protein prior to these experiments but remained iron–sulfur cluster-free as determined spectroscopically and by iron and sulfur determinations. Obviously, an equilibrium exists between the monomeric and dimeric protein; however, formation of a dimeric HemW is favored by the incorporation of the iron–sulfur cluster. The amino acid sequence analysis of E. coli HemW clearly revealed two binding sites for SAM similar to the radical SAM enzyme HemN from E. coli. Overall, in E. coli HemN, 19 amino acid residues are known from the crystal structure of the protein to coordinate two SAM molecules and one [4Fe–4S] cluster. Of the involved 19 HemN amino residues, 11 (Arg184, Gly113, Thr114, Cys66, Cys62, Cys69, Gln172, Asp209, Tyr56, Gly112, and Glu145, clockwise around the binding site (Fig. S2)) were found to be identical in HemW (Arg138, Gly67, Thr68, Cys20, Cys16, Cys23, Gln126, Asp163, Tyr10, Gly66, and Glu95) and three were found to be homologous (Ile211 in HemN and Met165 in HemW, Phe240 in HemN and Tyr194 in HemW, and Phe68 in HemN and Tyr22 in HemW) when the amino acid sequences of the proteins were aligned. Due to the low amino acid sequence conservation at the C terminus of both proteins, an alignment of four amino acid residues of HemN (Ala243, Ala242, Phe310, and Ile329) did not match the corresponding residues of HemW. This region of HemN is involved in coproporphyrinogen III coordination and most likely represents the heme-binding region of HemW. Only the cysteine (Cys71) and the following residue (Gly70) used to clearly differentiate HemN from HemW proteins were clearly different (Phe25 and Asp24). For experimentally studying SAM binding of HemW, the purified reconstituted protein was incubated with [14C]SAM, and the mixture was passed over a desalting column for the removal of non-incorporated free SAM. Protein-bound [14C]SAM was subsequently quantified using liquid scintillation counting. The control experiment was carried out using BSA and [14C]SAM. The HemW-[14C]SAM complex was eluted in the protein-containing fractions (Fig. 5A, solid line, fractions 1–4). Some free [14C]SAM eluted in the later, small-molecule fractions. In contrast, all [14C]SAM incubated with BSA eluted in the small-molecule fraction (Fig. 5A, dashed line, fractions 6–14). Consequently, SAM binding to HemW was clearly demonstrated. The highly conserved structure of the SAM and [4Fe–4S]-cluster binding site suggested the presence of two SAM molecules. However, due to the unknown amount of already bound SAM in the tested HemW proteins and the unknown exchange rate between bound and unbound SAM, it was not possible to determine the stoichiometry of SAM binding to HemW. The classical radical SAM enzyme chemistry requires the reduction of the [4Fe–4S] cluster and homolytic cleavage of the S–C(5′) bond of SAM with the generation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. HemN usually requires its substrate coproporphyrinogen III for radical formation (10Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D.

However, in the absence of the substrate, residual enzymatic SAM cleavage of usually less than 15% of the reaction with substrate was observed.

The current study aimed to investigate the moderating impact of social support on depression and anxiety of cancer patients and their family caregivers. Methods Gastric cancer patients and their family caregivers who visited a university medical center in Seoul were approached for participation in the study. Fifty-two pairs of adult patients and caregivers participated in the study. Along with demographic information and the physical condition of the patients, such as pre-operation cancer stage and the type of gastrectomy, social support, depression, and anxiety were measured for patients and caregivers, respectively. Results In the first round of analysis, patients’ depression was associated with age, while patients’ anxiety was related to income. On the other hand, caregivers’ depression was not associated with patients’ health and living arrangement. In the second round of analysis to examine the moderating effect of social support, patients’ income and social support were related to depression and anxiety, but the interaction of income and social support was only observed for anxiety. For caregivers, no interaction effects were found. Social support decreased the negative effects of low income status on the patients. Conclusion While the income of the families with cancer cannot be adjusted in the short-term, their experience of social support can be managed by a proper support system. Diverse implications in medical settings are discussed."

Bacteriophage vB_VspP_pVa5 is a N4-like podovirus with an icosahedral head measuring 85 nm in length and a short non-contractile tail. The phage had a narrow host range infecting only the bacterial host, a latent period of 30 min and a burst size of 24 virions per infected bacterium. Its genome size was 78,145 bp and genomic analysis identified 107 densely-packed genes, 40 of which could be annotated. In addition to the very large virion encapsulated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is the signature of the N4-like genus, an interesting feature of the novel phage is the presence of a self-splicing group I intron in the thymidylate synthase gene. A tRNAStop interrupted by a ~2.5kb open reading frame-containing area was also identified. The absence of genes related to lysogeny along with the high efficacy observed during in vitro cell lysis trials, indicate that the vB_VspP_pVa5 is a potential candidate component in a bacteriophage cocktail suitable for the biological control of V. splendidus in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2777381435,"Protein prenylation is a post-translational modification that has been most commonly associated with enabling protein trafficking to and interaction with cellular membranes. In this process, an isoprenoid group is attached to a cysteine near the C terminus of a substrate protein by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I or II (GGTase-I and GGTase-II). FTase and GGTase-I have long been proposed to specifically recognize a four-amino acid CAAX C-terminal sequence within their substrates. Surprisingly, genetic screening reveals that yeast FTase can modify sequences longer than the canonical CAAX sequence, specifically C(x)3X sequences with four amino acids downstream of the cysteine. Biochemical and cell-based studies using both peptide and protein substrates reveal that mammalian FTase orthologs can also prenylate C(x)3X sequences. As the search to identify physiologically relevant C(x)3X proteins begins, this new prenylation motif nearly doubles the number of proteins within the yeast and human proteomes that can be explored as potential FTase substrates. This work expands our understanding of prenylation's impact within the proteome, establishes the biologically relevant reactivity possible with this new motif, and opens new frontiers in determining the impact of non-canonically prenylated proteins on cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2777499021,"We report the results of in vivo studies in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes in which addition of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) to their diet significantly increased their life span with respect to the control group. Furthermore, when nematodes were exposed to the pesticide paraquat, they started to die after two days, but after the addition of EVOO to their diet, both survival percentage and lifespans of paraquat-exposed nematodes increased. Since paraquat is associated with superoxide radical production, a test for scavenging this radical was performed using cyclovoltammetry and the EVOO efficiently scavenged the superoxide. Thus, a linear correlation (y = -0.0838x +19.73, regression factor = 0.99348) was observed for superoxide presence (y) in the voltaic cell as a function of aliquot (x) additions of EVOO, 10 μL each. The originally generated supoeroxide was approximately halved after 10 aliquots (100 μL total). The superoxide scavenging ability was analyzed, theoretically, using Density Functional Theory for tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, two components of EVOO and was also confirmed experimentally for the galvinoxyl radical, using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The galvinoxyl signal disappeared after adding 1 μL of EVOO to the EPR cell in 10 minutes. In addition, EVOO significantly decreased the proliferation of human leukemic THP-1 cells, while it kept the proliferation at about normal levels in rat L6 myoblasts, a non-tumoral skeletal muscle cell line. The protection due to EVOO was also assessed in L6 cells and THP-1 exposed to the radical generator cumene hydroperoxide, in which cell viability was reduced. Also in this case the oxidative stress was ameliorated by EVOO, in line with results obtained with tetrazolium dye reduction assays, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species measurements. We ascribe these beneficial effects to EVOO antioxidant properties and our results are in agreement with a clear health benefit of EVOO use in the Mediterranean diet."
https://openalex.org/W2776338499,"A total of 64 acute gastroenteritis outbreaks with 2,953 patients starting in December of 2016 and occurring mostly in the late spring of 2017 were reported in Jiangsu, China. A recombinant GII.P16-GII.2 norovirus variant was associated with 47 outbreaks (73.4%) for the gastroenteritis epidemic, predominantly occurring in February and March of 2017. Sequence analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid protein of the viral isolates from these outbreaks confirmed that this GII.P16-GII.2 strain was the GII.P16-GII.2 variant with the intergenotypic recombination, identified in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other cities in China in 2016. This GII.P16-GII.2 recombinant variant appeared to a re-emerging strain, firstly identified in 2011-2012 from Japan and USA but might be independently originated from other GII.P16-GII.2 variants for sporadic and outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Japan and China before 2016. Further identification of unique amino acid mutations in both VP1 and RdRp of NoV strain as shown in this report may provide insight in explaining its structural and antigenic changes, potentially critical for the variant recombinant to gain its predominance in causing regional and worldwide epidemics."

The optimum platelet inhibition strategy after such emergency stenting is unknown. We therefore analyzed the outcome of early glycoprotein (gp) IIb/IIIa inhibitor treatment after emergency stenting in acute stroke.Sixty patients with emergency stenting were identified in our stroke unit registry from 12/2010-06/2014 and analyzed retrospectively. All patients were bridged intravenously with the gpIIb/IIIa antagonist tirofiban immediately after the acute procedure until switching to oral aspirin and clopidogrel was performed. For comparison we studied 135 patients with M1 occlusion undergoing thrombectomy without stent implantation or tirofiban treatment in a propensity score-adjusted analysis.In the acute stenting group receiving tirofiban complications with 6 deaths during the hospital stay (10%), 2 reinfarctions (3%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH; 20%) and 5 symptomatic ICH (8%) occurred. Thirty-seven patients (62%) reached a moderate outcome of mRS 0-3 after 90 days. In the thrombectomy group without tirofiban administration the rate of deaths within hospital stay, the rate of ICH and outcome at day 90 were not different.In our retrospective study acute stenting with subsequent gpIIb/IIIa inhibition was not associated with an increased risk of ICH or in-hospital death."
https://openalex.org/W2776295019,"Little is known about the responses of plant roots to filamentous pathogens, particularly to oomycetes. To assess the molecular dialog established between the host and the pathogen during early stages of infection, we investigated the overall changes in gene expression in A. thaliana roots challenged with P. parasitica. We analyzed various infection stages, from penetration and establishment of the interaction to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. We identified 3390 genes for which expression was modulated during the infection. The A. thaliana transcriptome displays a dynamic response to P. parasitica infection, from penetration onwards. Some genes were specifically coregulated during penetration and biotrophic growth of the pathogen. Many of these genes have functions relating to primary metabolism, plant growth, and defense responses. In addition, many genes encoding VQ motif-containing proteins were found to be upregulated in plant roots, early in infection. Inactivation of VQ29 gene significantly increased susceptibility to P. parasitica during the late stages of infection. This finding suggests that the gene contributes to restricting oomycete development within plant tissues. Furthermore, the vq29 mutant phenotype was not associated with an impairment of plant defenses involving SA-, JA-, and ET-dependent signaling pathways, camalexin biosynthesis, or PTI signaling. Collectively, the data presented here thus show that infection triggers a specific genetic program in roots, beginning as soon as the pathogen penetrates the first cells."
https://openalex.org/W2776867814,"The effects of low molecular sugars (sucrose, glucose and trehalose) on the retrogradation of tapioca starch (TS) gels stored at 4°C for different periods were examined with different methods. Decrease in melting enthalpy (ΔHmelt) were obtained through differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Analysis of decrease in crystallization rate constant (k) and increase in semi-crystallization time (τ1/2) results obtained from retrogradation kinetics indicated that low molecular sugars could retard the retrogradation of TS gels and further revealed trehalose as the best inhibitor among the sugars used in this study. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis indicated that the intensity ratio of 1047 to 1022 cm−1 was increased with the addition of sugars in the order of trehalose > sucrose > glucose. Decrease in hardness parameters and increase in springiness parameters obtained from texture profile analysis (TPA) analysis also indicated that low molecular sugars could retard the retrogradation of TS gels. The results of FTIR and TPA showed a consistent sugar effect on starch retrogradation with those of DSC and retrogradation kinetics analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2778517179,"The use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for regeneration of the spiral ganglion will require techniques for promoting otic neuronal progenitor (ONP) differentiation, anchoring of cells to anatomically appropriate and specific niches, and long-term cell survival after transplantation. In this study, we used self-assembling peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules that display an IKVAV epitope (IKVAV-PA) to create a niche for hESC-derived ONPs that supported neuronal differentiation and survival both in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into rodent inner ears. A feature of the IKVAV-PA gel is its ability to form organized nanofibers that promote directed neurite growth. Culture of hESC-derived ONPs in IKVAV-PA gels did not alter cell proliferation or viability. However, the presence of IKVAV-PA gels increased the number of cells expressing the neuronal marker beta-III tubulin and improved neurite extension. The self-assembly properties of the IKVAV-PA gel allowed it to be injected as a liquid into the inner ear to create a biophysical niche for transplanted cells after gelation in vivo. Injection of ONPs combined with IKVAV-PA into the modiolus of X-SCID rats increased survival and localization of the cells around the injection site compared to controls. Human cadaveric temporal bone studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of a transmastoid surgical approach for clinical intracochlear injection of the IKVAV-PA/ONP combination. Combining stem cell transplantation with injection of self-assembling PA gels to create a supportive niche may improve clinical approaches to spiral ganglion regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2950651348,"Red hair is associated in women with pain sensitivity. This medical condition, and perhaps others, seems facilitated by the combination of being red-haired and female. We tested this hypothesis by questioning a large sample of Czech and Slovak respondents about the natural redness and darkness of their hair, their natural eye color, their physical and mental health (24 categories), and other personal attributes (height, weight, number of children, lifelong number of sexual partners, frequency of smoking). Red-haired women did worse than other women in ten health categories and better in only three, being particularly prone to colorectal, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. Red-haired men showed a balanced pattern, doing better than other men in three health categories and worse in three. Number of children was the only category where both male and female redheads did better than other respondents. We also confirmed earlier findings that red hair is naturally more frequent in women than in men. Of the 'new' hair and eye colors, red hair diverges the most from the ancestral state of black hair and brown eyes, being the most sexually dimorphic variant not only in population frequency but also in health status. This divergent health status may have one or more causes: direct effects of red hair pigments (pheomelanins) or their by-products; effects of other genes that show linkage with genes involved in pheomelanin production; excessive prenatal exposure to estrogen (which facilitates expression of red hair during fetal development and which, at high levels, may cause health problems later in life); evolutionary recentness of red hair and corresponding lack of time to correct negative side effects; or genetic incompatibilities associated with the allele Val92Met, which seems to be of Neanderthal origin and is one of the alleles that can cause red hair."
https://openalex.org/W2776977260,"Fisheries bycatch is a widespread and serious issue that leads to declines of many important and threatened marine species. However, documenting the distribution, abundance, population trends and threats to sparse populations of marine species is often beyond the capacity of developing countries because such work is complex, time consuming and often extremely expensive. We have developed a flexible tool to document spatial distribution and population trends for dugongs and other marine species in the form of an interview questionnaire supported by a structured data upload sheet and a comprehensive project manual. Recognising the effort invested in getting interviewers to remote locations, the questionnaire is comprehensive, but low cost. The questionnaire has already been deployed in 18 countries across the Indo-Pacific region. Project teams spent an average of USD 5,000 per country and obtained large data sets on dugong distribution, trends, catch and bycatch, and threat overlaps. Findings indicated that >50% of respondents had never seen dugongs and that 20% had seen a single dugong in their lifetimes despite living and fishing in areas of known or suspected dugong habitat, suggesting that dugongs occurred in low numbers. Only 3% of respondents had seen mother and calf pairs, indicative of low reproductive output. Dugong hunting was still common in several countries. Gillnets and hook and line were the most common fishing gears, with the greatest mortality caused by gillnets. The questionnaire has also been used to study manatees in the Caribbean, coastal cetaceans along the eastern Gulf of Thailand and western Peninsular Malaysia, and river dolphins in Peru. This questionnaire is a powerful tool for studying distribution and relative abundance for marine species and fishery pressures, and determining potential conservation hotspot areas. We provide the questionnaire and supporting documents for open-access use by the scientific and conservation communities."

Our findings may have potential general utility for perturbing actin-mediated cellular activities and biological processes. Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is an integral aspect of many fundamental cellular activities (for example, cell migration and cell proliferation) and therefore crucial for the regulation of biological processes that rely on actin-based events, whether physiological or pathological. Actin cytoskeletal remodeling is regulated by orchestrated actions of a wide range of actin-binding proteins. One of the key players in the regulation of actin polymerization is profilin 1 (Pfn1), 3The abbreviations used are: PfnprofilinECendothelial cellGSTglutathione S-transferaseC1compound 1SARstructure–activity relationshipVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorPLAproximity ligation assayPLPpolyprolineVSMCvascular smooth muscle cellECMextracellular matrixN.A.numerical aperture. a ubiquitously expressed member of the Pfn family of actin monomer–binding proteins. Pfn1 inhibits nucleation and elongation of actin filaments at the pointed end but promotes barbed end elongation of filamentous actin through collaboration with various polyproline domain–containing promoters of actin nucleation and elongating factors. Pfn1 also stimulates actin polymerization through its ability to promote ADP-to-ATP exchange on monomeric actin (reviewed in Ref. 1Ding Z. Bae Y.H. Roy P. Molecular insights on context-specific role of profilin-1 in cell migration.Cell Adh. Migr. 2012; 6 (23076048): 442-44910.4161/cam.21832Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence in the literature that Pfn1 plays an important role in cell migration. With the exception of certain cancer cells, in most physiological contexts, either loss of Pfn1 expression or disruption of the actin-binding ability of Pfn1 is generally associated with defects in membrane protrusion (the initiating event of cell migration that is primarily driven by actin polymerization) and slower cell migration (2Ding Z.

Collectively, these findings demonstrate the important role of Pfn1 in various actin-dependent cellular functions, further begging the question whether some of these cellular functions are susceptible to chemical inhibition of Pfn1 function. However, currently no inhibitor of Pfn1 function exists. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Pfn1–actin interaction is susceptible to small-molecule inhibition. Guided by structure-based virtual screening of small-molecule libraries, we identified two compounds with similar chemical structures that are capable of reversing the effect of Pfn1 on actin polymerization in vitro. As a further proof-of-concept test for the cellular effects of these compounds, our experiments in endothelial cells (ECs) demonstrated that treatment of these compounds led to attenuation of cellular Pfn1–actin interaction, slower migration and proliferation, and prominent suppression of the angiogenic activity of ECs. profilin endothelial cell glutathione S-transferase compound 1 structure–activity relationship vascular endothelial growth factor proximity ligation assay polyproline vascular smooth muscle cell extracellular matrix numerical aperture.

The most critical actin residue of the Pfn1–actin structure, as determined by an analysis of PDB code 2BTF, is Y169 of actin, which forms a hydrogen bond with the His-119 residue of Pfn1. Consistent with the computational analysis, the H119E mutant of Pfn1, which eliminates this bond, loses affinity to actin (14Ezezika O.C. Younger N.S. Lu J. Kaiser D.A. Corbin Z.A. Nolen B.J.

To expand beyond the limited interactions of Tyr-169, we considered the small pocket on Pfn1 adjacent to Tyr-169 in which the C terminus of actin (Phe-375) buries (Fig. 1B, i). As the Phe-375 pocket in the crystal structure was too small to accommodate a ligand, we simulated the Pfn1 monomer with molecular dynamics and identified structures where the pocket was enlarged (Fig. 1B, ii). Potential interactions with residues in this pocket were identified by docking small fragments (benzene and water) to structures extracted from the simulation (Fig. 1B, iii). The native interactions of actin and the putative interactions identified through fragment docking were combined to construct pharmacophore queries. A pharmacophore represents the spatial arrangement of the essential features of an intermolecular interaction, such as hydrophobic groups and hydrogen bond donors. We generated ten pharmacophore queries, where every query contained a hydrophobic core targeting the Phe-375 pocket and three additional hydrogen bond features selected from five possible interactions. The pharmacophore features used are shown in Fig. 1B, iv, and primarily target the His-119, Arg-74, Asp-86, Leu-87, and Arg-88 residues of Pfn1. Pharmer (16Koes D.R. Camacho C.J. Pharmer: efficient and exact pharmacophore search.J. Chem. Inf.

Matching compounds are aligned to the query pharmacophore, as shown in Fig. 1B, v, and need to be optimized with respect to atomistic interactions with the Pfn1 receptor to be effectively ranked. The steric energy of hit compounds was minimized to identify a locally optimal conformation of the ligand and a predicted binding affinity (Fig. 1B, vi). Ligands were minimized and consensus-scored against an ensemble of Pfn1 structures generated using molecular dynamics to account for receptor flexibility. The top 20 scoring hits after filtering for structural diversity were initially acquired for screening (Table S1 for a complete list and structures of the initial batch of 20 compounds; annotated as C1 through C20). For biochemical screening of the compounds, we performed a pyrene-based actin polymerization assay. This type of assay was used previously to screen a library of chemical compounds to identify inhibitors against the formin family of actin-binding proteins (18Gauvin T.J. Fukui J. Peterson J.R. Higgs H.N. Isoform-selective chemical inhibition of mDia-mediated actin assembly.Biochemistry. 2009; 48 (19764708): 9327-932910.1021/bi901354zCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this assay, Pfn1 reduces actin polymerization by its monomer-sequestering action. Essentially, we searched for compounds that can reverse the inhibitory effect of Pfn1 on actin polymerization but are unable to impact actin polymerization in the absence of Pfn1 (we bacterially expressed and purified GST-tagged Pfn1 as our source of Pfn1 (Fig. 2A)). After screening the compounds, we ascertained that the two highest-scoring small molecules from our virtual screen (identified as compound 1 (C1, 8-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-10-(4-methylphenyl)-2,4,5,6,7,11,12-heptaazatricyclo[7.4.0.03,7]trideca-1(13),3,5,9,11-pentaen-13-ol) and compound 2 (C2, 8-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-10-phenyl-2,4,5,6,7,11,12-heptaazatricyclo[7.4.0.03, 7]trideca-1(13),3,5,9,11-pentaen-13-ol)) showed promise, as demonstrated by recovery of actin polymerization after addition of the compound in a dose-dependent and Pfn1-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). These two compounds, used as racemic mixtures, completely abrogated the inhibitory effect of Pfn1 on actin polymerization at 2.5-fold molar excess compared with Pfn1. In the absence of Pfn1, neither of these two compounds had any significant effect on actin polymerization on their own, further implying that their action on actin polymerization in the Pfn1–actin setting was through inhibition of Pfn1. Mass spectrometry and NMR analyses confirmed the purity and structure of these compounds, respectively (Figs. S1 and S2). Note that compounds C1 and C2 are nearly identical, differing by a single methyl group. For a limited structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis, we performed the pyrene–actin assay with 22 additional compounds (annotated as C21 through C42; see Table 2) that had an identical scaffold to C1 and C2. None of these analogous compounds exhibited comparable activity. The SAR suggests that the hydroxyl of the phenol group that mimics the Tyr-169 of actin (Fig. 1B, v) is essential: moving it to the para position (C32) or replacing it with an ether (C24) abrogated activity, as did other transformations of this phenol (C23–C42). Unfortunately, the commercially available compounds with this scaffold did not support the development of an SAR of other aspects of C1 and C2, other than revealing that the addition of a charged nitro group to the phenyl ring removes activity (C22). Considering the positional importance of the hydroxyl of the phenol group that mimics the Tyr-169 residue of actin, it is also not clear why compounds C7 and C8 (which also contained that feature) failed to show any activity. These compounds differ from C1 and C2 through decorations of the solvent-exposed phenyl group (Fig. 1B, v). This suggests that there may be intra- or intermolecular interactions missing from our model, and further refinement of the model remains an avenue of future research. We showed previously that loss of function of Pfn1 (either by depletion or disruption of the actin-binding function by point mutation) can lead to actin cytoskeletal changes (marked by prominent reduction of actin stress fibers and overall cellular F-actin content), slower migration and proliferation, and prominent reduction in the angiogenic ability of vascular ECs (2Ding Z.

Along this line, another study showed that Pfn1–actin interaction in ECs is stimulated in response to pro-angiogenic growth factor signaling through a specific tyrosine (Tyr-129) phosphorylation-dependent mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of Tyr-129 phosphorylation (which reduces Pfn1–actin interaction to its basal level) reduces VEGF-induced motility and angiogenesis of EC in vitro and angiogenesis associated with tissue repair and tumors in vivo (19Fan Y.

Profilin-1 phosphorylation directs angiocrine expression and glioblastoma progression through HIF-1α accumulation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16 (24747440): 445-45610.1038/ncb2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a proof-of-concept test for the cellular effects of these compounds, we performed a series of experiments in ECs to determine whether some of the above phenotypes can be recapitulated in the settings of chemical inhibition of the Pfn1–actin interaction by compound treatment, as described in the following sections. First, to determine the effects of C1 and C2 on angiogenesis, we performed Matrigel cord formation assays (a commonly used in vitro morphogenetic assay to assess the angiogenic potential of ECs) with HmVEC-1 (a widely used immortalized human dermal microvascular cell line, referred to as HmVECs hereafter) at different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μm) of each of the two compounds. As a control, cells were treated with the vehicle control DMSO. Although there was a general trend of dose-dependent decrease in the cord-forming ability of HmVECs (as measured by the total cord length) in response to either of the compounds, the difference in the cord formation readout between the control and the compound-treated groups was statistically significant only in the 50–100 μm dose range, with the most dramatic reduction (by ˜90%) in angiogenesis seen in response to 100 μm compound treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Depending on the compound, the average reduction in cord formation ranged from 50–80% for 50 μm compound treatment. To ensure that C1 and C2 were not cytotoxic at this high dose, we performed live/dead staining of HmVECs, which showed nearly 100% cell viability even after overnight treatment of the compounds at 100 μm concentration (Fig. 3C), suggesting a lack of any obvious cytotoxic effects of these compounds in ECs. Note that we also performed cord formation assays with four additional compounds (C7, C8, C24, and C29), given that these compounds had the same general structural scaffold as C1 and C2 but did not show any activity in the actin polymerization assay. Correlated with their lack of biochemical activity in the actin polymerization assay, these compounds also did not have any anti-angiogenic effect in ECs, even when added to the culture at a 100 μm concentration (Fig. 3D). The general correlation between biochemical and biological activities (or lack of activities) of the compounds suggest that the core structural scaffold of compounds C1 and C2 alone per se does not confer the anti-angiogenic action, further underscoring the importance of specific functional groups attached to this scaffold for the biological action of the two compounds. Although widely used, the cord formation assay fails to recapitulate the sprouting behavior of ECs from preexisting blood vessels and therefore does not represent the complexities of multicellular interactions that occur during angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, we also assessed EC sprouting from mouse aortic rings explanted in ECM in response to C1 and C2. Consistent with our cord morphogenesis assay results, ex vivo endothelial sprouting (identified by lectin staining) of aortic rings was almost completely impaired upon treatment with either C1 or C2 (Fig. 3, E and F; representative phase-contrast images of the sprouts in control versus C2-treated groups are shown in Fig. S3). Collectively, these data demonstrate the anti-angiogenic effects of these compounds. As a proof-of-principle test to verify that our compounds can actually inhibit the Pfn1–actin interaction in ECs, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to detect endogenous Pfn1–actin interaction with or without overnight treatment of ECs with C2. We found a dramatic 70% reduction in the average number of PLA spots (denotes Pfn1–actin interaction) per cell after treatment with C2 (Fig. 4). These data indicate decreased proximity of Pfn1 and actin, suggestive of reduced interaction of these proteins in ECs resulting from C2 treatment. Note that we also attempted to biochemically verify the ability of these compounds to inhibit the interaction of actin with Pfn1 by either the co-immunoprecipitation method in both HmVECs and HEK-293 cells or a polyproline (PLP) pulldown assay (a method commonly adopted for Pfn1 purification because of the affinity of Pfn1 for PLP sequences) with HEK-293 cell lysate. Unfortunately, these biochemical assays did not reveal any discernible effect of the compounds on Pfn1–actin interaction (data not shown). Possible reasons for the apparent discrepancy in the results between the PLA and biochemical experiments are elaborated under “Discussion.” To further test the effect of these compounds on the actin cytoskeleton of ECs, we performed rhodamine–phalloidin staining of HmVECs following overnight treatment with either of the two compounds (at 50 μm concentration) or DMSO (vehicle control). We observed a noticeable decrease in actin stress fibers and overall F-actin content (as measured by the average intensity of rhodamine fluorescence per cell) in HmVECs in response to the treatment with either C1 or C2 (Figs. 5, A and B), suggesting an inhibitory effect of these two compounds on actin polymerization in cells. Morphometric analyses revealed that the average spread area of ECs was significantly lower in the compound-treated groups than in the control group (Fig. 5C), an observation that is consistent with the inhibitory effect of the compounds on actin polymerization (expected to reduce the efficacy of membrane protrusion and, therefore, cell spreading). The interaction of Pfn1 with actin is an important requirement for efficient cell migration (a crucial aspect of angiogenesis). We showed previously that interfering with the actin interaction of Pfn1 by H119E mutation, which reduces the affinity of Pfn1 for actin by ˜25-fold (14Ezezika O.C. Younger N.S. Lu J. Kaiser D.A.

To determine whether the small molecule inhibitors of the Pfn1–actin interaction have a similar effect on EC migration, we analyzed 2D random migration of HmVECs without or with the compounds at two different concentrations (50 and 100 μm). At both concentrations, C1 and C2 reduced the average speed of HmVECs by ˜30% (Fig. 5D). Next we analyzed the effect of C2 on random motility of HmVEC sublines engineered to stably express either the WT form or the actin binding–deficient H119E mutant of Pfn1 as GFP fusion proteins (the expression of endogenous Pfn1 was suppressed by siRNA treatment; see Fig. 5E). The knockdown efficiency of endogenous Pfn1 in WT and H119E-Pfn1 expressers were roughly equal to 80% ± 10% (summarized from three experiments). The expression levels of WT Pfn1 and H119E Pfn1 relative to endogenous Pfn1 (based on the level in control siRNA-transfected cells) were equal to1.05 ± 0.12 and 0.9 ± 0.16, respectively (summarized from three experiments). As expected, the basal speed (in the absence of the compound) of H119E-Pfn1 expressers was ˜30% lower than that of the WT Pfn1 expressers. C2 reduced the speed of WT Pfn1 by 20% (at a slightly lower efficiency than the parental cell line, which may be due to different affinities of C2 for endogenous versus GFP-tagged Pfn1) but did not reduce the average speed of H119E Pfn1 expressers any further (Fig. 5F). Although these data do not necessarily rule out the possibility of off-target effects of the compound, dependence of a functional actin-binding capability of Pfn1 for the anti-migratory effect of the compound is consistent with a scenario in which the anti-migratory effect of any of the compounds is at least partly mediated through inhibition of the Pfn1–actin interaction. Given that EC proliferation is also an important aspect of angiogenesis and that Pfn1 plays an important role cell proliferation (3Ding Z. Lambrechts A. Parepally M. Roy P.

Our experiments revealed that the average cell counts in response to 3 days of incubation with the two test doses (50 and 100 μm) of C2 were ˜2- and 2.5-fold lower, respectively, than the same in the control group setting (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating an anti-proliferative effect of C2 on ECs. Finally, given that Pfn1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, we wanted to further explore whether C2 has a similar anti-proliferative effect on other types of cells. Therefore, we performed similar proliferation experiments with human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs; we chose this cell type as it is relevant to the vascular system), which also showed robust suppression of VSMC proliferation in 2D culture in response to C2 treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). Although we have not extended these studies to a broad range of cell types, these preliminary findings with VSMCs still suggest that the action of our compound is not specific to ECs only. Pfn is a vital regulator of actin dynamics and cell motility, and, therefore, interfering with the function of Pfn1 could be a useful strategy to pertur"

In the present study we examined the impact of altered poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on early gene expression induced by the microbe-associate molecular patterns (MAMPs) flagellin (flg22) and EF-Tu (elf18). Stringent statistical analyses and filtering identified 178 genes having MAMP-induced mRNA abundance patterns that were altered by either PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) or PARG1 knockout. From the identified set of 178 genes, over fifty Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines were chosen and screened for altered basal defense responses. Subtle alterations in callose deposition and/or seedling growth in response to those MAMPs were observed in knockouts of At3g55630 (FPGS3, a cytosolic folylpolyglutamate synthetase), At5g15660 (containing an F-box domain), At1g47370 (a TIR-X (Toll-Interleukin Receptor domain)), and At5g64060 (a predicted pectin methylesterase inhibitor). Over-represented GO terms for the gene expression study included ""innate immune response"" for elf18/parg1, highlighting a subset of elf18-activated defense-associated genes whose expression is altered in parg1 plants. The study also allowed a tightly controlled comparison of early mRNA abundance responses to flg22 and elf18 in wild-type Arabidopsis, which revealed many differences. The PARP inhibitor 3-methoxybenzamide (3MB) was also used in the gene expression profiling, but pleiotropic impacts of this inhibitor were observed. This transcriptomics study revealed targets for further dissection of MAMP-induced plant immune responses, impacts of PARP inhibitors, and the molecular mechanisms by which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates plant responses to MAMPs."

https://openalex.org/W2777695939,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation is characterized by the downregulation of SMC actin cytoskeleton proteins. Our published study shows that depletion of SM22α (aka SM22, Transgelin, an actin cytoskeleton binding protein) promotes inflammation in SMCs by activating NF-κB signal pathways both in cultured VSMCs and in response to vascular injury. The goal of this study is to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms whereby SM22 suppresses NF-κB signaling pathways under inflammatory condition. NF-κB inducing kinase (Nik, aka MAP3K14, activated by the LTβR) is a key upstream regulator of NF-κB signal pathways. Here, we show that SM22 overexpression suppresses the expression of NIK and its downstream NF-κB canonical and noncanonical signal pathways in a VSMC line treated with a LTβR agonist. SM22 regulates NIK expression at both transcriptional and the proteasome-mediated post-translational levels in VSMCs depending on the culture condition. By qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we found that Nik is a transcription target of serum response factor (SRF). Although SM22 is known to be expressed in the cytoplasm, we found that SM22 is also expressed in the nucleus where SM22 interacts with SRF to inhibit the transcription of Nik and prototypical SRF regulated genes including c-fos and Egr3. Moreover, carotid injury increases NIK expression in Sm22-/- mice, which is partially relieved by adenovirally transduced SM22. These findings reveal for the first time that SM22 is expressed in the nucleus in addition to the cytoplasm of VSMCs to regulate the transcription of Nik and its downstream proinflammatory NF-kB signal pathways as a modulator of SRF during vascular inflammation."

Bulk segregant analysis in a BC3F2 population revealed that ""green revolution gene"" semi-dwarf 1 (sd1) was most likely the gene controlling the tall plant height in RI92. Sequencing analysis of SD1 revealed that an intragenic recombination occurred between two parental non-functional sd1 alleles and generated a functional SD1 in RI92.

https://openalex.org/W2777894125,"Background Recent influenza surveillance data from Africa suggest an important burden of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. In tropical countries where influenza virus transmission may not be confined to a single season alternative strategies for vaccine distribution via antenatal care (ANC) or semiannual campaigns should be considered. Methods Using data on monthly influenza disease burden in women of child-bearing age and infants aged 0–5 months in Kenya from 2010–2014, we estimated the number of outcomes (illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) that occurred and that may have been averted through influenza vaccination of pregnant women using: 1) a year-round immunization strategy through ANC, 2) annual vaccination campaigns, and 3) semiannual vaccination campaigns. Results During 2010–2014, influenza resulted in an estimated 279,047 illnesses, 36,276 medical visits, 1612 hospitalizations and 243 deaths in pregnant women and 157,053 illnesses, 65,177 medical visits, 4197 hospitalizations, and 755 deaths in infants aged 0–5 months in Kenya. Depending on the mode of distribution and the vaccine coverage achieved, 12.8–31.4% of influenza-associated disease in pregnant women and 11.6–22.1% in infants aged 0–5 months might have been prevented through maternal influenza immunization. In this model, point estimates for influenza-associated disease averted through maternal vaccination delivered year-round in ANC or semiannually in campaigns were higher than vaccination delivered in a single annual campaign, but confidence intervals overlapped. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant women against influenza can reduce the burden of influenza-associated illness, hospitalization and death in both pregnant women and their young infants. Alternative immunization strategies may avert more influenza-associated disease in countries where influenza virus transmission occurs throughout the year."

To this end, the current study aims to explore the recent time trends in social patterning of selected non-communicable diseases among Korean adults between 2007 and 2015. Methods Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), temporal trends in socioeconomic inequalities in diabetes, arthritis, asthma and depressive symptoms were assessed across three time points. Respondents were adults aged 20 years or over (N = 47,091, 20,180 men and 26,911 women). Socioeconomic circumstance was assessed based on highest level of educational attainment. We estimated prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation (adjusted for age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical activity) separately for men and women. The magnitude of the inequalities was computed using the relative index of inequality (RII). Results In men, diabetes was not associated with educational attainment, while there was evidence of a negative association in women across surveys. Similar inverse associations were found with arthritis and depressive symptoms, but these associations were less clear for asthma. RII showed a non-significant increasing trend in educational disparities in depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, relative inequalities in diabetes, arthritis and asthma have narrowed. These trends were, in general, more pronounced in women. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate higher burden of selected NCDs among the lower educational groups, particularly among women. In addition, our results indicated some improvements in inequalities in diabetes, arthritis and asthma in recent years. These findings have important implications for understanding the causes of social patterning of NCDs and for the targeting of effective interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2778780256,"Extracellular low phosphate strongly enhances intestinal calcium absorption independently of active vitamin D [1, 25(OH)2D3] signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. To elucidate the phosphate-dependent regulation of calcium transport, we investigated part of the enteral environment that is involved in 1, 25(OH)2D3-independent calcium absorption, which responds to dietary phosphate levels in mice that lack intestinal vitamin D receptor (Vdr) activity. Impaired calcium absorption in intestinal Vdr-null mice was improved by dietary phosphate restriction. Accordingly, calcium transport in cultured intestinal epithelial cells was increased when the apical side was exposed to low phosphate levels (0.5 mM) compared with normal or high phosphate levels (1.0 or 5.0 mM, respectively). Mechanistically, low phosphate increased ATP in the apical side medium and allowed calcium entry into epithelial cells via the P2X7 purinoreceptor, which results in increased calcium transport. We found that luminal ATP was regulated by the release and degradation of ATP at the epithelium, and phosphate restriction increased ATP release from epithelial cells via connexin-43 hemichannels. Furthermore, ATP degradation by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase-1 was reduced, which was caused by the reduction of the MAPK cascade. These findings indicate that luminal ATP metabolism regulates transcellular calcium transport in the intestine by an 1, 25(OH)2D3-independent mechanism in response to dietary phosphate levels.— Uekawa, A., Yamanaka, H., Lieben, L., Kimira, Y., Uehara, M., Yamamoto, Y., Kato, S., Ito, K., Carmeliet, G., Masuyama, R.

Systems designed with several structures are also investigated in many RDT plans. Despite the availability of a range of test plans for different systems, RDT planning for load-sharing systems hasn't yet received the attention it deserves. In this paper, we propose a demonstration method for two specific types of load-sharing systems with components subject to two distributions: exponential and Weibull. Based on the assumptions and interpretations made in several previous works on such load-sharing systems, we set the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the total system as the demonstration target. We represent the MTTF as a summation of mean time between successive component failures. Next, we introduce generalized test statistics for both the underlying distributions. Finally, RDT plans for the two types of systems are established on the basis of these test statistics."

Methods and findings We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the health impact of common preventive health interventions applied to individuals in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We then used those measurements to estimate the health and economic impact of United Community Clinic (UCC), a student-run clinic in Philadelphia, PA.

To identify recent HIV-1 infections, we evaluated and compared the performance of 4 sequence-based diversity measures including percent diversity, percent complexity, Shannon entropy and number of haplotypes targeting 13 genetic segments within the env gene of HIV-1. A total of 597 diagnostic samples obtained in 2013 and 2015 from recently and chronically HIV-1 infected individuals were selected. From the selected samples, 249 (134 from recent versus 115 from chronic infections) env coding regions, including V1-C5 of gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain of HIV-1, were successfully amplified and sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The ability of the four sequence-based diversity measures to correctly identify recent HIV infections was evaluated using the frequency distribution curves, median and interquartile range and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Comparing the median and interquartile range and evaluating the frequency distribution curves associated with the 4 sequence-based diversity measures, we observed that the percent diversity, number of haplotypes and Shannon entropy demonstrated significant potential to discriminate recent from chronic infections (p<0.0001). Using the AUC of ROC analysis, only the Shannon entropy measure within three HIV-1 env segments could accurately identify recent infections at a satisfactory level. The env segments were gp120 C2_1 (AUC = 0.806), gp120 C2_3 (AUC = 0.805) and gp120 V3 (AUC = 0.812). Our results clearly indicate that the Shannon entropy measure represents a useful tool for predicting HIV-1 infection recency."

A total of 53,293 women with a new diagnosis of cytologic LSIL were identified in Taiwan’s national cervical screening registration database. Based on the retrieved clinical management data, the incidence of subsequent CIN3+ lesions was determined, and the hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The average follow-up was 5.02 years. A total of 988 women developed CIN3+ lesions during this period, with an overall incidence of 369.3 women per 100,000 person-years. Cryotherapy and conization/loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) decreased the subsequent risk of CIN3+ lesions in women younger than 50 years (HR 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.64, p<0.0001 for cryotherapy; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27–0.55, p<0.0001 for LEEP). Cryotherapy and conization/LEEP were two significant protective factors for developing CIN3+ lesions, especially in women with biopsy-proven CIN1 (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.82, p = 0.003 for cryotherapy; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.77, p = 0.005 for LEEP). These results suggest that when women are first screened LSIL and lack prior abnormal cervical cytology, cryotherapy should be one of the treatment options. Younger women with a histological biopsy diagnosis of CIN1 were most likely to benefit from cryotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2776521282,"Prioritizing resources for optimal responses to an ever growing list of existing and emerging infectious diseases represents an important challenge to public health. In the context of climate change, there is increasing anticipated variability in the occurrence of infectious diseases, notably climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases. An essential step in prioritizing efforts is to identify what considerations and concerns to take into account to guide decisions and thus set disease priorities. This study was designed to perform a comprehensive review of criteria for vector-borne disease prioritization, assess their applicability in a context of climate change with a diverse cross-section of stakeholders in order to produce a baseline list of considerations to use in this decision-making context. Differences in stakeholder choices were examined with regards to prioritization of these criteria for research, surveillance and disease prevention and control objectives. A preliminary list of criteria was identified following a review of the literature. Discussions with stakeholders were held to consolidate and validate this list of criteria and examine their effects on disease prioritization. After this validation phase, a total of 21 criteria were retained. A pilot vector-borne disease prioritization exercise was conducted using PROMETHEE to examine the effects of the retained criteria on prioritization in different intervention domains. Overall, concerns expressed by stakeholders for prioritization were well aligned with categories of criteria identified in previous prioritization studies. Weighting by category was consistent between stakeholders overall, though some significant differences were found between public health and non-public health stakeholders. From this exercise, a general model for climate-sensitive vector-borne disease prioritization has been developed that can be used as a starting point for further public health prioritization exercises relating to research, surveillance, and prevention and control interventions in a context of climate change. Multi-stakeholder engagement in prioritization can help broaden the range of criteria taken into account, offer opportunities for early identification of potential challenges and may facilitate acceptability of any resulting decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2778202792,"Recent experiments with the bacteria Paenibacillus vortex reveal a remarkable strategy enabling it to cope with antibiotics by cooperating with a different bacterium-Escherichia coli. While P. vortex is a highly effective swarmer, it is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. On the other hand, E. coli can degrade ampicillin but is non-motile when grown on high agar percentages. The two bacterial species form a shared colony in which E. coli is transported by P. vortex and E. coli detoxifies the ampicillin. The paper presents a simplified model, consisting of coupled reaction-diffusion equations, describing the development of ring patterns in the shared colony. Our results demonstrate some of the possible cooperative movement strategies bacteria utilize in order to survive harsh conditions. In addition, we explore the behavior of mixed colonies under new conditions such as antibiotic gradients, synchronization between colonies and possible dynamics of a 3-species system including P. vortex, E. coli and a carbon producing algae that provides nutrients under illuminated, nutrient poor conditions. The derived model was able to simulate an asymmetric relationship between two or three micro-organisms where cooperation is required for survival. Computationally, in order to avoid numerical artifacts due to symmetries within the discretizing grid, the model was solved using a second order Vectorizable Random Lattices method, which is developed as a finite volume scheme on a random grid."
https://openalex.org/W2779686651,"The application of electroencephalogram (EEG) generated by human viewing images is a new thrust in image retrieval technology. A P300 component in the EEG is induced when the subjects see their point of interest in a target image under the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experimental paradigm. We detected the single-trial P300 component to determine whether a subject was interested in an image. In practice, the latency and amplitude of the P300 component may vary in relation to different experimental parameters, such as target probability and stimulus semantics. Thus, we proposed a novel method, Target Recognition using Image Complexity Priori (TRICP) algorithm, in which the image information is introduced in the calculation of the interest score in the RSVP paradigm. The method combines information from the image and EEG to enhance the accuracy of single-trial P300 detection on the basis of traditional single-trial P300 detection algorithm. We defined an image complexity parameter based on the features of the different layers of a convolution neural network (CNN). We used the TRICP algorithm to compute for the complexity of an image to quantify the effect of different complexity images on the P300 components and training specialty classifier according to the image complexity. We compared TRICP with the HDCA algorithm. Results show that TRICP is significantly higher than the HDCA algorithm (Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test, p<0.05). Thus, the proposed method can be used in other and visual task-related single-trial event-related potential detection."

Underlying this reversal were large increases in suicides due to gassing in females and in being overrun in males. During a similar time period (2005–2013), Asian and some Western countries have also observed abrupt increases in suicides due to certain gasses, and the availability of “how-to” information on the Internet about these painless methods of suicide is thought to play a role in their increased use. This study used data from the Federal Statistics Office of Germany to examine current trends in overall suicide mortality in Germany (2007–2015) as well by age, gender, and suicide methods. Also assessed was whether suicides via newly emergent methods are associated with the frequency of corresponding Internet searches using data from Google Trends. Joinpoint regression analyses indicated significant increases in the overall suicide rate (Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) = 2.37%) for females, but not males. The largest annual increases were observed in gassing self-intoxication suicides (AAPC = 13.93%), the majority of which involved carbon monoxide. The increase in gassing suicides was larger in females (500%), compared to males (164%). The frequency of suicides by gassing was significantly associated with Internet searches for “carbon monoxide poisoning” for both male and female subgroups, independent of age group. This study provides the updated suicide surveillance data that are necessary for suicide prevention activities.

Bioinformatic analysis suggested the presence of two heme biosynthetic processes, an Fe-coproporphyrinogen III (coproheme) decarboxylase (ChdC) pathway and an alternative heme biosynthesis (Ahb) pathway, in Haloferax volcanii. PitA is specific to the halophilic archaea and has a unique molecular structure in which the ChdC domain is joined to the antibiotics biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM)-like domain by a histidine-rich linker sequence. The pitA gene deletion variant of H. volcanii showed a phenotype with a significant reduction of aerobic growth. Addition of a protoheme complemented the phenotype, supporting the assumption that PitA participates in the aerobic heme biosynthesis. Deletion of the ahbD gene caused a significant reduction of only anaerobic growth by denitrification or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) respiration, and the growth was also complemented by addition of a protoheme. The experimental results suggest that the two heme biosynthesis pathways are utilized selectively under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in H. volcanii. The molecular structure and physiological function of PitA are also discussed on the basis of the limited proteolysis and sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2776559824,"Measuring the temperature of a sample is a fundamental need in many biological and chemical processes. When the volume of the sample is on the microliter or nanoliter scale (e.g., cells, microorganisms, precious samples, or samples in microfluidic devices), accurate measurement of the sample temperature becomes challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for accurately determining the temperature of microliter volumes using a simple 3D-printed microfluidic chip. We accomplish this by first filling “microfluidic thermometer” channels on the chip with substances with precisely known freezing/melting points. We then use a thermoelectric cooler to create a stable and linear temperature gradient along these channels within a measurement region on the chip. A custom software tool (available as online Supporting Information) is then used to find the locations of solid-liquid interfaces in the thermometer channels; these locations have known temperatures equal to the freezing/melting points of the substances in the channels. The software then uses the locations of these interfaces to calculate the temperature at any desired point within the measurement region. Using this approach, the temperature of any microliter-scale on-chip sample can be measured with an uncertainty of about a quarter of a degree Celsius. As a proof-of-concept, we use this technique to measure the unknown freezing point of a 50 microliter volume of solution and demonstrate its feasibility on a 400 nanoliter sample. Additionally, this technique can be used to measure the temperature of any on-chip sample, not just near-zero-Celsius freezing points. We demonstrate this by using an oil that solidifies near room temperature (coconut oil) in a microfluidic thermometer to measure on-chip temperatures well above zero Celsius. By providing a low-cost and simple way to accurately measure temperatures in small volumes, this technique should find applications in both research and educational laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2777304627,"The degree of vertebral wedging, a key structural characteristic of spinal curvatures, has recently been found to be negatively related to vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA). The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine the relation between vertebral cross-sectional growth and vertebral wedging progression within the immature lumbar spine. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the potential association between increases in lumbar vertebral CSA and changes in L5 vertebral wedging in 27 healthy adolescent girls (ages 9–13 years) twice within a two-year period. Vertebral CSA growth was negatively associated with changes in posteroanterior vertebral wedging (r = -0.61; p = 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that this relation was independent of gains in age, height, and weight. When compared to the 14 girls whose vertebral wedging progressed, the 13 subjects whose vertebral wedging decreased had significantly greater vertebral cross-sectional growth (0.39 ± 0.25 vs. 0.75 ± 0.23 cm2; p = 0.001); in contrast, there were no significant differences in increases in age, height, or weight between the two groups. Changes in posteroanterior vertebral wedging and the degree of lumbar lordosis (LL) positively correlated (r = 0.56, p = 0.002)—an association that persisted even after adjusting for gains in age, height, and weight. We concluded that in the immature skeleton, vertebral cross-sectional growth is an important determinant of the plasticity of the vertebral body; regression of L5 vertebral wedging is associated with greater lumbar vertebral cross-sectional growth, while progression is the consequence of lesser cross-sectional growth."
https://openalex.org/W2778413168,"Progress towards a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of tularemia has been hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding the correlates of protective adaptive immunity and a lack of tools to generate this knowledge. CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against virulent strains of Francisella tularensis, but to-date, it has not been possible to study these cells in an antigen-specific manner. Here, we report the development of a tool for expression of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in F. tularensis, which allows for the study of CD8+ T cell responses to the bacterium. We demonstrate that in response to intranasal infection with the F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain, adoptively transferred OVA-specific CD8+ T cells expand after the first week and produce IFN-γ but not IL-17. Effector and central memory subsets develop with disparate kinetics in the lungs, draining lymph node and spleen. Notably, OVA-specific cells are poorly retained in the lungs after clearance of infection. We also show that intranasal vaccination leads to more antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung-draining lymph node compared to scarification vaccination, but that an intranasal booster overcomes this difference. Together, our data show that this novel tool can be used to study multiple aspects of the CD8+ T cell response to F. tularensis. Use of this tool will enhance our understanding of immunity to this deadly pathogen."

We introduce a new method to compensate for capture bias called BaseNormal that allows for accurate recovery of transcription factor protection profiles from DNase-capture data. We show that these normalized data allow for nuanced detection of transcription factor binding heterogeneity with as few as dozens of sites."
https://openalex.org/W2776343146,"In European countries, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) disproportionately affects migrants from medium- and high-endemic areas and is largely underdiagnosed. To inform policy and improve screening strategies, we measured the timing of CHB diagnosis after migration and its determinants among sub-Saharan migrants living in the Paris metropolitan area (France).The PARCOURS study is a retrospective life-event history survey conducted in health care services in 2012-2013 among 779 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who were receiving care for CHB. We investigated the timing of CHB diagnosis from the time of arrival in France using the Kaplan-Meier method and characteristics associated with CHB diagnosis since the time of arrival in France using discrete-time multivariate logistic regression models.The median CHB diagnosis occurred during the fourth year spent in France for men and during the second year spent in France for women. Among men, the probability of CHB diagnosis increased during years with (versus without) a temporary resident permit (aOR: 1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.2), a precarious accommodation (aOR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.6), and hospitalization (aOR: 7.7, 95%CI: 3.4-15.1). Among women, CHB diagnosis was more likely to occur during years with unemployment (aOR: 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1-3.94), pregnancy (aOR: 6.6, 95%CI: 3.5-12.5) and hospitalization (aOR: 9.0, 95%CI: 2.95-32.3). For both sexes, the probability of CHB diagnosis was higher among those who migrated to France because they were threatened in their country.This study shows that social hardships (residential, economic, administrative) and contact with the health care system after arrival in France hasten access to a CHB diagnosis."
