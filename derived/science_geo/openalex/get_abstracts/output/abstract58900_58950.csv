https://openalex.org/W1997938647,"Theory and data suggest that a male in good condition at the end of the period of parental investment is expected to outreproduce a sister in similar condition, while she is expected to outreproduce him if both are in poor condition. Accordingly, natural selection should favor parental ability to adjust the sex ratio of offspring produced according to parental ability to invest. Data from mammals support the model: As maternal condition declines, the adult female tends to produce a lower ratio of males to females."

The hospital itself imposes a special environment in which the meanings of behavior can easily be misunderstood. The consequences to patients hospitalized in such an environment—the powerlessness, depersonalization, segregation, mortification, and self-labeling—seem undoubtedly countertherapeutic."

Individual vibrissae were carefully injured at birth; 12 to 43 days later, the corresponding barrels proved to be absent. Evidently the sensory periphery has an important influence on the structure of the somatosensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2092481373,"Consistent behavior patterns are created by variable acts, and generally repeat only because detailed acts change. The accepted explanation of this paradox, that ""cues"" cause the changes, is irrelevant; it is unsupported by evidence, and incapable of dealing with novel situations. The apparent purposefulness of variations of behavioral acts can be accepted as fact in the framework of a control-system model of behavior. A control system, properly organized for its environment, will produce whatever output is required in order to achieve a constant sensed result, even in the presence of unpredictable disturbances. A control-system model of the brain provides a physical explanation for the existence of goals or purposes, and shows that behavior is the control of input, not output. A systematic investigation of controlled quantities can reveal an organism's structure of control systems. The structure is hierarchical, in that some quantities are controlled as the means for controlling higher-order quantities. The output of a higher-order system is not a muscle force, but a reference level (variable) for a lower-order controlled quantity. The highest-order reference levels are inherited and are associated with the meta-behavior termed reorganization. When controlled quantities are discovered, the related stimulus-response laws become trivially predictable. Variability of behavior all but disappears once controlled quantities are known. Behavior itself is seen in terms of this model to be self-determined in a specific and highly significant sense that calls into serious doubt the ultimate feasibility of operant conditioning of human beings by other human beings."
https://openalex.org/W1595324604,"Abstract Assay of ornithine transcarbamylase and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I in submitochondrial fractions of rat liver mitochondria shows they are located primarily in the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore during the urea cycle ornithine must pass from the cytoplasm, where it is formed, to the mitochondrial matrix, where it is carbamylated. The resulting citrulline must then pass from the matrix to the cytoplasm before it can be converted to arginine. Osmotic swelling tests show that nonrespiring rat liver mitochondria do not allow the ornithine+ cation, the ornithine zwitterion, or N-acetylornithine to pass into the matrix, regardless of the presence of permeant anions, uncoupling agents, or valinomycin plus K+. However, when state 4 respiration is instituted with succinate as substrate, ornithine+ readily enters the mitochondria if a permeant proton-yielding anion such as phosphate, acetate, or bicarbonate is present. However, the permeant anions nitrate and thiocyanate, which pass the membrane without carrying protons, do not support ornithine+ entry. The respiration-energized unidirectional entry of [14C]ornithine+ is inhibited by respiratory inhibitors, by uncoupling agents, and by valinomycin plus K+, but not by oligomycin. ADP also inhibits ornithine+ entry, presumably by competing for respiratory energy. The driving force for entry of ornithine+ is concluded to be a negative-inside transmembrane potential produced when proton-conducting anions enter mitochondria to relieve the alkaline-inside pH gradient generated by electron transport. It is postulated that the l-ornithine+ cation is transported by a specific electrogenic uniport carrier. This view is supported by (a) the apparent specificity of the system, which transports ornithine+ but not the closely related arginine+ or lysine+, (b) the stereospecificity for the l stereoisomer of ornithine+, and (c) the tissue specificity of ornithine+ transport, which occurs in liver mitochondria but not in those from heart, which cannot synthesize urea. The influx and efflux of citrulline in rat liver mitochondria does not depend on respiratory energy or the presence of permeant anions or cations. Because penetration of citrulline occurs into liver but not into heart mitochondria, it is postulated that citrulline also passes the membrane on a carrier, one specific for certain neutral amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W2047693055,"Rabbit fetuses 23 to 24 days of gestation were injected with either 9-fluoroprednisolone acetate or saline. Three days later the lungs of steroid-treated animals showed a significant increase in lecithin concentration and cholinephosphotransferase activity. In addition, lung slices from these animals incorporated more [(14)C]choline into lecithin. The rise in enzyme activity and [(14)C]choline incorporation was blocked by prior treatment of fetuses with cycloheximide but not by treatment with actinomycin D. It is proposed that the corticosteroids induce de novo synthesis of the lung enzyme, which in turn leads to increased synthesis of lecithin through the choline incorporation pathway. Furthermore, it appears that the site of regulation involves translation of messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1515931336,"The isolated plasma membrane of Acanthamoeba castellanii consists of approximately 27% lipid, 37% phosphoglycan, and 37% protein. About 60% of the protein migrates as a polypeptide of 15,000 daltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The phosphoglycan is resolved electrophoretically into two components which migrate ahead of the major polypeptide band. These three components are also detectable upon electrophoretic analysis of whole amoebae and they do not change in concentration when amoeba homogenates are incubated for 6 hours at 25°. These and other controls support the conclusion that the apparently simple macromolecular composition of the amoeba plasma membrane is not an artifact of the isolation procedure. In some preparations actin is associated with the plasma membranes as a nonmembranous component."

https://openalex.org/W1508892547,"Abstract Reduction of insoluble collagens from bone, skin, and tendon with NaB3H4 produced several radioactive substances which were isolated from acid hydrolysates of the protein. One of these substances, aldol-histidine, was most abundant in cow skin collagen and also appeared in reconstituted fibrils of purified cow skin tropocollagen. Another compound, histidino-hydroxymerodesmosine, was abundant in all of the collagens studied, and it appeared to be structurally related to aldol-histidine. The postulated structures of both compounds were obtained primarily by high and low resolution mass spectrometry and by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Ancillary data were provided by ultraviolet spectrometry and by colorimetric methods. Both compounds were present in partially purified, large peptides obtained from cyanogen bromide digests of insoluble collagen and of reconstituted collagen fibrils. These results suggest that aldol-histidine and histidino-hydroxymerodesmosine serve as cross-links in collagen, potentially uniting three or four polypeptide chains, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1558810341,"Abstract When matrix-free tendon cells from chick embryos were incubated with [14C]proline and then extracted with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol, a major part of the newly synthesized 14C-protein was found to consist of collagen polypeptides which were complete in that their content of [14C]hydroxyproline and their size was the same as that of polypeptides of the precursor form of collagen secreted into the medium. When the cells were incubated with 0.3 mm α,α'-dipyridyl so as to inhibit protocollagen proline hydroxylase and protocollagen lysine hydroxylase, secretion of 14C-protein was inhibited and [14C]protocollagen accumulated within the cells. [14C]Protocollagen extracted from the cells was comprised of polypeptides which were of the same size as polypeptides of the intracellular collagen or about 125,000 as estimated by gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate. In contrast, the small amount of peptide-bound 14C still secreted in the presence of α,α'-dipyridyl was shown to consist of small peptides which were in part derived from the intracellular degradation of [14C]protocollagen. The results demonstrated therefore that in freshly isolated tendon cells protocollagen itself is not secreted. Since the rate of protein synthesis in the presence of α,α'-dipyridyl was the same as under control conditions for about 90 min, the data suggested that the intracellular [14C]protocollagen accumulated in some postribosomal compartment. Extraction of control cells with acetic acid solubilized a large fraction of the intracellular collagen, and amino acid analyses indicated that 40 to 50% of the protein in the extracts was collagen. The protein extracted from cells incubated with α,α'-dipyridyl was similar in amino acid composition, but it contained essentially no hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline and was correspondingly rich in lysine and proline. In addition, 40% of the proline in the protein extract was converted to hydroxyproline after incubation with pure protocollagen proline hydroxylase. Experiments involving limited pepsin digestion provided the first demonstration that intracellular collagen and proto-collagen are largely in a native, triple-helical conformation. After acetic acid extracts from control cells and from cells incubated with α,α'-dipyridyl were dialyzed against ATP, segment long spacing aggregates were obtained. The aggregates were similar to those formed by extracellular, fibrillar collagen except that they had a 130-A NH2-terminal extension which was indistinguishable from that seen in aggregates of the precursor form of collagen secreted by the same cells."
https://openalex.org/W1627308543,"Abstract The effect of epinephrine and glucagon on 14CO2 production from C-1-labeled branched chain amino acids, [1-14C]pyruvate, [1-14C]alanine, and [U-14C]glucose, was studied in isolated diaphragms and perfused hearts. The tissues were obtained from rats fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 hours. Epinephrine (10-4 m) stimulated 14CO2 production from leucine, valine, and alanine by hemidiaphragms of fasted rats incubated without substrate, but not by hemidiaphragms of rats fed ad libitum. The oxidation of histidine was not affected by epinephrine. Epinephrine (10-5 to 10-6 m) stimulated branched chain amino acid oxidation by hearts of fed or fasted rats during perfusion without substrate. The addition of 5.5 mm glucose to the perfusion medium abolished the stimulatory effect of epinephrine on branched chain amino acid oxidation. The addition of pyruvate markedly inhibited the oxidation of branched chain amino acids by perfused hearts, and abolished the stimulatory effect of epinephrine on this process. Glucagon (2 x 10-8 to 5 x 10-9 m) stimulated branched chain amino acid oxidation by hearts of fasted rats perfused without additional substrate. Insulin added to glucagon caused no further stimulation of leucine oxidation. Glucagon did not stimulate leucine oxidation by hearts of fed rats, nor by hearts of fasted rats perfused with glucose (5.5 mm) or pyruvate (20 mm). Glucagon did not affect branched chain amino acid oxidation by diaphragms. N6, O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (10-2 to 10-3 m) was mildly inhibitory. Hearts and diaphragms of fed rats oxidized pyruvate much faster than those of fasted rats. Epinephrine (10-5 to 10-6 m) stimulated the myocardial oxidation of pyruvate and alanine. Epinephrine (10-4 to 10-5 m) stimulated the uptake and oxidation of pyruvate by diaphragms of fed or fasted rats, but diaphragms of fed rats were more responsive to this effect of epinephrine than those of fasted rats. Insulin (1 milliunit per ml) mildly stimulated 14CO2 production from pyruvate by diaphragms of fed rats. Stimulation by 10-5 m epinephrine was greater than that by insulin. In the presence of epinephrine insulin caused no further stimulation. Epinephrine stimulated 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose by hemidiaphragms, but did not affect the uptake of glucose from the medium. 14CO2 production from [1-14C]acetate by diaphragms was not affected by epinephrine. Glucagon (2 x 10-8 m) stimulated 14CO2 production from [1-14C]pyruvate by hearts of fed rats, but not by hearts of fasted rats. Glucagon did not stimulate 14CO2 production from [2-14C]pyruvate. Glucagon and insulin stimulated 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose at high glucose concentrations (16.5 mm) and the effects of the two hormones were additive. The oxidation of pyruvate and that of the branched chain amino acids by skeletal and heart muscles is regulated by the nutritional state of the animal and is susceptible to hormonal regulation by glucagon, epinephrine, and insulin in hearts, and the latter two hormones in diaphragms. The data suggest that in muscles, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is activated in the fed state, and is more responsive to stimulation by epinephrine and glucagon than in the fasted state. On the other hand, branched chain amino acid oxidation by muscles, is more susceptible to stimulation by epinephrine or glucagon in the fasted than in the fed state, and the hormonal stimulation can be suppressed by pyruvate or glucose."

Small, soft discolored testes with cysts in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens regions occurred frequently in the test groups.

The molecular weight calculated from amino acid analysis is 10,700, and the protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 91 amino acids. The protein contains no histidine, and only 1 residue each of tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine are present. It contains no mono- or dimethyl derivatives of lysine or arginine. Fifteen basic residues (Lys + Arg) and 22 acidic residues (Asp + Glu) are present, but up to 6 of the latter may be in the amide form.

https://openalex.org/W1565502008,"Abstract Developmental and aging patterns of pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes (PK 1, PK 2, PK 3, and PK 4) from rat liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle were studied by electrophoretic, chromatographic and immunochemical techniques. During the first 2 weeks of postnatal life a decline of total PK activity occurred in liver, kidney, and heart followed by an increase to adult or higher than adult levels after weaning. Skeletal muscle PK increased steadily from very low levels before birth to steady state levels by the end of the 2nd month. It was demonstrated that changes in enzyme activity during development were the result of changes in the amount of enzyme protein. Both PK isozymes from rat liver (PK 1 and PK 4) decreased during the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. Liver PK 1 sharply increased after weaning, whereas liver PK 4 remained at the level of 3 to 10% of the total enzymatic activity. PK 4, the only isozyme detected in fetal rat kidney, predominated throughout development, although PK 1, PK 2, and PK 3 appeared shortly after birth. A shift of PK 4 to PK 3 occurred in both cardiac and skeletal muscle with passage from the fetal to the neonatal stage of development. Adult skeletal muscle contains only PK 3, which is also the predominant form in cardiac muscle. Antiserum prepared against purified PK 3 from skeletal muscle neutralized PK 2, PK 3, and PK 4 from kidney but did not cross-react with liver and kidney PK 1. Developmental changes in total PK activity and in PK isozyme patterns in rat liver and kidney are discussed in terms of their possible significance in the regulation of gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1550354795,"The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-solubilized proteins of the bileaflet nuclear membrane from rat liver have been fractionated by gel filtration. More than 23 different molecular weight classes of proteins ranging from 160,000 to 16,000 can be distinguished by conventional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polypeptide chains of less than 16,000 were not detected. A triplet, the respective proteins of which have molecular weights of 64,000, 70,000, and 74,000, account for 25% of the total membrane protein, while a second group of proteins in the range of 53,000 to 60,000 represents an additional 21%. The amino acid composition of the individual fractions does not exhibit large deviations from the composition of the delipidated nuclear membrane. A trend was noted, however, in progressing from the high to the low molecular weight polypeptides; the ratio of acidic to basic residues decreased from 1.83 (Fraction A) to 0.92 (Fraction P). The major portion of the membrane phosphorus was separated into two discrete fractions by gel filtration. Ten per cent eluted near void volume and was predominantly RNA phosphorus, whereas 80% eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 15,000 and was entirely phospholipid phosphorus. The bulk of the neutral lipids was also found in this fraction; however, small amounts were also localized in other column fractions. In comparing the phosphorus elution profiles of the nuclear and microsomal membranes, the microsomal membrane did not yield the RNA component. The possibility that this RNA may represent some unique feature of the nuclear membrane, such as the nuclear pore complex, is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1525402057,"Abstract Theory pertaining to the binding of a ligand to a series of noninteracting macromolecular acceptors is developed in detail, and methods are described whereby such systems may be usefully identified and characterized. The theory is applied directly to the binding of α-d-methylglucopyranoside to the jack bean phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A. At pH 5.0, three dimeric types of concanavalin A are possible: homologous dimers of either 2 intact or 2 fragmented monomer units and a hybrid dimer consisting of one monomer of each form. Binding results indicate (a) that a mixture of dimeric types must exist at pH 5.0, some types having one rather than two binding sites per molecule; and (b) that such species must have similar affinity for ligand. A number of models are considered which may explain this binding behavior. It is concluded that hybrid dimers are not present in appreciable amounts. Results at pH 7.0, where the protein exists as a noninteracting mixture of dimer and tetramer species, suggest that dimer and tetramer have significantly different binding affinities. The dimer-tetramer association reaction itself affords some fractionation of intact and fragmented forms of the protein, intact units preferentially associating to form the tetrameric molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1573543146,"Abstract Human peripheral lymphocytes were incubated in the presence of Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. Activities of both glutamine-utilizing carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.5) and aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), the initial enzymes of the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis, increased simultaneously during the blastogenesis of lymphocytes. A very close connection between these two enzyme activities was recognized, the ratio of their activities at various times of culture being nearly constant. The elevation of the two enzyme activities could be prevented either by actinomycin D or puromycin. They were co-purified from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes through ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and zone electrophoresis in sucrose density gradient. The molecular weight of the enzyme complex was estimated to be approximately 600,000. The results indicate that the glutamine-utilizing carbamyl-P synthetase and aspartate transcarbamylase are induced together as an associated form during the blastogenesis of lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin."

The method is applied to results obtained with different mixtures of ovalbumin and lysozyme in phosphate buffer of pH 6.8 and Γ/2 = 0.02.

https://openalex.org/W1603726162,"Abstract The physicochemical properties of glucocorticoid receptors were studied in rat and mouse thymocytes. The steroid-receptor complex formed when thymocytes were incubated with [1,2,4-3H]triamcinolone acetonide ([3H]TA) was assayed in a 27,000 x g supernatant fraction using sucrose density gradient analysis. After incubation of rat thymocytes at 0° for 30 min most of the bound radioactivity was associated with the 27,000 x g supernatant obtained by extracting the cells with a buffer containing a low concentration of salt (l0.001 m); two [3H]TA-receptor complexes which sedimented at ∼3.5 S and ∼7 S were observed in this fraction. At 0°, the buffer containing high salt (0.15 m KCl) extracted [3H]TA-receptor complex sedimenting at ∼4 S. When incubated at 37° for 30 min, the bulk of bound radioactivity was found in the 27,000 x g pellet from which it could be extracted only with high salt buffer to give a [3H]TA-receptor complex which sedimented at ∼4 S. Mouse thymocytes differed from rat thymocytes in that following incubation with [3H]TA at 0° for 30 min and extraction with the low salt buffer, they yielded only one complex sedimenting at ∼7 S. Pretreatment in vivo with TA increased the in vitro binding of the [3H]TA to the 3.5 S receptor at the expense of binding to the 7 S receptor. It is concluded that the qualitative distribution of the glucocorticoid receptors is species specific and is dependent on the incubation temperature and the ionic strength of the buffer used for extraction and sucrose density analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1568699789,"Abstract Tryptic hydrolysates of native, denatured, or chemically modified phosphoglucose isomerase from rabbit skeletal muscle were subjected to standard peptide mapping techniques. Maps prepared from hydrolysates of either native, guanidine hydrochloride-denatured, or carboxymethylated enzyme were found to have only two-thirds to three-fourths of the number of ninhydrin-positive spots that would be expected (a) on the basis of the amino acid composition (82 lysyl and 42 arginyl residues per enzyme molecule of 132,000 mol. wt.) and (b) if it is assumed that the enzyme is composed of 2 identical subunits (physical studies have shown it to consist of 2 subunits of equal size). The lower-than-expected number of peptides obtained under these conditions was shown to be the result of incomplete hydrolysis, due to partial resistance of the enzyme to tryptic attack. However, tryptic peptide maps prepared from fully carbamylated phosphoglucose isomerase (all lysyl residues modified) yielded 20 to 22 unique peptides, the theoretical number for 2 identical subunits. The technique of peptide mapping after carbamylation of all of the lysyl residues proved to have numerous experimental advantages over mapping of the unmodified protein, suggesting this procedure as the method of choice for any protein composed of relatively large polypeptide chains. Standard methods of NH2-terminal analysis gave only negative results, leaving the possibility that the NH2 termini might be blocked. This was confirmed by gas chromatography which showed phosphoglucose isomerase to contain two acetyl groups per enzyme molecule. Application of gas chromatography and amino acid analysis after extensive proteolytic hydrolysis of the enzyme, followed by cation exchange chromatography of the products, yielded two equivalents of acetylalanine per enzyme molecule, i.e. one each at the NH2 terminus of each subunit. Treatment of the enzyme with carboxypeptidase A and hydrazinolysis followed by dinitrophenylation established the COOH-terminal end of each of the subunits to be -isoleucyl-glutamine. The results in their entirety indicate that rabbit muscle phosphoglucose isomerase is composed of 2 identical subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1643529508,"Abstract The NAD+-NADP+-dependent 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid C4 dehydrogenase from Clostridium sticklandii has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The weight average molecular weight of the native enzyme as determined by high speed sedimentation equilibrium is 72,000. Sedimentation velocity indicated an s20,w of 4.47 S. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis and high speed sedimentation in 6 m guanidine HCl established that the enzyme is composed of 2 subunits of identical size. The enzyme is sensitive to thiol inhibitors, and titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and p-chloromercuribenzoate demonstrated the presence of six sulfhydryl groups per mole. Amino acid analysis indicated that the enzyme contains 6 half-cystine residues per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1993906479,Atomic collisions of high-energy heavy ions produce large yields of x-rays. The small de Broglie wavelength of massive ions leads to an estimate of 0.2 angstrom for the resolution of a microscope utilizing nitrogen ions with energies of 14 million electron volts. Estimates of the yield of x-rays relative to molecular radiation damage of the bases in DNA are made.

https://openalex.org/W2059701182,"Ionizing radiation can induce strong electrical polarization phenomena in dielectic solids. These radiation-induced thermally activated depolarization (RITAD) effects are quite different from radioelectret effects. For nominally pure calcium fluoride samples, the RITAD signals show a signal-to-noise power advantage of 40 decibels over that of thermoluminescence signals measured under the same experimental conditions. Ease of measurement, very high radiation sensitivity, and simple sample fabrication requirements give the RITAD phenomena a great potential for use as a new solid-state dosimetry technique."
https://openalex.org/W1979985525,"Hydra were cut so that regenerates consisting only of the central gastric region were formed. This region, which has no natural opening to the environment, is capable of osmoregulation and of removing excess fluid from the gut. The fluid is excreted through a break in the body wall created as a result of a strong contraction when the gut is distended with fluid. A normal hydra, therefore, must remove excess fluid by contracting and expelling it through its mouth."

https://openalex.org/W1972765715,"Captive and free-ranging Great Basin pocket mice, Perognathus parvus, were exposed to ionizing radiation during the breeding season, April-June, in 1971. The values for the median lethal dose (LD(50)) at 30 days plus or minus the standard deviation were 880 +/- 14 rads and 780 +/- 27 rads, respectively, and the slopes of the survivorship curves were significantly different. These differences suggested that there was a synergism between radiation-induced and environmental sources of mortality, since the field data were corrected for natural mortality (5 percent) in the controls."

https://openalex.org/W1491465495,"Abstract The Δ24(28)-bond of 24-methylenecholesterol was not detectably reduced by rats either in vivo or in a liver enzyme preparation. Since the Δ24(25)-bond of other sterols is reduced under the same conditions, mammalian Δ24(25)-reductase must discriminate between the two positions of the pi-electronic system. It also follows that rats do not possess a Δ24(28)-reductase and are therefore incapable of biosynthesizing 24-methylcholesterol as plants do through reduction of a 24-methylene intermediate. 24-Methylenecholesterol also failed in the rat to undergo further addition of a carbon atom to yield a 24-ethylidene- or 24-ethyl derivative as occurs in plants."
