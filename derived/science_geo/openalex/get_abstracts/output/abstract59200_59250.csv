https://openalex.org/W1571243084,"The structure of crystalline carp muscle calcium-binding protein (parvalbumin) has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques to nominal 1.85-A resolution. Isomorphous and anomalous scattering data were measured for three heavy atom derivatives, 3-chloromercuri-2-methoxypropyl urea, mercury bromide, and ethyl mercury chloride, to 2.0-A resolution using precession photography. As described in Paper III in this series the 2.0-A phases were refined and the 2.0- to 1.85-A phases were determined by use of the tangent formula. The electron density map is interpreted in terms of the 108 amino acid sequence described in Paper I in this series. A calcium ion is bound in the loop between helix C and helix D and a second calcium is bound in the EF loop. The entire CD region is related to helix E, the EF loop, and the terminal helix F by an approximate intramolecular 2-fold axis. Although it does not bind calcium the AB region has a structure similar to the CD and EF regions and appears to have resulted from a gene triplication. The molecule is generally spherical with a well defined hydrophobic core, one-seventh of its total volume, composed of side chains of phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine. All of the polar side chains are at the surface except those associated with calcium binding and with an invariant internal salt bridge between arginine-75 and glutamic acid-81."

https://openalex.org/W1513299191,"Abstract Glutamate decarboxylase catalyzes the formation of γ-aminobutyric acid, an important inhibitory transmitter in invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. Approximately 700-fold purification of the enzyme from mouse brain has been achieved by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, calcium phosphate gel, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The most highly purified preparation appeared to be monodisperse on high speed sedimentation equilibrium analysis and was found to have a partial specific volume, v, of 0.732 and a molecular weight of 85,000 ± 2,000. A single major protein band coincident with the enzyme activity was found with polyacrylamide gel. In addition, a faint band also was present. In tests with 20 naturally occurring amino acids and α-ketoglutarate the enzyme showed α-decarboxylation only with glutamate to a great extent; but it also catalyzed α-decarboxylation of aspartate to a slight extent. A sharp pH optimum at pH 7.0 has been observed. Km values of 0.7 mm and 0.05 µm were found for glutamate and pyridoxal phosphate, respectively. The enzyme was dissociated into two physically indistinguishable subunits with a molecular weight of 44,000 ± 2,000 in 6 m guanidine HCl containing 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol."

https://openalex.org/W1984222099,"Short-term treatment with lithium chloride stimulates the uptake of tryptophan and its conversion to serotonin by striate synaptosomes. Preincubation of striate synaptosomes with L-tryptophan and in vivo administration of L-tryptophan appear to act in a similar manner. Midbrain tryptophan hydroxylase activity is reduced in temporal continuity with the lithium-induced activation of tryptophan uptake and conversion. By 10 days, conversion of tryptophan to serotonin in nerve endings becomes a joint function of the maintained increased uptake of tryptophan and a decreased level of tryptophan hydroxylase activity in nerve endings. The occurrence of this delayed alteration corresponds in time to the previously described axoplasmic flow rate for tryptophan hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1982371744,"Naive specimens of the marine gastropod Pleurobranchaea withdraw from tactile stimulation of the oral veil and show feeding responses to food chemicals. Experimental subjects, trained by pairing touch (conditioned stimullus) with food chemicals (unconditioned stimulus), soon acquired a classically conditioned feeding response to touch alone. Control subjects that received touch alone or unpaired touch and food chemicals showed significantly fewer feeding responses to touch than did experimentals. Classically conditioned specimens were used for avoidance conditioning. Subjects that received aversive electrical stimulation when they did not withdraw from touch rapidly learned to withdraw rather than to feed in response to touch alone. Controls that received touch alone or unpaired touch and shock continued to exhibit the feeding response to touch alone. The learned responses persisted for up to 2 weeks without reinforcement before extinction, and could be demonstrated in the isolated nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1556375320,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of carp muscle calcium-binding protein B has been completely determined by a combination of chemical and x-ray data. The protein was subjected to tryptic digestion and the peptides were separated on ion exchange columns. All of the 108 residues of the protein could be accounted for in 15 tryptic peptides. The sequence of each peptide was elucidated by a combination of Edman degradations with dansylation, carboxypeptidase, and aminopeptidase hydrolyses, and high voltage electrophoresis at pH 6.5. One 19-residue tryptic peptide was resistant to Edman degradation and was found by mass spectral analysis to have N-acetylalanine at the NH2 terminus. The sequence of this peptide was determined after digestion with thermolysin. The alignment of both the thermolytic and tryptic peptides to give the over-all sequence was made primarily from the 2.0 A resolution electron density map."

https://openalex.org/W1979779106,"A single intraventricular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF). given at the time of brain damage, facilitated the course of recovery from the lateral hypothalamic anorexic syndrome in male rats. In the second and third weeks after the trauma, NGF-treated rats ate more food, regained body weight more rapidly, and fed more vigorously in response to intraventricular administration of norepinephrine than untreated controls. After full recovery, rats that had been treated with NGF were resistant to reinstatement of the hypothalamic syndrome by 6-hydroxydopamine. NGF may facilitate behavioral recovery by promoting the development of supersensitivity to norepinephrine and possibly also by stimulating the growth of regenerating noradrenergic neurons in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1500074185,"Abstract A method is described for the preparation of homogeneous 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from pig heart muscle in amounts sufficient for structural studies. The procedure utilizes ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose. The homogeneity of the preparation obtained has been established by isoelectric focusing, sedimentation analysis, starch gel electrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Crystals of the protein have been obtained with ammonium sulfate in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The enzyme exhibits marked substrate inhibition with acetoacetyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent with S-acetoacetyl pantetheine, when assayed in the direction of NADH oxidation. The activity with S-acetoacetyl-N-acetylcysteamine is too low to determine whether high levels of this substrate also inhibit the enzyme. The purified enzyme is a basic protein with an isoelectric point of 8.95 at 4°. It possesses a sedimentation coefficient of 3.88 S and a maximum ultraviolet absorption at 278 nm. The extinction coefficient at this wave length is E1%1 cm = 4.39. The amino acid composition of the enzyme has been determined. The most notable features are 2 residues of tryptophan and 2 residues of half-cystine per mole of protein. Both half-cystinyl residues are present in the native enzyme as cysteine as judged by titration of the protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride with p-chloromercuribenzoate."

The enzyme activity measured in the presence of stimulating hormones (epinephrine, prostaglandin PGE(1), parathyroid hormone) is also inhibited in these preparations by somatomedin. These observations may be relevant in a general way to the mechanism of action of growth-prmoting substances and to the processes which normally regulate cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1488716207,"Abstract Liver homogenates hydroxylate dihydrotachysterol3 in position 25 equally well whether they are prepared from rats low in vitamin D or from rats treated with vitamin D3. This contrasts with the liver homogenate 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 which is markedly reduced by pretreatment with vitamin D3. In addition, the rate of appearance of 25-hydroxy[3H]dihydrotachysterol3 in the blood following a dose of [3H]dihydrotachysterol3 is not reduced by prior treatment with unlabeled vitamin D3 or dihydrotachysterol in contrast to the effect of prior vitamin D3 treatment on in vivo vitamin D3 25-hydroxylation. Furthermore the rate of appearance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the blood increases only about 2-fold with a 100-fold increase in vitamin D3 dose, while the rate of appearance of 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 increases 100-fold with a 100-fold increase in dihydrotachysterol3 dose. These results strongly suggest that the 25-hydroxylation of dihydrotachysterol is not regulated in vivo as is the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3. They also support the idea that the regulation of calciferol-25-hydroxylase activity functions to maintain a low circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the blood even when large amounts of vitamin D3 are being ingested."

https://openalex.org/W1593560466,"Abstract Human plasminogen was prepared from both plasma Fractions III and III2,3 by affinity chromatography on lysine-substituted Sepharose columns. Plasminogen prepared by this method, from either Fraction III or III2,3, appeared to be homogeneous when analyzed by slab acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 6 m urea-0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The specific activities of the preparations were 20 to 24 casein units per mg of protein. Acrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses in 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid at pH 8.4 showed that the distribution of the multiple molecular forms of plasminogen prepared from Fraction III differed depending upon whether the extracts were either frozen, or unfrozen, prior to affinity chromatography or processed more quickly during affinity chromatography. The major electrophoretic components in Fraction III plasminogen prepared from extracts which were unfrozen had greater electronegative mobilities than the major components in Fraction III2,3 plasminogen. The electrophoretic forms seen in Fraction III plasminogen prepared from extracts which had been frozen and thawed, prior to affinity chromatography appeared to be identical with those in Fraction III2,3 plasminogen. Electrophoretic analyses in acrylamide gels containing 0.4% casein showed that all of the electrophoretic forms of plasminogen prepared from Fractions III and III2,3 could be activated with urokinase as determined by the zones of casein digestion seen after incubation and staining of the gels. Electrophoretic analyses of Fractions III and III2,3 plasminogens in acrylamide gel-isoelectric focusing systems showed similar patterns to those obtained in the acrylamide gel-0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid system. At pH 3.1, in acrylamide gel electrophoresis, Fraction III plasminogen showed two groups of components, whereas Fraction III2,3 plasminogen showed a single component similar to the minor, faster moving component found in Fraction III plasminogen. Analyses and isolation of the individual isoelectric forms from Fractions III and III2,3 plasminogens were carried out with isoelectric focusing methods. Sixty-six per cent of the plasminogen isolated from Fraction III had isoelectric points between pH 6.2 and 7.2 (six forms). The specific activity of these forms was found to be 20 to 21 casein units per mg of protein. Each of these forms contained a major, and a minor electrophoretic component in slab acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid. Eighty-three per cent of the plasminogen isolated from Fraction III2,3 had isoelectric points between pH 7.2 and 8.1 (four forms). The specific activity of these forms was found to be 22 to 24 casein units per mg of protein. Each of these forms contained two major isoelectric components (doublets). The NH2-terminal amino acid of the isoelectric forms with pI values of 6.2, 6.4, and 6.6 was determined to be glutamic acid. The NH2-terminal amino acid of the isoelectric forms with pI values of 6.7, 7.2, 7.8, and 8.3 isolated from Fraction III2,3, and of the isoelectric forms with pI values of 7.2 and 7.8 isolated from Fraction III was determined to be lysine (and valine). Sedimentation-equilibrium analyses on isolated isoelectric forms showed that the NH2-terminal lysine forms with pI values of 7.2, 7.5, and 7.8, and the NH2-terminal glutamic acid forms with pI values of 6.2 and 6.4 all had the same molecular weights, approximately 80,000. The sedimentation coefficients, s°20,??w, of the Fraction III plasminogen forms were different from the Fraction III2,3 plasminogen forms. Each plasminogen isoelectric form, from pI values 6.2 to 8.5, can be activated with urokinase. The resulting plasmins which were inhibited with l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, reduced with mercaptoethanol and alkylated with iodoacetic acid, gave Cm-heavy (A) and Cm-light (B) chain derivatives that appeared to be identical with each other when analyzed in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate systems. Cm-heavy (A) and Cm-light (B) chain derivatives isolated from urokinase-activated plasminogen III A appeared to be identical with the same derivatives isolated from urokinase-activated plasminogens 1112,3 A and III2,3 S."

Measurements were made there, by specific autoradiographic techniques, of the numbers of total cholinesterase-like molecules and of acetylcholinesterase molecules. The acetylcholinesterase is distinctly decreased at the endplates in dystrophic muscles. The various data available on these muscles are compatible with the concept that a neural factor which determines the synaptic acetylcholinesterase, along with a number of other characters in the muscle cell, is defective in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1582584958,"Abstract Histone III of the testes of the carp, Letiobus bubalus, contains a serine residue in place of the cysteine found in calf thymus histone III. Examination of the cyanogen bromide peptides, as well as peptides derived by tryptic, chymotryptic, or thermolysin hydrolysis, revealed no other differences in amino acid composition. Thus histone III shows a highly conserved sequence from fish to calf, there being a difference of only 1 residue in the 135 of the protein. As in the case of calf thymus histone III, there are two specific sites of methylation of e-amino groups of lysine residues. Each site contains one, two or three methyl groups."

https://openalex.org/W1582061885,"Abstract The binding of concanavalin A (con A) to intact and detergent-solubilized fractions of rat liver mitochondria has been studied quantitatively using a turbidimetric agglutination assay and by a radioactive binding procedure employing [acetyl-3H]con A. The reaction appears to involve oligosaccharide residues associated with glycoproteins of the mitochondrion since glycosides such as methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside and methyl-α-d-glycopyranoside, which are specifically bound by con A, will inhibit this interaction. Solvent extraction (10% water in acetone) did not affect the ability of mitochondria to bind [acetyl-3H]con A. Based on gel filtration studies of Triton X-100 (1%) solubilized preparations of mitochondria, the majority (70%) of the con A-reactive components have molecular weights of 40,000 to 80,000. Since approximately 40% of the total [acetyl-3H]con A-binding capacity can be demonstrated using intact mitochondria, it appears that a considerable number of binding sites are located on the outer surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Seventy per cent of the con A-reactive components are released in soluble form together with most (85%) of the intracristate marker enzyme adenylate kinase by treatment with 0.108 mg of digitonin per mg of mitochondrial protein. The remainder of the con A-binding material is distributed equally between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. When the digitonin-solubilized intracristate space fraction is subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis five periodic acid-Schiff's base staining bands are observed. When the soluble, intracristate protein fraction is subjected to trypsin digestion or periodic acid oxidation, extensive destruction of [acetyl-3H]con A-binding activity is observed. These observations indicate that con A may be a useful probe for investigating the function and distribution of glycoproteins in the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W2036501605,"Before optic nerve outgrowth in Xenopus laevis embryos, a change of state occurs in the differentiating retinal cell population which renders the cells refractory to information about subsequent changes in their positions, and commits individual ganglion cells to develop specific position-dependent properties (locus specificities) which subserve the formation of orderly retinotopic connections in the optic tectum. When different parts of eye primordia from stages before optic nerve outgrowth are fused, each piece in such a reconstructed eye does not generate ganglion cells with the partial-set of locus specificities normally arising from that region of the intact eye. It is inferred that separate parts of the early embryonic retina do not contain stable programs for spatial deployment of locus specificity, and that development of definitive locus specificities in retinal ganglion cells requires additional cellular interactions among the retinal cells later in development."

https://openalex.org/W1542576388,"Abstract An RNA fraction with messenger activity has been isolated from free polysomes of rabbit liver. This liver RNA was translated in a reticulocyte cell-free system, which had been rendered dependent on exogenous messenger RNA by mild ribonuclease treatment. After ribonuclease was removed from the ribosomes, protein synthesis was almost totally dependent on 0.5 m KCl ribosomal wash protein and exogenous RNA isolated from either reticulocyte or liver polysomes. In contrast to reticulocyte RNA, which directed the synthesis of α and β globin chains almost exclusively, liver RNA directed synthesis of polypeptides over a broad range of molecular weights. Little globin chain synthesis was detected with liver RNA. Evidence for the specific synthesis of ferritin was obtained by chemical purification and crystallization of this protein from the cell-free reaction product, by immunoprecipitation of the purified material with a monospecific antibody to rabbit liver ferritin, and by coincident migration of radioactivity with purified ferritin in both polyacrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since this highly active, fractionated, reticulocyte cell-free system is capable of translating mRNA fractions from both the liver and the reticulocyte into specific natural proteins, it may be useful in future studies dealing with the regulation of protein synthesis with messenger RNA from various animal sources."

https://openalex.org/W1528024488,"Abstract Leghemoglobin may be isolated from soybean root nodules as a complex, leghemoglobin a-X of ferric leghemoglobin with a low molecular weight ligand X. That complex dissociates at neutral or alkaline pH and the ligand X may be separated from free leghemoglobin by ultrafiltration. The complex is regenerated by combining ferric leghemoglobin with X. The affinity of ferrous leghemoglobin for X is very much less than the affinity of ferric leghemoglobin for X. The optical spectrum of leghemoglobin a-X closely resembles that of a number of b-cytochromes. The evidence does not distinguish whether X binds to leghemoglobin at the heme iron atom or elsewhere. Reaction of ferric leghemoglobin a-X with dithionite yields ferrous leghemoglobin a-X. Ferrous leghemoglobin a-X dissociates slowly into free ferrous leghemoglobin and X; first order rate constant = 0.036 s-1. Ferrous leghemoglobin a-X reacts with carbon monoxide only after prior dissociation of the ligand X."

https://openalex.org/W1549577133,"Abstract Trout testis cells were incubated with [3H]arginine and lysine and inorganic [32P]phosphate. Histones were extracted with acid and the major fractions (I, IIb1, IIb2, III monomer, and IV) were resolved by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10. The profile of 32P incorporation was time dependent. When the phosphorylated histones in each of the major fractions were resolved from unphosphorylated species by starch gel electrophoresis, about 40 to 50% of histone I, 15 to 20% of histone IIb1, 5% of histones IIb2 and III, and 30 to 40% of histone IV was found to be phosphorylated. These different levels for each histone suggest that in each case phosphorylation may have a separate function other than, or in addition to, the usually postulated one of direct gene derepression. Histone IIb1 is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated shortly after its synthesis, suggesting that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of newly synthesized histone IIb1 may play a role in its correct binding to DNA. This is in contrast to histone IV where acetylation and deacetylation may be important in its correct binding to DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1480634076,"Abstract The reduction mechanism of type 1 Cu(II) of the human plasma copper protein, ceruloplasmin (EC 1.12.3.1), was investigated using the pulse radiolysis method. The hydrated electron, used as reducing agent, was found to decay by a bimolecular process. At the same rate, a transient absorption band, centered at 410 nm, appeared. It was followed by a slower increase of absorption due to a broad band with a maximum at 305 nm. The first band is assigned to the adduct of e-aq with the disulfide groups (RSSR- radical ion). The second band is probably due to the adduct of e-aq with an aromatic amino acid residue (histidyl). Both bands decay in a first order process at the same rate at which type 1 Cu(II) is reduced ((9 ± 1) x 102 s-1). The pathway of the reduction equivalent to this oxidation-reduction active center, may therefore be delineated at least for reduction by the very potent e-aq; it proceeds from the bimolecular encounter step, in which the electron is attached to residues on the protein surface (peptide bonds and disulfide groups) by an internal transfer to an imidazol residue and ultimately to the type 1 Cu(II) center."
https://openalex.org/W1655956665,"Abstract The molecular weight of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, was found to be 65,000, in good agreement with the value of 67,000 obtained from amino acid analyses. Gel filtration and sedimentation velocity measurements gave a somewhat higher value of 75,000. Further sedimentation equilibrium studies in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gave molecular weights of 31,000, indicating that the protein is composed of 2 subunits of equal molecular weight and supporting the lower molecular weight values for the native protein. NH2-terminal analyses gave 2 residues of serine per mole of protein, which is consistent with two polypeptide chains per molecule. Fractionation of the soluble tryptic peptides of the S-[14C]carboxymethylated enzyme by ion exchange chromatography and unidirectional paper electrophoresis indicated a maximum of 46 major peptides, which is approximately one-half of the number of tryptic peptides expected from the lysine plus arginine content of 81. In addition, only one peptide with [14C]carboxymethylcysteine and one peptide containing tryptophan were identified following the fractionation of the soluble tryptic peptides. These observations suggest that the subunits possess very similar or identical amino acid sequences. The sequence of amino acid residues surrounding the single cysteinyl residue is His-Pro-Val-Ser-Cys-Lys. This peptide does not show any obvious relationship to any cysteinyl-containing peptide reported from any other dehydrogenase. The stability of the protein as a function of urea concentration was followed by enzymatic activity, optical rotation, and sedimentation velocity analyses. The molecule appears to undergo a simultaneous dissociation and unfolding with a concomitant complete loss of enzymatic activity between urea concentrations of 2 and 3 m. Approximately 90% of the original activity of enzyme denatured in urea can be recovered upon removal of urea by dialysis against 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at 4°. Substrate and cofactor do not appear to affect the extent of reactivation under optimal conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1558792118,"Abstract Ferric leghemoglobin α forms a spectrally demonstrable complex with acetic acid. In the presence of acetic acid the rate of reduction of ferric leghemoglobin α by dithionite is reduced markedly. Over three orders of magnitude of rate, the rate of reduction of ferric leghemoglobin α by dithionite is proportional to the fraction of uncombined leghemoglobin. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that the complex of leghemoglobin α with acetic acid is reduced by dithionite either not at all or very much more slowly than free leghemoglobin. Binding of acetic acid to leghemoglobin α is identically linked to binding of fluoride. Fluoride is known to ligate to the heme iron atom of leghemoglobin, and a simple explanation of the data is that acetic acid and fluoride compete for binding to the heme iron atom. However an alternative possibility, also compatible with the present data, is that acetic acid binds to leghemoglobin elsewhere than at the heme to bring about a linked allosteric change in the configuration of the heme. That configurational change may involve ligation of a carboxyl side chain of the protein to the heme iron atom."

https://openalex.org/W1591904217,"Abstract T4 phage-induced deoxynucleotide kinase was purified to homogeneity as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be about 52,000 by the technique of Sephadex G-200 column chromatography. Enzyme denatured with 2-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate also showed a single band after electrophoresis in an acrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. In the latter case, the molecular weight was calculated to be approximately 23,000, suggesting that the native enzyme is composed of two identical subunits. The messenger RNA for deoxynucleotide kinase produced in vivo has been found to be present in two relatively sharp bands that sediment in sucrose density gradients with a coefficient of 15 S and 12 S. This RNA, as well as unfractionated RNA, could direct in vitro the synthesis of deoxynucleotide kinase. The molecular weight of the enzyme synthesized in vitro was determined by gel filtration chromatography and found to be 48,000, approximately the same value as that found for the in vivo enzyme. The kinase messenger in 12 S RNA is believed to be transcribed from T4 DNA as a monocistronic unit. However, kinase messenger also appears in di- or polycistronic form since 15 S RNA is large enough to code for the synthesis of the kinase and at least one other protein."

https://openalex.org/W1603094431,"Under aerobic conditions, glucose consumption by rat reticulocytes was relatively low. When cellular respiratory activity was blocked by antimycin A, both glucose uptake and lactate formation were greatly increased. Pasteur control (the ratio of the rate of glycolysis in the respiratory-inhibited state to that in the uninhibited aerobic state) was very high in these cells and varied from 9 to 12. A crossover plot of the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in the respiratory-inhibited cell as percentages of the control values showed forward crossovers at the phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase steps and a reversed crossover at the phosphoglyceromutase step. A third forward crossover at the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase step was suggested by an increase in the steady state concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate in the respiratory-inhibited state. Uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by p-trifluoromethoxy-carboxycyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) increased the rate of glycolysis, but this was further increased after the addition of antimycin A. The ratio of the rate of glycolysis in cells treated with antimycin A to that in cells treated with FCCP varied from 1.5 to 2.0. Oxidative utilization of glucose through mitochondrial activity in these cells was very low and accounted for about 6% of the total glucose utilized in the aerobic regulated state; in the uncoupled state this value rose to only about 12%. Rat reticulocytes utilized glycerol to support glycolysis and a high Pasteur control was maintained with this substrate. This demonstrates that there is strong regulation of glycolysis beyond the phosphofructokinase step. Glycerol 3-phosphate was found in these cells when glycerol was the added substrate but was absent when glucose was the added substrate. This demonstrates the presence of glycerokinase in rat reticulocytes."

Procedures are described for the degradation of these sugar nucleotides to give information about the origin of the methyl residues. The data show that the C2-O-methyl as well as the C3-methyl residue of the vinelose moiety arise from the S-methyl group in methionine. The following reactions which lead to formation of a cytidine diphosphate 3-C-methyl-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose have been described in the extracts of Azotobacter vinelandii strain O:Step 1, formation of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose from CDP-d-glucose; Step 2, formation of CDP-3-C-methyl-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose from CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose and S-adenosylmethionine; and Step 3, conversion of CDP-3-C-methyl-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose to a distinct CDP-sugar presumably by an epimerization mechanism. The activities for Step 2 and Step 3 can be partially separated by fractionation of the crude extract with ammonium sulfate. The significance of these observations is discussed in terms of the mechanisms operative during the biosynthesis of l-vinelose."
