https://openalex.org/W4205972999,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unknown etiology. We tested the hypothesis that MS is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a cohort comprising more than 10 million young adults on active duty in the US military, 955 of whom were diagnosed with MS during their period of service. Risk of MS increased 32-fold after infection with EBV but was not increased after infection with other viruses, including the similarly transmitted cytomegalovirus. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion. These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS."

Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis."

Gould et al . report that introducing metal-metal bonding can enhance coercivity. Reduction of iodide-bridged terbium or dysprosium dimers resulted in a single electron bond between the metals, which enforced alignment of the other valence electrons.

We report the development and application of engineered DNA-free virus-like particles (eVLPs) that efficiently package and deliver base editor or Cas9 ribonucleoproteins. By engineering VLPs to overcome cargo packaging, release, and localization bottlenecks, we developed fourth-generation eVLPs that mediate efficient base editing in several primary mouse and human cell types. Using different glycoproteins in eVLPs alters their cellular tropism. Single injections of eVLPs into mice support therapeutic levels of base editing in multiple tissues, reducing serum Pcsk9 levels 78% following 63% liver editing, and partially restoring visual function in a mouse model of genetic blindness. In vitro and in vivo off-target editing from eVLPs was virtually undetected, an improvement over AAV or plasmid delivery. These results establish eVLPs as promising vehicles for therapeutic macromolecule delivery that combine key advantages of both viral and nonviral delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4207035561,"Filament assembly of amyloid-β peptides ending at residue 42 (Aβ42) is a central event in Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Aβ42 filaments from human brains. Two structurally related S-shaped protofilament folds give rise to two types of filaments. Type I filaments were found mostly in the brains of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, and type II filaments were found in individuals with familial Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions. The structures of Aβ42 filaments from the brain differ from those of filaments assembled in vitro. By contrast, in AppNL-F knock-in mice, Aβ42 deposits were made of type II filaments. Knowledge of Aβ42 filament structures from human brains may lead to the development of inhibitors of assembly and improved imaging agents."
https://openalex.org/W4207021716,"Since the first half of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory has been dominated by the idea that mutations occur randomly with respect to their consequences1. Here we test this assumption with large surveys of de novo mutations in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to expectations, we find that mutations occur less often in functionally constrained regions of the genome-mutation frequency is reduced by half inside gene bodies and by two-thirds in essential genes. With independent genomic mutation datasets, including from the largest Arabidopsis mutation accumulation experiment conducted to date, we demonstrate that epigenomic and physical features explain over 90% of variance in the genome-wide pattern of mutation bias surrounding genes. Observed mutation frequencies around genes in turn accurately predict patterns of genetic polymorphisms in natural Arabidopsis accessions (r = 0.96). That mutation bias is the primary force behind patterns of sequence evolution around genes in natural accessions is supported by analyses of allele frequencies. Finally, we find that genes subject to stronger purifying selection have a lower mutation rate. We conclude that epigenome-associated mutation bias2 reduces the occurrence of deleterious mutations in Arabidopsis, challenging the prevailing paradigm that mutation is a directionless force in evolution."

https://openalex.org/W4220838810,"Gasdermin proteins form large membrane pores in human cells that release immune cytokines and induce lytic cell death. Gasdermin pore formation is triggered by caspase-mediated cleavage during inflammasome signaling and is critical for defense against pathogens and cancer. We discovered gasdermin homologs encoded in bacteria that defended against phages and executed cell death. Structures of bacterial gasdermins revealed a conserved pore-forming domain that was stabilized in the inactive state with a buried lipid modification. Bacterial gasdermins were activated by dedicated caspase-like proteases that catalyzed site-specific cleavage and the removal of an inhibitory C-terminal peptide. Release of autoinhibition induced the assembly of large and heterogeneous pores that disrupted membrane integrity. Thus, pyroptosis is an ancient form of regulated cell death shared between bacteria and animals."
https://openalex.org/W4205399426,"The medial entorhinal cortex is part of a neural system for mapping the position of an individual within a physical environment1. Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations2, and are organized in modules3 that collectively form a population code for the animal's allocentric position1. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments4,5 and behavioural states6,7, independent of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,8-11. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained unclear owing to the small samples of cells obtained so far. Here, using simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells and subsequent topological data analysis, we show that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to positions of the moving animal in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feedforward models12. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides a population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells."
https://openalex.org/W4205521038,"In conventional superconductors, Cooper pairing occurs between electrons of opposite spin. We observe spin-polarized superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene when doped to a saddle-point van Hove singularity generated by large applied perpendicular electric field. We observe a cascade of electrostatic gate-tuned transitions between electronic phases distinguished by their polarization within the isospin space defined by the combination of the spin and momentum-space valley degrees of freedom. Although all of these phases are metallic at zero magnetic field, we observe a transition to a superconducting state at finite B‖ ≈ 150mT applied parallel to the two-dimensional sheet. Superconductivity occurs near a symmetry breaking transition, and exists exclusively above the B‖-limit expected of a paramagnetic superconductor with the observed transition temperature TC ≈ 30mK, consistent with a spin-triplet order parameter."
https://openalex.org/W4205391572,"Half of all plant species rely on animals to disperse their seeds. Seed dispersal interactions lost through defaunation and gained during novel community assembly influence whether plants can adapt to climate change through migration. We develop trait-based models to predict pairwise interactions and dispersal function for fleshy-fruited plants globally. Using interactions with introduced species as an observable proxy for interactions in future novel seed dispersal networks, we find strong potential to forecast their assembly and functioning. We conservatively estimate that mammal and bird defaunation has already reduced the capacity of plants to track climate change by 60% globally. This strong reduction in the ability of plants to adapt to climate change through range shifts shows a synergy between defaunation and climate change that undermines vegetation resilience."
https://openalex.org/W4206183937,"Gasdermins are a family of structurally related proteins originally described for their role in pyroptosis. Gasdermin B (GSDMB) is currently the least studied, and while its association with genetic susceptibility to chronic mucosal inflammatory disorders is well established, little is known about its functional relevance during active disease states. Herein, we report increased GSDMB in inflammatory bowel disease, with single-cell analysis identifying epithelial specificity to inflamed colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes. Surprisingly, mechanistic experiments and transcriptome profiling reveal lack of inherent GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis in activated epithelial cells and organoids but instead point to increased proliferation and migration during in vitro wound closure, which arrests in GSDMB-deficient cells that display hyper-adhesiveness and enhanced formation of vinculin-based focal adhesions dependent on PDGF-A-mediated FAK phosphorylation. Importantly, carriage of disease-associated GSDMB SNPs confers functional defects, disrupting epithelial restitution/repair, which, altogether, establishes GSDMB as a critical factor for restoration of epithelial barrier function and the resolution of inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W4206422716,"For decades we have known that the Sun lies within the Local Bubble, a cavity of low-density, high-temperature plasma surrounded by a shell of cold, neutral gas and dust1-3. However, the precise shape and extent of this shell4,5, the impetus and timescale for its formation6,7, and its relationship to nearby star formation8 have remained uncertain, largely due to low-resolution models of the local interstellar medium. Here we report an analysis of the three-dimensional positions, shapes and motions of dense gas and young stars within 200 pc of the Sun, using new spatial9-11 and dynamical constraints12. We find that nearly all of the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly perpendicular to the bubble's surface. Tracebacks of these young stars' motions support a picture in which the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble's centre beginning approximately 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of supernova-driven star formation."
https://openalex.org/W4206622785,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the artery walls and involves immune cells such as macrophages. Olfactory receptors (OLFRs) are G protein–coupled chemoreceptors that have a central role in detecting odorants and the sense of smell. We found that mouse vascular macrophages express the olfactory receptor Olfr2 and all associated trafficking and signaling molecules. Olfr2 detects the compound octanal, which activates the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and induces interleukin-1β secretion in human and mouse macrophages. We found that human and mouse blood plasma contains octanal, a product of lipid peroxidation, at concentrations sufficient to activate Olfr2 and the human ortholog olfactory receptor 6A2 (OR6A2). Boosting octanal levels exacerbated atherosclerosis, whereas genetic targeting of Olfr2 in mice significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaques. Our findings suggest that inhibiting OR6A2 may provide a promising strategy to prevent and treat atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4205115875,"Efforts to date the oldest modern human fossils in eastern Africa, from Omo-Kibish1-3 and Herto4,5 in Ethiopia, have drawn on a variety of chronometric evidence, including 40Ar/39Ar ages of stratigraphically associated tuffs. The ages that are generally reported for these fossils are around 197 thousand years (kyr) for the Kibish Omo I3,6,7, and around 160-155 kyr for the Herto hominins5,8. However, the stratigraphic relationships and tephra correlations that underpin these estimates have been challenged6,8. Here we report geochemical analyses that link the Kamoya's Hominid Site (KHS) Tuff9, which conclusively overlies the member of the Omo-Kibish Formation that contains Omo I, with a major explosive eruption of Shala volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift. By dating the proximal deposits of this eruption, we obtain a new minimum age for the Omo fossils of 233 ± 22 kyr. Contrary to previous arguments6,8, we also show that the KHS Tuff does not correlate with another widespread tephra layer, the Waidedo Vitric Tuff, and therefore cannot anchor a minimum age for the Herto fossils. Shifting the age of the oldest known Homo sapiens fossils in eastern Africa to before around 200 thousand years ago is consistent with independent evidence for greater antiquity of the modern human lineage10."
https://openalex.org/W4205636517,"In recent years, digital finance has become a crucial part of the financial system and reshaped the mode of green finance in China. Digital finance has brought certain impact on economic growth, industrial structure, and resident income, which may affect pollution. The nexus of digital finance and environment in China is thus worth exploring. By revising the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve model with income inequality variable, this paper decomposes the environmental effects of economic activities into income growth effect, industrial structure effect and income inequality effect, and use panel data of China's provinces to conduct an empirical analysis. The results reveal the following: (1) the Environmental Kuznets Curve is still valid in sample, and digital finance can reduce air and water pollution (as measured through SO2 and COD emission) directly; (2) in the influence mechanism, digital finance can alleviate income inequality and promote green industrial structure, thus reducing pollution indirectly, but the scale effect of income growth outweighs the technological effect, which increases pollution indirectly; and (3) digital finance has a threshold effect on improving the environment, then an acceleration effect appears after a certain threshold value. From the regional perspective, digital finance development in eastern regions is generally ahead of central and western regions, and the effects of environmental improvement in the eastern regions are greater. According to the study, this paper suggest that digital finance can be an effective way to promote social sustainability by alleviating income inequality and environmental sustainability by reducing pollution."
https://openalex.org/W3216238840,"The final fate of massive stars, and the nature of the compact remnants they leave behind (black holes and neutron stars), are open questions in astrophysics. Many massive stars are stripped of their outer hydrogen envelopes as they evolve. Such Wolf–Rayet stars1 emit strong and rapidly expanding winds with speeds greater than 1,000 kilometres per second. A fraction of this population is also helium-depleted, with spectra dominated by highly ionized emission lines of carbon and oxygen (types WC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly observed supernova explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (types Ib/Ic) cannot result from massive WC/WO stars2,3, leading some to suggest that most such stars collapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosion4. Here we report observations of SN 2019hgp, beginning about a day after the explosion. Its short rise time and rapid decline place it among an emerging population of rapidly evolving transients5–8. Spectroscopy reveals a rich set of emission lines indicating that the explosion occurred within a nebula composed of carbon, oxygen and neon. Narrow absorption features show that this material is expanding at high velocities (greater than 1,500 kilometres per second), requiring a compact progenitor. Our observations are consistent with an explosion of a massive WC/WO star, and suggest that massive Wolf–Rayet stars may be the progenitors of some rapidly evolving transients. Observations of the supernova SN 2019hgp, identified about a day after its explosion, show that it occurred within a nebula of carbon, oxygen and neon, and was probably the explosion of a massive WC/WO star."

A spatial superposition of a massive particle is predicted to be sensitive to this effect. We measure the gravitational phase shift induced in a matter-wave interferometer by a kilogram-scale source mass close to one of the wave packets. Deflections of each interferometer arm due to the source mass are independently measured. The phase shift deviates from the deflection-induced phase contribution, as predicted by quantum mechanics. In addition, the observed scaling of the phase shift is consistent with Heisenberg’s error-disturbance relation. These results show that gravity creates Aharonov-Bohm phase shifts analogous to those produced by electromagnetic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4205878678,"The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is essential for cellular homeostasis. Yet little is known of the mechanisms that remodel it during natural stresses. We found that large “SPOTs” (structures positive for OMM) emerge during Toxoplasma gondii infection in mammalian cells. SPOTs mediated the depletion of the OMM proteins mitofusin 1 and 2, which restrict parasite growth. The formation of SPOTs depended on the parasite effector TgMAF1 and the host mitochondrial import receptor TOM70, which is required for optimal parasite proliferation. TOM70 enabled TgMAF1 to interact with the host OMM translocase SAM50. The ablation of SAM50 or the overexpression of an OMM-targeted protein promoted OMM remodeling independently of infection. Thus, Toxoplasma hijacks the formation of SPOTs, a cellular response to OMM stress, to promote its growth."

Given the prominence of iron in planetary interiors, we require accurate and precise physical properties at extreme pressure and temperature. A first-order property of iron is its melting point, which is still debated for the conditions of Earth’s interior. We used high-energy lasers at the National Ignition Facility and in situ x-ray diffraction to determine the melting point of iron up to 1000 gigapascals, three times the pressure of Earth’s inner core. We used this melting curve to determine the length of dynamo action during core solidification to the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure.

The KNOTTED1 (KN1) homeodomain family transcription factors act non–cell autonomously to control stem cell maintenance in plants through cell-to-cell movement of their proteins and mRNAs through plasmodesmata; however, the mechanism of mRNA movement is largely unknown. We show that cell-to-cell movement of a KN1 mRNA requires ribosomal RNA–processing protein 44A (AtRRP44A), a subunit of the RNA exosome that processes or degrades diverse RNAs in eukaryotes. AtRRP44A can interact with plasmodesmata and mediates the cell-to-cell trafficking of KN1 mRNA, and genetic analysis indicates that AtRRP44A is required for the developmental functions of SHOOT MERISTEMLESS, an Arabidopsis KN1 homolog. Our findings suggest that AtRRP44A promotes mRNA trafficking through plasmodesmata to control stem cell–dependent processes in plants."

This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers, of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p = 2*10-23 and 2*10-13 respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys."

The nature of this condensate can be tuned by varying the pairing strength, which is challenging in electronic systems. We studied graphene double layers separated by an atomically thin insulator. Under applied magnetic field, electrons and holes couple across the barrier to form bound magneto-excitons whose pairing strength can be continuously tuned by varying the effective layer separation. Using temperature-dependent Coulomb drag and counterflow current measurements, we were able to tune the magneto-exciton condensate through the entire phase diagram from weak to strong coupling. Our results establish magneto-exciton condensates in graphene as a model platform to study the crossover between two bosonic quantum condensate phases in a solid-state system."
https://openalex.org/W4206282953,"Fermi liquid theory forms the basis for our understanding of the majority of metals: their resistivity arises from the scattering of well defined quasiparticles at a rate where, in the low-temperature limit, the inverse of the characteristic time scale is proportional to the square of the temperature. However, various quantum materials1-15-notably high-temperature superconductors1-10-exhibit strange-metallic behaviour with a linear scattering rate in temperature, deviating from this central paradigm. Here we show the unexpected signatures of strange metallicity in a bosonic system for which the quasiparticle concept does not apply. Our nanopatterned YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) film arrays reveal linear-in-temperature and linear-in-magnetic field resistance over extended temperature and magnetic field ranges. Notably, below the onset temperature at which Cooper pairs form, the low-field magnetoresistance oscillates with a period dictated by the superconducting flux quantum, h/2e (e, electron charge; h, Planck's constant). Simultaneously, the Hall coefficient drops and vanishes within the measurement resolution with decreasing temperature, indicating that Cooper pairs instead of single electrons dominate the transport process. Moreover, the characteristic time scale τ in this bosonic system follows a scale-invariant relation without an intrinsic energy scale: ħ/τ ≈ a(kBT + γμBB), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, a is of order unity7,8,11,12, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, μB is the Bohr magneton and γ ≈ 2. By extending the reach of strange-metal phenomenology to a bosonic system, our results suggest that there is a fundamental principle governing their transport that transcends particle statistics."

Although survival rates have improved over the last decades, specific patients are still at risk for adverse outcome. In the Netherlands, since 2015, pediatric oncology care for renal tumors has been centralized in the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology. Here, we describe experiences of the first 5 years of centralized care and explore whether this influences the epidemiological landscape by comparing data with the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). We identified all patients &lt;19 years with a renal mass diagnosed between 01-01-2015 and 31-12-2019 in the Princess Máxima Center. Epidemiology, characteristics and management were analyzed. We identified 164 patients (including 1 patient who refused consent for registration), in our center with a suspicion of a renal tumor. The remaining 163 cases included WT (n = 118)/cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma (n = 2)/nephrogenic rests only (n = 6) and non-WT (n = 37). In this period, the NCR included 138 children, 1 17-year-old patient was not referred to the Princess Máxima Center. Central radiology review (before starting treatment) was performed in 121/163 patients, and central pathology review in 148/152 patients that underwent surgery. Treatment stratification, according to SIOP/EpSSG protocols was pursued based on multidisciplinary consensus. Preoperative chemotherapy was administered in 133 patients, whereas 19 patients underwent upfront surgery. Surgery was performed in 152 patients, and from 133 biomaterial was stored. Centralization of care for children with renal tumors led to referral of all but 1 new renal tumor cases in the Netherlands, and leads to referral of very rare subtypes not registered in the NCR, that benefit from high quality diagnostics and multidisciplinary decision making. National centralization of care led to enhanced development of molecular diagnostics and other innovation-based treatments for the future."
https://openalex.org/W4225823765,"High viral transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic has enabled SARS-CoV-2 to acquire new mutations that may impact genome sequencing methods. The ARTIC.v3 primer pool that amplifies short amplicons in a multiplex-PCR reaction is one of the most widely used methods for sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that some genomic intervals are poorly captured with ARTIC primers. To improve the genomic coverage and variant detection across these intervals, we designed long amplicon primers and evaluated the performance of a short (ARTIC) plus long amplicon (MRL) sequencing approach. Sequencing assays were optimized on VR-1986D-ATCC RNA followed by sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from fifteen COVID-19 positive patients. ARTIC data covered 94.47% of the virus genome fraction in the positive control and patient samples. Variant analysis in the ARTIC data detected 217 mutations, including 209 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and eight insertions & deletions. On the other hand, long-amplicon data detected 156 mutations, of which 80% were concordant with ARTIC data. Combined analysis of ARTIC + MRL data improved the genomic coverage to 97.03% and identified 214 high confidence mutations. The combined final set of 214 mutations included 203 SNVs, 8 deletions and 3 insertions. Analysis showed 26 SARS-CoV-2 lineage defining mutations including 4 known variants of concern K417N, E484K, N501Y, P618H in spike gene. Hybrid analysis identified 7 nonsynonymous and 5 synonymous mutations across the genome that were either ambiguous or not called in ARTIC data. For example, G172V mutation in the ORF3a protein and A2A mutation in Membrane protein were missed by the ARTIC assay. Thus, we show that while the short amplicon (ARTIC) assay provides good genomic coverage with high throughput, complementation of poorly captured intervals with long amplicon data can significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 genomic coverage and variant detection."

Further exploration revealed this pattern was confined to the less educated. The authors called this the 'mystery of American pain' since pain appears to rise with age in other countries irrespective of education. Revisiting this issue with the same cross-sectional data we show that what matters in explaining pain through to age 65 is whether one is working or not. The incidence of pain across the life-course is nearly identical for workers in America and elsewhere, but it is greater for non-working Americans than it is for non-workers elsewhere. As in other countries, pain is hump-shaped in age among those Americans out of work but rises a little over the life-course for those in work. Furthermore, these patterns are apparent within educational groups. We show that, if one ascribes age-specific employment rates from other OECD countries to Americans, the age profile of pain in the United States is more similar to that found elsewhere in the OECD. This is because employment rates are lower in the United States than elsewhere between ages 30 and 60: the simulation reduces the pain contribution of these non-workers to overall pain in America, so it looks somewhat similar to pain elsewhere. We conclude that what matters in explaining pain over the life-course is whether one is working or not and once that is accounted for, the patterns are consistent across the United States and the rest of the OECD."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of UEDVT in patients affected by moderate-severe COVID-19 infection and to identify potential associated risk factors for its occurrence.We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients affected by moderate-severe COVID-19 infection admitted to our unit. In accordance with the local protocol, all patients had undergone a systematic screening for the diagnosis of UEDVT, by vein compression ultrasonography (CUS). All the patients were receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis according to international guidelines recommendations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with UEDVT.257 patients were included in the study, 28 patients were affected by UEDVT with an incidence of 10.9% (95% CI, 7.1-14.7). At univariate analysis UEDVT appeared to be significantly associated (p< 0.05) with pneumonia, ARDS, PaO2/FiO2, D-dimer value higher than the age adjusted cut off value and need for CPAP ventilation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between UEDVT and the need for CPAP ventilation (OR 5.95; 95% IC 1.33-26.58). Increased mortality was found in patients affected by UEDVT compared to those who were not (OR 3.71; 95% CI, 1.41-9.78).UEDVT can occur in COVID-19 patients despite adequate prophylaxis especially in patients undergoing helmet CPAP ventilation.

The present study investigated the effect of buprenorphine on animal welfare, pain-related behaviour and model-specific parameters during the disease progression in a rat model of CFA-induced monoarthritis. The aim was to reduce or eliminate unnecessary pain in this model, in order to improve animal welfare and to avoid suffering, without compromising the quality of the model. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with 20 μl of CFA into the left tibio-tarsal joint to induce monoarthritis. Rats were treated with either buprenorphine or carprofen for 15 days during the disease development, and were compared to a saline-treated CFA-injected group or a negative control group. Measurements of welfare, pain-related behaviour and clinical model-specific parameters were collected. The study was terminated after 3 weeks, ending with a histopathologic analysis. Regardless of treatment, CFA-injected rats displayed mechanical hyperalgesia and developed severe histopathological changes associated with arthritis. However, no severe effects on general welfare were found at any time. Buprenorphine treatment reduced facial pain expression scores, improved mobility, stance and lameness scores and it did not supress the CFA-induced ankle swelling, contrary to carprofen. Although buprenorphine failed to demonstrate a robust analgesic effect on the mechanical hyperalgesia in this study, it did not interfere with the development of the intended pathology."

https://openalex.org/W4206287096,"Snakebite accidents are considered category A neglected tropical diseases. Brazil stands out for snakebite accidents, mainly in the Amazon region. The best possible care after snakebite accidents is to obtain antiophidic sera on time. And the maximum ideal time to reach it is about 2 hours after an accident. Based on public health information and using a tool to analyze geographical accessibility, we evaluate the possibility of reaching Brazilian serum-providing health facilities from the relationship between population distribution and commuting time. In this exploratory descriptive study, the geographic accessibility of Brazilian population to health facilities that supply antiophidic serum is evaluated through a methodology that articulates several issues that influence the commuting time to health units (ACCESSMOD): population and facilities' distribution, transportation network and means, relief and land use, which were obtained in Brazilian and international sources. The relative importance of the population without the possibility of reaching a facility in two hours is highlighted for Macro-Regions, States and municipalities. About nine million people live in locations more than two hours away from serum-providing facilities, with relevant variations between regions, states, and municipalities. States like Mato Grosso, Pará and Maranhão had the most important participation of population with reaching time problems to those units. The most significant gaps are found in areas with a dispersed population and sometimes characterized by a high incidence of snakebites, such as in the North of the country, especially in the Northeastern Pará state. Even using a 2010 population distribution information, because of the 2020 Census postponement, the tendencies and characteristics analyzed reveal challenging situations over the country. The growing availability of serum-providing health facilities, the enhanced possibilities of transporting accident victims, and even the availability of sera in other types of establishments are actions that would allow expanding the possibilities of access to serum supply."
https://openalex.org/W4205423800,"The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein Orb2 is a key regulator of long-term memory (LTM) in Drosophila. The N-terminus of the Orb2 isoform A is required for LTM and forms cross-β fibrils on its own. However, this N-terminus is not part of the core found in ex vivo fibrils. We previously showed that besides forming cross-β fibrils, the N-terminus of Orb2A binds anionic lipid membranes as an amphipathic helix. Here, we show that the Orb2A N-terminus can similarly interact with calcium activated calmodulin (CaM) and that this interaction prevents fibril formation. Because CaM is a known regulator of LTM, this interaction could potentially explain the regulatory role of Orb2A in LTM."
https://openalex.org/W4225639058,"The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that excessive accumulation of amyloid beta-peptides is the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease. These neurotoxic peptides are generated from the amyloid precursor protein via sequential cleavage by β- and γ-secretases in the 'amyloidogenic' proteolytic pathway. Alternatively, the amyloid precursor protein can be processed via the 'non-amyloidogenic' pathway which, through the action of the α-secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10, both precludes amyloid beta-peptide formation and has the additional benefit of generating a neuroprotective soluble amyloid precursor protein fragment, sAPPα. In the current study, we investigated whether the orphan drug, dichloroacetate, could alter amyloid precursor protein proteolysis. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, dichloroacetate enhanced sAPPα generation whilst inhibiting β-secretase processing of endogenous amyloid precursor protein and the subsequent generation of amyloid beta-peptides. Over-expression of the amyloid precursor protein partly ablated the effect of dichloroacetate on amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing whilst over-expression of the β-secretase only ablated the effect on amyloidogenic processing. Similar enhancement of ADAM-mediated amyloid precursor protein processing by dichloroacetate was observed in unrelated cell lines and the effect was not exclusive to the amyloid precursor protein as an ADAM substrate, as indicated by dichloroacetate-enhanced proteolysis of the Notch ligand, Jagged1. Despite altering proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein, dichloroacetate did not significantly affect the expression/activity of α-, β- or γ-secretases. In conclusion, dichloroacetate can inhibit amyloidogenic and promote non-amyloidogenic proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. Given the small size and blood-brain-barrier permeability of the drug, further research into its mechanism of action with respect to APP proteolysis may lead to the development of therapies for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W4205763869,"Determination of the self-reported walking capacity by interview or standardized questionnaire is important. However, the existing questionnaires require the patient to be able to read and write in a specific language. We recently proposed the WELSH (Walking Estimated Limitation Stated by History) tool to be administrable to illiterate people. The main objective was to assess the applicability of WELSH tool in the community and in a large group. We performed a prospective study in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso during June 2020. We recruited 630 interviewers among medical students. They were trained to administer the WELSH, and to conduct a 6-minute walk test. We performed a Pearson's ""r"" correlation between the WELSH and maximal walking distance (MWD). Of the 1723 participants available for the analysis, 757 (43.9%: 41.6-46.3) never went to school or attended only elementary school. The percentage of questionnaires with participant filling-in errors corrected by the investigator decreased with the decrease in educational level (p<0.001). The average WELSH score was 53 ± 22 and the average MWD was 383 ±142 meters. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the WELSH score and the MWD was r = 0.567 (p<0.001). Correlations ranged from 0.291 to 0.576 in males and females, (all p values < 0.05) and in different levels of education, with the highest coefficients found in illiterate people. The WELSH is feasible on the community by a wide variety of interviewers. It correlates with the MWD estimated by the 6-minutes' walk test even for people with little or no schooling."

https://openalex.org/W4206553020,"This replication underlines the importance of outlier diagnostics since many researchers have long neglected influential observations in OLS regression analysis. In his article, entitled ""Primary Resources, Secondary Labor,"" Shin finds that advanced democracies with increased natural resource wealth, particularly from oil and natural gas production, are more likely to restrict low-skill immigration policy. By performing outlier diagnostics, this replication shows that Shin's findings are a statistical artifact. When one outlying country, Norway, is removed from the sample data, I observe almost no significant and negative relationship between oil wealth and immigration policy. When two outlying countries are excluded, the effect of oil wealth completely disappears. Robust regression analysis, a widely used remedial method for outlier problems, confirms the results of my outlier diagnostics."

https://openalex.org/W4206737806,"Introduction A potential complication of term prelabor rupture of membranes (term PROM) is chorioamnionitis with an increased burden on neonatal outcomes of chronic lung disease and cerebral palsy. The purpose of the study was to analyze the efficacy of a standing clinical protocol designed to identify women with term PROM at low risk for chorioamnionitis, who may benefit from expectant management, and those at a higher risk for chorioamnionitis, who may benefit from early induction. Material and methods This retrospective study enrolled all consecutive singleton pregnant women with term PROM. Subjects included women with at least one of the following factors: white blood cell count ≥ 15×100/μL, C-reactive protein ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, or positive vaginal swab for beta-hemolytic streptococcus. These women comprised the high risk (HR) group and underwent immediate induction of labor by the administration of intravaginal dinoprostone. Women with none of the above factors and those with a low risk for chorioamnionitis waited for up to 24 hours for spontaneous onset of labor and comprised the low-risk (LR) group. Results Of the 884 consecutive patients recruited, 65 fulfilled the criteria for HR chorioamnionitis and underwent immediate induction, while 819 were admitted for expectant management. Chorioamnionitis and Cesarean section rates were not significantly different between the HR and LR groups. However, the prevalence of maternal fever (7.7% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.04) and meconium-stained amniotic fluid was significantly higher in the HR group than in LR group (6.1% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.04). This study found an overall incidence of 4.2% for chorioamnionitis, 10.9% for Cesarean section, 0.5% for umbilical artery blood pH &lt; 7.10, and 1.9% for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, no confirmed cases of neonatal sepsis were encountered. Conclusions A clinical protocol designed to manage, by immediate induction, only those women with term PROM who presented with High Risk factors for infection/inflammation achieved similar maternal and perinatal outcomes between such women and women without any risks who received expectant management. This reduced the need for universal induction of term PROM patients, thereby reducing the incidence of maternal and fetal complications without increasing the rate of Cesarean sections."
