https://openalex.org/W2094448442,"Automated partial DNA sequencing was conducted on more than 600 randomly selected human brain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This fast approach to cDNA characterization will facilitate the tagging of most human genes in a few years at a fraction of the cost of complete genomic sequencing, provide new genetic markers, and serve as a resource in diverse biological research fields."

https://openalex.org/W1995856480,"The tumor-suppressor gene p53 is altered by missense mutation in numerous human malignancies. However, the biochemical properties of p53 and the effect of mutation on these properties are unclear. A human DNA sequence was identified that binds specifically to wild-type human p53 protein in vitro. As few as 33 base pairs were sufficient to confer specific binding. Certain guanines within this 33-base pair region were critical, as methylation of these guanines or their substitution with thymine-abrogated binding. Human p53 proteins containing either of two missense mutations commonly found in human tumors were unable to bind significantly to this sequence. These data suggest that a function of p53 may be mediated by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences in the human genome, and that this activity is altered by mutations that occur in human tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1593931056,"The lipid fraction (fat cake) of rat epididymal adipocytes contains a prominent phosphoprotein (62 kDaapp by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) that is multiply phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo, at which point it migrates as a 65/67-kDaapp doublet by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is by far the most heavily radiolabeled protein in the cell. Western blot analysis of various tissues with immunopurified antibodies purified from antisera raised against the 62-kDa species suggests that the protein is specific for adipocytes. This protein, which we term perilipin, is found in differentiated cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but not in their precursor 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Immunocytochemical studies with specific antiserum shows that the perilipin is closely associated with the periphery of lipid storage droplets in cultured adipocytes. Given its adipocyte specificity, acute regulation by hormones, and subcellular location, we speculate that perilipin plays a role in the specialized lipid storage function of adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2139305314,"The crystal structure of the binary complex tRNA(Asp)-aspartyl tRNA synthetase from yeast was solved with the use of multiple isomorphous replacement to 3 angstrom resolution. The dimeric synthetase, a member of class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS's) exhibits the characteristic signature motifs conserved in eight aaRS's. These three sequence motifs are contained in the catalytic site domain, built around an antiparallel beta sheet, and flanked by three alpha helices that form the pocket in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the CCA end of tRNA bind. The tRNA(Asp) molecule approaches the synthetase from the variable loop side. The two major contact areas are with the acceptor end and the anticodon stem and loop. In both sites the protein interacts with the tRNA from the major groove side. The correlation between aaRS class II and the initial site of aminoacylation at 3'-OH can be explained by the structure. The molecular association leads to the following features: (i) the backbone of the GCCA single-stranded portion of the acceptor end exhibits a regular helical conformation; (ii) the loop between residues 320 and 342 in motif 2 interacts with the acceptor stem in the major groove and is in contact with the discriminator base G and the first base pair UA; and (iii) the anticodon loop undergoes a large conformational change in order to bind the protein. The conformation of the tRNA molecule in the complex is dictated more by the interaction with the protein than by its own sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1972372902,"National, longitudinal surveys from Great Britain and the United States were used to investigate the effects of divorce on children. In both studies, a subsample of children who were in two-parent families during the initial interview (at age 7 in the British data and at ages 7 to 11 in the U.S. data) were followed through the next interview (at age 11 and ages 11 to 16, respectively). At both time points in the British data, parents and teachers independently rated the children's behavior problems, and the children were given reading and mathematics achievement tests. At both time points in the U.S. data, parents rated the children's behavior problems. Children whose parents divorced or separated between the two time points were compared to children whose families remained intact. For boys, the apparent effect of separation or divorce on behavior problems and achievement at the later time point was sharply reduced by considering behavior problems, achievement levels, and family difficulties that were present at the earlier time point, before any of the families had broken up. For girls, the reduction in the apparent effect of divorce occurred to a lesser but still noticeable extent once preexisting conditions were considered."
https://openalex.org/W2047945116,"In the interleukin-2 (IL-2) system, intracellular signal transduction is triggered by the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R beta); however, the responsible signaling mechanism remains unidentified. Evidence for the formation of a stable complex of IL-2R beta and the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck is presented. Specific association sites were identified in the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain of p56lck and in the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2R beta. As a result of interaction, IL-2R beta became phosphorylated in vitro by p56lck. Treatment of T lymphocytes with IL-2 promotes p56lck kinase activity. These data suggest the participation of p56lck as a critical signaling molecule downstream of IL-2R via a novel interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2052709323,"Three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers dramatic improvements in spectral resolution by spreading through-bond and through-space correlations in three and four orthogonal frequency axes. Simultaneously, large heteronuclear couplings are exploited to circumvent problems due to the larger linewidths that are associated with increasing molecular weight. These novel experiments have been designed to extend the application of NMR as a method for determining three-dimensional structures of proteins in solution beyond the limits of conventional two-dimensional NMR (approximately 100 residues) to molecules in the 150- to 300-residue range. This potential has recently been confirmed with the determination of the high-resolution NMR structure of a protein greater than 150 residues, namely, interleukin-1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1551254087,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme), the multiprotein replicase of Escherichia coli, is essentially unlimited in processive DNA synthesis. Processive activity can be reconstituted from two components. One component, the beta preinitiation complex, is a beta dimer clamped onto primed DNA. The beta preinitiation complex is formed by the five-protein gamma complex, which hydrolyzes ATP to chaperone beta onto primed DNA. The other component is the alpha epsilon polymerase. The alpha epsilon polymerase itself is not processive, but is endowed with extremely high processive activity upon assembly with the beta preinitiation complex. Here we examine the mechanism by which the beta preinitiation complex confers processivity onto the alpha epsilon polymerase. We find the beta preinitiation complex to be mobile on DNA. Diffusion of beta on DNA is specific to duplex DNA, is bidirectional, does not require ATP, and appears to diffuse linearly along the duplex. Furthermore, beta directly binds the alpha epsilon polymerase through contact with alpha, the DNA polymerase subunit. Hence, the high processivity of the holoenzyme is rooted in a sliding clamp of beta on DNA that tethers the polymerase to the primed template. Implications for transcription and translation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069179692,"To search for histone domains that may regulate transcription in vivo, we made deletions and amino acid substitutions in the histone N-termini of S. cerevisiae. Histone H4 N-terminal residues 4-23, which include the extremely conserved, reversibly acetylated lysines (at positions 5, 8, 12, and 16), were found to encompass a region required for the activation of the GAL1 promoter. Deletions in the H4 N-terminus reduce GAL1 activation 20-fold. This effect is specific to histone H4 in that large deletions in the N-termini of H2A, H2B, and H3 do not similarly decrease induction. Activation of the PHO5 promoter is reduced approximately 4- to 5-fold by these H4 deletions. Mutations in histone H4 acetylation sites and surrounding residues can cause comparable and, in some cases, even greater effects on induction of these two promoters. We postulate that the H4 N-terminus may interact with a component of the transcription initiation complex, allowing nucleosome unfolding and subsequent initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1967897161,"Calmodulin is a small Ca(2+)-binding protein proposed to act as the intracellular Ca2+ receptor that translates Ca2+ signals into cellular responses. We have constructed mutant yeast calmodulins in which the Ca(2+)-binding loops have been altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the mutant proteins has a dramatically reduced affinity for Ca2+; one does not bind detectable levels of 45Ca2+ either during gel filtration or when bound to a solid support. Furthermore, none of the mutant proteins change conformation even in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations. Surprisingly, yeast strains relying on any of the mutant calmodulins not only survive but grow well. In contrast, yeast strains deleted for the calmodulin gene are not viable. Thus, calmodulin is required for growth, but it can perform its essential function without the apparent ability to bind Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W2016817019,"The identification of specialized areas in the mammalian neocortex, such as the primary visual or somatosensory cortex, is based on distinctions in architectural and functional features. The extent to which certain features that distinguish neocortical areas in rats are prespecified or emerge as a result of epigenetic interactions was investigated. Late embryonic visual cortex transplanted to neonatal somatosensory cortex was later assayed for ""barrels,"" anatomically identified functional units unique to somatosensory cortex, and for boundaries of glycoconjugated molecules associated with barrels. Barrels and boundaries form in transplanted visual cortex and are organized in an array that resembles the pattern in the normal barrelfield. These findings show that different regions of the developing neocortex have similar potentials to differentiate features that distinguish neocortical areas and contribute to their unique functional organizations."
https://openalex.org/W1531561158,"We have determined the subunit stoichiometry of chicken neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes by quantitation of the amount of radioactivity in individual subunits of [35S] methionine-labeled receptors. The chicken neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be a pentamer of two alpha 4 acetylcholine-binding subunits and three beta 2 structural subunits. We also show that these expressed receptors bind L-[3H]nicotine with high affinity, are transported to the surface of the oocyte outer membrane, and cosediment on sucrose gradients with acetylcholine receptors isolated from chicken brain. Using this unique and generally applicable method of determining subunit stoichiometry of receptors expressed in oocytes, we obtained the expected (alpha 1) 2 beta 1 gamma delta stoichiometry for muscle-type acetylcholine receptors assembled from coexpression of either Torpedo alpha 1 or human alpha 1 subunits, with Torpedo beta 1, gamma, and delta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1589395925,"Human plasma platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase hydrolyzes the sn-2 acetyl residue of PAF, but not phospholipids with long chain sn-2 residues. It is associated with low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and is the LDL-associated phospholipase A2 activity that specifically degrades oxidatively damaged phospholipids (Stremler, K. E., Stafforini, D. M., Prescott, S. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and McIntyre, T. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5331-5334). To identify potential substrates, we synthesized phosphatidylcholines with sn-2 residues from two to nine carbon atoms long, and found the V/k ratio decreased as the sn-2 residue was lengthened: the C5 homolog was 50%, the C6 20%, while the C9 homolog was only 2% as efficient as PAF. However, the presence of an omega-oxo function radically affected hydrolysis: the half-life of the sn-2 9-aldehydic homolog was identical to that of PAF. We oxidized [2-arachidonoyl]phosphatidylcholine and isolated a number of more polar phosphatidylcholines. We treated these with phospholipase C, derivatized the resulting diglycerides for gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopic analysis, and found a number of diglycerides where the m/z ratio was consistent with a series of short to medium length sn-2 residues. We treated the polar phosphatidylcholines with acetylhydrolase and derivatized the products for analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The liberated residues were more polar than straight chain standards and had m/z ratios from 129 to 296, consistent with short to medium chain residues. Therefore, oxidation fragments the sn-2 residue of phospholipids, and the acetylhydrolase specifically degrades such oxidatively fragmented phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1555561206,"We demonstrate that unstimulated platelets attach to immobilized fibrinogen in a selective process mediated by the membrane glycoprotein (GP) complex IIb-IIIa (alpha IIb beta 3). The initial attachment, independent of platelet activation, is followed by spreading and irreversible adhesion even in the presence of activation inhibitors. Using fibrinogen fragments derived from plasmin digestion, we found that unstimulated platelets do not attach to immobilized fragment E, which contains an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence at A alpha 95-97, and adhere to fragments X and D, both containing the gamma 400-411 dodecapeptide adhesion sequence, less efficiently than to intact fibrinogen. Thus, the carboxyl terminus of the A alpha chain, missing in the early fragment X used in these studies, appears to be involved in the interaction of fibrinogen with unstimulated platelets. In contrast, activated platelets adhere to immobilized fibrinogen and fragments X, D, and E in a time-dependent and equivalent manner. Although activated platelets adhere to immobilized vitronectin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor through GP IIb-IIIa, unstimulated platelets fail to adhere to vitronectin and have only a limited capacity to adhere to fibronectin and von Willebrand factor. These results demonstrate that GP IIb-IIIa on unstimulated platelets displays a recognition specificity for attachment to immobilized adhesive proteins that is distinct from that seen following platelet activation. Thus, unstimulated platelets selectively interact with fibrinogen, and the initial attachment is followed by spreading and irreversible adhesion in the absence of exogenous agonists. This process may be regulated by plasmin cleavage of the fibrinogen A alpha chain and may play an important role during normal hemostasis and during the pathological development of thrombotic vascular occlusions."
https://openalex.org/W1571990028,"From conditions for production in Fusarium oxysporum of the unique nitrate/nitrite-inducible cytochrome P-450, tentatively called P-450dNIR, it was expected that the fungus is capable of metabolizing nitrate dissimilatively. Here we report that F. oxysporum exhibits a distinct denitrifying ability which results in the anaerobic evolution of nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrate or nitrite. Comparison of the cell growth during denitrification indicated that the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite is an energetically favorable process in F. oxysporum; however, further reduction of nitrite to N2O might be energy-exhausting and may function as a detoxification mechanism. A potent nitrite reductase activity to form N2O could be reconstituted by combination of the cell-free extract prepared from the denitrifying cells and an NADH-phenadinemethosulfate-dependent reducing system. The activity was strongly inhibited by carbon monoxide, cyanide, oxygen (O2), and the antibody against P-450dNIR. The results, along with those concerning inducing conditions of P-450dNIR, were highly indicative that the cytochrome is involved in the denitrifying nitrite reduction. This work has thus presented not only the first demonstration that a eukaryote exhibits a marked denitrifying ability, but also the first instance of a cytochrome P-450 that is involved in a reducing reaction with a distinct physiological significance against a hydrophilic, inorganic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2039019845,"A transgene, pHRD, is highly methylated in 12 independent mouse lines when in a C57BL/6 strain background, but becomes progressively less methylated when bred into a DBA/2 background. Transgenes inherited from the mother are generally more methylated; however, this parental effect disappears following continued breeding into the nonmethylating strain. Mapping experiments using BXD recombinant inbred mice as well as other inbred strains indicate that a single strain-specific modifier (Ssm-1) linked to, but distinct from, Fv-1 is responsible for the strain effect. In addition to the methylated and unmethylated transgenic phenotypes, certain mice exhibit a partial methylation pattern that is a consequence of an unusual cellular mosaicism. The pHRD transgene, containing target sequences for the V(D)J recombinase, undergoes site-specific recombination only in lymphoid tissues. This V-J joining is restricted primarily to unmethylated transgene copies."
https://openalex.org/W2055636296,"The neural integrator, which converts eye velocity signals into position signals, is central to oculomotor theory. Similar integrators are probably necessary in any neural system that changes and maintains muscular tension. The integrator for horizontal eye position is in the pons, but the locations of the vertical and torsional integrators have not been clearly defined. Recording three-dimensional eye movements in alert monkeys during microstimulation and pharmacological inactivation of midbrain sites showed that the interstitial nucleus of Cajal generates both the torsional and vertical eye position signals. Up and down signals are linked with clockwise signals in the right brain and counterclockwise signals in the left brain. This three-dimensional coordinate system achieves orthogonality and bilateral symmetry without redundancy and optimizes energy efficiency for horizontal visual scanning."
https://openalex.org/W2068025089,"The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily and participates in the regulation of several genes. While a number of functions have been ascribed to COUP-TF, no ligand or activator molecule has been identified, and thus it is classified as one of a group of orphan receptors. Activation of COUP-TF by physiological concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine was observed in transient transfection assays. Treatment of transfected cells with the dopamine receptor agonist alpha-ergocryptine also activated COUP-dependent expression of a reporter gene. COUP-TF that contained a deletion in the COOH-terminal domain was not activated by these compounds. These observations suggest that dopamine may be a physiological activator of COUP-TF."

https://openalex.org/W1970421002,"The nucleotides crucial for the specific aminoacylation of yeast tRNA(Asp) by its cognate synthetase have been identified. Steady-state aminoacylation kinetics of unmodified tRNA transcripts indicate that G34, U35, C36, and G73 are important determinants of tRNA(Asp) identity. Mutations at these positions result in a large decrease (19- to 530-fold) of the kinetic specificity constant (ratio of the catalytic rate constant kcat and the Michaelis constant Km) for aspartylation relative to wild-type tRNA(Asp). Mutation to G10-C25 within the D-stem reduced kcat/Km eightfold. This fifth mutation probably indirectly affects the presentation of the highly conserved G10 nucleotide to the synthetase. A yeast tRNA(Phe) was converted into an efficient substrate for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase through introduction of the five identity elements. The identity nucleotides are located in regions of tight interaction between tRNA and synthetase as shown in the crystal structure of the complex and suggest sites of base-specific contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1539235241,"The activation of human coagulation factor IX by human tissue factor.factor VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ (TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+) and factor Xa.PCPS.Ca2+ enzyme complexes was investigated. Reactions were performed in a highly purified system consisting of isolated human plasma proteins and recombinant human tissue factor with synthetic phospholipid vesicles (PCPS: 75% phosphatidylcholine (PC), 25% phosphatidylserine (PS)). Factor IX activation was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, [3H]factor IX activation peptide assay, colorimetric substrate thiobenzyl benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysinate (Z-Lys-SBzl) hydrolysis, and specific incorporation of a fluorescent peptidyl chloromethyl ketone. Factor IX activation by the TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ enzyme complex was observed to proceed through the obligate non-enzymatic intermediate species factor IX alpha. The simultaneous activation of human coagulation factors IX and X by the TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ enzyme complex were investigated. When factors IX and X were presented to the TF.VIIa complex, at equal concentrations, it was observed that the rate of factor IX activation remained unchanged while the rate of factor X activation slowed by 45%. When the proteolytic cleavage products of this reaction were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was observed that the intermediate species factor IX alpha was generated more rapidly when factor X was present in the reaction mixture. When factor IX was treated with factor Xa.PCPS in the presence of Ca2+, it was observed that factor IX was rapidly converted to factor IX alpha. The activation of factor IX alpha by the TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ complex was evaluated, and it was observed that factor IX alpha was activated more rapidly by the TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ complex than was factor IX itself. These data suggest that factors IX and X, when presented to the TF.VIIa.PCPS.Ca2+ enzyme complex, are both rapidly activated and that factor Xa, which is generated in the initial stages of the extrinsic pathway, participates in the first proteolytic step in the activation of factor IX, the generation of factor IX alpha."

https://openalex.org/W2024654045,"The Dictyostelium ecmB gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein and is inducible by the stalk cell morphogen DIF. It is expressed in a subset of prestalk (pstB) cells in the slug and surrounding pstA cells first express it at culmination. A region of the ecmB promoter can direct transcription in all anterior prestalk cells, but a separate, downstream region acts to prevent its expression in pstA cells prior to culmination. This may be the site of interaction of a repressor, regulated by an extracellular antagonist to DIF. At culmination, expression of the ecmB gene also becomes greatly elevated in anterior-like cells as they move to surround the spore mass. A distal region of the ecmB promoter directs increased expression in those anterior-like cells that surmount the spore head. This divergence in gene expression suggests that anterior-like cells and anterior prestalk cells experience different inductive conditions at culmination."

https://openalex.org/W1567513330,"Several years ago, we proposed that polypeptide regions rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) (PEST) target intracellular proteins for destruction (Rogers, S., Wells, R., and Rechsteiner, M. (1986) Science 234, 364-368). To test the PEST hypothesis, we have produced chimeric proteins in which the N or C terminus of mouse dihydrofolate reductase is extended by the PEST-containing C terminus of mouse ornithine decarboxylase. Oligonucleotides encoding the 37 C-terminal residues of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (mODC) or equivalent lengths of dissimilar amino acids were inserted at appropriate sites in a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expression vector. The various fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by enzyme affinity chromatography. All purified fusion proteins exhibited similar abilities to convert dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, thereby demonstrating that the attachment of peptide extensions to either terminus did not prevent the proper folding of DHFR. Metabolic stabilities of the radioiodinated fusion proteins were assayed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or Xenopus egg extract. Proteolysis was found to be energy-dependent with mODC-DHFR fusion proteins being degraded from 2 to almost 40-fold faster than the parental DHFR molecule or DHFR fusion proteins bearing non-PEST extensions. Deletion of most of the PEST region from the mODC extension resulted in a significantly more stable fusion protein. Rapid proteolysis of DHFR proteins containing intact mODC extensions provides support for the PEST hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1516578436,"The human immunodeficiency virus binds to CD4+ T lymphocytes through the interaction of its envelope glycoprotein (gp120) with the CD4 molecule. The src-related protein tyrosine kinase p56lck is physically associated with CD4 and is co-immunoprecipitated by CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Activators of protein kinase C (PKC) cause the dissociation of p56lck from CD4. Here we report that gp120 mAb immunoprecipitated the p56lck.CD4.gp120 complex after short term treatment (20 min) of human T lymphocytes with gp120. The p56lck that was associated with the CD4.gp120 complex was dissociated by activators of PKC. This effect was abolished by pretreatment of cells with PKC inhibitors. Thus the p56lck.CD4.gp120 immune complex immunoprecipitated by gp120 mAb behaves in a similar manner, with respect to PKC activation or inhibition, to the p56lck.CD4 complex immunoprecipitated by CD4 mAb. Short term treatment of cells with gp120, followed by gp120 mAb, resulted in an increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck associated with CD4. However, the amount of enzyme associated with CD4 remained unchanged. Long term treatment (20 h) of human T lymphocytes with gp120 resulted in the down-regulation of cell surface CD4 molecules. A parallel decrease in CD4-associated gp120 was also observed. In addition, gp120 caused the dissociation of p56lck and CD4. However, the dissociation of the p56lck from CD4 occurred at much faster rate than the down-regulation of surface CD4 molecules. Such mechanisms may account for the down-regulation of cell surface CD4 molecules and the depletion of functional CD4+ T lymphocytes which are characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus infections and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1494810963,"The DNA binding characteristics of the rat nuclear matrix were investigated. A saturable and temperature-dependent, salt-resistant DNA binding to the nuclear matrix was discovered, with 70-80% of total bound DNA resistant to extraction with high concentrations of salt at 37 degrees C, compared to less than 5% at 0 degrees C. The initial binding of DNA to nuclear matrix is sensitive to salt concentration, indicating a transition to a salt-resistant binding state. The nuclear matrix shows a preference for single-stranded DNA, both in saturation and competition assays, with little binding of RNA or double-stranded DNA. Further competition studies show a preference for matrix-attached DNA probably involving predominantly AT-rich sequences, while a specific sequence defined previously as a matrix-attached region (MAR; Cockerill, P. N., and Garrard, W. T. (1986) Cell 46, 273-282) only showed preference for a limited number of the total matrix binding sites. These results and estimates from saturation data of approximately 150,000 single-stranded DNA binding sites per matrix lead us to propose that the nuclear matrix contains different classes of DNA binding sites, each with a separate sequence specificity. Binding of DNA to individual matrix polypeptides separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose blots was also temperature-dependent, salt-resistant, and showed a preference for binding DNA over RNA and nuclear matrix DNA over total genomic DNA. Subnuclear fractionation experiments further demonstrated that the nuclear matrix is enriched in the subset of higher molecular weight (greater than 50,000) DNA binding proteins of isolated nuclei and correspondingly depleted of the lower molecular weight ones. Of the approximately 12 major proteins separated on nonequilibrium two-dimensional gels, 7 were identified as specific DNA binding proteins including lamins A and C (but not B), and the internal nuclear matrix proteins, matrins D, E, F, G, and 4."
https://openalex.org/W1636845236,"Biotination of proteins is a post-translational modification that requires a folded acceptor domain. We previously showed that an acceptor domain fused to the carboxyl terminus of several cytosolic proteins results in biotinated fusion proteins in vivo. We now show that proteins encoded by translational gene fusions of two periplasmic proteins, alkaline phosphatase and TEM beta-lactamase, to carboxyl-terminal biotin-accepting sequences are biotinated and exported by Escherichia coli. Expression of the alkaline phosphatase fusion protein in wild type strains resulted in inefficient biotination of the fusion product. This result was due to the rapid export of the acceptor protein before biotination could occur since a very large increase in biotinated fusion protein levels was observed in strains lacking the SecB chaperone protein. The beta-lactamase fusion protein was biotinated but was only stable in strains lacking the DegP periplasmic protease. Both biotinated fusion proteins accumulated in the culture medium in strains possessing defective outer membranes. These results indicate that the export machinery can accommodate both a post-translational modification and a protein domain previously folded into its mature conformation in vivo."

Structural studies of this complex have been limited because only very small amount of samples are available. Therefore devising an efficient method of crystallization was essential. The addition of a phospholipid and its subsequent slow depletion by phospholipase A2 have been used to successfully grow well-ordered monolayer crystals that extend up to about 10 micrometers. The interaction of the L-P ring complex with lipid membranes was also visualized during this process."
https://openalex.org/W1484741277,"Gel retardation analysis with full- and half-palindromic sequences using partially purified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resulted in GR-glucocorticoid response element (GRE) species of identical mobilities, suggesting that formation of the dimeric GR protein complex is not catalyzed by DNA binding. These results are in contrast to the behavior of the isolated DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor where dimerization occurred on the GRE. Density gradient centrifugation of cytosolic GR resulted in two forms, a 4 S peak characteristic of the monomeric GR and a fraction which sediments at 6 S which is consistent with the observed size of the dimeric GR. These two forms were found to differ in their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences with the 6 S species having a higher affinity for a GRE. Taken together our results are consistent with a two-step model for hormone-induced transformation of GR: dissociation of the multimeric untransformed complex and dimerization of the GR to yield a high affinity DNA binding species."
https://openalex.org/W1479935039,"Protein Z is a vitamin K-dependent protein of unknown function present in normal bovine plasma at a concentration of approximately 0.1 microM. Quantitative affinity chromatographic studies using diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP)-thrombin-Affi-Gel 10 as the affinity matrix and free DIP-thrombin as the competitor demonstrated that protein Z interacts with DIP-thrombin with a dissociation constant of 0.15 +/- 0.05 microM. Binding was independent of Ca2+. Protein C and factor IX, other vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins with the same domain structure as that of protein Z, did not interact with immobilized DIP-thrombin under these conditions; and factor X interacted with an affinity 20-fold lower than that for protein Z. The Michaelis constant, Km, for hydrolysis of pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide by thrombin was increased 1.8-fold, from 130 to 230 microM, as a result of the binding of protein Z and the Km for H-Val-Leu-Arg-p-nitroanilide 1.4-fold, from 390 to 560 microM. From these kinetic studies, a dissociation constant of 0.11 +/- 0.04 microM was calculated for the binding of protein Z to alpha-thrombin. Protein Z bound to large phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphatidylserine, 75% phosphatidylcholine) with a dissociation constant of 0.39 +/- 0.16 microM at a phospholipid to protein ratio of 82 mol of phospholipid/mol of protein Z at saturation. In the presence of protein Z thrombin associated with phospholipid vesicles, whereas thrombin did not interact with phospholipid vesicles in the absence of protein Z. These studies, therefore, demonstrate a physiologically relevant interaction between protein Z and thrombin. They also suggest a mechanism whereby thrombin is localized to an injury site by virtue of its interaction with protein Z bound to phospholipid surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1585692737,"We have subjected the FLP protein of the 2-micron plasmid to partial proteolysis by proteinase K and have found that FLP can be digested into two major proteinase K-resistant peptides of 21 and 13 kDa, respectively. The 21-kDa peptide contains a site-specific DNA-binding domain that binds to the FLP recognition target (FRT) site with an affinity similar to that observed for the native FLP protein. This peptide can induce DNA bending upon binding to a DNA fragment containing the FRT site, but the angle of the bend (approximately 24 degrees) is smaller in magnitude than that induced by the native FLP protein (60 degrees). The additional DNA bending induced by the interaction between two native FLP molecules bound to the FRT site is not observed with the 21-kDa DNA-binding peptide. Amino-terminal sequencing has been used to map this peptide to an internal region of FLP that begins at residue Leu-148. It is likely that the DNA-binding peptide includes the catalytic site of the FLP protein."
https://openalex.org/W1548456834,"Type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase is an integral membrane protein catalyzing the phenolic ring deiodination of thyroxine. We recently showed that the substrate binding subunit of this approximately 50-kDa protein is selectively labeled with N-bromoacetyl-L-thyroxine, allowing ready identification of the type I enzyme without the need to maintain catalytic activity. In this study, we used both affinity labeling and catalytic activity to determine the regional distribution of this enzyme in rat kidney and to localize the enzyme to specific plasma membrane domain(s) of renal epithelial cells. The type I enzyme was present exclusively in tubular epithelial cells of the outer renal cortex and co-purified with basolateral plasma membranes; the renal medulla lacked activity. LLC-PK1 cells, derived from the proximal convoluted tubule, have abundant type I 5'-deiodinating activity. We used this homogenous cell line to verify that the type I enzyme was localized to the cytosolic surface of the basolateral membrane. Digitonin permeabilization increased affinity labeling of the enzyme 4-fold, and approximately 75% of the affinity label was incorporated into the 27-kDa substrate binding subunit. Affinity labeling of the type I enzyme in LLC-PK1 cells mimicked the affinity labeling of the substrate binding subunit of type I 5'-deiodinase in rat kidney (Kohrle, J., Rasmussen, U. B., Ekenbarger, D. M., Alex, S., Rokos, H., Hesch, R. D., and Leonard, J. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6155-6163). Subcellular fractionation of LLC-PK1 cell homogenates showed that both affinity labeled and catalytically active type I enzyme were present on the cytosolic surface of the basolateral region of the renal cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1567078723,"The assembly of outer membrane proteins of Escherichia coli was examined using the OmpF porin as a model. Since this protein is made as a precursor, which is processed to a protein of Mr 37,000 before being assembled into trimers in the outer membrane, we synthesized a modified OmpF, which lacked 16 out of 22 amino acid residues from its signal sequence, in a coupled transcription-translation system. This modified protein resembled the unfolded, monomeric OmpF in its electrophoretic behavior, but much of the protein apparently existed in a more tightly folded conformation as it was recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific to a surface epitope of the native, trimeric OmpF porin. At least some conformers of this protein could be further incorporated into outer membrane or lipopolysaccharide bilayers, and assembled into trimers. The trimers formed were trypsin-resistant and heat-stable in sodium dodecyl sulfate up to 70 degrees C, thus showing the characteristics of the native trimeric protein. These results extend our earlier observation that OmpF monomer secreted by spheroplasts of E. coli can be trimerized in vitro (Sen, K., and Nikaido, H (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A 87, 743-747) and show that the trimerization can occur, albeit at a low efficiency, with porin monomers synthesized in vitro, presumably not contaminated by membrane fragments or other components of the cell envelope. However, comparison of trimerization efficiency of the nascent in vitro product with that of the same product already exposed to aqueous medium, as well as with that of the spheroplast-secreted product, leads us to the working hypothesis that the trimerization process in intact cells is accelerated either by accessory components or by the conformational changes accompanying the secretion through the cytoplasmic membrane and that the reactions observed in this study represent only part of the physiological process."
https://openalex.org/W1604377974,"We have previously shown that the infection of mouse L-cells with Newcastle disease virus activates transcription of the alpha 4 but not the alpha 6 interferon gene and that the induction is mediated by a 35-base pair inducible element (IE) found in the alpha 4 promoter (-109 to -75). In the present study, we show that the inactivity of the alpha 6 promoter can be mapped to 2 out of 6 nucleotides in which the alpha 6 differs from alpha 4 IE. The symmetrical sequence, GTAAAGAAAGT (-103 to -93), present in the alpha 4 IE is essential for its inducibility and binding of nuclear protein(s) to the alpha 4 IE."
https://openalex.org/W1530312409,"In this study, we have examined the interactions of the beta gamma subunit complex of the retinal GTP-binding protein transducin (beta gamma T) with its alpha subunit (alpha T) using fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. The beta gamma T subunit complex was covalently labeled with 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)napthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS), an environmentally sensitive fluorescent cysteine reagent. The formation of the MIANS beta gamma T complexes (two to five MIANS adducts per beta gamma T) resulted in 2-3-fold enhancements in the MIANS fluorescence, and 20-25-nm blue shifts in the fluorescence emission maxima, relative to the emission for identical concentrations of MIANS-labeled MIANS complexes. The addition of alpha T.GDP to these MIANS beta gamma T complexes resulted in an additional enhancement in the MIANS fluorescence (typically ranging from 20 to 40%) and a 5-10-nm blue shift in the wavelength for maximum emission. These fluorescence changes were specifically elicited by the GDP-bound form of alpha T and were not observed upon the addition of purified alpha T.guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) complexes to the MIANS beta gamma T species. Conditions which resulted in the activation of the alpha T.GDP subunit (i.e. the addition of AlF4- or the addition of rhodopsin-containing vesicles and GTP gamma S) resulted in a reversal of the alpha T.GDP-induced enhancement of the MIANS beta gamma T fluorescence. Thus the MIANS beta gamma T fluorescence provided a spectroscopic monitor for transducin-subunit association and transducin-activation. Based on the results from studies using this spectroscopic read-out, it appears that the association of the alpha T.GDP species with the beta gamma T subunit complex to form the holotransducin molecule is rapid and does not limit the rate of the rhodopsin-stimulated activation of holotransducin. However, either the dissociation of the activated alpha T subunit from the beta gamma T complex, or a conformational change in beta gamma T which occurs as a result of the subunit dissociation event, appears to be slow relative to the G protein-subunit association event."
https://openalex.org/W1497415820,"Interaction of cloned yeast, drosophila, and human transcription factor IID (yTFIID, dTFIID, and hTFIID, respectively) with the adenovirus 2 major late promoter (Ad2 MLP) confers a more limited pattern of DNase I protection than that obtained using highly purified native hTFIID (Hahn, S., Buratowski, S., Sharp, P. A. and Guarente, L. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 3379-3382; Van Dyke, M. W., and Sawadogo, M. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 3415-3420; Horikoshi, M., Wang, C.K., Fujii, H., Cromlish, J.A., Weil, P.A., and Roeder, R.G. (1989) Nature 341, 299-303; Peterson, M. G., Tanese, N., Pugh, B.F., and Tjian, R. (1990) Science 248, 1625-1630; Hoey, T., Dynlacht, B. D., Peterson, M.G., Pugh, B.F., and Tjian, R. (1990) Cell 61, 1179-1186). Since the mass of the cloned TFIIDs is considerably less than that of native hTFIID (27-38 kDa versus 120-140 kDa), it is considered likely that native hTFIID exists as a mixed heterodimer. We have recently identified, purified, and characterized a novel transcription factor that binds to the CAP site region (+1 to +23) of the Ad2 MLP. This CAP site binding factor, designated CBF, is required for optimal transcriptional activity. We now show that when bound to the Ad2 MLP, yTFIID and CBF interact to generate the extended pattern of DNase I protection conferred by native hTFIID. In addition, bound yTFIID and CBF interact such that the stability of the complex exceeds that of each factor bound alone. We also demonstrate the existence in nuclear extracts of a hTFIID and CBF heterodimer by the electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. CBF, therefore, may represent the first identified member of a large family of gene-specific TFIID-associated factors that are required for the regulated gene-specific expression of TFIID activity."
https://openalex.org/W1581785463,"Pyruvate oxidase of Escherichia coli, an enzyme greatly activated by phospholipids, is a tetramer of a Mr 62,000 subunit. We have utilized the differing electrophoretic mobilities of several mutant oxidases on native polyacrylamide gels to study the role of the quaternary structure of the enzyme in the activation process. We found that when two poxB gene alleles coexisted in cells, heterotetrameric species were formed in addition to homotetramers. The concentration of each tetrameric species varied according to the concentration of the different subunits present, and the distribution seemed virtually identical to those expected from random mixing. We showed that the intrinsic activity of pyruvate oxidase was not affected by interactions among the four subunits. However, binding of the enzyme to lipids, a property required for function in vivo, required that a tetramer contain at least two subunits capable of lipid binding. Our data fit the model proposed previously (Grabau, C., Chang, Y.-Y., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12510-12519) in which the carboxyl termini of two subunits interact to form a functional lipid-binding domain. We also have detected oxidase activity in a form of oxidase of unusually high electrophoretic mobility. This form seems to be either a monomeric or a dimeric form (more probably the former) of the oxidase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1527745414,"Cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450SCC) and 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (P450(17) alpha) are key enzymes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. The 5'-flanking regions of the corresponding bovine genes have recently been characterized in the adrenal-derived Y1 cell line and specific DNA sequences, required for basal and cAMP-dependent gene expression, were identified. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling P450SCC and P450(17) alpha gene expression throughout the ovarian cycle, we devised an electroporation protocol to transfect bovine luteal cells in primary culture with specific chimeric DNA constructs. Transfection of such cells with reporter gene constructs containing 186 base pairs (bp) or more of the CYP11A (P450SCC) 5'-regulatory region resulted in cAMP-responsive reporter gene expression. Reporter gene constructs containing 101 bp or less of this regulatory region were expressed neither in the presence nor in the absence of forskolin. Thus, expression of the CYP11A gene in bovine luteal cells in primary culture appears to be controlled by a cis-acting element located between -186 to -101 bp. Transfection of bovine luteal cells in primary culture with reporter gene constructs containing increasing deletions of the bovine CYP17 (P450(17) alpha) 5'-regulatory region clearly demonstrated that none of the sequences were capable of promoting significant reporter gene expression, neither in the presence nor absence of forskolin. Since no 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and no specific mRNA encoding P450(17) alpha have been detected in the bovine corpus luteum, the failure of expression of the P450(17) alpha reporter gene constructs mimics that of the endogenous gene. These results demonstrate that the regulation of CYP11A gene expression in bovine luteal cells is carried out by the same cis-acting element (-183/-101) which serves this role in the adrenal Y1 cell line. On the other hand, expression of the CYP17 gene in bovine luteal cells appears to be completely repressed, due to the absence of specific positive transcription factor(s) or the presence of negative regulatory factor(s). Thus, transfection experiments using bovine luteal cells in primary culture represent a first step towards the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cytochrome P450 gene expression throughout the ovarian cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1551906952,"A monoclonal antibody specific for Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L16 was prepared to test its effects on ribosome function and to locate L16 by immunoelectron microscopy. The antibody recognized L16 in 50 S subunits, but not in 70 S ribosomes. It inhibited association of ribosomal subunits at 10 mM Mg2+, but not at 15 mM Mg2+. Poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis and peptidyltransferase activities were completely inhibited when the L16 antibody was bound to 50 S subunits at a molar ratio of 1. There was no inhibitory effect on the binding of elongation factors or on the associated GTPase activities. Fab fragments of the antibody gave the same result as the intact antibody. Chemical modification of the single histidine (His13) by diethyl pyrocarbonate destroyed antibody binding. Electron microscopy of negatively stained antibody subunit complexes showed antibody binding beside the central protuberance of the 50 S particle on the side away from the L7/L12 stalk and on or near the interface between the two subunits. This site of antibody binding is fully consistent with its biochemical effects that indicate that protein L16 is essential for the peptidyltransferase activity activity of protein biosynthesis and is at or near the subunit interface."
