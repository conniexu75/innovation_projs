https://openalex.org/W2067143949,"An essential feature of the first synapse in the retina is a negative feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones. Here we show that at this synapse, connexin26 forms hemichannels on horizontal cell dendrites near the glutamate release site of the cones. Blocking these hemichannels hyperpolarizes horizontal cells, modulates the Ca2+ channels of the cones, and abolishes all feedback-mediated responses. We propose a feedback mechanism in which the activity of the Ca2+ channels and the subsequent glutamate release of the cones are modulated by a current through these hemichannels. Because the current through the hemichannels depends on the polarization of the horizontal cells, their activity modulates the output of the cones."
https://openalex.org/W1964533512,"Vascular permeability factor (VPF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) achieves its multiple functions by activating two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGF receptor-1) and KDR (VEGF receptor-2), both of which are selectively expressed on primary vascular endothelium. To dissect the respective signaling pathways and biological functions mediated by these receptors in primary endothelial cells with these two receptors intact, we developed a chimeric receptor system in which the N terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor was fused to the transmembrane domain and intracellular domain of KDR (EGDR) and Flt-1 (EGLT). We observed that KDR, but not Flt-1, was responsible for VPF/VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration. Moreover, Flt-1 showed an inhibitory effect on KDR-mediated proliferation, but not migration. We also demonstrated that the inhibitory function of Flt-1 was mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-dependent pathway because inhibitors of PI-3K as well as a dominant negative mutant of p85 (PI-3K subunit) reversed the inhibition, whereas a constitutively activated mutant of p110 introduced the inhibition to HUVEC-EGDR. We also observed that, in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs, the Flt-1/EGLT-mediated down-modulation of KDR/EGDR signaling was at or before intracellular Ca2+mobilization, but after KDR/EGDR phosphorylation. By mutational analysis, we further identified that the tyrosine 794 residue of Flt-1 was essential for its antiproliferative effect. Taken together, these studies contribute significantly to our understanding of the signaling pathways and biological functions triggered by KDR and Flt-1 and describe a unique mechanism in which PI-3K acts as a mediator of antiproliferation in primary vascular endothelium.

Tumor-secreted angiogenic cytokines include fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, and vascular permeability factor (VPF)1/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (6Risau W.

VPF/VEGF is likely the most important of these because it is expressed abundantly by a wide variety of human and animal tumors and because of its potency, selectivity for endothelial cells, and ability to regulate most and perhaps all of the steps in the angiogenic cascade (5Dvorak H.F.

Moreover, a number of other angiogenic cytokines act, at least in part, by up-regulating VPF/VEGF expression (5Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Brown L.F. Dvorak A.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

VPF/VEGF extensively reprograms endothelial cell expression of proteases, integrins, and glucose transporters, stimulates endothelial cell migration and division, protects endothelial cells from apoptosis and senescence, and induces angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models (for review, see Refs. 5Dvorak H.F.

In addition, VPF/VEGF is the only angiogenic cytokine identified thus far that renders microvessels hyperpermeable to circulating macromolecules, a characteristic feature of angiogenic blood vessels (8Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Feder J. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dvorak H.F. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 354A: 317-330PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dvorak H.F. Orenstein N.S.

Most of the biological activities of VPF/VEGF are thought to be mediated by its interaction with two high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGF receptor-1) and KDR (VEGF receptor-2; flk-1 in mice) (17Fong G.H.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). A third receptor, neuropilin, has been recognized, but little is known about its capacity to initiate endothelial cell signaling (22Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar, 23Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Both Flt-1 and KDR are selectively expressed on vascular endothelium but bind VPF/VEGF with different affinities; thus, Flt-1 binds VPF/VEGF with a K d of ∼10 pm, whereas the K d for KDR binding is 400–900 pm (24Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 25Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both receptors possess tyrosine kinase domains, potential ATP-binding sites, and long kinase insert regions that contain phosphorylation sites with binding capacity for different signaling molecules. Flt-1 and KDR also have different ligand specificities. Thus, Flt-1 interacts with VPF/VEGF (also known as VEGF-A) and with two other members of the VPF/VEGF family, PlGF and VEGF-B. KDR, on the other hand, interacts with VEGF-C and VEGF-D, in addition to VPF/VEGF (26Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Both Flt-1 and KDR are essential for normal vascular development (17Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 20Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). At present, the signaling cascades following VPF/VEGF interaction with cultured endothelial cells (ECs) are only partially understood but are known to involve a series of protein phosphorylations, beginning with receptor phosphorylation and subsequently with tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) (for review, see Refs. 26Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar and 27English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Like other endothelial cell agonists such as thrombin and histamine, VPF/VEGF activates protein kinase C, increases [Ca2+]i, and stimulates inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate accumulation (28Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). Because most cultured endothelial cells express both Flt-1 and KDR, it has been difficult to delineate the distinct signaling pathways and biological functions triggered individually by each, and much of our current information comes from studies with cell lines, particularly porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells, which do not normally express detectable levels of either KDR or Flt-1 and do not respond to VPF/VEGF. However, when PAE cells were engineered to express KDR, VPF/VEGF induced striking changes in cell morphology and behavior including actin reorganization, membrane ruffling, cell division, and chemotaxis (25Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known about the consequences of VPF/VEGF interaction with Flt-1. In PAE cells engineered to express Flt-1 but not KDR, VPF/VEGF stimulated tissue factor expression but not cell migration or proliferation (25Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, in PAE cells overexpressing KDR and Flt-1, it was reported that Flt-1 repressed KDR-mediated proliferation (29Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). By inhibiting the expression of either receptor with antisense oligonucleotides, it was also found that KDR was required for HUVEC proliferation (30Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A similar result was also obtained with KDR- or Flt-1-specific antibodies that blocked receptor interaction with VPF/VEGF (31Kanno S. Oda N. Abe M. Terai Y. Ito M. Shitara K. Tabayashi K. Shibuya M. Sato Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and VPF/VEGF mutants that specifically bind to KDR (32Gille H. Kowalski J. Li B. LeCouter J. Moffat B. Zioncheck T.F. Pelletier N. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3222-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Available data suggest that KDR and Flt-1 have different and perhaps complementary roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. However, many of the data have been obtained from immortalized cell lines that may differ significantly in behavior from early-passage cells derived from primary endothelial cultures. Therefore, to elucidate the respective roles of KDR and Flt-1 in early-passage HUVECs expressing both KDR and Flt-1, we engineered chimeric constructs of both receptors, replacing the extracellular domain of each with the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We used retroviral vectors to express these chimeric receptors in HUVECs that expressed both KDR and Flt-1 but not EGFR. Using this system, we demonstrated that HUVEC proliferation and migration were mediated exclusively through the KDR signaling pathway, a conclusion consistent with that of others (25Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3222-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Flt-1 activation mediated a distinctive inhibitory signaling pathway through PI-3K that down-regulated the cell proliferation pathway triggered by KDR. Recombinant VPF/VEGF was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGM-MV Bullet Kit, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin neutralization solution were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Vitrogen 100 was purchased from Collagen Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the KDR C-terminal domain and against the EGFR N-terminal domain and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Flt-1 C-terminal domain and p85α were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). [3H]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sulfinpyrazone, collagenase, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma. Transwell plate inserts were from Fisher Scientific. CyQuant, Fura-2/AM, and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Primary HUVECs were obtained from Clonetics. Cells were grown on plates coated with 30 µg/ml vitrogen in EGM-MV Bullet Kit (5% fetal bovine serum in endothelial cell basic medium with 12 µg/ml bovine brain extract, 1 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 µl/ml GA-1000, and human EGF). HUVECs transduced with EGDR or EGLT were grown in the same medium without human EGF. HUVECs (passage 3 or 4) that were ∼80% confluent were used for most experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum in endothelial cell basic medium for 24 h before testing. Chimeric receptors were engineered that consisted of the extracellular domain of EGFR and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of either KDR or Flt-1. The N-terminal portion of EGF receptor was generated by PCR, using EGFR cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Alex Ulrich as a template. A SalI enzyme restriction sequence was inserted in the 5′ primer (GGGGGGTCGACCAGCATGGGACCCTCCGGGACGGCCGGG) just before the translation start site (ATG); also, the fourth nucleotide C was changed to G to create a kozak sequence that resulted in conversion of Arg to Gly. In the 3′ fusion primer (GCGCGGTACCTACTAGAATAATGATGGCGATGGACGGGATCTTAGGCCCATT) of EGFR, the nucleotide sequence ending at amino acid 647 was fused to a sequence of KDR beginning at amino acid 744, in which aKpnI restriction site had been created by two silent mutations (GGC to GGT and ACG to ACC). The C-terminal portion of KDR was generated by reverse transcription-PCR with RNA isolated from HUVECs. The 5′ primer (GGGGGGTACCACGGTGATTGCCATGTTC) began at amino acid 744 of KDR with two silent mutations to create a KpnI restriction site (GGC to GGT and ACG to ACC). In the 3′ primer (GCGCGCGCGCGGCCGCTTAAACAGGAGGAGAGCTCAGTGT), a NotI site was created immediately after the stop codon. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to create pTOPO-EGFR and pTOPO-KDR. Both of these PCR products were sequenced. These two receptor fragments were then subcloned into retroviral vector pMMP (kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Mulligan) to create EGDR(EGFR/KDR), the EGFR N terminus and KDR C terminus fusion receptor. EGLT, the EGFR N terminus and Flt-1 C terminus fusion receptor, was created by two rounds of PCR. In the first round, two DNA fragments were generated using EGFR and Flt-1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Masabumi Shibuya) as templates, with oligonucleotides a (5′-GCGTCTCTTGCCGGAATGT-3′) and b (5′-CTCTTTCAATCGTTGGACAGCCTTCAAGACC-3′) and c (5′-CTGTCCAACGATTGAAAGAGTCACAGAAGAGG-3′) and d (5′-AAATGCTGATGCTTGAACC-3′) as primers, respectively. The second-round PCR was performed with both of the first-round PCR products as template and oligonucleotides a and d as primers. pUC18-EGLT was created by replacement of the SalI/HpaI fragment of pUC18-Flt-1 with the N-terminal fragment of EGFR created by digestion of pTOPO-EGFR with SalI and BsmI restriction enzymes, and the second-round PCR product was digested withBsmI and HpaI restriction enzymes. The EGLT was subcloned to retroviral vector pMMP to express protein in HUVECs. The EGLT(793stop) and EGLT(824stop) mutants were obtained by PCR with stop codons introduced at amino acids 794 and 825, respectively. EGLT(Y794F) was created by mutation of TAC to TTC. The dominant negative mutant of p85 (p85(DN)), the subunit of PI-3K, and the constitutively activated form of PI-3K (p110CAAX; kindly provided by Dr. Alex Toker) were subcloned to retroviral vector pMMP to express protein in HUVECs. To prepare the retrovirus, 293T cells were seeded at 6 × 106 cells/100-mm plate 24 h before transfection. 20 µg of targeted genes (pMMP-EGDR, pMMP-EGLT, or pMMP-LacZ, etc.), 15 µg of pMD.MLV gag.pol, and 5 µg of pMD.G DNA encoding the cDNAs of the proteins required for virus packaging (kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Mulligan) were mixed in 500 µl of water with 62 µl of 2m CaCl2. 500 µl of 2× HBS (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, 12 mm dextrose, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05) was added to the DNA mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA mixture was added dropwise to 293T cells. Medium was changed after 16 h. Retrovirus was isolated 48 h after transfection and used immediately for infection. 24 h before infection, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. 5 ml of retrovirus solution and 5 ml of fresh medium (∼1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml) were added to cells with 10 µg/ml Polybrene. Medium was changed after 16 h and cells were ready for experiment 48 h after infection. Serum-starved HUVECs (with or without retrovirus infection) were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 4 ml of collagenase solution (0.2 µg/ml collagenase, 0.2 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were detached by gentle scraping and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in the same buffer at 0.5 × 106cells/ml. Then, aliquots (1 × 105 cells in 200 µl) were added to 96-well plates and pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in 10 µl of the same buffer containing 1 µg of mouse anti-EGFR-N antibody or mouse IgG and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with the same buffer, resuspended in 10 µl of the same buffer containing 2.5 µg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 400 µl of the same buffer. FACS analysis was carried out in a FACScalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson) with Cellquest software. 2 × 103 HUVECs/well (with or without retrovirus infection) were seeded in 24-well plates. After 2 days, cells were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF or EGF for 20 h. 1 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and 4 h later, cells were washed three times with cold PBS, fixed with 100% cold methanol for 15 min at 4 °C, precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with water three times, and lysed with 200 µl of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in scintillation solution. For growth inhibition experiments, various inhibitors (always in final Me2SO concentrations ≤ 0.1%) were added 15 min before VPF/VEGF or EGF stimulation. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate values. Serum-starved HUVECs (with or without retrovirus infection) were detached from tissue culture plates as described in FACS analysis, washed twice with endothelial cell basic medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and seeded (1 × 105 cells/well) into the transwells coated with vitrogen (30 µg/ml), and the transwells were inserted in a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of the same medium. Cells over a range of 3 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate for standard curve. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the cells to attach, and then VPF/VEGF or EGF was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After incubation for an additional 2 h, cells remaining on the upper surface of the transwell filter membrane were wiped off with a cotton tip. The whole transwell membrane was cut out and placed in an individual well of the 96-well plate that contained the cells for standard curve. 200 µl of Cyquant DNA stain was added to each well containing cells or membrane, and the plate was kept at 4 °C overnight. After warming to room temperature, stained cells were counted in a spectrofluorometer (SpectraFluor; TECAN) with Delta Soft 3 software. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of quadruplicate values. Serum-starved HUVECs (with or without retrovirus infection) were detached from plates as described in FACS analysis. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer (5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and centrifuged again at the same speed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer containing 1 µg/ml Fura-2 and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer for stimulation with VPF/VEGF or EGF. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with inhibitors at 30 °C before VPF/VEGF stimulation. Intracellular Ca2+concentrations were measured with the DeltaScan Illumination System (Photon Technology International) using Felix software. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or EGF for different lengths of time, as indicated. Stimulation was halted by the addition of ice-cold PBS, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. 500 µg of lysate protein was incubated with 1 µg of different antibodies (as indicated) for 1 h and with protein A-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for another hour. Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Cell proliferation and migration data were subjected to analysis of variance and to post hoc testing with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. To elucidate the specific signaling events and biological activities mediated by KDR and Flt-1 in early-passage HUVECs, we prepared two chimeric receptors, EGDR and EGLT, by fusing the EGFR extracellular domain to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of either KDR or Flt-1 (Fig. 1 a). Each receptor (or both receptors in some experiments) was then transduced into HUVECs with a retroviral expression vector (pMMP). Cells transduced with chimeric receptors or with LacZ as a control were designated EGDR/HUVEC, EGLT/HUVEC, LacZ/HUVEC, and EGDR-EGLT/HUVEC, respectively. Each cell type was then stimulated with EGF or VPF/VEGF, allowing us to study separately the signaling pathways triggered by each chimeric receptor and to compare the results obtained with those that followed stimulation of the wild-type receptors. This approach was possible because HUVECs did not express detectable endogenous EGFR by Western blotting or FACS analysis and did not respond to EGF under the conditions of our experiments (see below). Immunoblots performed directly on EGDR/HUVEC or EGLT/HUVEC lysates demonstrated clear specific bands with antibodies to the C terminus of KDR (mouse monoclonal antibody) or Flt-1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody), respectively (Fig. 1 b, A). The blotting antibodies specifically recognized EGDR and EGLT without detectable cross-reactivity. Neither EDGR nor EGLT was recognized in LacZ/HUVEC. To test whether these proteins contained the EGFR N terminus, lysates of transduced HUVECs were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the EGFR N terminus before immunoblotting with antibodies against the C terminus of KDR or Flt-1, respectively (Fig. 1 b, B). The chimeric proteins expressed in HUVECs reacted specifically with antibodies to KDR and Flt-1, and both of them contained the N terminus of EGFR. To determine the fraction of transduced cells that expressed these proteins on their surface, we performed FACS analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminus of EGFR. Fig.1 c shows that more than 80% of EGDR/HUVEC and EGLT/HUVEC expressed the expected receptor on their surface. EGFR expression was undetectable in parental HUVECs and in LacZ/HUVEC. Stimulation of HUVECs with VPF/VEGF led to time-dependent phosphorylation of both KDR and Flt-1, but with different kinetics (Fig. 1 d, A). Phosphorylation of KDR was maximal and equivalent at 5 and 10 min; however, phosphorylation of Flt-1 was maximal and equivalent at 1 and 5 min and had markedly decreased by 10 min. The decline in Flt-1 phosphorylation was not attributable to unequal protein loading because Flt-1 levels were found to be equal when blots were stripped and reprobed with antibody against Flt-1. The differences in phosphorylation therefore likely reflect differences in the kinetics of"

We have used an in vitro chromosome assembly system based on Xenopus egg cytoplasmic extracts to study mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation. We identified a histone H3 Ser10 kinase activity associated with isolated mitotic chromosomes. The histone H3 kinase was not affected by inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, DNA-dependent protein kinase, p90rsk, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The activity could be selectively eluted from mitotic chromosomes and immunoprecipitated by specific anti-X aurora-B/AIRK2 antibodies. This activity was regulated by phosphorylation. Treatment of X aurora-B immunoprecipitates with recombinant protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibited kinase activity. The presence of PP1 on chromatin suggested that PP1 might directly regulate the X aurora-B associated kinase activity. Indeed, incubation of isolated interphase chromatin with the PP1-specific inhibitor I2 and ATP generated an H3 kinase activity that was also specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-X aurora-B antibodies. Nonetheless, we found that stimulation of histone H3 phosphorylation in interphase cytosol does not drive chromosome condensation or targeting of 13 S condensin to chromatin.

Phosphorylation at Ser10 of histone H3 is essential in Tetrahymena; cells bearing a mutant histone H3 where Ser10 is replaced by alanine are unable to fully condense or segregate their chromosomes (6Wei Y., Yu, L.

In cultured cells phosphatase inhibitors stimulate histone H3 phosphorylation and visible chromosome condensation (7Ajiro K. Yoda K. Utsumi K. Nishikawa Y. J. Biol.

Finally, addition of oligonucleosomes to Xenopus in vitro chromosome assembly reactions decreases chromosomal histone H3 phosphorylation and inhibits condensation (9de La Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S., M., C. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that a balance of kinase and phosphatase activities regulates mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3 and chromosome condensation. Recently protein kinases of the aurora/Ipl1 family have been implicated in regulating mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation. The aurora protein kinases are essential at various points to promote the proper execution of mitosis (10Chan C.S. Botstein D.

Development. 1998; 125: 4391-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation is reduced in a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae aurora homologue Ipl1 grown at the permissive temperature (15Hsu J.-Y. Sun Z.-W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Most multicellular organisms have two or three aurora homologues that may have separate, nonredundant functions (for reviews, see Refs. 16Giet R. Prigent C. J.

RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)1 of the two aurora homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, air-1 andair-2, has demonstrated that mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation requires AIR-2 but not AIR-1 (15Hsu J.-Y. Sun Z.-W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). InDrosophila cultured cells, reduction of aurora-B by RNAi caused a reduction in the level of mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation (12Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Thus, the role for aurora-B in mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation appears to be conserved throughout metazoans. However, the nature of this requirement is not yet clear. Mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation first appears in late G2 phase or in prophase, initiating at centromeres and then progressing along the arms until it is detected along the whole arm in prophase (3Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 12Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The existing data show that aurora-B first localizes to centromeres in prophase and remains concentrated at centromeres until mitosis when, like its binding partner INCENP, it relocalizes to the central spindle and subsequently the spindle midbody (12Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M. Smythe C. Gerloff D.L.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be shown that aurora-B is indeed directly associated with the mitotic chromosomal histone H3 kinase or that, if once localized to the centromere, it regulates the activity of another kinase that localizes along the chromosome arm. Cell cycle-regulated histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation must also require at least one protein phosphatase. In S. cerevisiae, genetic supressors of the temperature-sensitiveipl1-1 include specific alleles of glc7, a gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (21Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In both yeast and worms, reduction of PP1 activity partially supresses defects in mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation in ipl1-1 orair-2( RNAi ) (15Hsu J.-Y. Sun Z.-W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 22Speliotes E.K. Uren A. Vaux D. Horvitz H.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the suggestion that mitotic histone H3 phosphorylation is the result of a balance of competing kinase and phosphatase activities but do not exclude the possibility that these enzymes regulate each other. The role of histone H3 phosphorylation may be to modulate interaction of the basic N terminus of histone H3 with DNA. Incubation of isolated chromatin with cAMP-dependent protein kinase causes phosphorylation of histones H3 and H1 and causes an apparent relaxation of the canonical “zigzag” appearance of chromatin in the electron microscope (23Marion C. Martinage A. Tirard A. Roux B. Daune M. Mazen A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the importance of these structural changes in chromosome condensation remains to be determined. Additionally, histone H3 phosphorylation may represent one part of a multifaceted histone modification code (24Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 25Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In this model, post-translational histone modifications might serve as ligands for factors that regulate chromatin dynamics (4Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 26Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, reducing aurora-B levels in Drosophila prevented the localization of the barren protein (12Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), a component of the pentameric condensin complex that is required for mitotic chromosome condensation (27Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, a recent biochemical analysis showed that phosphorylation of nucleosomes in vitro does not induce condensin binding, suggesting that condensin targeting may not solely depend on histone H3 phosphorylation (28Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The properties of a number of nonhistone chromosomal proteins are also regulated by phosphorylation. DNA topoisomerase IIα, a 170-kDa DNA strand-passing enzyme required for chromosome condensation, is hyperphosphorylated in G2/M phase cells, a modification that stimulates its activity in vitro (29Adachi Y. Luke M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1991; 64: 137-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 30Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15161-15164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 13 S condensin, a complex of five proteins required for chromosome condensation, is also specifically phosphorylated in mitotic cell extracts (27Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 33Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 13 S condensin by cdc2/cyclin Bin vitro stimulates its positive supercoiling activity. In short, mitotic phosphorylation activates condensation factors and correlates with the induction of chromosome condensation. Although numerous kinases and phosphatases have been localized to chromosomes (34Pines, J., and Hunter, T. (1991) J. Cell Biol., 115.Google Scholar, 35Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the specific enzymes responsible for mitotic chromosome protein phosphorylation have not been identified. To study the mechanism of chromosome condensation, we have made use of an in vitro chromosome assembly system based on cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs (39Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have used this in vitro assembly system to explore the nature of mitotic phosphorylation of chromosomal proteins, in particular histone H3. We have characterized a mitotic chromosome-associated histone H3 kinase activity and shown that this activity is associated withXenopus X aurora-B. We have also shown that the activity of the enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation and that in addition to antagonizing X aurora-B activity, interphase chromatin-associated PP1 directly inactivates X aurora-B. Anti-XCAP-C and anti-XCAP-E antisera (kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Hirano) were diluted 1:5000 and used for immunoblotting (40Hirano T. Mitchison T.J.

The anti-X aurora-A antibody (Rb788) was generated against a C-terminal peptide (CKNSQLKKKDEPLPGAQ) derived from the sequence of Eg2 (43Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R.

The anti-X aurora-B antibody (Rb958) was generated against a fusion of glutathioneS-transferase with amino acids 1–95 of X aurora-B/AIRK2 (19Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M.

The antibody recognized a single 41-kDa protein on immunoblots ofXenopus egg cytosol and in anti-INCENP immunoprecipitates, localized to centromeres during metaphase and the spindle midbody after completion of mitosis, and recognized the recombinant protein (data not shown). A detailed protocol for generating cytosols for chromatin and chromosome assembly and purification has recently appeared (46Swedlow J.R. Bickmore W.A. Chromosome Structural Analysis. Oxford University, Oxford1999: 167-182Google Scholar). Briefly, to make mitotic cytosols, cytostatic factor (CSF)-arrested eggs were crushed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in XBE2 (10 mmK+-Hepes, pH 7.7, 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm K+-EGTA) (47Murray A.W. Meth. Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared from this crude cytoplasmic extract by centrifugation in a TLS-55, SW50.1, or SW55 rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by recentrifugation for 30 min (39Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interphase cytosol was made by washing eggs with 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and activating eggs with 2 µg/ml calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) and then centrifugation as above. The clear cytosol was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen in 50–200-µl aliquots and stored at −80 °C until later use. No difference was noted between the activities of fresh and frozen cytosol. All characterization of the chromatin- and chromosome-associated kinase activities has been performed using both CSF-arrested cytosols and interphase cytosols converted to the mitotic state by the addition of a nondegradable cyclin B (Δ90-cyclin) (48Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). All results were identical using these two types of cytosols; therefore, we refer to CSF-arrested or cyclin-treated cytosols and chromosomes assembled in them as mitotic cytosol and chromosomes. Interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes were prepared as described previously (39Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 46Swedlow J.R. Bickmore W.A. Chromosome Structural Analysis. Oxford University, Oxford1999: 167-182Google Scholar). It should be noted that the interphase cytosol does not support formation of interphase nuclei because of the absence of membrane components required for nuclear envelope formation. For visualization and immunofluorescence, assembly reactions were fixed with 3.7% CH2O and then centrifuged onto polylysine-coated coverslips and stained with anti-Ser(P)10 histone H3 and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). To assay chromatin- and chromosome-associated kinase activities, 25 µl of mitotic cytosol was diluted with an identical volume of XBE5 (as XBE2, except 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with an ATP regeneration system to give a final concentration in diluted cytosol of 1 mm ATP (Sigma), 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Diluted cytosol was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Interphase cytosol was treated identically except that it was diluted with XB (10 mm K+-Hepes, pH 7.7, 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with the ATP regeneration system. Demembranated Xenopussperm nuclei (47Murray A.W. Meth. Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) were added to diluted cytosol at a final concentration of 6,000 nuclei/µl cytosol. No difference in protein labeling or chromatin and chromosome kinase activity was detected in reactions containing 10–100 µl of cytosol or 1000–6000 sperm nuclei/µl cytosol. Assembled chromatin and chromosomes were then isolated through a 30% sucrose in XBE2 (w/v) cushion as described (39Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,46Swedlow J.R. Bickmore W.A. Chromosome Structural Analysis. Oxford University, Oxford1999: 167-182Google Scholar). The chromatin and chromosomes form an invisible, stable pellet at the bottom of the tube. 10 µl of kinase buffer (XBE5 + 0.2 mm ATP) was added to the isolated chromatin or chromosomes and incubated at 18 °C for 10 min. For radioactive phosphorylation reactions, the kinase buffer was supplemented with 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Incubation was stopped by the addition of 10 µl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen to partially shear the DNA. After thawing, the reactions were boiled and then separated on either a 15% or 7.5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were either transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody (3Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), or dried and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Kinase inhibitors 6-dimethylaminopurine (Sigma), wortmannin, rapamycin, olomoucine (all from Alexis), PKI (5–24) (a gift of Dr. C. G. W. Smythe), roscovitine (Calbiochem), and butyrolactone I (a gift from M. Kitagawa) were added directly to the kinase reaction from stock solutions. Chromatin or chromosomes were assembled and isolated as described above, except that demembranated sperm nuclei were added at 3750 nuclei/µl cytosol. Following 30 min of incubation at 18 °C, the chromatin assembly reactions were chilled on ice for 10 min. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The assembly reaction was then overlaid onto a 30% sucrose cushion in XBE2 (w/v) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf). The cushion was then washed and removed, and the chromatin was washed with 50 µl of CE buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 m NaCl in XBE2). The chromatin pellet was recentrifuged, and the interphase chromatin eluate (ICE) or the mitotic chromosome eluate (MCE) was then removed and assayed. To test the effect of I2 and ATP on chromatin-associated kinase activity, the isolated and washed chromatin pellet was incubated on ice for 30 min in XBE5 supplemented with 600 nm I2 (kindly provided by Dr. P. T. Cohen) (49Helps N.R. Street A.J. Elledge S.J. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 45 µl of XBE5 plus 0.4 mm ATP was subsequently added and then incubated at 18 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed from the chromatin pellet following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with XBE2 and then eluted with CE buffer. H3 kinase activity was determined using a peptide derived from the N terminus of histone H3 (KQTARKSTGGKAPRK) or a mutant peptide that removes Ser10 (KQTARKATGGKAPRK). The assays were performed in XBE2 with 0.2 mm ATP, 10 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 mm substrate peptide. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min, spotted onto P81 paper (Whatman), washed with 1% phosphoric acid, and then counted (50Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University, New York1999: 201-209Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations from cytosol, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were adsorbed on to protein A-agarose beads (AffiPrep, Bio-Rad), washed with XBE2, and then incubated in undiluted interphase or mitotic cytosols for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with XBE2 supplemented with leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (10 µg/ml each) and then assayed for H3 kinase activity using a filter binding assay (50Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University, New York1999: 201-209Google Scholar). Including microcystin LR or other phosphatase inhibitors in the bead washes gave no change in the level of kinase activity associated with the beads. To test inactivation of H3 kinase, recombinant PP1γ (kindly provided by Dr. P. T. Cohen) (41Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) at 2 milliunits/µl was incubated on ice for 10 min in PP1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.03% Brij, 1 mm MnCl2) with or without 1 µm microcystin LR. Affi-Prep beads loaded with X aurora-B immunoprecipitated from MCE were washed twice in CE buffer and then three times in PP1 buffer. 5 µl of beads were resuspended in 10 µl of PP1 with or without microcystin LR and shaken for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were washed, and filter binding assays were performed as described above in the presence of 1 µm microcystin LR. We have used an in vitro chromosome assembly system based on cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus eggs to study the role of protein phosphorylation in chromosome condensation. Xenopus eggs are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II by the action of CSF, an activity that results from activation of the c-Mos kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in meiosis II (51Sagata N. Bioessays. 1997; 91: 13-21Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 52Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This arrest is maintained until entry of the sperm nucleus causes a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+, destruction of CSF, and entry into anaphase of meiosis II. Cytoplasmic extracts prepared in the presence of EGTA preserve CSF and the meiotic metaphase state (47Murray A.W. Meth. Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Treatment of eggs with a Ca2+ ionophore causes the destruction of CSF and entry into interphase; extracts made from these eggs are in interphase. Adding nondegradable cyclin B to the interphase extract generates mitotic extracts. We prepared clarified cytosols of CSF, mitotic, and interphase cytoplasmic extracts by centrifugation at 200,000 × g and, for simplicity, refer to these as “cytosols.” When supplemented with demembranated sperm nuclei, these cytosols support the formation of decondensed interphase chromatin or condensed mitotic chromosomes. In vitro assembled chromatin can be recovered quantitatively from these cytosols with a better than 20,000-fold purification from cytosol (40Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). 2J. Swedlow, unpublished data. We have used this system to identify protein kinases and phosphatases present in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes and study the functions these molecules play in chromatin and chromosome structure. Paulson and Taylor (53Paulson J.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6064-6072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that chromosomes purified from colchicine-arrested HeLa cells contain kinase activities that phosphorylate histones H1 and H3. To determine whether a similar activity copurified with interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes assembled in vitro, we added sperm nuclei to interphase and mitotic extracts, allowed chromatin and chromosomes to form, and then purified the reaction products through a sucrose cushion (Fig.1 A). [γ-32P]ATP was added to the purified interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes to detect any copurifying kinase activity. Histones were then purified by acid extraction and separated using a Triton X-100/acetic acid/urea gel system (54Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This method resolves the histones on the basis of charge and hydrophobicity. Comparison of the Coomassie-stained gel and the autoradiogram of a representative Triton X-100/acetic acid/urea gel (Fig. 1 B) shows that all histones are present in equal amounts in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes, but histones H2A and H4 are phosphorylated in isolated interphase chromatin, whereas histones H3 and H1 are phosphorylated in isolated mitotic chromosomes. The core histones and histone B4, the Xenopus egg linker histone (55Smith R.C. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), are present in equal amounts in both interphase chromatin a"
https://openalex.org/W1985471077,"All retroviruses possess a highly error-prone reverse transcriptase, but the extent of the consequent sequence diversity and the rate of evolution differ greatly among retroviruses. Because of the high mutability of retroviruses, it is not the generation of new viral variants that limits the extent of diversity and the rate of evolution of retroviruses, but rather the selection forces that act on these variants. Here, we suggest that two selection forces--the immune response and the limited availability of appropriate target cells during transmission and persistence--are chiefly responsible for the observed sequence diversity in untreated retroviral infections. We illustrate these aspects of positive selection by reference to specific lentiviruses [human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV)] and oncoviruses [feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV)] that differ in their extent of variation and in disease outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2053519025,"The discovery of TATA-binding protein-related factors (TRFs) has suggested alternative mechanisms for gene-specific transcriptional regulation and raised interest in their biological functions. In contrast to recent observations of an embryonic lethal phenotype for TRF2 inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis, we found that Trf2-deficient mice are viable. However, Trf2-/- mice are sterile because of a severe defect in spermiogenesis. Postmeiotic round spermatids advance at most to step 7 of differentiation but fail to progress to the elongated form, and gene-specific transcription deficiencies were identified. We speculate that mammals may have evolved more specialized TRF2 functions in the testis that involve transcriptional regulation of genes essential for spermiogenesis."

These isoforms seem to have distinctive properties despite their overall structural similarity. For example, NHE1 and NHE3, which have been the most intensively studied isoforms, are involved in regulation of intracellular pH and cell volume in all cell types and Na+ and bicarbonate absorption in the epithelial cells, respectively. These two isoforms exhibit very different modes of regulation by many physiological factors as well as a large difference in the sensitivity to inhibitors such as amiloride derivatives (1Wakabayashi S.

Furthermore, targeted gene disruption of NHE1, NHE2, or NHE3 produces remarkably different phenotypes in mice; epilepsy and seizure for NHE1, reduced acid secretion in stomach for NHE2, and reduced salt absorption in kidney and low blood pressure for NHE3, respectively (5Cox G.A.

The functional diversity may suggest that NHE isoforms have fundamental differences in the regulatory mechanism. All NHE molecules comprise two major domains, amino-terminal transmembrane (∼500 amino acids) and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains (∼300 amino acids). The latter has been suggested to function as a regulatory domain involving multiple accessory factors (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol.

For example, calmodulin (8Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wakabayashi S.

A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) have been suggested to regulate NHE1 and NHE3 by interacting with their cytoplasmic domains, respectively. Five years ago, Lin and Barber (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) identified a novel Ca2+-binding protein CHP that interacts with NHE1 and exerts regulatory influences on its activity. CHP is ubiquitously expressed and homologous to the calcineurin B subunit (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This same protein has been identified independently as a factor (called p22) required for the vesicular transport of proteins (12Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More recently, this protein has been reported to inhibit the calcineurin phosphatase activity (13Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36125-36131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or to associate with microtubules (14Timm S. Titus B. Bernd K. Barros M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3473-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lin and Barber (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of CHP with a tag for detection in CCL39 fibroblastic cells inhibits the activation of NHE1 induced by serum or small G proteins and suggested that CHP may be dissociated from the exchanger upon mitogenic stimulation (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the role of endogenous CHP in NHE1 has not yet been clarified. Our preliminary experiment showed that CCL39 cells express a significant amount of endogenous CHP that may be sufficient to form a complex with endogenous NHE1 at a 1:1 molar ratio. Therefore, the interpretation of the reported effect of CHP overexpression in NHE1 function (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) may not be straightforward. Clearly, to assign the definitive role to CHP, it is necessary to compare the exchanger functions in the presence or absence of bound CHP. In this study, we have characterized the role of endogenous CHP in the functions of NHE1 and other NHE isoforms not determined previously. We show here that CHP is a key molecule that supports the activities of multiple exchanger isoforms. This is the first study to show that different exchangers require physical interaction with a common protein to express physiological activity. The exchanger-deficient PS120 cells (15Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Plasmids were transfected into PS120 cells (5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) by means of the calcium-phosphate co-precipitation technique. Cell populations that stably express NHE variants were selected by means of the repetitive H+-killing selection procedure (16Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For stable expression of CHP·GFP fusion protein variants, single clones expressing proteins were isolated using GFP fluorescence as a marker after selection with G418. Plasmids carrying cDNAs for human NHE1, rat NHE2, and rat NHE3, and their mutants were all cloned into the mammalian expression vector pECE. All these constructs were produced by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy (16Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The cDNA for CHP was obtained from human blood by reverse transcriptase-PCR based on the reported sequence (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CHP·GFP fusion protein plasmids were constructed using vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) by means of the PCR-based method. Inserted DNA fragments containing mutations were confirmed by sequencing plasmids with a DNA sequencer model 377 (ABI) to ensure the fidelity of construction. MBP or GST fusion protein plasmids were constructed using vector pMAL-c (New England Biolabs) or pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by means of the PCR-based method. Proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. For production of recombinant CHP, the full CHP sequence with 6 His residues was cloned into bacterial expression vector pET11 (Stratagene). This plasmid was incorporated into Escherichia coli cells (BL21) either alone or together with pBB131 carrying cDNA for yeastN-myristoyltransferase (kindly provided by Dr. Gordon, Washington University). After protein induction, the transformed bacteria were sonicated and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in the lysis buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. CHP proteins were purified on a ProBondTM resin column (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were renatured by dialysis overnight against 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Hepes, Tris, pH 7.4. His-tagged NHE1 proteins were also purified from E. coli in a similar way. Polyclonal anti-NHE1 was previously described (8Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-NHE3 or anti-CHP antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with the MBP·NHE3-(470–831) or GST·CHP-(1–195) fusion proteins. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (8Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes, Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, and the cell lysate was incubated with the antibodies indicated and protein A-Sepharose. Precipitated materials were separated on 7.5 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Japan). After blocking, incubation with antibodies, and washing, protein signals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For surface labeling of NHE1 or NHE3, cells were incubated with 1 mm NHS-biotin for 30 min at room temperature, solubilized with the lysis buffer, and then incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-agarose beads as described (17Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After washing, the proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 3% SDS buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the antibodies indicated. For far-Western analysis, blots for various MBP·NHE1 fusion proteins were incubated for 1 h with 100 μg/ml GST·CHP proteins, and then bound GST·CHP fusion proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the pull-down assay for CHP proteins, non-myristoylated or myristoylated CHP (150 μg each) was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of amylose resin pretreated with the MBP·NHE1-(503–815) fusion protein (200 μg) in buffer (in mm: NaCl, 150; Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 10; and CaCl2, 1; or EDTA, 1). After washing, the proteins were eluted from resin with 50 mm maltose, electrophoresed, and then visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol and incubated with anti-NHE1 antibody, followed by incubation with rhodamine-labeled second antibody as described (18Yoshida T. Pan Y. Hanada H. Iwata Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For observation of GFP fluorescence, cells stably expressing CHP·GFP proteins were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red. Images were taken under a fluorescent microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP imaging system (RS Photometrics). Xenopus oocytes were stripped and defolliculated enzymatically with 1 mg/ml collagenase in a Ca2+-free ND96 solution (in mm: NaCl, 96; KCl, 2; MgCl2, 1; and Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 5) for 30 min at room temperature. For membrane preparation, 100 oocytes injected with each protein were homogenized for 60 s with Physcotron (Nition Co.) in a medium (in mm: NaCl, 20; Mg-acetate, 10; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1; and Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20), and then subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 g, the 20–50% interface was collected as the crude membrane fraction. Membranes were solubilized with lysis buffer (in mm: KCl, 100; MgCl2, 5; CaCl2, 1; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1; and Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 100) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate and was then subjected to immunoprecipitation. The rates of ethylisopropyl-amiloride (EIPA)-sensitive22Na+ uptake by PS120 cells expressing NHE variants were measured using cells pHi-clamped at 5.6 by the K+/nigericin method (19Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For measurement of22Na+ uptake by oocytes, cells were preincubated for 1 h in NH4Cl medium (in mm: NH4Cl, 80; CaCl2,1; MgCl2, 1; and Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 10), washed twice with choline-Cl medium (in mm: choline-Cl, 80; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; and Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 10) and then incubated for 15 min in the same medium additionally containing 1 mm22NaCl (370 kBq/ml), 1 mm ouabain, and 0 or 0.1 mm EIPA. Oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold, nonradioactive choline-Cl medium, and then 22Na radioactivity was counted. CHP is a myristoylated protein with four Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-hands) (Refs. 11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) including the exchanger-deficient PS120 cells used in our expression study (Fig. 1 b). Co-immunoprecipitation studies involving PS120 cells stably expressing NHE1 revealed that CHP is tightly associated with NHE1 (Fig.1 b). To identify the CHP-binding domain in NHE1, we produced a series of MBP fusion proteins containing various regions of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 503–815) of NHE1 (see Fig. 1 a) and examined their interaction with GST·CHP fusion proteins by far-Western analysis (Fig. 1, c andd). The analysis revealed that amino acids 515–530 of NHE1 are required for CHP-binding (Fig. 1, c and d), which was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments involving cells expressing several deletion mutants of NHE1 (Fig.1 e). The identified CHP-binding domain is different from the previously reported one (amino acids 567–635; Ref. 11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The sequence of the CHP-binding domain was found to be well conserved among mammalian NHE isoforms NHE1–5 (see Fig.2 a), suggesting that all these isoforms may interact with CHP. In fact, CHP bound to NHE3 (see Fig.2 d). Furthermore, we produced two chimeric exchangers, NHE1(N2) and NHE1(N4), in which amino acids 503–600 of NHE1 were replaced by the corresponding region of NHE2 or NHE4, respectively (Fig. 1 c). CHP also bound to these exchangers (Fig.1 f). Thus, NHE1–4 all contain CHP-binding sites in the juxtamembrane region of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain.Figure 2Properties of NHE mutants. a,amino acid sequence alignment of the CHP-binding domain of NHEs and the mutant constructs.

Both CHP proteins bound to NHE1 in the absence or presence of Ca2+, as revealed in the pull-down assay with MBP·NHE1 fusion proteins (Fig. 1 g). Thus, myristoylation and Ca2+ binding in CHP are not required for the interaction of CHP with NHE1. It is noteworthy that the Ca2+-bound form of myristoyl-CHP migrated faster (Fig. 1 g). Thus, the Ca2+-induced conformational change in CHP seems to require its myristoylation as in the case of other Ca2+-binding myristoylated proteins (20Meyer T. York J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E93-E95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The CHP-binding domain of NHE1 is predicted to form a conserved α-helix like the calcineurin B-binding domain within the calcineurin A subunit (Refs. 21Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R.

A helical wheel diagram for amino acids 518–535 of NHE1 revealed a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Fig.2 a). Based on the previous finding that a hydrophobic interaction is important for the interaction between two calcineurin subunits (21Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 456-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we produced several mutant plasmids carrying amino acid substitutions of hydrophobic to hydrophilic residues (Gln or Arg) as well as other substitutions (to Ala) (see Fig. 2 a for the naming of mutants). When transfected into cells, these NHE1 variants were expressed in high and low molecular weight forms that correspond to glycosylated mature and immature NHE1 proteins, respectively (Ref.23Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 b, not shown for some mutants). The mature proteins from all these constructs were labeled efficiently with membrane-impermeable NHS-biotin applied from the outside (Fig.2 c), indicating the surface expression of these proteins. NHE1 mutants 4Q, 4R, 6Q, and 2Q/4R were not co-immunoprecipitated with CHP (Fig. 2 d). These findings suggest that CHP is not required for the surface expression of NHE1. Intriguingly, these mutations 4Q, 4R, 6Q, and 2Q/4R dramatically reduced the exchange activity, as measured as EIPA-sensitive22Na+ uptake at an acidic intracellular pH of 5.6, to <10% of the level in the wild-type (Fig. 2 g). A similar reduction in activity also occurred for deletion mutants Δ510–530 and Δ515–530 (not shown). As summarized in Fig. 2,f and g, the exchange activity changed in parallel with the CHP-binding ability for various NHE1 mutants, despite the fact that nearly the same amounts of proteins were expressed in the surface (Fig. 2 e). These data suggest that CHP binding is required for optimal activity of NHE1. We could not further analyze regulatory or kinetic properties of CHP binding-defective mutant exchangers (4Q, 4R, 6Q, and 2Q/4R) because of their low activity (Vmax). However, cells expressing a mutant (518Q/522Q) with low affinity for CHP but with modest activity show similar properties to the wild-type NHE1, i.e. an intracellular pH dependence of 22Na+ uptake with a pK of ∼6.6 and cytoplasmic alkalinization by 0.1 ∼ 0.2 pH unit in response to α-thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbol ester, and hyperosmotic stress (data not shown). These properties probably reflect those of the CHP-bound but not CHP-unbound mutant exchanger because only the former exhibits measurable high activity as shown in oocyte experiments described below. Similar to NHE1 mutants, NHE2–3R or NHE3–4R mutants (see Fig. 2 a) did not interact with CHP (see Figs. 2 d and 4, h–k). In addition, these CHP binding-defective mutants of NHE2 and NHE3 exhibited markedly reduced exchange activity (Fig. 2 g, inset). The above data strongly suggest that CHP binding is required for the exchange activity of NHE1–3. To examine this further, we used a Xenopus oocytes expression system. Oocytes are known to have an endogenous NHE, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of human NHE1 (overall homology, 78%; Refs. 24Busch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). CHP-binding domains were well conserved in the two species (see Fig. 2 a). Oocytes also have an endogenous CHP detectable on immunoblotting with anti-human CHP antibody (Fig.3 a). We produced His-tagged human NHE1 proteins (amino acids 503–600) containing the wild-type sequence or CHP binding-defective mutations (Fig. 3 b). Injection of the His-tagged wild-type protein into oocytes, but not that of mutant proteins, resulted in the disappearance ofXenopus NHE1 from the CHP immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 c, middle). Furthermore, anti-CHP antibody co-precipitated the His-tagged wild-type protein with endogenous CHP, but not mutant proteins (Fig. 3 c, bottom). These data indicate that the injected human CHP-binding protein depletes bound CHP from Xenopus NHE. Importantly, we found that injection of the His-tagged wild-type protein abolished the endogenous exchange activity in oocytes almost completely (Fig. 3 d). A relatively long time (≥3 h) was required for inhibition of the exchange activity after injection of proteins (Fig. 3 e), suggesting that CHP is slowly released from Xenopus NHE. On the other hand, the exchange activity of human NHE1 expressed in oocytes was significantly increased when human CHP was co-expressed (Fig. 3 f). These data also strongly suggest that CHP is required for high exchange activity. CHP fusion protein conjugated with green fluorescent protein (CHP·GFP) was expressed uniformly in the cytosol of PS120 cells (Fig.4 c). This fusion protein became partly localized in the cell surface when exogenous NHE1 was co-expressed (Fig. 4 d). However, CHP·GFP was not localized in the surface membrane when NHE1 mutant 4Q was expressed in the membrane (Fig. 4, b and e). Therefore, NHE1 seems to be the principal target for CHP in the membrane. We stably overexpressed two GFP-conjugated CHP mutant proteins (CHP2A·GFP and CHPEF3·GFP) that lack the ability to be myristoylated or to bind Ca2+ (12Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vitro binding data (see Fig. 1 g), these proteins were partly localized in the surface membrane together with the NHE1 protein (Fig. 4,f and g), suggesting that they might have replaced endogenous CHP. Because expression of these proteins did not inhibit 22Na+ uptake activity (Fig.4 l), it appears that neither myristoylation nor Ca2+ binding is essential for exchange activity. CHP·GFP was also partly localized in the surface membrane when it was co-expressed with NHE2 or NHE3, although a significant amount of CHP·GFP still remained in the cytosol or an intracellular compartment (Fig. 4, h and j). However, such surface expression was abolished by mutations (NHE2-3R and NHE3-4R) introduced into these NHE isoforms (Fig. 4, i and k), indicating that CHP binding was lost in these mutants. It has generally been considered that a single polypeptide for each NHE isoform is sufficient for normal exchange activity. However, the present data provide evidence that NHE1 requires an extra cofactor protein, CHP, for it to express physiological activity. Our data also suggest the same role of CHP for NHE2-4. A potential CHP-binding motif also exists in NHE5 (Ref. 3Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabo E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4377-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; see Fig. 2 a), but not in mitochondrial NHE6 (4Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we propose that CHP functions as an integral cofactor common to plasma membrane-type Na+/H+ exchangers. Na+/H+ exchange presumably occurs through the transmembrane domain of an exchanger. Cells expressing a NHE1 mutant (Δ515) with the complete carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 516–815) deleted still retain low exchange activity that can be detected by expressing a high copy number of a mutant molecule (16Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the present finding that mutants lacking the CHP-binding site are able to exhibit low exchange activity (5–10% of the wild-type level). We previously showed that the exchange activity at physiological pHi is markedly decreased by deletion of different regions in the amino terminus (subdomain I, amino acids 515–595) of the NHE1 cytoplasmic domain (19Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data suggest that subdomain I is essential for normal exchange activity. This domain with bound CHP would therefore function as a key structure that interacts with the transmembrane domain (see Fig. 1 a), thereby permitting the ion translocation pathway to maintain its physiologically relevant active conformation. More detailed structural information including the crystal structure of the CHP·NHE complex is necessary to reveal how CHP is involved in this important task of subdomain I. Subdomain I contains the CHP-binding region (amino acids 515–530) as well as two potential phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding motifs (amino acids 509–516 and 552–560 for the human NHE1 sequence) identified by Aharonovitz et al. (26Aharonovitz O. Zaun H.C. Balla T. York J.D. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) who provided evidence that a reduction of cell PIP2 causes marked inhibition of the exchange activity of NHE1. Their study, however, provided little information regarding whether or not the effect of PIP2 is mediated by the above binding motifs in situ. In this study, we found that the injected His-tagged wild-type NHE1 protein (amino acids 503–600) almost completely abolished the exchange activity in oocytes, whereas mutant protein 4R lacking the ability to bind CHP did not (Fig.3 d). This finding seems to argue against the view that the function of CHP is directly related to PIP2, because the injected wild-type and mutant 4R proteins would not be much different in their PIP2 binding (see Fig. 2 a). We observed that the surface localization of CHP·GFP in NHE1 transfectants was not affected significantly by ionomycin, ATP depletion, phorbol ester, serum, or other growth factors (not shown), which is inconsistent with the previous proposal (11Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that CHP may be dissociated from NHE1 upon growth factor activation. Whether or not the bound CHP is involved in acute regulation of the exchanger is not clear at present. Although CHP interacts with multiple NHE isoforms, it is still possible that the activity of the exchanger is regulated through post-translational modifications of the associated CHP in response to extracellular stimuli. Indeed, myristoylated CHP alters its conformation in a Ca2+-dependent manner (see Fig. 1 g), similar to some other Ca2+-myristoyl switch proteins (20Meyer T. York J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E93-E95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible that such a conformational change of bound CHP alters the structure of subdomain I and regulates the transport activity. In conclusion, the present study revealed that multiple exchangers require physical interaction with a common protein, CHP for exchange activity. This function does not appear to require Ca2+binding and myristoylation in CHP. To our knowledge, this is the first finding to show that a Ca2+-binding protein supports the activity as an integral component of the secondary active transporter. We thank Dr. T. Y. Nakamura for technical assistance in the Xenopus oocyte experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2010488171,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 has been well documented as a transcriptional activator involved in the regulation of a number of critical genes involved in the cell cycle, response to DNA damage, and apoptosis. Activation by p53 requires the interaction of the protein with a consensus binding site consisting of two half-sites, each comprising two copies of the sequence PuPuPuC(A/T) arranged head-to-head and separated by 0-13 base pairs. In addition to activation, p53 has been shown to be a potent repressor of transcription. However, the basis for p53-mediated repression is not well understood and has been proposed to occur indirectly through interactions with other promoter-bound transcription factors. In the present study, we show that p53 can repress transcription directly by binding to a novel head-to-tail (HT) site within the MDR1 promoter. A mutation that disrupted p53 binding to the MDR1 HT site blocked p53-mediated repression of the MDR1 promoter in transfection assays. Replacement of the HT site with a head-to-head (HH) site converted the activity of p53 from repression to activation, indicating that simple recruitment of p53 to the promoter is not sufficient for repression and that the orientation of the binding element determines the fate of p53-regulated promoters."

A multitude of neuronal AChR subtypes assembled from different combinations of α2–α9 and β2–β4 subunits have been identified (3Deneris E.S. Connolly J. Rogers S.W. Duvoisin R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Of these, the α4β2 AChR is widely expressed in the central nervous system and represents >80% of the high affinity [3H]nicotine-binding sites in mammalian brain (5Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3395-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our understanding of their physiological roles comes most recently from gene knock-out studies in mice. Mice in which the α4 subunit gene has been deleted lack [3H]nicotine- or [3H]epibatidine-binding sites in their brain and exhibit reduced antinociceptive effects of nicotine (6Marubio L.M. Arroyo-Jimenez M.M. Cordero-Erausquin M. Lena C. Le Novere N. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Huchet M. Damaj M.I. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Mice in which the β2 subunit gene has been deleted also show little [3H]nicotine binding in their brains, lose their sensitivity to nicotine in passive avoidance tasks (7Picciotto M.R. Zoli M.

The normal and pathophysiological functions mediated by α4β2 AChRs are of significant importance to human health. Some inherited forms of epilepsy, such as the autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsies, are caused by α4β2 AChRs harboring at least two separate mutations within their α4 subunit (9Hirose S.

Most recently, α4β2 AChRs, among other β2 subunit-containing AChRs, have been implicated in neuronal survival during aging, as surmised from the neurodegeneration observed in β2-subunit knock-out mice (13Zoli M. Picciotto M.R. Ferrari R. Cocchi D. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The α4 subunit, like the other AChR subunits, consists of an extracellular N-terminal domain, followed by three transmembrane domains (M1–M3), a large cytoplasmic domain, a fourth transmembrane domain (M4), and a short extracellular C terminus. The large cytoplasmic domain is highly divergent among the various subunits, and this sequence divergence presumably provides the diversity necessary for different AChR subtypes to interact directly with cytosolic proteins of different function. To identify such proteins associated with α4β2 AChRs, we used the large cytoplasmic domain of the α4 subunit as a bait to screen a mouse brain cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. Here we describe the isolation of a known protein termed 14-3-3η. The 14-3-3 proteins family consists of seven isoforms (β, γ, η, ξ, ε, τ, and ς) that function as intracellular regulators or chaperone/scaffolding/adaptor proteins in diverse cellular functions (14Wang W. Shakes D.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 384-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The binding of 14-3-3 to most of their protein targets are mediated by a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residue within a consensus binding site motif or within sequences closely resembling it (15Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). We found that 14-3-3η interacted with the recombinant AChR α4 subunits alone following activation of PKA. The interaction was mediated by serine 441 of the α4 subunit within a motif similar to a known consensus binding site motif for 14-3-3 proteins. The interaction significantly increased the steady state levels of the α4 subunit alone and α4β2 AChRs. The surface levels of recombinant wild-type α4β2 AChRs were ∼2-fold higher than those of mutant α4S441Aβ2 AChRs. 14-3-3 coimmunopurified with native α4 AChRs from brain suggesting its interaction with native α4 AChRs is physiologically relevant. These results support a possible role for 14-3-3 in dynamically regulating the steady state levels of α4β2 AChRs through its interaction with the α4 subunit in the ER/Golgi compartments, following activation of PKA.

The nested deletions of the α4 cytoplasmic domain were generated by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GGG GAATTC GTG CAC CAC CGC TCG CCA CGC-3′ and nested reverse primers 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA GGT GCC TCC CGC CTT GAG CAC-3′; 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA CAG GGA GGT CGG GGA GCT GGT-3′; 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA TTC TTG GGA GCT GGG CAC ATG-3′; 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA GGC CTT CTC AAC CTC TGA TGT-3′; 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA TGA CAG ACC TTG GTT GCA GAT-3′; 5′-GGG GGATCC TCA GTT GTC TTT GAC CAC AGA GGG-3′ and were subsequently subcloned into theEcoRI-BamHI sites of the pLexA. The mutated subunit α4S441A was generated by mutagenesis using the following two primers: 5′-C AAA GCC AGG TCC CTG GCT GTC CAG CAT GTG CCC-3′ and 5′-GGG CAC ATG CTG GAC AGC CAG GGA CCT GGC TTT G-3′ in conjunction the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., San Diego, CA). The mouse 14-3-3η, the rat α4 subunit, and the rat β2 subunit cDNAs were generated by amplification of the full clone by PCR using forward primer 5′-GGGAATTCG CCA CCA TGG GGG ATC GAG AGC AG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGG TCTAGA TCA GTT GCC TTC TCC TGC TTC TTC-3′ for 14-3-3η; forward primer 5′-GGGAATTCG CCA CCA TGG CCA ATT CGG GCC CCG GG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGG TCTAGA TCA GCA AGC AGC CAG CCA GGG AGG-3′ for the α4 subunit; and forward primer 5′-GGGAATTCG CCA CCA TGC TGG CTT GCA TGG CCG GG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGG TCTAGA TCA CTT GGA GCT GGG AGC TGA GTG-3′ for the β2 subunit. The amplified cDNAs were ligated into theEcoRI-XbaI sites of the mammalian cell expression vector pEF6/myc-His A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Yeast two-hybrid screens were carried out according to a standard protocol (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The α4 bait plasmid pLexA and the p8op-LacZ reporter gene plasmid were first transformed in EGY48 yeast cells followed by transformation of the library of brain cDNA plasmids. Approximately 2 × 106 yeast cells cotransformed with the bait and cDNAs from a premade mouse brain cDNA Matchmaker LexA library (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were screened. Positive clones were selected for their ability to grow on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and uracil and assayed for β-galactosidase activity on media supplemented with X-gal. Plasmids containing the brain cDNAs were isolated from positive yeast cells, and their nucleotide sequences were determined by manual DNA sequencing using the ThermoSequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Seven clones of 14-3-3η that interacted with the α4 bait were characterized. These clones contained slightly different cDNA sizes but all had the full-length cDNA of 14-3-3η as determined from limited sequence analysis of their 5′ ends. One of these clones containing the full-length 14-3-3η subunit was used in all subsequent work. The anti-14-3-3 mouse monoclonal antibody that cross-reacts with multiple isoforms of 14-3-3 and the anti-β2 subunit that cross-reacts with β2 subunits on immunoblots were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein G affinity-purified anti-α4 subunit (299) and anti-β2 subunit (295) mAbs were generously provided by Dr. Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). The goat anti-mouse and anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Abs were obtained from Pierce. mAbs were coupled to Actigel ALD beads at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml of gel using the manufacturer's instructions (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Human tsA201 cells (16Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar), a derivative of the human embryonic kidney cell line 293, were cultured at 37 °C in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 90% confluency (∼106cells/well) with various combinations of cDNAs as per the manufacturer's instructions and utilized after ∼48 h. The cDNAs were cloned into the vector pEF6/myc-His but lacked the myc-His tag because of the presence of the endogenous stop codon present in each cloned cDNA. AChR subunit assembly was found to be more efficient at 30 °C than at 37 °C as described previously (17Cooper S.T. Harkness P.C. Baker E.R. Millar N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27145-27152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and hence the experiments were performed with cells incubated at 30 °C following transfection. To study the effect of 14-3-3η on the α4 subunit alone, tsA201 cells seeded (400,000 per well) in 12 wells were incubated at 37 °C. The next day the cells were cotransfected with α4 or α4S441A with or without 14-3-3η and incubated at 30 °C (the DNA concentrations and ratios were kept constant by using the pEF6A vector DNA). The transfected cells were treated 24 h with or without forskolin (10 µm). After washing once with ice-cold PBS, the cells were solubilized in 500 µl of the following lysis buffer: 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml pepstatin, and 2% Nonidet P-40. After shaking for 3 h at 4 °C, the lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g,and 20 µl of the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. tsA201 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 50 mmNaF and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 µg/ml aprotinin, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, 25 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.3 µm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium tetrathionate, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 µm phenylarsine oxide, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and agitated vigorously for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, the clear supernatant from each sample (∼1 ml) was incubated with 10 µl of mAb-coupled beads (that were preblocked with 5% non-fat milk for 30 min) for 24 h. The beads were then washed 8 times with ∼800 µl of solubilization buffer and eluted with sample buffer (lacking β-mercaptoethanol to avoid reduction of the disulfide linkage of the IgG chains) at 60 °C for 30 min, and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to the eluted samples that were then boiled for an additional 5 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Frozen rat brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) using a homogenizer (OMNI International, Warrenton, VA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckmann 50.2 Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was further briefly homogenized and then extracted with 3 volumes of a solubilization buffer (homogenization buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 25 µg/ml aprotinin, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, 25 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 µm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium tetrathionate, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 µm phenylarsine oxide) for 2 h at 4 °C. The clear supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the pellet at 18,000 × g for 30 min was used for all subsequent immunoisolation procedures. Detergent-solubilized brain extracts (typically 10 ml) thus obtained were incubated with ∼25 µl of mAb-coupled Actigel ALD beads (that were preblocked with 5% non-fat milk for 30 min) at 4 °C for 72 h. In initial experiments, to ensure that the binding observed was specific, we first determined the number of successive washes of the mAb beads necessary for the complete removal of unbound 14-3-3 proteins that are abundant in brain extracts and many of whose isoforms cross-react with the anti-14-3-3 mAb used in the immunoblotting experiments. The beads thus were typically washed 10 times with ∼800 µl of solubilization buffer and eluted with sample buffer (lacking β-mercaptoethanol to avoid reduction of the disulfide linkage of the IgG chains) at 60 °C for 30 min, and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to the eluted samples prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The proteins bound to the Ab beads were eluted with protein sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (IMMUN-BLOT; Bio-Rad), and the membranes were incubated with diluted (typically 1/200 to 1/1000) primary Abs in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween and 5% non-fat milk. The binding of the primary mAbs was detected using appropriate secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in conjunction with a chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal, Pierce). To reduce nonspecific binding, the blots were typically cut in half, and the top half was probed with the anti-α4 subunit mAb and the bottom half with the anti-14-3-3 mAb thus eliminating the need for sequential reprobing of the blots. Cell surface α4β2 AChRs were measured as described previously (17Cooper S.T. Harkness P.C. Baker E.R. Millar N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27145-27152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, tsA201 cells plated in 12-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were washed once in PBS and then blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, and the cells were incubated for 1 h with an anti-β2 subunit mAb (295) in PBS containing 3% BSA at room temperature. After four washes with PBS the cells were fixed with formaldehyde (3%) for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked again for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary Ab for 1 h in the presence of 3% BSA, washed six times with PBS, and incubated with 300 µl of the HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 1 h. The absorbance of the supernatant was then measured at 655 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer. cDNAs were subcloned into the vector pSP64T (Invitrogen) with a modified polylinker. cRNAs from linearized cDNA templates were synthesized in vitrousing SP6 RNA polymerase in conjunction with reagents from the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes were prepared for injection as described previously (18Anand R. Nelson M.E. Gerzanich V. Wells G.B. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 20 ng of cRNAs for the α4 and β2 subunits and 40 ng of 14-3-3η per oocyte and incubated for 3–7 days at 16–18 °C in 50% L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Currents were measured using standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp amplifier (Oocyte Clamp OC-725C) as described previously (18Anand R. Nelson M.E. Gerzanich V. Wells G.B. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar). Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 1.0–2.0 megohms for the voltage electrode and 0.5–0.1 megohm for the current electrode. All records were digitized at 200 Hz with MacLab software and hardware (AD Instruments). Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph. The recording chamber was perfused at a flow rate of 10 ml/min with ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.6). Cells were fixed with an ice-cold mixture of 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 5 min, washed 3 times with 2 ml of PBS, and blocked using PBS containing 2% BSA for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with diluted primary anti-α4 mAb (1/2000 dilution) in PBS containing 4% NGS with gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times for 15 min per wash in PBS, incubated with diluted (1/1000) fluorophore-conjugated anti-rat secondary Ab in PBS containing 4% NGS for 1 h at room temperature, and fixed again with an ice-cold mixture of 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 5 min and washed 3 times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with diluted primary anti-14-3-3 mAb (1/200 dilution) in PBS containing 4% NGS with gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times for 15 min per wash in PBS and then incubated with diluted (1/1000) fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab in PBS containing 4% NGS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed 3 times for 15-min periods in PBS and then used for immunofluorescence microscopy. Nontransfected cells were processed in parallel as controls for nonspecific staining. The secondary Abs used were goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Ab (catalog number A-11006) and the goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated Ab (catalog number A-11030) from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Confocal microscopy was accomplished using a Noran Instruments Odyssey XL confocal laser scanning microscope (Noran Instruments, Middleton, WI). Cells were scanned using 1-µm steps in the z axis, alternating between fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine filters. The resulting confocal images were captured on Silicon Graphics workstations. Images were pseudocolored and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The large cytoplasmic domain corresponding to amino acids 302–561 of the rat AChR α4 subunit was used as a bait to screen ∼2 × 106clones of a mouse brain cDNA LexA yeast two-hybrid library. The large cytoplasmic domain extends from the third to the fourth transmembrane domain of the AChR α4 subunit. Multiple clones of 14-3-3η that interacted with the α4 bait were obtained. A full-length clone of 14-3-3η was chosen for further characterization. To delineate the site where 14-3-3η interacts with the AChR α4 subunit cytoplasmic domain, a series of C-terminal nested deletions of the cytoplasmic loop was created as LexA fusion protein baits and tested for their ability to interact with the 14-3-3η clone in the yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction was determined by both the ability of transformed yeast cells to grow on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and uracil and by their ability to turn blue on media supplemented with X-gal. As controls, the LexA protein alone was used as a bait. We mapped the interaction of 14-3-3η to residues 413–450 (Fig. 1A). A putative motif, RSX S XP, in which the underlined serine residue is phosphorylated, has been demonstrated previously to be important for the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to some of its target proteins. A sequence that closely resembles this motif, RSLSVQ, occurs within the region 413–450 that was found to be essential for the interaction of 14-3-3 with the α4 cytoplasmic domain bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Based on the demonstration that the interaction of 14-3-3 with target proteins is mediated by the recognition of a phosphoserine, we mutated serine 441 to alanine within this consensus binding site motif in the α4 cytoplasmic domain. Mutating serine 441 to alanine nearly completely abolished interaction of 14-3-3η with the α4 cytoplasmic domain bait in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that the high affinity binding of 14-3-3η to the α4 cytoplasmic domain is mediated by serine 441 within a specific consensus binding site motif. To test directly if 14-3-3η could interact with full-length unassembled α4 subunits alone, we transfected tsA 201 cells with the α4 subunit cDNA. Because it has been demonstrated previously that phosphorylation of a consensus binding site motif for 14-3-3 greatly increases its affinity for the site, we also tested if activation of kinases would increase the interaction of 14-3-3η with the recombinant α4 subunit. We treated transfected cells coexpressing 14-3-3η and recombinant α4 subunits with forskolin (50 µm) plus IBMX (1 mm) to activate PKA and PMA (0.1 µm) to activate PKC. Activation of PKA (Fig. 2, 3rd lane) but not PKC (Fig. 2, 6th lane) was found to very significantly enhance the interaction of 14-3-3η with the α4 subunit. In the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (30 µm), the effect of forskolin was significantly attenuated (Fig. 2, 4th lane) consistent with the idea that PKA-dependent phosphorylation was involved in mediating the interaction. To determine whether 14-3-3η could also interact with recombinant α4β2 AChRs in mammalian cells, we immunoisolated 1% Nonidet P-40-solubilized recombinant α4β2 AChRs using anti-α4 subunit mAb beads from tsA 201 cells transfected with the α4, β2, and 14-3-3η cDNAs. As a control for nonspecific binding, we used beads coupled to nonspecific rat IgG. We observed immunoreactivity for 14-3-3η and the α4 subunit migrating at their expected molecular masses of ∼30 and ∼70 kDa, respectively (Fig.3A, 2nd lane). No immunoreactivity for either protein in the control nonspecific rat IgG lane was observed (Fig. 3, 1st lane). As with the α4 subunit alone, we tested if activation of kinases would increase the interaction of 14-3-3η with recombinant α4β2 AChRs. We treated transfected cells coexpressing 14-3-3η and recombinant α4β2 AChRs with forskolin (50 µm) plus IBMX (1 mm) to activate PKA and PMA (0.1 µm) to activate PKC. Activation of PKA (Fig. 3 A, 3rd lane) but not PKC (Fig. 3 A, 6th lane) was found to very significantly enhance the interaction of 14-3-3η with recombinant α4β2 AChRs. In the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (30 µm), the effect of forskolin was significantly attenuated (Fig. 3 A, 4th lane). The preceding results were obtained by immunoisolating recombinant α4β2 AChRs with anti-α4 mAb beads. Since this mAb binds both assembled and unassembled α4 subunits, we were unable to distinguish if 14-3-3η interacted with α4 subunits that were unassembled or assembled with the β2 subunits. To test if 14-3-3η could interact with assembled α4 subunits, α4β2 complexes were isolated with the anti-β2 mAb beads. The anti-β2 mAb used (mAb 295) binds the conformationally mature β2 subunit only. Reactivity with denatured β2 subunits on immunoblots is not observed. We found that activation of PKA by forskolin significantly enhanced the interaction of 14-3-3 with α4β2 AChR complexes immunoisolated with the anti-β2 mAb beads both in the absence (Fig. 3 B, 2nd lane) and the presence of exogenous 14-3-3η (Fig. 3 B, 4th lane). We also observed low basal levels of interaction of 14-3-3 with α4β2 AChR complexes even prior to activation of PKA by forskolin (Fig. 3 B, 1st and 3rd lanes). These results suggested that both endogenous 14-3-3 and exogenous 14-3-3η associated with the α4β2 AChR complexes. In addition, in three independent experiments we also observed that both in the presence or absence of exogenous 14-3-3η, the amount of α4 subunits immunoprecipitated by the anti-β2 mAb beads from detergent extracts of cells treated with forskolin was consistently higher than that from detergent extracts of cells not treated with forskolin. The increased amounts of the α4 subunits also correlated with greater amounts of 14-3-3 coimmunoprecipitated with the α4β2 AChR complexes using the anti-β2 mAb beads suggesting a possible role for 14-3-3η in altering the steady state levels of α4β2 AChR complexes. To demonstrate further that the interaction of 14-3-3η with the α4β2 AChRs was phosphorylation-dependent, the detergent-solubilized α4β2 AChR immunoisolated complexes from cells treated with forskolin and IBMX were treated with recombinant protein phosphatase I. We observed a significant reduction in the amount of 14-3-3η associated with immunopurified recombinant α4β2 AChRs treated with protein phosphatase I compared with those treated with the buffer alone under identical conditions (Fig. 3 C). These results further supported the fact that forskolin-dependent enhancement of the interaction of 14-3-3η with α4β2 AChRs was due to a PKA-mediated phosphorylation event. We examined if 14-3-3η could associate with mutant α4S441Aβ2 AChRs, in which serine 441 of the α4 subunit was mutated to alanine, following activation of PKA by forskolin in tsA201 cells. In keeping with the yeast two-hybrid mapping and mutagenesis studies, mutating serine 441 to alanine almost completely abolished interaction of 14-3-3η with mutant α4S441A subunit (Fig. 2, 5th lane) and the mutant α4S441Aβ2 AChRs (Fig. 3 A, 5th lane; Fig. 3 B, 5th to 8th lanes). These results, in conjunction with the results from previous studies of several other investigators demonstrating that a phosphoserine enhances the interaction of 14-3-3 with its target protein"
https://openalex.org/W2106135888,"Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is rapidly activated in response to growth factor stimulation and plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation through the generation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, leading to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and increased levels of intracellular calcium, respectively. Given the existing overlap between signaling pathways that are activated in response to oxidant injury and those involved in responding to proliferative stimuli, we investigated the role of PLC-γ1 during the cellular response to oxidative stress. Treatment of normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with H2O2 resulted in time- and concentration-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. Phosphorylation could be blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases or the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, but not by inhibitors of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. To investigate the physiologic relevance of H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, we compared survival of normal MEF and PLC-γ1-deficient MEF following exposure to H2O2. Treatment of PLC-γ1-deficient MEF with H2O2 resulted in rapid cell death, whereas normal MEF were resistant to the stress. Pretreatment of normal MEF with a selective pharmacological inhibitor of PLC-γ1, or inhibitors of inositol trisphosphate receptors and PKC, increased their sensitivity to H2O2, whereas treatment of PLC-γ1-deficient MEF with agents capable of directly activating PKC and enhancing calcium mobilization significantly improved their survival. Finally, reconstitution of PLC-γ1 protein expression in PLC-γ1-deficient MEF restored cell survival following H2O2 treatment.

The deleterious and cumulative effects of oxidant injury to macromolecules appear to contribute to the development of a wide variety of disease processes, including diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, and are believed to be a major factor in aging (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7120) Google Scholar). For these reasons our laboratory has long been interested in the signaling pathways that mediate the effects of oxidative stress on cellular physiology. Oxidants activate many signaling pathways, and we and others have demonstrated that growth factor receptors play an important role in initiating cellular responses to oxidative stress (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Klotz L.O. Schieke S.M. Sies H. Holbrook N.J.

Following exposure to H2O2, both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are activated, leading to their dimerization and autophosphorylation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that certain proliferation-associated signaling pathways, including those leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt, are activated by oxidative stress in a growth factor receptor-dependent manner and in such instances promote cell survival (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that at least some signaling pathways involved in regulating proliferation also participate in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Phospholipase C γ1 (PLC-γ1) is an enzyme that is recruited to the membrane following activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (7Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G.

Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As a result of its interaction with these signaling molecules, PLC-γ1 is activated by a mechanism that relies on tyrosine phosphorylation. Activated PLC-γ1 cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generating two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The former functions to activate protein kinase C (PKC); the latter stimulates the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Through the pleiotropic actions of IP3 and DAG, PLC-γ1 participates in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation (8Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories have demonstrated that PLC-γ1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to oxidant exposure, but the mechanisms leading to this activation are not well understood (11Qin S. Inazu T. Yamamura H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Blake R.A. Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem.

In addition, the physiologic consequences of PLC-γ1 activation by stress are unclear. Based on our prior studies demonstrating the importance of certain proliferation-associated signaling pathways in protecting the cell against oxidative stress (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 14Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PLC-γ1 might also be important for transducing survival signals resulting from oxidant exposure. To investigate this possibility, we have employed normal mouse embryo fibroblasts (wt MEF), MEF that have been rendered deficient for PLC-γ1 by targeted disruption of bothplc-γ1 alleles (Plcg1 null), andPlcg1 null MEF in which PLC-γ1 function has been reconstituted through stable ectopic expression of PLC-γ1 (Plcg1 null+). Our findings reported herein demonstrate that H2O2 is a strong and specific activator of PLC-γ1, and further implicate PLC-γ1 and its downstream effectors in conferring protection against oxidative stress. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was purchased from Sigma. Thapsigargin, Go6983, xestospongin C, TPA, ionomycin, PP2, PP3, wortmannin, U73122, AG1478, compound 56, AG1296, and N-acetylcysteine were all obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The JNK1 and PLC-γ1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The phospho-specific ERK rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). The phospho-specific p38 and phosphospecific Akt polyclonal antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Establishment of spontaneously immortalized wt MEF and Plcg1 null, derived from targeting vector I (TV-I), has been described previously (16Ji Q.S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 was stably re-expressed in plcg1 null MEF using a retroviral expression vector to produce plcg1 null+ MEF (17Liao H.J. Ji Q.S. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although plcg1 null do not mobilize calcium in response to growth factors, plcg1 null+ do. HeLa and T98G cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and were maintained in 5% CO2. For treatments with H2O2, an 8 mstock solution was diluted to a working concentration in deionized water and was added immediately to the culture medium (containing serum). For cell survival assays, cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and cultured overnight prior to treatment with H2O2or other agents. Following treatment, cells were harvested and stained with trypan blue, and live cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The percentage of viable cells in the treatment groups was determined from cell counts in treatment groups divided by cell counts of untreated controls. Thus, a reduction in the number of viable cells in treatment groups reflects cell death and/or inhibition of proliferation. DAPI staining was performed as described previously (18Wang X. Gorospe M. Huang Y. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In brief, prior to staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. DAPI was added to the fixed cells for 1 h, after which they were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei. After stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 5 µg of PLC-γ1 antibody and 35 µl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed four times with the same lysis buffer and were resuspended in 2× sample buffer. For immunoblot analysis, the precipitated proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, containing 5% milk, and were then probed with different antibodies. Proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). JNK activity was measured by an immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (15Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein samples were precipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with 5 µl of a JNK1 antibody with the addition of 35 µl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times each in lysis buffer and kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). JNK kinase assays were performed using GST-c-Jun-(1–135) as a substrate. Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and, after drying, were subjected to autoradiography. An unpaired Student's ttest was used to assess statistical significance of differences between normal MEF and Plcg1 null MEF. Differences were considered significant for p values of 0.05 or less. PLC-γ1 is a tyrosine kinase substrate, and it is well established that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 is necessary for its activation (9Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 10Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of H2O2 treatment on PLC-γ1 phosphorylation, wt MEF were exposed to various doses of the oxidant for 15 min and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was examined by precipitating PLC-γ1 with a PLC-γ1 antibody, followed by Western blotting analysis with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Western blot analysis with a PLC-γ1 antibody was used to verify that equal amounts of PLC-γ1 protein were present in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 1A, H2O2 treatment resulted in PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A significant increase in PLC-γ1 phosphorylation was detected with H2O2 concentrations as low as 200 µm and activation was rapid, occurring within 5 min of treatment. Maximum levels of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation were recorded 10–20 min after the addition of H2O2. It is important to note that, in these experiments, H2O2 was added directly to the serum-containing culture medium, as opposed to cells being treated with H2O2 while in phosphate-buffered saline. The fact that such low doses of H2O2 increase PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation, despite the presence of anti-oxidants in the supplemented medium, supports the physiologic relevance of our observations. This response was not unique to MEF as H2O2 treatment also led to phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in two human cell lines, HeLa and T98G glioblastoma cells (Fig. 1 C). To confirm the involvement of reactive oxygen species in PLC-γ1 phosphorylation, the ability ofN-acetylcysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and precursor of glutathione (19Cotgreave I.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), to block phosphorylation was assessed. As shown, NAC acted in a dose-dependent manner to inhibit PLC-γ1 phosphorylation in wt MEF (Fig.1 D). We and others have previously provided evidence that growth factor receptors, including EGFR and PDGFR, play an important role in mediating the activation of ERK and Akt in response to oxidant injury (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Klotz L.O. Schieke S.M. Sies H. Holbrook N.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since PLC-γ1 is also strongly activated by growth factor stimulation of these receptors, we investigated their involvement in mediating PLC-γ1 activation following H2O2 treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, AG1478 and compound 56, selective inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (20Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar,21Bridges A.J. Zhou H. Cody D.R. Rewcastle G.W. McMichael A. Showalter H.D. Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), prevented PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2 treatment. In contrast, AG1296, a specific inhibitor of PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity, had no effect on PLC-γ1 phosphorylation, although these cells have been shown to express functional PDGFRs (17Liao H.J. Ji Q.S. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for EGFR, but not PDGFR in mediating PLC-γ1 phosphorylation by oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in signaling events stimulated by reactive oxygen species (22Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and Src kinase family members have also been demonstrated to phosphorylate PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 in vitro (25Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Khare S. Bolt M.J. Wali R.K. Skarosi S.F. Roy H.K. Niedziela S.

To address the role of Src family kinases in H2O2-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, we utilized the selective Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 by H2O2 was completely blocked by the presence of 10 µm PP2. Similar treatment with the same concentration of the inactive analog PP3 had no effect on PLC-γ1 phosphorylation by H2O2, indicating that the effect of PP2 was selective. Several studies have implicated PI3-K in the activation of PLC-γ1 (27Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but others have not (30Ji Q.S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have demonstrated previously that the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway is activated in response to H2O2 treatment (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), we used the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin to test the possibility that PI3-K is involved in mediating PLC-γ1 phosphorylation in response to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, inhibition of PI3-K had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 by H2O2. Consistent with this, wortmannin does not affect calcium mobilization in response to H2O2(data not shown). H2O2 acts in a concentration-dependent manner to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (15Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 31Kim H. Lee T.H. Park E.S. Suh J.M. Park S.J. Chung H.K. Kwon O.Y. Kim Y.K. Ro H.K. Shong M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and a number of different signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in controlling cellular sensitivity to oxidant injury. To explore the role of PLC-γ1 in influencing cell survival following H2O2treatment, we compared the sensitivity of wt MEF and Plcg1null MEF to various concentrations of the oxidant. Trypan blue exclusion was employed to assess viability 24 h after treatment. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with 300 µm H2O2 inhibited the growth of both wt and Plcg1 null MEF, resulting in a reduction in the number of viable cells relative to untreated (control) cultures. At higher concentrations (450–600 µm), H2O2 became markedly cytotoxic forPlcg1 null MEF, with less than 1% of cells surviving treatment with 600 µm H2O2. However, little evidence of cytotoxicity was observed in wt MEF (Fig.3, bottom panel; see also Fig.4B and Fig. 7C). This differential sensitivity of wt and Plcg1 null MEF to H2O2 appears to be specific for oxidative stress as wt and Plcg1 null MEF did not differ in their susceptibility to another stressor, thapsigargin. Thapsigargin disrupts calcium homeostasis by inhibiting calcium ATPases on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, which triggers a unique signaling cascade referred to as the unfolded protein response (34Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, thapsigargin induces growth arrest and/or cell death. Thapsigargin had the same effect on wt and Plcg1 null MEF; although some growth arrest was observed, the treatment was toxic and resulted in significant cell death in both cell lines (Fig. 3,bottom panel). Consistent with the lack of a role for PLC-γ1 in influencing the responsiveness of MEF to thapsigargin treatment, no PLC-γ1 phosphorylation was evident in wt MEF following treatment with the agent (Fig. 3, top panel).Figure 4H2O2 rapidly induces death in Plcg1 null MEF. A, wt MEF and Plcg1 null MEF were treated with 600 µm H2O2 for the indicated times, and surviving cells (those able to exclude trypan blue) were counted. Dramatic sensitivity of Plcg1 null MEF was observed as early as 4 h after addition of H2O2 to culture medium.

C, representative phase contrast micrographs of wt, Plcg1 null, and Plcg1 null+ MEF that were either left untreated or were treated with 600 µm H2O2 for 24 h. Nuclei of apoptotic cells are fragmented and condensed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Examination of the kinetics of the response to 600 µmH2O2 treatment revealed that the onset of death occurred rapidly in Plcg1 null MEF (Fig. 4 A). Within 4 h, these cells began to shrink, round up, and detach from the plate, and by 8 h less than 1% of the cells remained viable. The wt MEF, on the other hand, remained attached to the plate, but took on a more flattened, spread-out appearance. Thus, the growth inhibitory effects of H2O2 were already apparent at early time points. Plcg1 null MEF stained with DAPI displayed features typical of apoptosis including condensation and fragmentation of nuclei (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, nuclei from H2O2-treated wt MEF remained homogeneously stained with little evidence of fragmentation (Fig. 4 B). We have previously demonstrated that both the MAPK (including ERK, JNK, and p38 members) and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways are activated in response to H2O2 treatment and influence cell survival (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 15Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the differential sensitivity of wt MEF and Plcg1 null MEF to H2O2 might be attributed to effects of PLC-γ1 on one or more of these pathways, we examined whether the PLC-γ1 status affected activation of these kinases in response to oxidant treatment. wt MEF and Plcg1 null MEF were harvested at various times after exposure to 600 µmH2O2, and examined for ERK, p38, and Akt activation by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific ERK, p38, and Akt antibodies. JNK activity was assessed by an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. As shown in Fig.5, no significant differences in the levels of ERK, JNK, or Akt phosphorylation were noted between wt MEF and Plcg1 null MEF. Although p38 activation was actually higher in the Plcg1 null MEF relative to wt MEF, neither SB202190 nor SB203580 (pharmacologic inhibitors of p38) affected MEF cell survival in response to H2O2 treatment (data not shown). Thus, the influence of PLC-γ1 on cell survival appears to be independent of MAPK and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways. Our results thus far suggest that PLC-γ1 serves a pro-survival function during H2O2 treatment. If so, then inhibition of PLC-γ1 activity would be expected to increase the sensitivity of wt MEF cells to H2O2. To test this possibility, wt MEF were treated with U73122, a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide-specific PLCγ function, prior to challenge with H2O2. As shown in Fig.6A, 30 min of pretreatment with 5 µmU73122 did significantly enhance the sensitivity of wt MEF to H2O2 (Fig.6 A). U73122 treatment in the absence of H2O2 had no effect on the cells (data not shown). The inactive analog of U73122, known as U73433, could not be included in these survival assays because it was toxic to both the wt and Plcg1 null MEF. PLC-γ1 catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate the second messenger molecules IP3 and DAG. The former provokes a transient increase in intracellular free Ca (2+), whereas the latter serves as a direct activator of PKC. It is through these second messengers that PLC-γ1 exerts its influence on proliferation. To examine their importance in influencing cell survival in response to oxidative stress, two complementary approaches were employed. First, we pretreated wt MEF with a combination of XeC (an IP3 receptor blocker) and Go6983 (a PKC inhibitor) to abrogate the PLC-γ1-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ and PKC activity. Cell survival was assessed 24 h later by trypan blue dye exclusion. As expected, the addition of XeC and Go6983 partially reduced the survival of wt MEF following exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 6 B), although treatment with XeC and Go6983 in the absence of H2O2 had no effect on the cells (data not shown). In the second approach, Plcg1 null MEF were treated with pharmacologic agents that act downstream of PLC-γ1 to increase intracellular Ca2+ (ionomycin) and activate PKC (TPA). Consistent with the hypothesis that these PLC-γ1 effector functions are important in promoting cell survival during oxidant injury, the combination of ionomycin and TPA markedly improved survival of H2O2-treated Plcg1 null MEF. Taken together, the experiments described above argue strongly that PLC-γ1 activation exerts a pro-survival influence during the cellular response to oxidant injury. As a final test of this hypothesis, we examined how reconstitution of PLC-γ1 expression in Plcg1null MEF would affect their response to H2O2treatment. Plcg1 null cells with restored PLC-γ1 expression (Plcg1 null+) were generated previously and have been shown to exhibit normal PLC-γ1 function in response to proliferative signals (17Liao H.J. Ji Q.S. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Ji Q.S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 A, the ectopically expressed PLC-γ1 in these cells undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2 treatment similar to that seen in wt MEF. Next, we compared the sensitivity of wt MEF, Plcg1null, and Plcg1 null+ MEF to various doses of H2O2. As depicted in Fig. 7 B, reconstitution of PLC-γ1 expression in the Plcg1 null MEF rescued them from H2O2-induced cytoxicity, resulting in cell viability essentially identical to that seen in wt MEF. As seen in Fig. 7 C, morphologic examination of H2O2-treated wt MEF, Plcg1 null, andPlcg1 null+ MEF confirmed the viability measurements obtained by trypan blue dye exclusion in Fig. 7 B, indicating that PLC-γ1 function is important in mediating resistance to harmful effects of H2O2. PLC-γ1 is known to play an important role in regulating cell proliferation through its interactions with both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, despite the existence of significant overlap between proliferative and stress signaling pathways, a role for PLC-γ1 in mediating cellular responses to stress has not been appreciated. Here we have demonstrated that PLC-γ1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to H2O2treatment through Src family kinases and/or an EGFR-dependent mechanism. In addition, usingPlcg1 null MEF and Plcg1 null MEF in which PLC-γ1 function is restored, we have provided evidence that PLC-γ1 expression supports cell survival following acute oxidant injury. Taken together, these findings implicate PLC-γ1 as an important regulatory molecule in the cellular response to oxidative stress. That PLC-γ1 undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in response to H2O2 treatment has been reported by others (11Qin S. Inazu T. Yamamura H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Blake R.A. Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Schieven G.L. Kirihara J.M. Myers D.E. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, most of the previous studies have employed high doses of H2O2 (in excess of 1 mm, and usually between 5 and 10 mm) and/or have required co-treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate to observe phosphorylation. Such observations suggest that H2O2 is, at best, a weak activator of PLC-γ1. In addition, the use of such high concentrations of H2O2 raises questions concerning the biologic relevance of the response, as they can be markedly cytotoxic for cells, leading to rapid necrosis. Our current studies have employed much lower concentrations of H2O2, and it is added to cells in the presence of serum, which contains significant anti-oxidant activity. We have demonstrated that, at concentrations as low as 200 µm, treatment with H2O2 results in PLC-γ1 phosphorylation, with concentration-dependent increases occurring over a range of 200–1000 µm in MEF (Fig. 1, A and B). Survival of MEF deficient in PLC-γ1 function is severely compromised over the same dose-response range of H2O2 (Fig. 3), which strongly supports the biologic relevance of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and the role of PLC-γ1 in protecting cells against H2O2-induced cell death. A number of questions remain concerning the mechanisms leading to PLC-γ1 phosphorylation in response to oxidant injury, although our studies implicate both the EGFR and Src family kinases in the process. Previously we proposed that oxidants might act to mimic the action of EGF (and perhaps other growth factors) leading to elevated EGFR kinase activity (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 5Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This in turn triggers the activation of other signaling molecules including non-receptor type tyrosine kinases, such as members of the Src family. Indeed, PLC-γ1 phosphorylation occurs rapidly in response to oxidant treatment, over the same time frame as that seen for phosphorylation of EGFR by EGF and H2O2 (2Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 35Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, in response to certain stimuli, Src kinase activation has been found to lead to phosphorylation of the EGFR (36Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is certainly possible that H2O2 acts in a similar fashion, first activating Src kinases, followed by activation of the EGFR. It has been suggested that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation is due, at least in part, to inactivation of phosphatases by H2O2, a mechanism that assumes a certain basal level of tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of overt stimulation. In support of this view, H2O2 has been shown to reversibly inactivate protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B in cells and contribute to EGFR phosphorylation in response to EGF treatment (37Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Direct activation of tyrosine kinases and inactivation of phosphatases by oxidants are not mutually exclusive events. Rather, they are both likely to influence phosphotyrosine levels and therefore the activities of upstream kinases that ultimately regulate PLC-γ1 phosphorylation. However, oxidant-mediated inactivation of a phosphatase involved in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on PLC-γ1 is obviously not sufficient to produce dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 that results from H2O2 treatment. A major conclusion of our studies is that PLC-γ1 has a pro-survival function in the cell's response to acute oxidative stress. Consistent with our observations, overexpression of PLC-γ1 in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells was reported to inhibit apoptosis induced by short wave length ultraviolet radiation (UVC) (38Lee Y.H. Kim S. Kim J. Young K.K. Kim M.J. Ryu S.H. Suh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). UVC is believed to exert its cellular affects, at least in part, through generation of oxidative stress. However, a subsequent report showed no protective influence of PLC-γ1 overexpression against several different treatments including H2O2 in NIH3T3 cells, although PLC-γ1 overexpression did favor survival (39Lee Y.H. Kim S.Y. Kim J.R. Yoh K.T. Baek S.H. Kim M.J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Kim J.H. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the significance of PLC-γ1 expression levels in the previous studies is complicated by the fact that PLC-γ1 was overexpressed in cells with otherwise normal PLC-γ1 activity. Our approach, which utilized MEF derived from embryos in whichPlcg1 expression has been eliminated through targeted gene disruption, avoided such complications and further allowed us the opportunity to evaluate how restoration of PLC-γ1 function in thePlcg1 null fibroblasts affected their response to H2O2. We observed that ectopic expression of PLC-γ1 in Plcg1 null MEF conferred resistance to H2O2 equivalent to that seen in wt MEF (Fig. 7,B and C). That PLC-γ1 may have a similar role in other stress circumstances is indicated by the finding that when grown in suspension, Plcg1 null are more sensitive to death than are Plcg1null+. 2A. Chattopahadhyay and G. Carpenter, submitted for publication. It is not clear how PLC-γ1 protects cells from oxidant injury. PLC-γ1 exhibits its influence on proliferation largely through the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which in turn provoke the mobilization of Ca2+ and activate protein kinase C, respectively. That these downstream events also contribute to PLC-γ1's influence on cell survival following H2O2 treatment was evidenced by the finding that inhibitors of PKC and Ca2+mobilization rendered wt MEF more sensitive to H2O2 treatment, whereas pharmacologic activation of PKC and Ca2+ mobilization in Plcg1null MEF enhanced their survival. Importantly, the pharmacologic agents were less effective modulators of survival in oxidant-treated cells than was manipulation of Plcg1 expression. This may be a reflection of the expected limitations of the pharmacologic approach (due to, for example, the degree of inhibition or activation achieved and the specificity of the agents actions). However, it could reflect additional, unrecognized roles of PLC-γ1. In this regard it is also interesting to note that wt and Plcg1 null MEF do not differ in their mitogenic response to EGF stimulation (40Ji Q.S. Ermini S. Baulida J. Sun F.L. Carpenter G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The marked differences in sensitivity to oxidant injury observed in wt MEF as compared with Plcg1 null MEF may thus be attributable to a unique function of PLC-γ1 during stress. Attempts to identify downstream targets of PLC-γ1 activation that are involved in mediating stress resistance are currently under way."

Fungal polyketide melanins are often derived from a pentaketide 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene, and pentaketide synthases are used for synthesis of the upstream pentaketide precursor, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (1,3,6,8-THN). However,Aspergillus fumigatus, a human fungal pathogen, uses a heptaketide synthase (Alb1p) to synthesize its conidial pigment through a pentaketide pathway similar to that which produces 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin. In this study we demonstrate that a novel protein, Ayg1p, is involved in the formation of 1,3,6,8-THN by chain-length shortening of a heptaketide precursor in A. fumigatus. Deletion of the ayg1 gene prevented the accumulation of 1,3,6,8-THN suggesting the involvement ofayg1 in 1,3,6,8-THN production. Genetic analyses of double-gene deletants suggested that Ayg1p catalyzes a novel biosynthetic step downstream of Alb1p and upstream of Arp2p (1,3,6,8-THN reductase). Further genetic and biochemical analyses of the reconstituted strains carrying alb1, ayg1, oralb1 + ayg1 indicated that Ayg1p is essential for synthesis of 1,3,6,8-THN in addition to Alb1p. Cell-free enzyme assays, using the crude Ayg1p protein extract, revealed that Ayg1p enzymatically shortened the heptaketide product of Alb1p to 1,3,6,8-THN. Thus, the protein Ayg1p facilitates the participation of a heptaketide synthase in a pentaketide pathway via a novel polyketide-shortening mechanism inA. fumigatus.

Polyketides have attracted great attention because of their biosynthetic complexity and importance in the pharmaceutical industry. Extensive molecular genetic studies of polyketide biosynthesis have been carried out in actinomycetes and Gram-positive bacteria. Microbial polyketides are generally assembled by three types of polyketide synthase (PKS)1 (1Hutchinson C.R. Fujii I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Type I modular PKSs are large multifunctional polypeptides that consist of a number of modular units (modules), each of which is responsible for single β-ketoacyl condensation and the following reduction steps. Because modules are used sequentially and nonrepetitively, the number of modules determines the length of the carbon backbones of reduced complex-type polyketides. On the other hand, type II PKSs consist of several single-function enzymes that are used iteratively for bacterial aromatic polyketides, and the determinants for polyketide skeletons are still unclear. Type III are small plant chalcone synthase-type PKSs, and RppA was identified as the first microbial PKS of this class (2Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Fungal PKSs fall into type I, consisting of a single large polypeptide with a set of active site domains similar to the modular type I PKSs, but they work iteratively to produce their specific products including both aromatic and reduced complex-type compounds. Thus they might be classified as an independent group of PKSs (3Fujii I. Sankawa U. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. Elsevier, Oxford1999: 409-441Crossref Google Scholar). Although several PKS genes have been identified from various fungal species (4Beck J. Ripka S. Siegner A. Schiltz E. Schweizer E. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exactly how a fungal PKS synthesizes a specific polyketide remains unclear. In general, PKS is the sole determinant of the chain length and cyclization pattern of a polyketide. However, a recent report showed that an accessory protein (LovC) is needed to enable the PKS (LovB) ofAspergillus terreus to synthesize a full-length polyketide precursor, dihydromonacolin L, for lovastatin biosynthesis. This suggests that fungal PKS might be of a more complex nature than the modular PKS. (9Kennedy J. Auclair K. Kendrew S.G. Park C. Vederas J.C. Hutchinson C.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1368-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Pentaketide melanins have been shown to be important virulence factors in fungal species pathogenic to plants or humans (13Tsai H.F. Chang Y.C. Washburn R.G. Wheeler M.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dixon D.M. Polak A. Szaniszlo P.J. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1987; 25: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Lundqvist T.

It is generally believed that acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are the starter and extender of polyketide synthases involved in the fungal 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin pathway. However, recently malonyl-CoA was demonstrated as the sole starter ofColletotrichum lagenarium PKS1 for production of the precursor 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (1,3,6,8-THN) (see Fig.1 A) (19Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8853-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pentaketide, 1,3,6,8-THN, is then reduced by 1,3,6,8-THN reductase to scytalone, which is subsequently converted to DHN following the dehydration and reduction steps. Finally, DHN is polymerized to form DHN-melanin. Tricyclazole, a fungicide, specifically inhibits both THN reductase reactions involved in the DHN-melanin pathway (see Fig. 1 A) (20Wheeler M.H. Bell A.A. McGinnis M.R. Current Topics in Medical Mycology. Springer Verlag, New York1988: 338-387Google Scholar). To date, the genes encoding PKS, THN reductases, and scytalone dehydratases have been characterized in several fungal species (21Butler M.J. Day A.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 1115-1136Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 22Keller N.P. Hohn T.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 17-29Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Thompson J.E. Fahnestock S.

Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, causes allergy, noninvasive colonization, or life-threatening invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A. fumigatus synthesizes its bluish green conidial pigment through a pentaketide pathway similar to the DHN-melanin pathway (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical investigations have shown that biosynthesis of the conidial pentaketide melanin in A. fumigatus requires a six-gene cluster that includes the genesalb1, arp2, and arp1 coding for PKS, 1,3,6,8-THN reductase, and scytalone dehydratase, respectively (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes also are referred to hereafter as the gene products Alb1p, Arp2p, and Arp1p. The amino acid sequence of Alb1p PKS has a significantly higher similarity to the heptaketide synthase WA ofAspergillus nidulans (67% identity, 80% similarity) than to the pentaketide synthase PKS1 of C. lagenarium (43% identity, 60% similarity). Therefore, Alb1p is likely a heptaketide synthase, which has been demonstrated by the heterologous expression ofalb1 in Aspergillus oryzae (25Watanabe A. Fujii I. Tsai H.-F. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Ebizuka Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 192: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. nidulans uses WA to synthesize a heptaketide naphthopyrone, YWA1 (see Fig. 1 B), as a precursor for its green conidial pigment, but it does not use the DHN pentaketide pathway (26Watanabe A. Fujii I. Sankawa U. Mayorga M. Timberlake W.E. Ebizuka Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 91-94Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, C. lagenarium uses PKS1 to synthesize the pentaketide precursor 1,3,6,8-THN directly for DHN melanin (19Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8853-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To understand how A. fumigatus uses a heptaketide synthase to initiate the biosynthesis of a pentaketide melanin, we explored the possible involvement of accessory protein(s) in the biosynthetic pathway. We discovered a novel protein, Ayg1p, which is required for synthesis of the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN via a novel polyketide-shortening mechanism. The A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table I and Fig. 2, A andB. Strain B-5233 is a clinical isolate that produces blue-green conidia. Deletion strains of A. fumigatus were constructed by targeted gene disruption as described previously (28Tsai H.-F. Washburn R.G. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Correct gene replacement events were confirmed by Southern blot analyses. For gene reconstitution in the six-gene cluster-deleted strain, RGD19, alb1 and/orayg1 was reintroduced and confirmed by Southern blot analyses.

Asparagine-sucrose agar (ASA) medium is identical to the alkaline medium described previously (30Wheeler M.H. Stipanovic R.D. Exp. Mycol. 1979; 3: 340-350Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For tricyclazole inhibition assays, ASA was modified to contain 1% EtOH with or without 30 µg/ml tricyclazole (Lilly) (13Tsai H.F. Chang Y.C. Washburn R.G. Wheeler M.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls with 1% EtOH alone or no EtOH were compared to exclude the possibility that 1% EtOH may affect morphology or conidial pigment production.A. fumigatus cultures used for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were grown on ASA and potato-dextrose agar (Difco), respectively. For overexpression of ayg1, A. oryzae transformants were grown in Czapek-Dox medium containing starch (31Raper K.B. Fennell D.I. The Genus Aspergillus. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1965: 36Google Scholar). Isolation of total DNA from Aspergillus cultures was performed as described previously (32Timberlake W.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 24: 5-36Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A Geneclean II kit (Bio101, Vista, CA) was used to purify recovered DNA fragments. DNA cloning and Southern blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N Y1989Google Scholar). HybondTM-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for blot analysis. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Prime-It kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cosmid pG1–1, containing the vector pCosHX (Dr. J. Hamer, Purdue University) and a 42.5-kilobase (kb) genomic DNA fragment of A. fumigatus, was obtained via plasmid rescue from a complemented conidial color mutant, RP3/G1–1 (28Tsai H.-F. Washburn R.G. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It carries a six-gene cluster of 19 kb (6-, 11-, and 2-kb HindIII fragment) involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis (see Fig.3 A). Vector pBC-phleo was a gift from Dr. P. Silar (Centre de Génétique Moléculaire du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). The six-gene cluster disruption construct, pRGD19, is a pBC KS+ (Stratagene)-based plasmid in which the 13.8-kbEcoRV-AvrII fragment (nucleotides 2006–15796, Fig. 3 A) of the17-kb HindIII DNA fragment (nucleotides 1–17029, Fig. 3 A) was replaced with a 2.8-kb hygromycin B resistance gene-selective marker (hph). Thealb1 disruption construct, pRGD18, was made by replacing the 2.6-kb EcoRV-AvrII fragment (nucleotides 13197–15796, Fig. 3 A) of the 6-kbAvrII-HindIII DNA fragment (nucleotides 10971–17029, Fig. 3 A) with a 3-kb phleomycin resistance-selective marker (ble). The ayg1 disruption plasmid, RGD16, was constructed by replacing the 1-kbSmaI-BamHI fragment (nucleotides 6718–7725, Fig.3 A) of the 2.6-kb HindIII-SacI DNA fragment (nucleotides 6090–8765, Fig. 3A) containing ayg1with a 3-kb phleomycin resistance selection marker. The alb1 gene reconstitution construct, pALB1, contains the 9.2-kb SspI-HindIII DNA fragment (nucleotides 9756–18937, Fig. 3A) that carries the entire alb1 gene in pBC-phleo. The ayg1 reconstitution construct, pAYG1, is a pBC-phleo-based plasmid and contains a 4.2-kbMluI-SacI DNA fragment (nucleotides 4580–8765, Fig. 3 A) that carries the entire ayg1 gene. Thealb1 + ayg1 reconstitution plasmid, pALBAYG51, was constructed by cloning the 3.5-kb blunt-endedNcoI-SacI fragment (nucleotides 5250–8765, Fig.3 A) carrying the ayg1 gene into the blunt-ended NotI site of pALB1. For overexpression of ayg1 in A. oryzae, theayg1 gene was cloned into the pTAex3 expression plasmid to yield pTA-ayg1. It uses an α-amylase promoter of A. oryzaeto express ayg1 and contains argB of A. nidulans as an auxotrophic selection marker (34Fujii T. Yamaoka H. Gomi K. Kitamoto K. Kumagai C. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A. fumigatus protoplasts were prepared with Mureinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed using the polyethylene glycol method described by Yelton et al. (35Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Aspergillus minimal medium containing hygromycin B (200 µg/ml) for hph-based constructs or phleomycin (30 µg/ml) for ble-based constructs. Transformation ofA. oryzae protoplasts using argB as a selection marker was described previously (36Gomi K. Limura Y. Hara S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 2549-2555Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of tricyclazole on the metabolism of 1,3,6,8-THN by B-5233 and RGD15 were visually compared using TLC analysis. The culture and TLC analysis conditions were as described previously (13Tsai H.F. Chang Y.C. Washburn R.G. Wheeler M.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. J.

For HPLC analysis of polyketide products, A. fumigatus spore suspensions prepared from 40-h-old sporulating potato-dextrose agar cultures were acidified by HCl and then extracted with ethyl acetate. Extracts were dried with N2 gas and redissolved in acetonitrile (CH3CN) (27Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was carried out using a Tosoh 8020 with a photodiode array detector. A reverse phase column (Tosoh ODS-80Ts, 4.6 × 150 mm) was maintained at 40 °C with a solvent flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. A linear solvent gradient of 5–40% CH3CN in 2% acetic acid was used for the first 30 min; then 40–100% was used for the next 10 min. Liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-APCIMS) was performed on an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, ThermoQuest). For in vitro assay of Ayg1p activity, Ayg1p crude protein extract was obtained from 3-day-old cultures of A. oryzae transformed with pTA-ayg1 and grown in Czapek-Dox medium containing starch for induction of expression. Harvested mycelia were blended with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in a Waring blender. Polyclar AT was added (4.6% w/v) to absorb phenolic compounds. The sample was then gently stirred on ice for 30 min. The mixture was subsequently filtered through four layers of gauze and centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used as the crude extract for cell-free enzyme assays. Enzyme activity was assayed at 30 °C in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 50 µm YWA1 as substrate. The reaction mixture was then analyzed directly by HPLC. The conditions for HPLC analysis were as described above for polyketides except for the solvent gradient; the linear solvent gradient was 10–50% CH3CN in 2% acetic acid for 20 min. The Aspergillus fumigatus ayg1 deletant (RGD15) and the wild-type strain B-5233 responded differently to the presence of tricyclazole in the ASA medium. The wild-type strain produced blue green conidia under normal culture conditions; however, when grown on medium containing 30 µg/ml tricyclazole, it produced reddish pink conidia (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alteration of the conidial color was due to blockage of the 1,3,6,8-THN reduction step by tricyclazole, which also caused the accumulation of flaviolin, an autoxidation product of 1,3,6,8-THN (Fig. 1 A) (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal culture conditions, RGD15 produced yellow green conidia, which appeared yellow at an early stage and gradually became a greener color as the cultures aged (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike B-5233, the ayg1deletant produced conidia of the same color on ASA medium with or without tricyclazole (data not shown). TLC analysis of culture extracts of the ayg1 deletant revealed that neither 1,3,6,8-THN nor its autoxidation product flaviolin had accumulated regardless of the presence of tricyclazole (data not shown). Therefore, deletion ofayg1 apparently prevented the synthesis of 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin. Because deletion of ayg1 prevented the accumulation of 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin, Ayg1p is likely to be involved in the biosynthetic step prior to 1,3,6,8-THN reduction (Fig. 1 A). Previous studies showed that deletion of alb1 also blocked the production of 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin and deletion of arp2 (1,3,6,8-THN reductase) led to the accumulation of flaviolin (13Tsai H.F. Chang Y.C. Washburn R.G. Wheeler M.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the function of ayg1, it is essential to find out the biosynthetic step catalyzed by Ayg1p. Because A. fumigatusis an asexual fungus, and standard genetic crosses are not feasible, double gene disruptions were carried out to determine the epistatic order of alb1, arp2, and ayg1. Conidial color was used as an indicator for the epistasis analysis of the genes because disruption of each individual gene resulted in a distinct conidial color (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of both alb1 andayg1 (RGD18) resulted in an albino conidial phenotype similar to the single alb1 deletant (RGD12) (Fig.2 A). This suggests thatalb1 is epistatic to ayg1. On the other hand, the mature conidia produced by the arp2 and ayg1double deletant (RGD16) had a yellow green color similar to that of the single ayg1 deletant suggesting that ayg1 is epistatic to arp2 (Fig. 2 B, see colony centers). Additionally, alb1 but not arp2 is essential for 1,3,6,8-THN production, indicating that alb1 is epistatic toarp2 (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that the order of the three enzymes in the pathway is Alb1p-Ayg1p-Arp2p and that there is an unknown biosynthetic step requiring Ayg1p in the production of 1,3,6,8-THN in A. fumigatus. The role of ayg1 in the pentaketide synthesis of A. fumigatus was further demonstrated by biochemical analyses of the alb1 and/orayg1 reconstituted strains. To prevent the polyketides produced by Alb1p and Ayg1p from being metabolized by other enzymes involved in the pathway, the whole six-gene cluster was deleted by targeted gene replacement as illustrated in Fig.3 A. The gene disruption construct pRGD19 was used to transform B-5233. Transformants producing albino conidia were further analyzed by Southern analysis to determine whether these albino transformants had the expected deletion. Genomic DNA of B-5233 and an albino transformant, RGD19, were hybridized with the 13.8-kb EcoRV-AvrII DNA fragments that were replaced with the hygromycin-B resistance gene in the disruption cassette. B-5233 gave two hybridizing signals of 6.0 and 11 kb, whereas RGD19 did not reveal any hybridizing signal (Fig. 3 B,panel I). The blot was stripped and rehybridized with the entire disruption cassette, pRGD19 (Fig. 3 A). B-5233 gave two hybridizing signals of 6.0 kb and 11.0 kb, whereas RGD19 showed one hybridizing fragment of 6.0 kb (Fig. 3 B, panel II). These results indicate that the whole gene cluster was disrupted in RGD19 via a double-crossover event, and the albino phenotype of RGD19 was the result of six-gene cluster disruption. Strain RGD19 was then used as a recipient strain for alb1and ayg1 reconstitution. RGD19 transformed withayg1 (strain AYG1) remained albino whereas thealb1 transformant (ALB6) produced yellow conidia (Fig.4 A). HPLC analysis of the conidial pigment extracts showed that a yellow compound produced by thealb1 transformant (ALB6) had the same retention time of 30 min as the heptaketide naphthopyrone, YWA1 (Fig. 4 B,panel II). LC-APCIMS analysis of the yellow pigment gave [M+H]+ and [M-H]− values of 277 and 275, identical with the authentic YWA1. Neither YWA1 nor 1,3,6,8-THN was detected in the transformants carrying either ayg1 or the vector alone (Fig. 4 B, panels IV andV). Thus without the presence of polyketide-metabolizing enzymes, Alb1p produces the heptaketide YWA1 in A. fumigatus. This agreed with the recent finding that heterologous expression of alb1 in A. oryzae resulted in the production of YWA1 (25Watanabe A. Fujii I. Tsai H.-F. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Ebizuka Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 192: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, reintroduction of bothalb1 and ayg1 into the strain RGD19 resulted in transformants with brown conidia (ALBAYG5) (TableI), a hallmark for the presence of 1,3,6,8-THN (Fig. 4 A). HPLC analysis indicated that thealb1 + ayg1 transformant produced compounds with retention times of 16 and 22 min, identical to those of 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin, respectively (Fig. 4 B, panel III). LC-APCIMS analysis revealed that the peak at the16-min retention time had the same [M+H]+ and [M-H]− values of 193 and 191 as those of 1,3,6,8-THN. Similarly, the [M+H]+ and [M-H]− values from the peak at the 22-min retention time were 207 and 205, identical to those of flaviolin. These data demonstrate that expression of both alb1 andayg1 results in the production of the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN. Therefore, A. fumigatus Alb1p requires Ayg1p to produce the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN and related pentaketide compounds from the heptaketide YWA1. Cell-free enzyme assays were carried out to determine whether Ayg1p converts the heptaketide naphthopyrone YWA1 to 1,3,6,8-THN enzymatically. The expression plasmid pTA-ayg1, which uses an α-amylase promoter for expression of ayg1, was introduced into A. oryzae. The crude Ayg1p protein extract was obtained from the strain, A. oryzae/pTA-ayg1, forin vitro assay. To test conversion of the heptaketide YWA1 to the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN by Ayg1p, YWA1 was used as the substrate, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC. At incubation time 0, only input substrate YWA1 was detected in the reaction mixture with a peak at a retention time of 17 min (Fig.5 A). However, after 5 min of incubation, 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin were observed with the appearance of two new peaks at the retention times of 9 and 13.5 min, respectively (Fig. 5 B). During the 5-min incubation period, the amount of YWA1 decreased with time as evidenced by absorption at 406 nm, the absorption maximum of YWA1 (data not shown). In contrast, neither 1,3,6,8-THN nor flaviolin was detected in the reaction mixture using the crude extract of A. oryzae transformed with the vector pTAex3 after 5 min of incubation (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, the cell-free enzyme assay demonstrated that Ayg1p enzymatically converts the heptaketide YWA1 to the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN via a post-PKS polyketide shortening mechanism. A cluster of six genes, alb1, arp2,arp1, abr1, abr2, and ayg1, involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. fumigatuswas previously identified and characterized (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that A. fumigatus synthesizes its conidial pigment through a pentaketide pathway similar to the DHN-melanin pathway found in many brown-to-black fungi. In this study, we showed that unlike the known DHN-melanin pathway, A. fumigatus uses a heptaketide synthase, Alb1p, instead of a pentaketide synthase for the production of the pentaketide precursor 1,3,6,8-THN. In addition, a novel protein, Ayg1p, is required for Alb1p to produce 1,3,6,8-THN. We demonstrated that Ayg1p converted the heptaketide product of Alb1p to the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN through a novel polyketide-shortening mechanism. Disruption of ayg1 prevented the accumulation of the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN and its autoxidation product flaviolin suggesting that Ayg1p is involved in synthesis of 1,3,6,8-THN inA. fumigatus. Reconstitution of both alb1 andayg1 in the cluster deletant, RGD19, resulted in the production of brown conidia suggesting that Ayg1p altered the polyketide product of Alb1p. In fact, the (alb1 +ayg1)-reconstituted strain did produce 1,3,6,8-THN and flaviolin, whereas YWA1, the product of Alb1p, was undetectable. This is fundamentally different from the known pentaketide melanin pathway in which PKS alone directly synthesizes the pentaketide 1,3,6,8-THN (19Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8853-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Identification of this novel shortening step offers mechanistic insights into how the polyketide shortening is achieved. Our data show that Ayg1p could enzymatically convert the heptaketide YWA1 to the pentaketide1,3,6,8-THN. The cell-free enzyme studies support the view that Ayg1p is capable of shortening the carbon backbone of the heptaketide YWA1. A data base-homology search with the Ayg1p amino acid sequence did not identify any homologous protein (24Tsai H.F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a motif search showed the presence of a hydrolytic (lipase, peptidase-type) enzyme motif around the Ser257 residue, which is located at the possible active site of Ayg1p (kmVVwGlS257AGGYyA motif). As shown in Fig.6, the acyl side-chain open form of YWA1 is likely deacylated by Ayg1p hydrolytically, producing 1,3,6,8-THN and the diketide acetoacetate. The demonstration that Ayg1p shortened YWA1 to 1,3,6,8-THN in the absence of Alb1p also indicates that the polyketide shortening is a post-PKS modification. The carbon skeletons of polyketides are generally determined by polyketide synthases alone, although exceptions have been reported previously (9Kennedy J. Auclair K. Kendrew S.G. Park C. Vederas J.C. Hutchinson C.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1368-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In A. terreus, for example, an accessory protein is required for the polyketide synthase to produce the full-length polyketide for lovastatin biosynthesis (9Kennedy J. Auclair K. Kendrew S.G. Park C. Vederas J.C. Hutchinson C.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1368-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Lack of the accessory protein led to the synthesis of polyketides with shortened polyketide chains. However, in contrast to lovastatin biosynthesis inA. terreus through polyketide extension, the novel Ayg1p protein in A. fumigatus shortens a polyketide carbon chain through a post-PKS modification. Discovery of the post-PKS modification implies that the polyketide carbon backbone is not solely determined by the polyketide synthase reaction itself. Our study showed that post-PKS enzymatic steps can greatly influence the carbon skeleton of polyketides and are not restricted to modifications of functional groups. To date, the engineering of polyketide synthases has been the main focus of combinatorial biosynthesis aimed at creating new compounds through genetic manipulation of the microbial genes and enzymes. The identification of a protein capable of modifying the polyketide carbon backbone may have a significant impact on the application of post-PKS modifications to the combinatorial synthesis of polyketides.

To investigate the functional protection of the MR by 11β-HSD2, we coexpressed epitope-tagged MR and 11β-HSD2 in HEK-293 cells lacking 11β-HSD2 activity and analyzed their subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. When expressed alone in the absence of hormones, the MR was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. However, when coexpressed with 11β-HSD2, the MR displayed a reticular distribution pattern, suggesting association with 11β-HSD2 at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization of the MR was observed upon coexpression only with 11β-HSD2, but not with 11β-HSD1 or other steroid-metabolizing enzymes. Aldosterone induced rapid nuclear translocation of the MR, whereas moderate cortisol concentrations (10–200 nm) did not activate the receptor, due to 11β-HSD2-dependent oxidation to cortisone. Compromised 11β-HSD2 activity (due to genetic mutations, the presence of inhibitors, or saturating cortisol concentrations) led to cortisol-induced nuclear accumulation of the MR. Surprisingly, the 11β-HSD2 product cortisone blocked the aldosterone-induced MR activation by a strictly 11β-HSD2-dependent mechanism. Our results provide evidence that 11β-HSD2, besides inactivating 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids, functionally interacts with the MR and directly regulates the magnitude of aldosterone-induced MR activation. 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) type 2 has been considered to protect the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by converting 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids into their inactive 11-keto forms, thereby providing specificity to the MR for aldosterone.

These ligand-dependent transcription factors are generally located in the nucleus even in the absence of hormone, with the exception of the GR, the androgen receptor (AR), and the MR. The localization of the MR in the absence of hormone is controversial (1Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Several investigators reported mainly cytoplasmic localization of the MR in different tissues or transfected cells using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis (2Binart N. Lombes M.

S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The unliganded MR is part of a soluble hetero-oligomeric complex that includes hsp90, hsp70, and other associated proteins (11Trapp T. Holsboer F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Couette B. Fagart J. Jalaguier S. Lombes M. Souque A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The presence of hsp90 in the receptor complex seems to prevent activation of the unliganded MR. Binding of aldosterone initiates a conformational activation within the ligand-binding domain of the receptor that leads to the dissociation of several associated proteins from the receptor, followed by dimerization and nuclear translocation of the activated receptor. Variations in the expression level of associated proteins necessary for nuclear translocation of the MR or differences in the expression levels of proteins regulating intracellular free corticosteroid concentrations might be responsible for the observed controversial findings obtained from different tissues or cell systems. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of the applied anti-MR antibodies with other members of the steroid/thyroid receptor family cannot be excluded in some of the previous investigations. The mineralocorticoid aldosterone and the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone have similar affinities for binding to the MR (13Krozowski Z.S. Funder J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the circulating concentrations of cortisol (in humans) and corticosterone (in rodents) are 100–1000 times higher than those of aldosterone (17Holbrook M.M. Dale S.L. Melby J.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1980; 13: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), cortisol and corticosterone do not lead to MR activation under normal conditions. This is due to the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) activity present in most MR-expressing cells. Two 11β-HSD enzymes, both localizing to the ER membrane, have been described so far (for review, see Refs. 18White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar and 19Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam.

In vivo, it acts predominantly as a reductase, but it efficiently oxidates 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids when measured in intact cells or in cell lysates. The catalytic domain of 11β-HSD1 is directed toward the ER lumen (22Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol.

In contrast, 11β-HSD2 is mainly expressed in the kidney and in other mineralocorticoid-sensitive tissues and catalyzes exclusively the oxidation of 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids (25Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Its catalytic moiety protrudes into the cytoplasm (23Odermatt A.

By binding to the MR, aldosterone and, under certain circumstances, glucocorticoids play a major role in the regulation of sodium and potassium homeostasis. Whereas aldosterone normally elicits sodium retention and kaliuresis, 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids cause kaliuresis without sodium retention. There is evidence from several in vivo studies that the aldosterone-induced salt retention is blunted by the co-administration of glucocorticoids, suggesting an MR antagonist-like action of glucocorticoids (40Kenyon C.J.

More recently, evidence for distinct physiological effects of aldosterone in aldosterone target tissues and non-epithelial tissues was presented (43Funder J.W. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1358-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the impact of 11β-HSD enzyme expression on the intracellular distribution of the MR and analyzed the corticosteroid-induced nuclear translocation of the receptor under various conditions. The results suggest that the MR is specifically associated with 11β-HSD2 at the ER membrane in the absence of corticosteroids. Moreover, 11β-HSD2 tightly regulated the access of aldosterone to the MR by inactivating 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids, whereby the formed 11-keto products blunted the aldosterone-induced nuclear translocation of the MR. Wild-type and FLAG epitope-tagged human 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 expression plasmids were constructed as described (23Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol.

The tagged human MR was obtained by insertion of the nonapeptide hemagglutinin (HA) epitope with the sequence YPYDVPDYA at the carboxyl-terminal end just upstream of the stop codon.

Russell (Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK-293 cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates containing 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 0.5 µg of MR cDNA and 0.5 µg of 11β-HSD2 cDNA per well. When expressing the MR alone, 0.5 µg of empty pcDNA3 vector DNA was added as a carrier. Transient transfection resulted in 30–35% of 11β-HSD2- and MR-positive cells. Six hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution, followed by incubation in medium that was charcoal-stripped twice. Analysis of the medium by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed the absence of corticosteroids. 2B. Dick, unpublished data. HEK-293 cells were transiently cotransfected with 50 ng of plasmid MMTV-lacZ (53Satoh K. Galli I. Ariga H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4429-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, and either 450 ng of plasmid RShMR, encoding the human MR (15Arriza J.L.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced by steroid-free medium at 24 h post-transfection. Another 24 h later, cortisol dissolved in methanol or the corresponding amount of methanol was added, and cells were incubated for another 16 h prior to analysis by the Dual-Light assay (Tropix, Inc., Foster City, CA). 11β-HSD enzyme activity was measured in intact cells as described (23Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK-293 cells incubated in charcoal-treated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h were washed once with Hanks' solution and resuspended in prewarmed (37 °C) steroid-free medium. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in a final volume of 20 µl containing 30 nCi of [3H]corticosterone and unlabeled corticosterone at different concentrations ranging from 25 nm to 2 µm. The reaction was started by mixing the cell suspension with the reaction mixture. Incubation was for 10–30 min, and the conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone was determined by thin-layer chromatography. Enzyme kinetics were analyzed by the Eadie-Hofstee linear transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The protein expression of the different 11β-HSD constructs was compared by semiquantitative Western blot analysis. Transfected cells grown in charcoal-treated medium for 14 h were incubated in the presence or absence of the appropriate concentrations of 11β-HSD2 inhibitors for 5 min as indicated, followed by the addition of corticosteroids. Cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and washed once with 150 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 120 mmsucrose, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed as described (23Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged proteins and HA-tagged proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) and a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) as first antibodies, respectively, and anti-mouse antibody Alexa-488 and anti-rat antibody Alexa-594 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands) as secondary antibodies, respectively. In coexpression experiments with the AR, human 11β-HSD2 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody generously provided by Dr. Z. N. Kyossev (Division of Nephrology, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AK) (54Kyossev Z. Walker P.D. Reeves W.B. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and anti-rabbit secondary antibody Alexa-594. Immunofluorescence was detected using a Model LSM410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Quantitation of intracellular localization of the MR or AR was performed by counting the number of cells within an area selected under the transmitted light and determination of positively staining cells that were classified into three different categories: predominantly cytoplasmic staining, comparable intensity of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, and exclusively nuclear staining. Results were obtained from at least three independent transfection experiments, in which between 400 and 500 stained cells were determined for each sample. To investigate the intracellular distribution of the MR in the absence of hormone, we transiently expressed the C-terminally HA epitope-tagged MR in HEK-293 cells and analyzed receptor localization by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. We confirmed the lack of endogenous 11β-HSD activity in HEK-293 cells (23Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activities of wild-type and HA-tagged MRs, determined by a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay, were indistinguishable. No MR transcriptional activity was detected in untransfected cells (data not shown). The anti-HA antibody, specifically recognizing the nonapeptide epitope YPYDVPDYA, was used for fluorescence microscopy detection. Incubation of untransfected HEK-293 cells with the anti-HA antibody did not produce any signal; therefore, the problem of cross-reactivity with other receptors inherent with antibodies raised directly against the MR could be avoided. Cells transiently expressing the MR and grown in steroid-free medium exhibited both cytoplasmic and nuclear presence of the receptor (TableI). A heterogeneous distribution pattern with significant cell-to-cell differences was observed (Fig.1). Low concentrations of aldosterone, cortisol, or corticosterone mediated complete nuclear translocation of the receptor (Table I).Table ICorticosteroid- and 11β-HSD2-dependent intracellular distribution of the MRPositive cellsNN/CC%MR303337MR, 10 nmaldosterone10000MR, 10 nmcortisol10000MR, 10 nmcorticosterone10000MR, 11β-HSD20199MR, 11β-HSD2, 10 nm aldosterone731710MR, 11β-HSD2, 10 nm cortisol0298MR, 11β-HSD2, 10 nm corticosterone0298MR, 11β-HSD2, 2.5 µm glycyrrhetinic acid0595MR, 11β-HSD2, 100 µm furosemide0496MR, ΔL114,E1152593MR, ΔL114,E115, 10 nm cortisol73189MR, ΔL114,E115, 50 nm cortisol9631MR, R337C1495MR, R337C, 10 nm cortisol83134MR, R337C, 50 nm cortisol9721MR, 11β-HSD1253342MR, 11β-HSD1, 10 nmcortisol9064MR, 11β-HSD1 mutant K5S,K6S303634MR, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase294427MR, steroid 5α-reductase type I332938MR, CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase67258MR, CYP7A1 cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase553411AR195724AR, 11β-HSD2245323AR, 100 nmtestosterone10000AR, 11β-HSD2, 100 nmtestosterone10000HEK-293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged MR or cotransfected with the HA-tagged MR and FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD2, FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD1, or unrelated steroid-metabolizing enzymes. Transfected cells were grown for 14 h in steroid-free medium prior to the addition of corticosteroid hormones or inhibitors of 11β-HSD2 and incubation for another 45 min. Immunostaining using antibodies against the HA and FLAG epitopes was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Alternatively, the FLAG-tagged AR was expressed alone or with wild-type 11β-HSD2 both in the absence and presence of testosterone.

Open table in a new tab HEK-293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged MR or cotransfected with the HA-tagged MR and FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD2, FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD1, or unrelated steroid-metabolizing enzymes.

Results represent the percentage of fluorescent cells relative to total cells, whereby 400–500 fluorescent cells were determined. In most mineralocorticoid-sensitive cells, the MR is coexpressed with 11β-HSD2. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of 11β-HSD2 expression on the intracellular distribution of the MR. Dual staining of cells incubated in the absence of hormone and expressing both the HA-tagged MR and FLAG-tagged 11β-HSD2 and subsequent analysis by confocal microscopy revealed a localization pattern that was dramatically different from that observed when the MR was expressed in the absence of 11β-HSD2. The MR displayed a typically reticular distribution pattern, with no MR present in the nucleus, suggesting association of the receptor with the ER membrane in the absence of aldosterone (TableI and Fig. 2, A–C). An overlay image of the expression of the MR and 11β-HSD2 at high resolution indicated the colocalization of both proteins at the ER membrane (Fig. 2, D–F). The ER membrane association of the MR was analyzed further by coexpressing the HA-tagged MR with untagged wild-type 11β-HSD2 and FLAG-tagged sarcolipin, a small proteolipid known to be located exclusively in the ER membrane (47Odermatt A.

Both the MR and sarcolipin showed almost identical reticular expression patterns (Fig. 2, G–I), indicating ER membrane association of the MR. Sarcolipin alone did not affect the intracellular distribution of the MR since, in the absence of 11β-HSD2, a heterogeneous MR distribution comparable to that shown in Fig. 1 was observed. The MR also displayed exclusively reticular localization when coexpressed in the absence of corticosteroids with 11β-HSD2 mutant ΔL114,E115 or R337C, both of which were derived from patients suffering from AME and which retained only very low dehydrogenase activity (Table I) (45Odermatt A.

A few anti-apoptotic Rel/NF-κB target genes have been characterized; they act either downstream in the apoptotic pathway or upstream, for example at the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor level. We found using DNA arrays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence that Rel/NF-κB factors up-regulate DcR1, a receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a cytokine of the TNF family that induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Four related receptors bind TRAIL, two death receptors (DR4 and DR5) that signal apoptosis and two decoy receptors (DcR1 and DcR2) that act as dominant negative inhibitors of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. DcR1 is devoid of an intracellular domain and is anchored at the cell surface membrane by a glycophospholipid. Our results indicate that overexpression of cRel or activation of endogenous Rel/NF-κB factors by TNFα in HeLa cells up-regulates DcR1 without changing the expression of DcR2, DR4, and DR5 and makes cells resistant against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This resistance is a consequence of DcR1 up-regulation, because it was abolished when DcR1 was removed from the cell surface by a phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. Therefore, Rel/NF-κB transcription factors could regulate the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL, by controlling the ratio of TRAIL-decoy to -death receptors.

Rel/NF-κB dimers are assumed to be ubiquitously expressed but in a transcriptionally inactive complex with a protein of the IκB family. The prototypic protein of this family, IκBα, is able to both retain Rel/NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm and inhibit their binding to DNA. The inhibition of Rel/NF-κB dimers by IκBα can be released upon stimulation by a variety of agents, including TNFα1 and IL-1β, which leads to the activation of high molecular weight complexes containing IκB kinase activity. The best characterized of these complexes, the IκB kinase signalsome, is composed of two IκB kinases, IκB kinase α, and IκB kinase β, and a regulatory component, NEMO. Upon IκBα or IκBβ kinase activation, IκBα is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, thus allowing Rel/NF-κB dimers to exert transcriptional control (1Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin.

Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), act upstream in the apoptotic pathway, principally at the TNF receptor level and, therefore, may account especially for the resistance against apoptosis induced by TNFα. A few years ago, a new member of the TNF family was independently characterized by two groups and named Apo2 ligand or TRAIL, for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Indeed, TRAIL activates apoptosis in many tumor cell lines by inducing the caspase cascade. TRAIL binds a family of receptors belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily. Two of these receptors, DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), possess a death domain in their cytoplasmic part, which enables them to engage the apoptotic machinery in a way similar to that engaged by TNF receptor 1 or Fas. Two other receptors, DcR1 (TRAIL-R3) and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), are decoy receptors, respectively devoid of cytoplasmic domain or with a truncated death domain lacking the amino acids critical for apoptosis signaling (31Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 32Marsters S.A. Pitti R.A. Sheridan J.P. Ashkenazi A. Recent Prog. Horm.

DcR1 and DcR2 behave as transdominant negative receptors, protecting against TRAIL-induced apoptosis either by competing for TRAIL binding on DR4 and DR5 or by forming inactive heterotrimeric receptors with DR4 or DR5 (33Schneider P.

Since TRAIL induces apoptosis in a wide range of transformed cell lines but not in normal cells (37Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar, 38Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that decoy receptor expression may participate in the determination of whether cells are sensitive or resistant to TRAIL. In this report, we show that Rel/NF-κB transcription factors, upon overexpression or physiological activation by TNFα in HeLa cells, increase DcR1 expression, with no concomitant induction of DcR2, DR4, or DR5. This DcR1 induction confers resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The bicistronic pEGFP/cRel expression vector was constructed from the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), designed to synthesize proteins fused to the C terminus of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). To stop the translation of EGFP at the 5′ end of the multiple cloning site, we inserted a sequence containing multiple stop codons between the HindIII andBglII sites. Next, the internal ribosomal entry site sequence of the poliovirus type 1 (39Ziegler E. Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Kean K.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3465-3474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted between the Asp-718 and SmaI sites of the multiple cloning site. This construct, named pEGFP, was used as a control vector. To obtain the pEGFP/cRel expression vector, the human c-rel cDNA (40Brownell E. Mittereder N. Rice N.R. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted in the XbaI site of the multiple cloning site. HeLa cells from the European Collection of Cell Culture (number 93021013), were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. GFP-expressing cells were sorted 24 h after transfection with an Epics Elite cytometer (Coulter) using excitation at 488 nm and detection at 520–530 nm. On average, 40% of cells were GFP-positive. Sorting was adjusted to keep cells from the most fluorescent third of the GFP-positive population. Twenty-four to 72 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. cRel was detected with an anti-human cRel mouse IgG1 (Sc-6955, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a secondary antibody, rhodamine Red-X-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). DcR1 was detected by a procedure involving tyramide amplification. Briefly, cells were successively incubated with anti-human DcR1 goat serum (Alexis Biochemicals), peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), biotinylated tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and rhodamine Red-X-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at 1 µg/ml. Cells were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135 TV, Zeiss) using filter sets specific for GFP, Hoechst, and rhodamine. After sorting by flow cytometry, cells were grown for 24 h and then washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, scraped, and sonicated. After a 20,000 ×g centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, the total protein concentration in extracts was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were successively incubated with an anti-human cRel mouse IgG1 (sc-6955, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Peroxidase activity was revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reporter vector used to measure the transcriptionnal activity of overexpressed cRel or endogenous Rel/NF-κB factors was the p3κB-Luc vector containing three human immunodeficiency virus κB sites upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal reporter and the luciferase cDNA. The luciferase activity was measured 24–36 h after transfection by the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were transfected, sorted, and cultured as described above. They were then homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNAs were isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNAs were synthesized using the Gene Amp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCRs were performed with the Gene Amp 9600 PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 50 µl of buffer containing 2.5 µl of the retrotranscription product, all four dNTPs at 150 µm, MgCl2 (3 mm for cRel, 2 mm for others), 1 unit of Taq gold polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and each primer at 1 µm.

Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). 28–37 amplification cycles were done at 94 °C for 1 min, 53.3 °C (cRel), 55 °C (β-actin), 59.0 °C (DcR2), 56.9 °C (ΘκBα), 58.4 °C (DcR1), 59.2 °C (p105), 60.9 °C (DR5), 61.2 °C (DR4) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with an initial step of 5 min at 95 °C. PCR product lengths were 415 bp (DR4), 418 bp (DcR2), 420 bp (cRel), 430 bp (p105), 437 bp (DR5), 503 bp (IκBα), 546 bp (DcR1), and 661 bp (β-actin). HeLa cells were either transfected by pEGFP or pEGFP/cRel or treated by TNFα (R&D Systems) at 10 ng/ml. Forty eight or 18 h later, respectively, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing PI-PLC (Sigma) at 3 µg/ml and cycloheximide (Sigma) at 10 µg/ml. One h later, the medium was replaced by fresh medium, and the expression of DcR1 or the sensitivity to TRAIL were assayed. Cells were incubated or not with TNFα (R&D Systems) at 10 ng/ml for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as in Lin et al. (41Lin K.I. Lee S.H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The κB consensus probe (Promega) was radiolabeled according to recommendations of Promega and purified using QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (28304, Qiagen). One µg of nuclear extract was incubated with 0.035 pmol of radiolabeled κB consensus probe according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Competitions with cold probe were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with the κB cold probe in a 50- or 100-fold excess. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 µl of anti-cRel, anti-RelA, anti-p50 (antibodies used were those described by Pepin et al. (42Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Lin R. Hiscott J. Virology. 1994; 204: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe by migration on native 4% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 2 h. The expression vector used to inhibit Rel/NF-κB activity contains the avian IκBα cDNA inserted in the pCR3 plasmid (Invitrogen). The empty pCR3 plasmid was used as a control. Rel/NF-κB factors were activated 24–36 h after transfection by treating cells overnight with 10 ng/ml TNFα (R&D Systems). Apoptosis was induced by treatment with various concentrations of TRAIL (R&D Systems) and 10 µg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). After that, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Apoptotic and viable cells were recognized according to the condensation and fragmentation degree of their cytoplasm and nuclei. Viable cells were manually counted among 100 GFP-positive cells, in triplicate for each point. The statistical analysis were performed with analysis of variance (Statview). To identify new anti-apoptotic genes under Rel/NF-κB control, we applied the DNA array technique on HeLa cells that were made apoptosis-resistant by overexpression of a Rel/NF-κB factor, cRel. The cRel expression vector constructed, pEGFP/cRel, expresses a bicistronic internal ribosomal entry site-based mRNA encoding both cRel and the EGFP. The concordance between cRel and GFP expression in pEGFP/cRel-transfected cells was checked by immunofluorescence. Whereas cRel was undetectable in GFP-positive cells transfected by the pEGFP control vector, it was detected in all GFP-positive cells transfected by the pEGFP/cRel vector (Fig.1 A). The most fluorescent GFP-positive cells were those that express cRel at the highest level (data not shown). Hence, this vector allowed us to sort cRel-overexpressing cells by flow cytometry on the basis of their GFP fluorescence and, therefore, to perform molecular analysis on nearly pure populations. The overexpression of cRel in pEGFP/cRel-transfected and -sorted cells was analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a protein migrating at the expected M r 75,000 was overexpressed in cells transfected by pEGFP/cRel. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the overexpressed protein was preferentially located in the nucleus (Fig. 1 A), suggesting it was transcriptionally active. To further establish this point, cells were co-transfected by either pEGFP or pEGFP/cRel and a p3κB-Luc reporter vector. The luciferase activity of cRel-transfected cells was about 6.5-fold that of control cells (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the overexpressed cRel was transcriptionally active. This transcriptional activity was finally confirmed by determining the expression level of two known Rel/NF-κB target genes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed for Iκβα (43Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) and p105 (44Lombardi L. Ciana P. Cappellini C. Trecca D. Guerrini L. Migliazza A. Maiolo A.T. Neri A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2328-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression of these two genes was induced in pEGFP/cRel-transfected and -sorted cells compared with control cells, whereas the β-actin control was expressed at similar levels in both cases (Fig. 1 D). Therefore, HeLa cells transfected by the pEGFP/cRel vector overexpressed a transcriptionally active cRel protein. As already described by us and others (17Liu Z.-G. Hsu H., V. Goeddel D. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 18Zong W.X. Bash J. Gelinas C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Bernard D. Quatannens B. Begue A. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2656-2664PubMed Google Scholar), this overexpression renders these cells resistant against apoptosis induced by TNFα in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). These cRel-overexpressing cells thus appear suitable for searching new target genes of Rel/NF-κB factors involved in their anti-apoptotic activity. To identify new anti-apoptotic genes induced by cRel, we have made a large scale screening by using DNA arrays. Total RNAs from pEGFP- and pEGFP/cRel-transfected cells were extracted, retrotranscribed in 33P-radiolabeled cDNAs, and successively hybridized on a filter containing ∼4000 spots for human named genes (GF211, Research Genetics). Radioactivity levels were measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamic), and the differential analysis of the results was done using the PathwaysTM software (Research Genetics). Among several genes whose expression level changed above 2-fold between cRel-overexpressing cells and control cells (data not shown), only one fulfilled the criterion of being a new Rel/NF-κB anti-apoptotic target gene; this gene is DcR1, which encodes a decoy receptor of TRAIL, a cytokine of the TNF family. The expression of DcR1 was induced 2.4-fold in cRel-expressing cells, whereas that of another TRAIL receptor, DR5, remained unchanged. The other TRAIL receptors, DcR2 and DR4, were not represented on the filter. Changes in the expression of all four TRAIL receptors were subsequently investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.2 A, the levels of DcR1 mRNAs increased in cRel-expressing cells compared with control cells, confirming the DNA array results. In contrast, no change in the expression of the other TRAIL receptors was detected: the levels of DcR2, DR4, and DR5 mRNAs were similar in cRel-expressing cells and in control cells (Fig. 2 A). Since it has been shown that in some cell types DcR1 is expressed but not localized at the membrane (45Zhang X.D. Nguyen T. Thomas W.D. Sanders J.E. Hersey P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we examined the localization of DcR1 in cRel-expressing cells by immunofluorescence. The comparative observation of GFP-positive cells transfected by pEGFP or pEGFP/cRel revealed that DcR1 was specifically accumulated in cRel-expressing cells (Fig. 2 B). DcR1 being anchored at the surface membrane by a phosphatidylinositol tail (35Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Science. 1997; 277: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar), it can be specifically removed from the cell surface by treating cells with an extracellularly added phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (35Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After a 1-h treatment with PI-PLC in the presence of CHX (to avoid any DcR1 neosynthesis), DcR1 became undetectable by immunofluorescence in pEGFP/cRel-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that it was indeed localized at the cell surface. Taken together, these results indicate that cRel induces the expression of the TRAIL decoy receptor DcR1 at the membrane, with no concomitant induction of DcR2, DR4, and DR5. To establish whether physiological levels of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors directly participate in the control of DcR1 expression, endogenous Rel/NF-κB activity was induced in parental HeLa cells by TNFα or inhibited by IκBα overexpression, and DcR1 expression was assessed in both cases. Rel/NF-κB activation by TNFα was checked by gel shift assays. Thirty minutes of TNFα treatment increased Rel/NF-κB binding on a κB consensus probe (Fig.3 A). Supershift experiments indicate that the affected Rel/NF-κB dimers were composed of at least cRel, RelA, and p50 (Fig. 3 A). The transcriptional activity of these complexes was assayed by transfecting the p3κB-Luc reporter vector. Fig. 3 B shows a 3.5-fold increase in transcriptional activity upon TNFα treatment. Both the basal and TNFα-induced transcriptional activities were inhibited by overexpressing IκBα (Fig. 3 B). Changes in TRAIL receptor expression upon TNFα treatment and/or IκBα overexpression were then investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results show that TNFα treatment induced the accumulation of DcR1 transcripts but not DcR2, DR4, and DR5. This DcR1 induction was markedly decreased in IκBα-transfected cells although not completely abolished because of the partial transient transfection efficiency (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rel/NF-κB transcription factors directly participate in the control of the expression of DcR1 but not of other TRAIL receptors. Since DcR1 ectopic expression has been shown to"

Although these findings have provided support for involvement of c-Abl in the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress, few insights are available regarding the signals conferred by c-Abl in this response.In the present studies, we show that treatment of cells with H2O2 induces translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria. The results demonstrate that mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl is dependent on PKCδ and the c-Abl kinase function. We also demonstrate that c-Abl mediates ROS-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ψm), depletion of ATP, and a necrosis-like cell death.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo assess the effects of ROS on c-Abl, we investigated the subcellular localization of c-Abl in response to H2O2 by measuring intracellular fluorescence with a high sensitivity CCD camera and image analyzer. Examination of the distribution of fluorescence markers in control MEFs showed distinct patterns for anti-c-Abl (red signal) and a mitochondrion-selective dye (Mitotracker; green signal). By contrast exposure to H2O2 was associated with a marked change in fluorescence signals (redand green → yellow and orange) supporting translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria (Fig.1 A). To confirm targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria in response to ROS, mitochondria were isolated from MEFs treated with H2O2. Analysis of the mitochondrial fraction by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl demonstrated an increase in c-Abl protein that was detectable at 30 min and through 3 h (Fig. 1 B). Densitometric scanning of the signals demonstrated over a 5-fold increase in c-Abl protein at 0.5-1 h of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting for the mitochondrial HSP60 protein was used to assess loading of the lanes (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, purity of the mitochondrial fraction was confirmed by reprobing the blots with antibodies against the cytoplasmic β-actin protein, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein, and the cell membrane platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Fig. 1 B). To estimate the amount of c-Abl protein that localizes to mitochondria, we subjected whole cell and mitochondrial lysates, each prepared from 3 × 106cells, to immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. Densitometric scanning of the signals (Fig. 1 C) and adjustment for lysate volume indicated that mitochondrial c-Abl is ∼4% of the total cellular c-Abl protein. Following treatment with H2O2, ∼20% of total c-Abl localized to mitochondria (Fig. 1 B). As an additional control, mitochondrial lysates were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Abl showed H2O2-induced increases in levels of mitochondrial c-Abl protein (Fig. 1 D). The demonstration that c-Abl levels are increased in the mitochondria of H2O2-treated human U-937 leukemia cells (Fig.1 E) and human neuroblastoma cells (data not shown) further indicated that this response occurs in diverse cell types.To confirm involvement of ROS in targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria, MEFs were treated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen intermediates and precursor of glutathione (22Roederer M. Staal F.J. Raju P.A. Ela S.W. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine treatment inhibited H2O2-induced translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). Also to determine whether ROS-induced activation of the c-Abl kinase function is necessary for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria, MCF-7 cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) mutant at levels comparable with that of kinase-active c-Abl in MCF-7/neo cells (Fig.2 B, left panel) (11Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were treated with H2O2. The finding that MCF-7/neo, but not MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), cells respond to H2O2 with translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria supported a requirement for the c-Abl kinase function (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These results indicate that ROS-induced c-Abl activation is associated with the targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria.Figure 2Targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria is dependent on ROS-induced c-Abl activation. A, MEFs were pretreated with 30 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) for 1 h before adding H2O2 for an additional 1 h. Mitochondrial lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Abl, anti-HSP60, and anti-β-actin. B, mitochondrial lysates from MCF-7 and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells treated with H2O2 were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl and anti-β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The available evidence indicates that ROS activate c-Abl by a mechanism dependent on the PKCδ kinase (19Sun X.

To determine whether PKCδ contributes to mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl, MEFs were treated with the selective PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (24Gschwendt M. Kielbassa K. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 773-779Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although rottlerin had no effect on constitutive levels of mitochondrial c-Abl, this agent inhibited H2O2-induced c-Abl translocation (Fig. 3 A). To extend the interaction of PKCδ and c-Abl, 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-c-Abl and PKCδ. Analysis of the mitochondrial fraction by immunoblotting with anti-HA demonstrated that targeting of HA-c-Abl to mitochondria is increased by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, cotransfection of HA-c-Abl and kinase-inactive PKCδ was associated with less targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria and no apparent effect of H2O2treatment (Fig. 3 B). These findings provide support for the involvement of ROS-induced activation of PKCδ in mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl.Figure 3PKC δ is required for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria. A, MEFs were pretreated with 10 μm rottlerin for 0.5 h and then with H2O2 for 1 h. Mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. B, 293T cells were cotransfected to express HA-c-Abl and GFP-PKCδ or GFP-PKCδ(K-R). At 24 h, the cells were treated with H2O2 for 2 h. Lysates prepared from the mitochondrial fraction and intact cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP and anti-HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the results indicate that c-Abl targets mitochondria in the ROS response, we hypothesized that c-Abl may directly induce mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine whether c-Abl is necessary for ROS-induced loss of ψm, wild-type and c-Abl−/− cells were treated with H2O2 and then stained with rhodamine 123. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was substantially diminished in H2O2-treated wild-type cells (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the ψm was protected from ROS-induced loss in c-Abl−/−cells, but not in c-Abl−/− cells transfected to stably express c-Abl (c-Abl+) (Fig. 4 A). Cyclosporin A prevents the reduction in ψm induced by various agents that open mitochondrial permeability transition pores (25Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). In this context, pretreatment of wild-type MEFs with cyclosporin A (100 μmfor 1 h) abrogated the H2O2-induced change in ψm (data not shown). Both apoptosis and necrosis are associated with decreases in ψm, whereas necrosis is distinguished from apoptosis by depletion of ATP and an early loss of plasma membrane integrity (26Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 27Nicotera P. Leist M. Ferrando-May E. Toxicology Letters. 1998; 102–103: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of c-Abl in ROS-induced necrosis, wild-type, c-Abl−/−, and c-Abl+ cells were treated with H2O2and assayed for ATP levels. The results demonstrate that, whereas H2O2 treatment of wild-type and c-Abl+ cells is associated with depletion of ATP, this response was attenuated in c-Abl−/− cells (Fig.4 B). Because these findings support the involvement of c-Abl in a necrosis-like cell death, cells were stained with both annexin-V and propidium iodide to assess plasma membrane integrity. The results demonstrate that, compared with wild-type and c-Abl+ MEFs, loss of plasma membrane integrity in response to H2O2 is attenuated in c-Abl−/− cells (Fig. 4 C). These findings demonstrate that ROS-induced targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP depletion, and necrotic cell death.Figure 4Targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ψm), depletion of ATP, and necrosis-like cell death. Wild-type (solid bars), c-Abl−/−(open bars) and c-Abl+ (hatched bars) MEFs were treated with H2O2 for the indicated times. A, cells were stained with Rhodamine 123 and analyzed by flow cytometry (upper panels). Percentage (mean ± S.E.) of control ψm obtained from 3 separate experiments (lower panels). B, cells were analyzed for ATP levels. The data represent the percentage (mean ± S.E.) of control ATP levels obtained from three separate experiments.

These findings provided support for involvement of c-Abl in the regulation of mitochondrial signaling. The present studies demonstrate that ROS target the c-Abl protein to mitochondria and that this response is dependent on the c-Abl kinase function. Moreover, in concert with the demonstration that PKCδ is required for ROS-induced activation of c-Abl (20Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we show that PKCδ is necessary for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria. Importantly localization of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Apoptosis and necrosis both involve the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, whereas depletion of ATP is found selectively in necrosis (28Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Thus, the demonstration that mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl is associated with depletion of ATP indicated that c-Abl is functional in necrosis-like cell death. In this context, wild-type, but not c-Abl−/−, MEFs also responded to oxidative stress with dysfunction of the plasma membrane. These findings and the previous demonstration that c-Abl is involved in ROS-induced cytochromec release (19Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) indicate that targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria confers both proapoptotic and pronecrotic cell death signals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 have been implicated in the regulation of both mitogenic and apoptotic signaling pathways. Mitogenic signals induced by certain growth factors and activated Ras are mediated by ROS production (1Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T.

The generation of ROS through normal cellular metabolism has also been associated with damage to cellular components and the induction of apoptosis (3Croteau D. Bohr V. J. Biol.

Staal F.J. Raju P.A. Ela S.W. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A.

N-Acetyl-l-cysteine treatment inhibited H2O2-induced translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). Also to determine whether ROS-induced activation of the c-Abl kinase function is necessary for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria, MCF-7 cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) mutant at levels comparable with that of kinase-active c-Abl in MCF-7/neo cells (Fig.2 B, left panel) (11Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were treated with H2O2. The finding that MCF-7/neo, but not MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), cells respond to H2O2 with translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria supported a requirement for the c-Abl kinase function (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These results indicate that ROS-induced c-Abl activation is associated with the targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria.The available evidence indicates that ROS activate c-Abl by a mechanism dependent on the PKCδ kinase (19Sun X.

To determine whether PKCδ contributes to mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl, MEFs were treated with the selective PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (24Gschwendt M. Kielbassa K. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 773-779Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although rottlerin had no effect on constitutive levels of mitochondrial c-Abl, this agent inhibited H2O2-induced c-Abl translocation (Fig. 3 A). To extend the interaction of PKCδ and c-Abl, 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-c-Abl and PKCδ. Analysis of the mitochondrial fraction by immunoblotting with anti-HA demonstrated that targeting of HA-c-Abl to mitochondria is increased by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, cotransfection of HA-c-Abl and kinase-inactive PKCδ was associated with less targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria and no apparent effect of H2O2treatment (Fig. 3 B). These findings provide support for the involvement of ROS-induced activation of PKCδ in mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl.Figure 3PKC δ is required for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria. A, MEFs were pretreated with 10 μm rottlerin for 0.5 h and then with H2O2 for 1 h. Mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. B, 293T cells were cotransfected to express HA-c-Abl and GFP-PKCδ or GFP-PKCδ(K-R). At 24 h, the cells were treated with H2O2 for 2 h. Lysates prepared from the mitochondrial fraction and intact cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP and anti-HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the results indicate that c-Abl targets mitochondria in the ROS response, we hypothesized that c-Abl may directly induce mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine whether c-Abl is necessary for ROS-induced loss of ψm, wild-type and c-Abl−/− cells were treated with H2O2 and then stained with rhodamine 123. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was substantially diminished in H2O2-treated wild-type cells (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the ψm was protected from ROS-induced loss in c-Abl−/−cells, but not in c-Abl−/− cells transfected to stably express c-Abl (c-Abl+) (Fig. 4 A). Cyclosporin A prevents the reduction in ψm induced by various agents that open mitochondrial permeability transition pores (25Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). In this context, pretreatment of wild-type MEFs with cyclosporin A (100 μmfor 1 h) abrogated the H2O2-induced change in ψm (data not shown). Both apoptosis and necrosis are associated with decreases in ψm, whereas necrosis is distinguished from apoptosis by depletion of ATP and an early loss of plasma membrane integrity (26Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 27Nicotera P. Leist M. Ferrando-May E.

To assess the involvement of c-Abl in ROS-induced necrosis, wild-type, c-Abl−/−, and c-Abl+ cells were treated with H2O2and assayed for ATP levels. The results demonstrate that, whereas H2O2 treatment of wild-type and c-Abl+ cells is associated with depletion of ATP, this response was attenuated in c-Abl−/− cells (Fig.4 B). Because these findings support the involvement of c-Abl in a necrosis-like cell death, cells were stained with both annexin-V and propidium iodide to assess plasma membrane integrity. The results demonstrate that, compared with wild-type and c-Abl+ MEFs, loss of plasma membrane integrity in response to H2O2 is attenuated in c-Abl−/− cells (Fig. 4 C). These findings demonstrate that ROS-induced targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP depletion, and necrotic cell death.Figure 4Targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ψm), depletion of ATP, and necrosis-like cell death. Wild-type (solid bars), c-Abl−/−(open bars) and c-Abl+ (hatched bars) MEFs were treated with H2O2 for the indicated times.

These findings provided support for involvement of c-Abl in the regulation of mitochondrial signaling. The present studies demonstrate that ROS target the c-Abl protein to mitochondria and that this response is dependent on the c-Abl kinase function. Moreover, in concert with the demonstration that PKCδ is required for ROS-induced activation of c-Abl (20Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we show that PKCδ is necessary for targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria. Importantly localization of c-Abl to mitochondria is associated with loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Apoptosis and necrosis both involve the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, whereas depletion of ATP is found selectively in necrosis (28Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Thus, the demonstration that mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl is associated with depletion of ATP indicated that c-Abl is functional in necrosis-like cell death. In this context, wild-type, but not c-Abl−/−, MEFs also responded to oxidative stress with dysfunction of the plasma membrane. These findings and the previous demonstration that c-Abl is involved in ROS-induced cytochromec release (19Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) indicate that targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria confers both proapoptotic and pronecrotic cell death signals. To assess the effects of ROS on c-Abl, we investigated the subcellular localization of c-Abl in response to H2O2 by measuring intracellular fluorescence with a high sensitivity CCD camera and image analyzer. Examination of the distribution of fluorescence markers in control MEFs showed distinct patterns for anti-c-Abl (red signal) and a mitochondrion-selective dye (Mitotracker; green signal). By contrast exposure to H2O2 was associated with a marked change in fluorescence signals (redand green → yellow and orange) supporting translocation of c-Abl to mitochondria (Fig.1 A). To confirm targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria in response to ROS, mitochondria were isolated from MEFs treated with H2O2. Analysis of the mitochondrial fraction by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl demonstrated an increase in c-Abl protein that was detectable at 30 min and through 3 h (Fig. 1 B). Densitometric scanning of the signals demonstrated over a 5-fold increase in c-Abl protein at 0.5-1 h of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting for the mitochondrial HSP60 protein was used to assess loading of the lanes (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, purity of the mitochondrial fraction was confirmed by reprobing the blots with antibodies against the cytoplasmic β-actin protein, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein, and the cell membrane platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Fig. 1 B). To estimate the amount of c-Abl protein that localizes to mitochondria, we subjected whole cell and mitochondrial lysates, each prepared from 3 × 106cells, to immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. Densitometric scanning of the signals (Fig. 1 C) and adjustment for lysate volume indicated that mitochondrial c-Abl is ∼4% of the total cellular c-Abl protein. Following treatment with H2O2, ∼20% of total c-Abl localized to mitochondria (Fig. 1 B). As an additional control, mitochondrial lysates were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Abl showed H2O2-induced increases in levels of mitochondrial c-Abl protein (Fig. 1 D). The demonstration that c-Abl levels are increased in the mitochondria of H2O2-treated human U-937 leukemia cells (Fig.1 E) and human neuroblastoma cells (data not shown) further indicated that this response occurs in diverse cell types.

One control paradigm is the two-component regulator (TCR)1 where the tasks of detecting the signal and responding to it are undertaken by separate proteins (1Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). One component, the signal sensor, belongs to an extended family of histidine kinases that autophosphorylate when activated by an appropriate signal. The second element, a member of the response regulator family of transcription factors, is activated by the phosphorylation of an aspartate residue, with the phosphate donor being the phospho-histidine of its partner signal sensor (1Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar).

American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1996: 1357-1381Google Scholar). The CreC signal sensor, originally designated PhoM, was discovered because it can act as a phosphate donor for PhoB, a response regulator that controls expression of the pho regulon. This regulon encodes functions (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, PhoA) that are involved in cytoplasmic inorganic phosphate homeostasis, and its usual control system is the PhoBR TCR (5Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingram J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1996: 1357-1381Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the PhoR signal sensor is triggered when the concentration of inorganic phosphate falls below a critical threshold. This results in the phosphorylation of PhoB via phospho-relay, causing an increase in its affinity for the “pho box,” a specific DNA binding motif, that is promoter-proximal in all pho regulon genes. Binding of PhoB to the pho box stimulates (or in some cases represses) transcription of the downstream gene (5Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingram J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B.

Genet. 1984; 195: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is not responsive to phosphate concentration but rather to the carbon source in the growth medium. For example, PhoA expression is induced in phoR − mutants during growth in minimal salts medium with glucose, acetate, or pyruvate as carbon and an energy source (10Wanner B.L. Wilmes-Riesenberg M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of this finding, it was suggested that the normal function of CreC is to monitor changes in carbon supply and that cross-talk with PhoB reflects similarities between CreC and PhoR such that both serve as phosphate donors for PhoB. Because cross-talk only occurs in mutants lacking the phospho-PhoB phosphatase activity residing in PhoR, it may not have any physiological relevance in wild-type cells (5Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C.

When the β-lactamase genes of Aeromonas jandaei were first cloned into E. coli, their expression was observed to be low level (13Rasmussen B.A. Keeney D. Yang Y. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2078-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutants were obtained in which expression of the β-lactamases was increased, and the mutations mapped to thecre gene cluster (13Rasmussen B.A. Keeney D. Yang Y. Bush K. Antimicrob.

In this study, we have extended these findings to locate a consensus sequence, the “cre tag,” which is found close to the promoters of all CreBC-regulated Aeromonas spp. β-lactamase genes. This information was used to find E. coli cre-tag genes, which all have their expression regulated by CreBC. Thus we have defined, at least in part, the cre regulon. The strains ofE. coli used in the study were DH5α (ΔlacU169(φ80lacZΔM15), supE44, rfbD1,gyrA96, recA1, endA1,relA1, spoT1, thi, hsdR17,cre +) (15Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar); UB5254 (DH5αcreC::KmR) (see below); HfrH (relA1, thyA11, spoT1, thi,phoM510(creC2)) (16Low K.B. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 587-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and RB208 (lacY,supE44, thyA11, rpsL228,metB1, serB, creC3, cet2) (17Drury L.S. Buxton R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All strains were routinely cultured in nutrient broth or on nutrient agar (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom). Minimal salts medium was prepared using a base of 7 g/liter K2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, and 1 g/liter (NH4)2SO4 in water supplemented with 50 mg/liter thiamine. For minimal medium growth of RB208, further supplementation with thymine, serine, and methionine (30 mg/liter each) was required. Carbon sources were provided at 60 mm carbon atoms (i.e. 5 mm maltose, 10 mmglucose, 20 mm glycerol or pyruvate, 30 mmacetate). In all cases, growth in liquid media was at 37 °C in air with vigorous shaking. All general reagents have been described previously (14Avison M.B. Niumsup P. Walsh T.R. Bennett P.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 695-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of cell extracts and assay of specific β-lactamase activity (number of nmol of β-lactam hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein) were exactly as described previously (14Avison M.B. Niumsup P. Walsh T.R. Bennett P.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 695-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basic molecular genetic techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 53-104Google Scholar). ThecreC gene from DH5α was amplified by PCR using the method described previously (19Avison M.B. von Heldreich C.J. Higgins C.S. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 879-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and primers based on its published sequence (11Amemura M. Makino K. Shinagawa H. Nakata A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 294-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (i.e. 5′-CCTGAGGGGCCTGTAATG-3′ and 5′-CTGCACCGTATAAAGCTC-3′). The creC gene contains a uniqueClaI restriction site that was exploited to disrupt the gene. To do so, the aph type I kanamycin resistance gene (including its promoter) was amplified from plasmid pK18 (20Pridmore R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) using PCR with primers that inserted a ClaI restriction site in either side of the product (i.e.5′-CATGGCAGATCGATAGACTGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCGGTGGTATCGATATCTCGT-3′). Both creC andaphI PCR amplicons were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Quiagen) according to manufacturer instructions and then digested with ClaI. The resultant fragments were purified as described above, mixed, and ligated. PCR with thecreC primer set was repeated using the ligation reaction as a template and produced two amplicons: one, the religatedcreC gene, and the other, the creC gene with anaphI insertion. The amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis and the larger amplicon, with the aphI insertion, was gel-purified using a Quiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit and used as template for a further round ofcreC PCR (primers as described before) to recover large amounts of the creC::aphI amplicon. The amplicon was purified as described before, and 1 µg of DNA was used to electrotransform ∼108 DH5α cells. Sixteen kanamycin-resistant (30 mg/liter) colonies were recovered where thecreC gene had been replaced bycreC::aphI. The aphI insertion into the chromosomal copy of creC(creC::KmR) was confirmed by PCR. The cells were transformed with the following plasmids, encodingAeromonas spp. β-lactamase genes: pUB5812 (cepS), pUB5820 (ampS) (21Walsh T.R. Hall L. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 36: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); pUB5826 (imiS) (22Walsh T.R. Neville W.A. Haran M.H. Tolson D. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Antimicrob.

Chemother. 2000; 46: 695-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinants were grown in glucose minimal medium to an absorbance (at 600 nm) of 0.8, and total RNA was recovered after homogenization of 100 mg of pelletted bacterial cells in a plastic tube containing silica beads (Hybaid Blue matrix) using a Hybaid Ribolyser (40 s, speed setting 6.0). The cells were homogenized in a standard RNA isolation reagent (Hybaid RNA recovery kit), and RNA purification was performed according to manufacturer instructions. The RNA concentration was adjusted to 0.5 µg/µl with diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated water, and 2 µg of total RNA was used as template to produce first-strand cDNA in a 20-µl reaction with 20 pmol of the appropriate reverse primer using buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm each of dATP, [α-32P]dCTP (1000 cpm/pmol), dGTP, and dTTP). After the addition of 40 units of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. In parallel, DNA sequencing was performed using a T7-sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer instructions with the appropriate purified β-lactamase-encoding plasmid as template and the same primer that was used for reversed transcription. The reversed primers used were:ampH (5′-GAGAAAGCAGCCGGTGGC-3′); ampS(5′-GAGAAAGCAGCCGCTGGC-3′); cepH (5′-CATCCACCACAGCGTTCA-3′);cepS (5′-CATCCACCACCGCCTTCA-3′); and imiH andimiS (5′-CTCGCCATCAGCACCACG-3′). Cells were grown in nutrient broth or glucose minimal medium as appropriate until an absorbance (at 600 nm) of 0.8 was reached. The cells were lysed and RNA was purified as described above. Reversed transcription was performed exactly as described above but using unlabeled dCTP. Five µl of the RT reaction mixture were used as a source of cDNA for PCR, which was performed using 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) in a final volume of 50 µl of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 50 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP) containing 100 pmol each of reverse and forward primer. The reaction mix was heated to 96 °C for 5 min, and PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 1-min sequential incubations at 96 °C, 55 °C, and 72 °C. E. coli ampC was chosen as the control for normalization of mRNA loading in each RT-PCR reaction. This gene was found to be constitutively expressed during growth in the different media and in the different mutants used in this study as determined by assay of AmpC β-lactamase activity. 2R. E. Horton and M. B. Avison, unpublished results. All RT-PCR amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and images of the ethidium bromide-stained gels were acquired using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.) and analyzed using the ImageQuant suite of programs (Molecular Dynamics) to determine band intensities. In all cases, the intensities were normalized for loading using the intensity of the ampC band from each RNA preparation. Primer sequences were designed from the E. coli MG1655 genome sequence (23Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F.

RT-PCR products were purified and sequenced as described previously (19Avison M.B. von Heldreich C.J. Higgins C.S. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 879-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm that the target message had been amplified. In two previous studies usingcreBC mutants, the E. coli CreBC TCR was implicated in controlling the expression of cloned Aeromonasspp. β-lactamase genes (13Rasmussen B.A. Keeney D. Yang Y. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2078-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Avison M.B. Niumsup P. Walsh T.R. Bennett P.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 695-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the wild-type CreBC TCR can regulate the expression of Aeromonas spp. β-lactamases in a medium-dependent manner, the threeAeromonas hydrophila (ampH, cepH, andimiH) and three Aeromonas veronii bv. Sobria (ampS, cepS, and imiS) β-lactamase genes were introduced into E. coli DH5α (cre +) separately on multicopy plasmids, and β-lactamase activities in the cell extracts were measured after growth of the recombinants to mid-log phase in nutrient broth or in minimal medium with either glucose, glycerol, or pyruvate as carbon source (Fig. 1). In all cases, there was a significant increase in β-lactamase expression after a switch from complex to minimal medium, with the actual carbon source used only contributing a small amount to the overall increase. These effects were not seen when UB5254, a creC::KmRderivative of DH5α, was used, confirming that the activation of β-lactamase expression in minimal medium is a CreBC-dependent event (Fig. 1). These findings argued for the presence of a specific transcription factor binding sequence near the promoter of each β-lactamase gene, mediating CreBC-dependent control. To find whether this was the case, sequences upstream of the ATG initiation codon for all six β-lactamase genes were aligned and searched for common motifs. To facilitate analysis, transcriptional start points for each β-lactamase gene in DH5α grown in glucose minimal medium were determined via reversed transcript analysis (Fig.2). A single motif, TTCAC, was identified as being common to all the promoter-proximal regions; in four of six cases it is present as a hyphenated tandem repeat, TTCACnnnnnnTTCAC (where “n” is “any character”) (Fig. 2). The presence of a direct repeat was concomitant with considerably more transcriptional activation during growth in minimal medium than when only a single motif was observed (Figs. 1 and 2). As such, the direct repeat sequence was denoted a cre tag (i.e. a label for genes, the transcription of which is regulated directly or indirectly by CreBC). We speculated that cre tags would be associated with those E. coli genes that are subject to CreBC-dependent transcriptional control. Searches of the entire E. coliMG1655 genome sequence (23Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) for the direct repeat sequence revealed 13 instances (Table I). For a direct repeat to be classed as a cre tag, the criteria used were that it should be oriented in the same direction as a 3′-proximal gene and within 450 base pairs of that gene's ATG initiation codon. Eight of the 13 direct repeats fitted these criteria, leading to the identification ofackA, talA, radC, malE,trgB, creD, yidS, and yieIas cre-tag genes (Table I). ackA is known to be the lead gene of the ackA/pta operon (24Kakuda H. Hosono K. Shiroishi K. Ichihara S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), thus pta was also classified as a cre-tag gene.Table IE. coli MG1655 cre-tag sequencesSequenceOpen reading frameTTCACCTCAACTTCACackA/ptaTTCACGTAACGTTCACtalATTCACCGGTCGTTCACNothingTTCACAAGGACTTCACyidSTTCACACTCCCTTCACyieITTCACCTGATATTCACNothingTTCACCGTCACTTCACcreDTTCACTTTTTCTTCACNothingTTCACCGGTAATTCACNothingTTCACCAGCGCTTCACNothingTTCACATTTAATTCACtrgBTTCACCTGAGATTCACradCTTCACGAGCACTTCACmalEThe entire MG1655 genome sequence (23Blattner F.R.

The closest 3′-proximal open reading frame is listed; open reading frames further away than 450 base pairs from the direct repeat were not considered. The relative expression of cre-tag genes inE. coli growing in nutrient broth or minimal medium was determined by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). Glucose was chosen as the minimal carbon source to retain catabolite repression and thus limit the possible complications of changing the medium. Both DH5α (cre +) and UB5254 (creC::KmR) were used for these studies to enable the determination of CreBC-specific effects. When DH5α was grown in glucose minimal medium, expression of all the cre-tag genes except malE was significantly higher than during growth in nutrient broth (Fig. 3). The genes did not all have the same level of transcriptional activation; the greatest was ofackA/pta, which increased about 50-fold. In most cases, differences in -fold transcriptional activation were caused by a variable level of transcription during growth in nutrient broth (Fig.3). The change in malE expression was the reciprocal, with a considerable transcriptional repression during growth in glucose minimal medium. Differential expression of cre-tag genes in response to switching from complex to minimal medium was not seen in UB5254, acreC insertion mutant, where cre-tag mRNA levels were actually decreased (for malE, levels were slightly increased) from the cre + level in broth and did not change significantly after the switch to minimal medium (Fig. 3). Furthermore, UB5254 grew slowly compared with DH5α (doubling time more than tripled) in glucose, maltose, glycerol, and pyruvate minimal media and not at all in acetate minimal medium, but its growth rate was the same as the cre + strain when grown in broth (Table II).Table IIDoubling time of E. coli cre mutants in different mediaStrainMediaNBGlucose MMMaltose MMGlycerol MMAcetate MMPyruvate MMDH5α39.161.4110.566.7178.4258.3UB525442.8233.3347.0222.6>1000794.9RB20855.787.6352.690.4193.6275.6Doubling times (min) were an average of four generations starting at an absorbance (at 600 nm) of 0.05, and each value represents an average of three separate cultures.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 900-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HfrH growing in nutrient broth, levels of cre-tag gene expression were elevated markedly compared with those in DH5α, with increases of 2–15-fold, depending on the gene in question (Fig.4); the effect on malE was again the reciprocal. E. coli strain RB208 (cet2) has been shown previously to overproduce CreD (17Drury L.S. Buxton R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), encoded by a cre-tag gene. Levels of cre-tag gene expression in RB208 growing in broth were between 2- and 4-fold higher than in HfrH, the RB208 parent (17Drury L.S. Buxton R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), giving an increase in expression compared with DH5α of 4–55-fold (Figs. 3 and 4). Again, malE expression was affected in quite the opposite way. The cet2 mutation does not dramatically affect the growth rate of RB208 compared with DH5α (cre +) in glucose, glycerol, pyruvate, and acetate minimal media, but growth is significantly slower in maltose minimal medium (Table II). To define the specific creBC alleles carried by DH5α, HfrH, and RB208, PCR was used to recover these genes, and the amplification products were sequenced. All three strains were found to carry copies of wild-type creB. That HfrH has a mutation increC (creC2), which results in an R77P amino acid substitution (5Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R.

TLF-1 is composed of four major apolipoproteins: apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, paraoxonase, and the primate-specific haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr). Hpr is greater than 90% homologous to haptoglobin (Hp), an abundant acute phase serum protein. Killing of trypanosomes by TLF-1 requires cell surface binding, endocytosis, and subsequent lysosomal targeting. Low temperature binding studies reveal two receptors for TLF-1: one that is high affinity/low capacity (K d ∼12 nm, 350 receptors per cell) and another that binds with low affinity/high capacity (K d ∼1 µm, 60,000 receptors per cell). The low affinity binding is competed by nonlytic human HDL and is likely to be apolipoprotein AI-mediated. Purified human Hpr and human Hp bind to trypanosomes, are internalized, and are targeted to the lysosome. Furthermore, Hpr shows competition for TLF-1 binding, and a monoclonal antibody against Hpr prevents both TLF-1 uptake and trypanosome killing. Based on these results, we propose that Hpr mediates the high affinity binding of TLF-1 toT. b. brucei through a haptoglobin-like receptor.

Med. 1996; 183: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The relative in vivoimportance of these two Hpr-containing complexes remains to be established.The Hpr gene is the product of a gene triplication event that occurred during primate evolution and is found in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (4Seed J.R. Sechelski J.B. Loomis M.R. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sera from these primates are toxic to T. b. brucei with the exception of chimpanzees, which contain a mutation in the Hpr gene (4Seed J.R. Sechelski J.B. Loomis M.R. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5McEvoy S. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15740-15747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The humanHpr gene is located 2.2 kilbases downstream of the haptoglobin (Hp) gene and shows greater than 90% sequence homology to Hp (6Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Hpr and Hp differ in normal human serum with Hpr levels (30–40 µg/ml) generally being several hundredfold lower than Hp (0.9–3 mg/ml). Aside from its proposed role in protection from T. b. brucei, the function of Hpr is unknown.Haptoglobin is a tetrameric acute phase plasma protein composed of two α and two β chains that are linked by disulfide bonds. Haptoglobin avidly binds hemoglobin (Hb) released into the bloodstream and facilitates the rapid clearance of Hb from the circulatory system by the liver (7Bowmann B. Kurosky A. Adv. Human Genet. 1982; 12: 189-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 8Okuda M. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Hp-Hb complex has been shown to bind with high affinity to mammalian cells. Human hepatocytes, in culture, expressed about 84,000 Hp receptors per cell, with a dissociation constant (K d) of 7.4 nm (8Okuda M. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The internalized Hp-Hb complex is targeted to the lysosome where it is degraded; however the heme moiety is preserved. Haptoglobin is a natural inhibitor of TLF-1, and individual variation in trypanosome lytic activity in serum correlates to variations in the amount of Hp (9Smith A.B. Hajduk S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10262-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hp does not inhibit the lytic activity of TLF-2 in vitro(10Raper J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).When incubated with T. b. brucei, TLF-1 first binds to a receptor on the trypanosome surface, then it is endocytosed via coated pits and targeted to the trypanosome lysosome (11Hager K.M. Pierce M.A. Moore D.R. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Lorenz P. Barth P.E. Rudin W. Betschart B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1994; 88: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of TLF-1-mediated lysis is unknown. We have hypothesized that TLF-1 causes lysosomal membrane damage resulting in disruption of the organelle and auto-digestion of the cell (2Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 3J. R. Bishop and S. L. Hajduk, submitted for publication.3J. R. Bishop and S. L. Hajduk, submitted for publication.Other macromolecules have also been shown to interact with trypanosomes. Transferrin is required for the survival and proliferation of bloodstream trypanosomes and also is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (13Grab D.J. Shaw M.K. Wells C.W. Verjee Y. Russo D.C. Webster P. Naessens J. Fish W.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 114-126PubMed Google Scholar, 14Steverding D. Stierhof Y.D. Fuchs H. Tauber R. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptors are restricted to the flagellar pocket of trypanosomes, and this is the only site of endocytosis in trypanosomes (15Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Baudhuin P. J. Parasitol. 1987; 34: 465-473Google Scholar). Following endocytosis, transferrin is targeted to the lysosome and degraded.We show in this paper that T. b. brucei binds TLF-1 with high affinity to a TLF-1-specific receptor and to a low affinity receptor that also binds nonlytic HDL. We further show that Hpr is the ligand in TLF-1 that promotes the high affinity binding toT. b. brucei and that this receptor also binds human Hp.DISCUSSIONThe purification of TLF-1 from human serum allowed us to investigate the interactions of this minor subclass of human HDL with trypanosomes. TLF-1 differs from nonlytic human HDL by the presence of Hpr, raising the possibility that Hpr might provide for specificity in binding to a receptor on the trypanosome surface. We present evidence here that Hpr is the ligand for TLF-1 binding to T. b. brucei.Binding of TLF-1 to T. b. brucei is specific, concentration-dependent, and exhibits biphasic binding, which is indicative of both high affinity/low capacity binding and low affinity/high capacity binding. The low affinity component of the binding curves was competed with nonlytic human HDL. When binding studies were performed with nonlytic 125I-HDL, a monophasic binding curve was obtained with a calculated binding constant of 1 µm and an estimated 60,000 receptors per cell (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with those previously reported for HDL binding to T. b. brucei (24Gillett M. Owen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the presence of excess nonlytic HDL, the TLF-1-specific component of the binding curve was unmasked. This binding is monophasic, saturable, and has a calculated binding affinity of ∼12 nm with an estimated 350 receptors per cell.Using antibody affinity chromatography, Hpr was purified from TLF-1, and its binding characteristics were determined. Hpr binding to trypanosomes was specific and showed competition with purified TLF-1. This competition is presumably through the Hpr associated with the TLF-1 particle. Competition studies with Hp are not possible due to its propensity to aggregate. However, at lower concentrations Hp binds to the trypanosome surface in a saturable fashion. The affinity for Hp was ∼1 µm versus an apparent affinity of 1 nm for TLF-1-associated Hpr. This difference may reflect conformational differences in Hpr in its TLF-1-associated form. In addition to a decrease in the binding constant for Hp, there appears to be a much larger number of trypanosome cell surface receptors accessible to binding Hp than to the TLF-1 associated Hpr. Based on saturation binding studies, the number of Hp receptors was estimated to be ∼32,000 receptors per cell relative to the 350 TLF-1 receptors per cell. It is likely that the large diameter of the TLF-1 particle (18–22 nm) may restrict the number of receptors that are accessible to TLF-1 binding, resulting in an underestimate of the number of receptors when intact TLF-1 is used as a ligand.It is possible that the Hpr-dependent high affinity TLF-1 binding measured in our studies could be due to Hpr binding to a Hp receptor. As a soluble acute phase serum protein, the primary function of Hp is to bind hemoglobin and facilitate its clearance from the circulation by binding to haptoglobin receptors on liver cells (7Bowmann B. Kurosky A. Adv. Human Genet. 1982; 12: 189-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 8Okuda M. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of Hp to the hepatocyte receptor increases for the Hp-Hb complex. Following binding, the Hp-Hb complex is endocytosed and targeted to the lysosome (25Kimura H. Tsudzuki T. Murachi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 77: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The uptake of Hp-Hb complexes may provide an important alternative to transferrin as a source of iron for the bloodstream parasite (26Bonkovsky H.L. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 301: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Hp uptake may be part of an antioxidant defense mechanism of this parasite (27Gutteridge J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Bloodstream trypanosomes are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress, and Hp has antioxidant activity (28Miller Y.I. Altamentova S.M. Shaklai N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 36: 12189-12198Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of Hp to its receptor on the trypanosome surface does not require the formation of a Hp-Hb complex. This is consistent with the trypanosome Hp receptor being able to bind Hpr and TLF, since recent studies show that TLF lacks Hb and that Hpr does not bind Hb (29Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3884-3887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).4The studies reported here demonstrate that trypanosomes have an Hp receptor and that Hp is taken up and lysosomally targeted. However, competition studies with purified Hp are not possible, since Hp forms aggregates at high concentrations making competition studies impossible to interpret (30Dobryszycka W. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 35: 647-654PubMed Google Scholar). These studies further demonstrate that Hpr is the ligand on the TLF particle that allows binding to T. b. brucei. One intriguing possibility is that the TLF-1 receptor is in fact an Hp receptor used as a nutrient receptor for the parasite in the mammalian host. In this case, Hpr effectively mimics Hp and would allow for uptake of TLF-1 via the Hp receptor. The identification of Hpr as the ligand for TLF-1 will facilitate the purification of the receptor for this molecule and may aid in the development of drug delivery schemes utilizing the TLF receptor to specifically target anti-trypanocidal agents. Trypanosomes cause debilitating diseases in both humans and cattle. Trypanosoma brucei brucei causes nagana in cattle, while Trypanosoma brucei rhodesienseand Trypanosoma brucei gambiense cause sleeping sickness in humans. These subspecies of trypanosomes differ only in their susceptibility to a subclass of high density lipoprotein (HDL)1 found in human serum.T. b. brucei is lysed by this HDL, termed trypanosome lytic factor (TLF-1), whereas T. b. rhodesiense is unaffected (1Hajduk S.L. Hager K. Esko J.D. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 95-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Three of the four major proteins found in TLF-1, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, and paraoxonase are found in other nonlytic HDL, while haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) is unique to TLF (2Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TLF-1 has been biochemically characterized, and the toxic component for trypanosomes is Hpr. 2J. R. Bishop, unpublished data.2J. R. Bishop, unpublished data.

Interestingly, Akt activation by UVB was attenuated by treatment with PD 98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk) kinase 1 inhibitor, or SB 202190, a specific p38 kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Erk2 or p38 kinase, but not that of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), blocked UVB-induced Akt activation. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of p85 or treatment with LY 294002 also inhibited UVB-induced Erk phosphorylation. The UVB-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase members, which were immunoprecipitated from cells exposed to UVB, did not phosphorylate Akt. Instead, Akt was phosphorylated at both threonine 308 and serine 473 and activated by UVB-activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (Msk1). The expression of a Msk1 C-terminal kinase-dead mutant inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt. These data thus suggested that UVB-induced Akt activation was mediated through Msk1, which is a downstream kinase of the Erk and p38 kinase signaling pathways.

The serine-threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B (PKB)1) is activated by a wide variety of growth stimuli, including epidermal growth factor and insulin through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) (11Burgering B.M.

These findings suggest that UV irradiation induces the activation of Akt. In a wide range of cellular systems, Akt has been shown to control intracellular pathways responsible for preventing cell death in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli (15Marte B.M.

In quiescent or serum-starved cells, Akt resides within the cytosol in a catalytically inactive state.

Therefore, we investigated the involvement of the MAP kinase signaling pathways in UVB-induced Akt activation. In this study, we demonstrated that activation of Akt is induced by UVB irradiation and that the activation of Akt is mediated by Erks and p38 kinase through their downstream kinase, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (Msk1), in addition to the PI3-K/PDK pathway.

The source of UVB was a bank of four Westinghouse F520 Lamps (National Biological, Twinsburg, OH) at 6 J/S/m light in the UVB range. Approximately 10% of the remaining radiation from the F520 lamp is in the UVA region (320 nm). Although almost no UVC leakage occurred, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808 filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. This lamp is one of the most frequently used UVB sources for the study of carcinogenesis. The International Agency for Research on Cancer refers to this lamp as a source emitting mainly UVB irradiation for the study of cancer induction in animals. UVB irradiation was measured using the UVX radiometer from UVP (UVX-31). The JB6 mouse epidermal cell line Cl 41 (JB6 Cl 41) and its stable transfectants, Cl 41 CMV-neo, Cl 41 DN-Erk2, Cl 41 DN-p38, Cl 41 DN-JNK1, Cl 41 DN-p85, Cl 41 CMV5, and Cl 41 Msk1 C-dead, were grown at 37 °C in MEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The dominant negative mutants of Erk2, p38 kinase, or JNK1 were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector plasmid, CMV-neo. A dominant negative mutant plasmid of PI3-K p85 subunit or Msk1 C-terminal kinase-dead mutant plasmid or its control vector CMV5 plasmid was transfected or co-transfected with CMV-neo in JB6 Cl 41 cells by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructors.

The cells were starved in 0.1% FBS MEM for 48 h at 37 °C. Then, medium was changed to fresh 0.1% FBS MEM, and cells were incubated for another 2–4 h at 37 °C. Before the cells were treated with UVB or insulin, they were treated with or without LY 294002, PD 98059, or SB 202190 for 1 h. Then, the cells were exposed to UVB (4 kJ/m2) and subsequently incubated for the indicated periods or for 30 min or treated with insulin (2.5 μg/ml) for the indicated periods or for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of inhibitors. The cells were then lysed, and immunoblot analysis performed by using the antibodies against Akt, Erks, JNKs, or p38 kinase or the phospho-specific antibodies against their phosphorylated proteins. Antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECF from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) as described above. The cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm ν-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm microcystin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was incubated with the phospho-specific Erks, p38 kinase, or JNKs antibody with gentle rocking for 6–10 h at 4 °C. Then, the protein A/G plus agarose was added, and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm ν-glycerophosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min using 2 μg of Elk-1, ATF-2, or c-Jun as substrate for Erks, p38 kinase, or JNKs, respectively. The phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies. PI3-K activity was carried out as described previously (57Huang C. Schmid P.C. Ma W. Schmid H.O. Dong Z.

The cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmaprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was incubated with 20 μl of agarose conjugated with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers: 1) PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 2) 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5m LiCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and 3) 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The beads were incubated for 5 min on ice in 20 μl of Buffer 3, and then 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (previously sonicated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaH2PO4) was added. After 5 min at room temperature, 10 μl of the reaction buffer was added (50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and the beads were incubated for an additional 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 4 n HCl and 130 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). After vortexing for 30 s, 30 μl of the chloroform phase was spotted onto 1% potassium oxalate-coated silica gel H plates (previously baked at 110 °C for 1 h). The plates were developed in choloroform/methanol/NH4OH/H2O (60:47:2:11.3) and dried at room temperature. Radiolabeled spots were quantified using the Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2), lysates were prepared from the cells, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out using the phospho-specific Erk, p38 kinase, or JNKs antibody or the specific Msk1, MAPKAP-K2, or Rsk1 antibody as described above (under “Assay for Erk, p38 Kinase, and JNK Activities”). The kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of kinase buffer with 200 μmATP and 250 ng of inactive Akt fusion protein as substrate. The phosphorylated protein was detected by immunoblotting using phospho-specific Akt antibodies. Cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) or insulin (2.5 μg/ml), lysates were prepared from the cells, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out using 4 μg of anti-Akt1/PKBα PH domain or anti-Msk1 antibody as described above. The enzyme immune complex was washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and once with 100 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm ν-glycerophosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT). For the Akt kinase assay, the enzyme immune complex was added to 10 μl of assay dilution buffer, 40 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 0.4 mm Akt substrate peptide, and 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, and for the Msk kinase assay, it was added to 20 μl of assay dilution buffer, 10 μl of 0.4 mm Akt substrate peptide, and 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and centrifuged, and then 30 μl of the supernatant fraction was transferred onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and allowed to bind for 30 s. The P81 papers were washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and then washed once in acetone, and γ-32P incorporation was measured by scintillation counting. Cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2), lysates were prepared from the cells, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out using 4 μg of anti-Akt1/PKBα PH domain antibody as described above. The enzyme immune complex was added to 12.5 μl of assay dilution buffer, 10 μl (3 μg) of Bad protein, and 50 μl of magnesium/ATP mixture (75 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm ATP in assay dilution buffer). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and centrifuged, and then 20 μl of the supernatant fraction was used as a sample for immunoblotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed by using the phospho-specific Bad (serine 136) antibody, and antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECF from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics).

We expressed rho-GFP in the rod photoreceptors of Xenopus laevis using theX. laevis principal opsin promoter. Like rhodopsin, rho-GFP localized to rod outer segments, indicating that rho-GFP was recognized by membrane transport mechanisms. In contrast, a rho-GFP variant lacking the C-terminal outer segment localization signal distributed to both outer and inner segment membranes. Confocal microscopy of transgenic retinas revealed that transgene expression levels varied between cells, an effect that is probably analogous to position-effect variegation. Furthermore, rho-GFP concentrations varied along the length of individual rods, indicating that expression levels varied within single cells on a daily or hourly basis. These results have implications for transgenic models of retinal degeneration and mechanisms of position-effect variegation and demonstrate the utility of rho-GFP as a probe for rhodopsin transport and temporal regulation of promoter function.

However, cultured cells often provide only an approximation of the in vivo situation, particularly when proteins are studied in heterologous cell systems or when interactions between cell types in highly organized tissues may be critical. Here we employ an in vivo system for the study of rhodopsin targeting and renewal in an animal in which simple genetic manipulations are easily accomplished, transgenic Xenopus laevis that express a fluorescent form of rhodopsin. In developing this system, we encountered variable protein expression patterns resembling heterochromatin-associated position-effect variegation. Because of the unique mechanisms of photoreceptor outer segment growth and renewal, we obtained a novel perspective on this previously described artifact of transgenesis.Rhodopsin is the light-sensing visual pigment of vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells, which mediate vision under dim light conditions. It consists of an apoprotein, opsin, with seven membrane-spanning domains and a covalently attached 11-cis retinal chromophore. Upon light absorption, the retinal chromophore undergoescis-trans isomerization, eliciting a series of conformational changes that initiate intracellular signaling through the G-protein transducin, leading to closure of cation channels in the plasma membrane and hyperpolarization of the cell (1Palczewski K. Saari J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Rhodopsin is found almost exclusively in the rod outer segment (ROS)1 compartment of vertebrate rod photoreceptors. The ROS consists of a stack of membranous discs surrounded by a plasma membrane, connected to the rod cell body or inner segment (RIS) by a connecting cilium. Rhodopsin is present in ROS at enormous levels, where it constitutes greater than 90% of total membrane protein (2Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) at a concentration of ∼3 mm (3Leibman P.A. Entine G. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 4Hárosi F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 357-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Only minor quantities of rhodopsin are found in the inner segment membranes (5Papermaster D.S. Schneider B.G. Besharse J.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 1386-1404PubMed Google Scholar).ROS membranes are continuously renewed in a unique manner. Newly synthesized rhodopsin-containing discs are added at the base of the ROS, near the RIS/ROS junction, and are gradually displaced toward the distal end of the ROS, where they are shed and phagocytosed by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium. The entire organelle is renewed in ∼10 days in both mice and X. laevis. (6Besharse J.C. Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 507-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). InX. laevis, which have much larger photoreceptors than humans, this requires the synthesis of an average of 2.3 µm of ROS length per day per cell, equivalent to 3.2 µm2 of membrane per min per cell (6Besharse J.C. Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 507-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Besharse J.C. Adler R. Farber D. The Retina: A Model for Cell Biology Studies. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 297-352Google Scholar). Rhodopsin synthesis occurs in the RIS, and newly synthesized rhodopsin is transported to the RIS plasma membrane near the base of the connecting cilium and then to the site of new disc formation in the ROS, most likely via the connecting cilium plasma membrane. The high rates of membrane synthesis in photoreceptors make this an attractive cell in which to study membrane trafficking and transport (8Deretic D. Schmerl S. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. McDowell J.H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, photoreceptors in cell culture systems quickly lose their ROS and do not divide (10Townes-Anderson E. MacLeish P.R. Raviola E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Over the past decade, a number of mutations in the rhodopsin gene were identified as causes of retinitis pigmentosa, a group of hereditary retinal degenerative diseases characterized by progressive loss of vision (11Berson E.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1659-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive studies of mutant rhodopsins by expression in mammalian cells or transgenic animals have demonstrated that some mutations may affect the processes of rhodopsin folding and transport to the ROS (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Sung C.-H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl.

A. 1995; 92: 3551-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For example, studies in both transgenic mice and X. laevis suggest that mutations of the C-terminal region of rhodopsin disrupt a ROS localization signal (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), resulting in delocalization to the RIS plasma membrane (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Sung C.-H. Makino C. Baylor D. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations provide further impetus for understanding rhodopsin targeting and transport.We constructed a fluorescent form of rhodopsin, rho-GFP, a fusion protein of bovine rhodopsin (rho) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). We first examined the properties of rho-GFP expressed in COS-1 cells and found that it bound retinal, forming a functional light receptor. Like bovine rhodopsin, rho-GFP expressed in COS-1 cells localized to the plasma membrane. Affinity-purified rho-GFP activated transducin, with a maximal activity approximately half that of rhodopsin. The level of rho-GFP phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase was about 10% of that of native rhodopsin phosphorylation. Thus, rho-GFP retained many features of native rhodopsin despite the addition of a large fluorescent tag that nearly doubled its mass.To visualize physiological events associated with rhodopsin biogenesis in intact cells, we employed an in vivo approach and examined the subcellular distribution of rho-GFP expressed in transgenic X. laevis rod photoreceptors. The large size and turnover rates of amphibian photoreceptors, as well as the relative ease with which transgenic X. laevis can be generated, are reasons for studying rhodopsin transport in frogs. Here we describe transgenic X. laevis that express rho-GFP and a rho-GFP variant with a localization defect and demonstrate that the transgenicX. laevis rho-GFP approach is useful for monitoring gene expression and protein transport in photoreceptors.Our study revealed an interesting variegated expression pattern, which is probably analogous to position-effect variegation (PEV). PEV describes a mosaic expression pattern in a genetically non-mosaic animal that is dependent on localization of a gene within or adjacent to regions of heterochromatin (17Talbert P.B. Henikoff S. Genetics. 2000; 154: 259-272PubMed Google Scholar, 18Karpen G.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Many of our transgenic animals exhibited PEV-like expression patterns. Because the daily renewal of ROS membranes effectively provides a 10-day record of expression levels, we were also able to discover that transgene expression varied not only between cells but also within individual cells on time scales ranging from days to hours, resulting in narrow bands of rho-GFP in the ROS. This temporal variation was not synchronized across the retina, but rather each cell expressed rho-GFP independently at different times. Temporal variation of expression levels has implications for mechanisms of PEV, transgenic models of retinal degeneration, and other transgenic animal systems.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of rho-GFP and Expression PlasmidsFor the construction of the rho-GFP cDNA, SalI sites were created at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the enhanced GFP cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, using eGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) as a template. This modified cDNA was inserted into the SalI site of the synthetic bovine rhodopsin cDNA in the pMT4 expression vector (19Ferretti L. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. Nassal M. Oprian D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 588-603Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The resulting construct encodes a fusion protein in which eGFP was inserted in the C-terminal domain of rhodopsin, and Ser-334 and Thr-335 of rhodopsin are present before and after the inserted GFP (amino acids 2–240) (Fig. 1). DNA sequencing confirmed the correct orientation of the inserted GFP cDNA. The rho-GFPΔCT cDNA was constructed by replacing theSalI/NotI fragment of the synthetic bovine rhodopsin cDNA in pMT4 with the SalI/EcoRI fragment of eGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), containing the eGFP cDNA, resulting in a cDNA encoding a fusion protein lacking the extreme C terminus of rhodopsin. The pMT-based plasmids were used for expression in COS-1 cells. For expression in transgenic X. laevis rods, the mammalian expression vector pCDNA1.1/AMP (Invitrogen) was digested with SpeI, releasing the CMV promoter, and a linker containing a BamHI site (CTAGTGGATCCA) was ligated into the SpeI site. The 5.5-kbBamHI fragment containing the previously described X. laevis opsin promoter (20Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was cloned into the newBamHI site to create the vector pCDNA-XOP. Digestion with PstI confirmed the correct orientation of the promoter.EcoRI-NotI fragments of pMT plasmids containing the rho-GFP and rho-GFPΔCT cDNAs were ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCDNA-XOP to create the expression plasmids pcDNA-XOP-rho-GFP and pcDNA-XOP-rho-GFPΔCT.Expression of rho-GFP in COS-1 Cells and UV-Visible Absorption Spectroscopyrho-GFP was expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection with a DEAE-dextran method (21Kaufman R.J. Murtha P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 11-cis retinal (2 µm) 48 h after transfection for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were solubilized in 1% dodecyl maltoside in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 in the presence of 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 1 h. rho-GFP was purified using anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody 1D4 coupled to Sepharose as described previously (22Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption spectra of purified rho-GFP were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 14 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Bleaching spectra were obtained by illuminating the sample through a 550-nm long pass cutoff filter.Transducin Activation by rho-GFPTransducin was purified from bovine retina, and the ability of rho-GFP to activate transducin was determined by a [35S]GTPγS guanine nucleotide exchange assay as previously described (23Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction (500 µl) contained 1 nm rho-GFP or rhodopsin purified from COS-1 cells, 1 mm transducin, 2 mm [35S]GTPγS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.012% dodecyl maltoside. Aliquots (80 µl) of the reaction mixture were removed at the indicated times, and [35S]GTPγS bound to transducin was determined by a filter binding method.Light-dependent Phosphorylation of rho-GFP by Rhodopsin KinaseA crude extract enriched for rhodopsin kinase was prepared from bovine ROS, and a phosphorylation assay was carried out essentially as described (24Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction mixture containing 126 pmol of rho-GFP or rhodopsin purified from COS-1 cells, 350 µl of rhodopsin kinase extract, 100 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm GTP, and 0.012% dodecyl maltoside in 70 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0 was illuminated through a 550-nm long pass filter at room temperature. At time intervals, aliquots (150 µl) were removed, and the proteins were precipitated with 3% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were washed with 3% trichloroacetic acid in 5 mm phosphoric acid five times and dissolved in Soluene 350 (Packard), and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Additionally, an aliquot (20 µl) was removed from the reaction and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and light-dependent phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography.Expression of rho-GFP in X. laevis Rod Photoreceptors and Generation of F1 OffspringTransgenic X. laevis were generated by the method of sperm nuclear transplantation into unfertilized eggs as described by Kroll and Amaya (25Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications as previously described (26Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3276-3280PubMed Google Scholar). The restriction enzyme NheI was used to linearize the plasmid for transgenesis, as well as for restriction enzyme-mediated integration. Within 5–7 days after injection, transgenic animals were identified visually by examining fluorescence from their eyes using a dissecting microscope equipped with fluorescence optics and a GFP filter set. Tadpoles were raised at 18 °C on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Transgenic X. laevis that reached maturity were bred with wild-type adults to obtain F1 offspring.Cellular Localization of rho-GFPIn COS-1 CellsCOS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected as above. After 48 h, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Intracellular localization of rho-GFP was examined with a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope using a 488-nm laser band and a 515–540 band-pass filter to visualize rho-GFP.In Transgenic X. laevis EyesTadpole eyes were fixed in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. Eyes were embedded in OCT medium (Tissue Tek), and 14-µm cryosections were prepared. Cryosections were stained with Texas Red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) as previously described (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Sections were observed with a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope.Quantitation of rho-GFP Expression in Transgenic X. laevis RodsThe expression level of rho-GFP in Xenopus rods was determined by quantitative confocal microscopy, using a method similar to that described by Piston et al. (27Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 31-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eyes were fixed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline. Cryosections were prepared as described above. Unstained sections were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline, and fluorescence images were gathered using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss × 40 numerical aperture 1.3 water immersion objective, which minimized variation in signal due to depth of confocal sectioning. Pinholes were adjusted to give 1-µm optical sections. Standard curves were generated from images of diluted recombinant GFP standards (CLONTECH) taken under identical conditions. The concentration of rho-GFP in transgenicX. laevis rods was measured by matching the intensity of the green fluorescence obtained from the retinal sections to the standard curves. To test the effect of fixation on GFP fluorescence, samples of recombinant GFP were mixed with 10 volumes of paraformaldehyde fixative, incubated for 30 min, diluted 100-fold in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately examined using the confocal microscope. Treatment with formaldehyde fixative lowered GFP fluorescence by 20% (accounting for dilution). Therefore, measurements reported were corrected for this reduction. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet.)Preparation of Genomic DNA and Southern BlottingGenomic DNA was isolated from individual primary transgenic tadpoles at 14 days post-fertilization (stage 50) or from 50 randomly selected 3–4-day post-fertilization F1 embryos of transgenic founders crossed with wild-type frogs. Tadpoles or embryos were incubated in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 1% SDS overnight at 55 °C. DNA was extracted from this solution and treated with RNase and proteinase K as described (28Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K.

For Southern blots either 5 µg of embryo DNA or one-third of the DNA yield from a single tadpole was digested withEcoRI and subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA fragments were transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane and hybridized with a digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled probe as described (29Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar). The hybridized probe was detected using the DIG luminescent detection kit for nucleic acids (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probe was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide primers TGGGGTCTTTGCTCAGG and ATGAACGGTACCGAAGGC and spanned the unique EcoRI site of the transgene construct corresponding to the translation start site of rho-GFP.DISCUSSIONRho-GFP shares many of the properties of native rhodopsin. The insertion of GFP in the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin (Fig. 1) had little effect on protein folding, as determined by pigment/fluorophore generation with 11-cis retinal, green fluorescence, and cellular localization in COS-1 cells. Previous studies (12Sung C.-H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 13Sung C.-H.

Light-dependent phosphorylation of rho-GFP by rhodopsin kinase was significantly reduced relative to rhodopsin, whereas the ability of rho-GFP to activate transducin was less affected. Activation of transducin and phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin involve the interaction of rhodopsin cytoplasmic loops with transducin or rhodopsin kinase, respectively (34Kelleher D.J.

Our results suggest that there is a partial perturbation of the cytoplasmic structure of rhodopsin, most likely resulting from steric hindrance by the β-barrel of GFP. The three-dimensional structure of the rhodopsin C-terminal peptide determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows that the site of insertion of GFP is oriented outward and support this interpretation of our data (39Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9649-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,40Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with transducin activation, the more significant reduction in the level of phosphorylation may reflect a large spatial displacement of the C-terminal tail containing the multiple phosphorylation sites. One possibility is that the residue equivalent to rhodopsin serine 334 (on the N-terminal side of GFP in the fusion protein; shown in Fig. 1 C), which has been previously suggested to be one of the initial phosphorylation sites (41Ohguro H. Johnson R.S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), may be phosphorylated at a very low level. Our results therefore suggest that rho-GFP possesses many, but not all, of the structural and functional characteristics of rhodopsin.Transgenic X. laevis were generated by the restriction enzyme-mediated integration method recently developed by Kroll and Amaya (25Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This simple and relatively inexpensive technique was used previously to express GFP and GFP fusion proteins in the principle rod cells of X. laevis using the X. laevis principal opsin promoter (20Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rapid production of transgenic tadpoles and the generation of large numbers of independent transgenic lines is achievable (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

In this study, expression of rho-GFP in principal rods of X. laevis generated tadpoles with green fluorescent eyes, similar to previous studies with expression of GFP (26Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3276-3280PubMed Google Scholar, 42Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although the eyes of animals expressing rho-GFP were much less fluorescent. Like endogenous rhodopsin, rho-GFP was almost exclusively localized to ROS membranes, in contrast to GFP alone, which was found mostly in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the inner segment (26Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3276-3280PubMed Google Scholar, 42Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact spatial position of the C-terminal ROS localization signal is not critical for the transport of rhodopsin to the ROS, as long as the native sequence is present and is accessible to the sorting pathway components.We compared the localization of rho-GFP to a rho-GFP variant, rho-GFPΔCT, in which the C-terminal 15 amino acid residues of rhodopsin were deleted. This variant had a distribution indistinguishable from rho-GFP when expressed in COS-1 cells. By contrast, when rho-GFPΔCT was expressed in transgenic frog rods under conditions identical to those used for rho-GFP, it delocalized to the lateral plasma membrane of the inner segment and synapse. This parallels results previously described by others in transgenic mice, in which the distribution of C-terminal deletion mutants of rhodopsin was examined (15Sung C.-H. Makino C. Baylor D. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Green E.S. Menz D.M. LaVail M.M. Flannery J.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1546-1553PubMed Google Scholar). The delocalization does not appear to be a result of overexpression, because expression levels of rho-GFPΔCT were low relative to endogenous rhodopsin and were comparable with or lower than those measured for rho-GFP. Therefore, rho-GFP provides a useful starting point for the analysis of mutations that may affect the intracellular trafficking or transport of rhodopsin. Such experiments would be more easily carried out than experiments using transgenic mice (15Sung C.-H. Makino C. Baylor D. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and physiologically more relevant than experiments using cultured cells, in which an identified rhodopsin sorting signal (9Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) does not function (22Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc.

In all of these processes, DnaK is thought to interact transiently with unraveled segments of partially unfolded or denatured protein substrates. Studies have shown that the reversible switching from a high affinity conformation, which binds substrate tightly, to a low affinity conformation, which binds substrate weakly, is the hallmark of DnaK activity (7Palleros D.R.

Such a mechanism is shown in Scheme FS1, where ADP·DnaK·P and ATP·DnaK* are the high and low affinity states, respectively, and E and J are GrpE and DnaJ, respectively. In this report, we examine the role of a specific subdomain of DnaK on this conformational switch.DnaK is composed of two functional domains: residues 1–387 comprise the N-terminal ATPase domain, and residues 388–638 comprise the C-terminal polypeptide binding domain. The three-dimensional structure of the ATPase domain of bovine brain Hsc70, a 70-kDa chaperone, is a bilobed structure in which a nucleotide molecule sits at the base of a cleft formed by the two lobes (12Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a fragment of the C-terminal polypeptide binding domain comprising residues 387–601 consists of a β-sandwich subdomain that is followed by an α-helical subdomain that acts like a lid over the β-sandwich subdomain (13Morshauser R.C.

To gain insight into the function of the lid, slightly different lidless forms of DnaK and eukaryotic Hsp70s have been engineered (9Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schroder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G.

Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and loss of the lid results in a 2–20-fold increase inKd values for peptide interaction with the ADP-bound state of lidless DnaK (17Pellecchia M.

Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The lidless protein reversibly oligomerizes (16Fouchaq B. Benaroudj N. Ebel C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The β-sandwich subdomain can exist in a closed conformation (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y.

Lidless DnaK(2–538) does not function in anin vitro folding assay (18Mayer M. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), whereas DnaK(1–507) supports λ phage DNA replication in vivo, albeit at reduced activity relative to the wild type protein (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.-P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).The hypothesis tested in this study was that removal of the DnaK lid should produce a constitutive low affinity state of the protein. In other words, if the lid enables high affinity peptide binding to DnaK, then deletion of the lid should produce a state that rapidly binds and rapidly releases peptide, even in the presence of ADP. Such experiments are important because the kinetics of peptide interactions with lidless DnaK is unexplored. To this end, we have expressed, purified, and characterized a lidless variant of DnaK which contains an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)1tag. Deletion of these residues (see the arrow in Fig. 1) completely eliminates four of the five helices that make up the lid. Because GST domains dimerize (19Maru Y. Afar D.E. Witte O. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15353-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Tudyka T. Skerra A. Prot. Sci. 1997; 6: 2180-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage prior to characterization. In agreement with two earlier studies (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.-P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Mayer M. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we show here that our GST-cleaved DnaK(1–517) is not comparable to the ATP-bound low affinity state of DnaK. Instead, clDnaK(1–517) is an activated state in that the rates of peptide binding and release in the presence of ADP or ATP are increased relative to the wild type protein.RESULTSWild type DnaK and two variants were studied. (i) The primary form of lidless DnaK used in this report was expressed with an N-terminal GST tag that was removed by treatment with thrombin prior to characterization. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that 10 residues, GSPEFPGRLE, remain attached to the N terminus of DnaK after cleavage of the GST tag. GSPEFPGRLE-DnaK(1–517) is referred to below as clDnaK(1–517). (ii) To control for the effect, if any, of this 10-amino acid prepiece a GST fusion of wtDnaK was also expressed; cleavage of the tag leads to GSPEFPGRLE-DnaK, and this form of the protein is referred to as clDnaKwt.ATPase ActivityThe steady-state ATPase activities of wild type, clDnaK(1–517), and clDnaKwt are compared in Fig.2. In the absence of peptide, the steady-state ATPase activity of wtDnaK was 0.02 ± 0.01 min–1, and added peptide increased this value ∼5-fold to 0.11 ± 0.01 min–1. In contrast, in the absence of peptide clDnaK(1–517) hydrolyzes ATP (0.05 ± 0.015 min–1) about two times faster than wtDnaK, and, in agreement with Pellecchia and co-workers (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.-P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), added peptide produces a ∼2-fold stimulation of the ATPase activity of lidless DnaK. As a control, we determined the steady-state ATPase activity of clDnaKwt. The ATPase values with and without peptide are almost identical to those found for clDnaK(1–517). On the basis of these results we conclude that clDnaK(1–517) is fully capable of binding peptide because added peptide stimulates its ATPase activity, and the 10-amino acid prepiece stimulates the endogenous ATPase activity of DnaK by a factor of 2.Figure 2ATPase assay. The ATPase activity of DnaK (wtDnaK, clDnaK(1–517), and clDnaKwt) was measured in the absence or presence of excess peptide.

A spin column assay was used instead of size exclusion column because the former assay enables the separation of relatively short lived DnaK·peptide complexes from free peptide, whereas the latter method requires relatively long lived complexes (t 1/2 > 15 min). The assay was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A tritiated Cro peptide ([3H]MQERITLKDYAM) was used.Figure 3Equilibrium peptide binding to DnaK variants. A spin column assay was used to measure equilibrium peptide binding to DnaK and its various forms (wtDnaK, clDnaK(1–517), and clDnaKwt). For details regarding the spin column assay, see “Experimental Procedures.” Conditions: [protein] = 4 µm; [[3H]Cro] = 20 µm; temperature = 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Wild type DnaK binds the [3H]Cro peptide in a nucleotide-dependent fashion, with high affinity binding and reduced or low affinity binding in the presence of ADP and ATP (Fig. 3), respectively. By comparison, clDnaK(1–517) binds the [3H]Cro peptide with about one-half to one-fourth the affinity as wtDnaK in the presence of ADP. However, similar to wtDnaK, added ATP reduces the amount of peptide binding to the lidless protein. To control for the presence of the prepiece, [3H]Cro peptide binding to clDnaKwt was also examined. This form of DnaK displays high and low affinity binding in the presence of ADP and ATP, respectively. One difference between clDnaK and wtDnaK is that there is about twice the amount of peptide binding in the presence of ATP to the cleaved form of wild type. The reduced amount of [3H]Cro peptide binding to clDnaK(1–517), coupled with the ability of ATP to reduce further the amount of binding, agrees with earlier studies (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L.

A fluorescence spectrometer in time-based mode was used for experiments conducted on wtDnaK and clDnaKwt, and a stopped-flow instrument was used for experiments conducted on clDnaK(1–517).Fig. 4 A compares fNR dissociation from wild type, clDnaKwt, and clDnaK(1–517) in the presence of ADP. Over a time base of 2,000–3,000 s for dissociation from wtDnaK and clDnaKwt and a time base of 100 s for clDnaK(1–517), fNR dissociation follows single exponential kinetics. The dissociation of the fNR peptide from preformed wtDnaK·fNR complexes occurs with an apparent first-order rate constant,k off, equal to 1.0 (± 0.1) × 10–3 s–1. In contrast, the dissociation of the fNR peptide from preformed clDnaK(1–517)·fNR complexes is 100 times faster, occurring with an apparent k offequal to 1.1 (± 0.2) × 10–1 s–1. (An expanded scale version of this dissociation trace is shown in theinset.) As a control, the dissociation of the fNR peptide from clDnaKwt, which, like clDnaK(1–517), possesses a 10-amino acid, N-terminal prepiece, was examined. The fNR peptide dissociates from clDnaKwt with k off = 8.7 (± 0.5) × 10–4 s–1, which demonstrates that the 10-amino acid prepiece does not affect the rate of fNR dissociation from DnaK. The dissociation experiments show that loss of the lid increases the rate of peptide release from ADP-DnaK by 2 orders of magnitude.Figure 4Kinetics of DnaK·peptide complex dissociation. Panel A, comparison of fNR dissociation from wild type, clDnaKwt, and clDnaK(1–517) in the presence of ADP. Experiments were initiated by mixing preformed ADP·wtDnaK·fNR complexes with excess unlabeled NR plus excess ADP. Each dissociation trace was fit to a single exponential function (solid line). wtDnaK·fNR → wtDnaK + fNR, k off = 0.00099 s–1; clDnaKwt·fNR → clDnaKwt + fNR,k off = 0.00093 s–1; and clDnaK(1–517)·fNR → clDnaK(1–517) + fNR,k off = 0.073 s–1. Theinset shows an expanded scale trace for dissociation from clDnaK(1–517). Concentrations after mixing: [protein] = 1–2 µm; [fNR] = 1–2 µm; [NR] = 30–60 µm; [ADP] = 1 mm. Temperature = 25 °C. Panel B, comparison of fNR dissociation from wild type, clDnaKwt, and clDnaK(1–517) in the presence of ATP.

Theinset shows an expanded scale trace for fNR dissociation from clDnaK(1–517). Concentrations after mixing: [protein] = 1–2 µm; [fNR] = 1–2 µm; [NR] = 30–60 µm; [ATP] = 1 mm.

ATP accelerates the rate of fNR dissociation from all three forms of DnaK compared with ADP. For example, the apparent first-order rate constant, k off, for fNR dissociation from wtDnaK and clDnaKwt is 4.8 ± 0.3 s–1 and 4.1 ± 0.3 s–1, respectively. In contrast, fNR dissociates from preformed clDnaK(1–517)·fNR complexes with an apparentk off equal to 188 (± 36) s–1. ATP therefore produces a ∼1,700-fold increase in the rate of peptide dissociation from clDnaK(1–517). The combined results reveal that loss of the lid region of DnaK produces a significant increase in the peptide off-rates.The kinetics of DnaK·peptide complex formation was also investigated (Fig. 5). Representative formation traces for the reaction between fNR and ADP-bound, lidless DnaK are shown in Fig. 5 A. The reactions were carried out at a fixed concentration of the fNR peptide (1.0 µm) while the concentration of wtDnaK was varied (4–20 µm). The relatively large concentration of the fNR peptide was used to obtain an adequate fluorescence signal. The fNR peptide binds to ADP-bound clDnaK(1–517) with double exponential kinetics (F(t) =ΔF1exp[−k obs1 t] +ΔF2exp[-k obs2 t] +F ∞) (Fig. 5 A), consistent with the following sequential two-step mechanism P+ADP·lidless↔k−1k+1(ADP·lidless·P)i↔k−2k+2(ADP·lidless·P)t REACTION1where (ADP·lidless·P)i and (ADP·lidless·P)t denote intermediate and terminal complexes of clDnaK(1–517). For Reaction 1, when the bimolecular reaction P + ADP·lidless ⇔ (ADP·lidless·P)i is faster than the unimolecular reaction (ADP·lidless·P)i ⇔ (ADP·lidless·P)t,k obs1 exhibits a linear dependence on the concentration of lidless DnaK, whereas k obs2exhibits a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of the lidless protein (29Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions Theory and Practice. John Wiley & Sons, New York1979Google Scholar). The plot of k obs1 versus [clDnaK(1–517)] (see Fig. 5 B) is linear; the slope and y intercept yield apparent on- and off-rate constants of 11,000 (± 2,000) m–1s–1 and 0.13 (± 0.04) s–1, respectively. This latter value agrees, within the experimental error, with the value of k off1 determined from the direct dissociation experiment (k off1 = 0.11 ± 0.02 s–1) (Table I). The plot ofk obs2 versus [clDnaK(1–517)] (see Fig. 5 B) shows a weak dependence ofk obs on [clDnaK(1–517)], and the asymptote of the plot, k +2 + k –2, equals 0.06–0.07 s–1.Figure 5Kinetics of DnaK·peptide complex formation.

Open table in a new tab For comparison, the kinetics of complex formation between the fNR peptide and wtDnaK in the presence of excess ADP was investigated. The reactions were carried out at a fixed concentration of the fNR peptide (0.2 µm) while the concentration of wtDnaK was varied (2–10 µm). Over this range of protein concentrations, the fNR peptide binds to ADP·wtDnaK in one phase (F(t) = ΔFexp[−k obs t] +F ∞) (Fig. 5 C), consistent with complex formation according to Reaction 2. P+ADP·wtDnaK⇔k−1k+1ADP·wtDnaK·P REACTION2Assuming complex formation according to Reaction 2, a plot ofk obs versus [wtDnaK] should be linear, with slope and intercept equal to the apparent on-rate (k +1) and off-rate (k –1) constants, respectively. The plot of k obs versus [wtDnaK] in Fig. 5 D is linear and yields apparent on- and off-rate constants of 910 (± 40)m–1 s–1 and 0.0019 (± 0.0002) s–1, respectively. This latter value is similar to the apparent k off value determined from the direct dissociation experiment (k off = 0.0010 ± 0.0001 s–1) (Table I). These combined kinetic experiments show that deletion of the lid increases the magnitudes of the apparent on- and off-rate constants (k +1 andk –1) by 12- and ∼100-fold, respectively.When complex formation reactions were carried out at a larger fixed concentration of the fNR peptide (1.0 µm) while the concentration of wtDnaK was varied over a larger range (4–20 µm) there was a rapid (k obs ∼ 2 s–1) initial increase in fluorescence which constituted 5% of the total signal change. Based on this observation, it is likely that the reaction between wtDnaK and the fNR peptide is also biphasic, but because of the small amplitude we could not characterize this phase.DISCUSSIONStriking differences were found in the kinetic constants for the interactions of the NR peptide with wtDnaK and lidless DnaK (Table I). Differences in off-rate constants between wild type and lidless DnaK are illustrated in Reactions 3–R6. Reactions 3 and 4 compare peptide dissociation from wild type and clDnaK(1–517) in the presence of ADP, respectively; Reactions 5 and 6 compare peptide dissociation from wild type and clDnaK(1–517) in the presence of ATP, respectively. ADP·wtDnaK·fNR→0.001s−1ADP·wtDnaK+fNR REACTION3 ADP·clDnaK(1–517)·fNR→0.1s−1ADP·clDnaK(1–517)+fNR REACTION4 ATP+wtDnaK·fNR→5s−1ATP·wtDnaK*+fNR REACTION5 ATP+clDnaK(1–517)·fNR→188s−1ATP·clDnaK(1–517)*+fNR REACTION6The above results show that loss of the lid produces an activated form of DnaK in which the rate constants for peptide dissociation are increased substantially compared with wild type. For example, in the presence of ADP the deletion of the lid increasesk off by a factor of 100 (0.001 → 0.1 s–1), whereas in the presence of ATP the deletion of the lid increases k off by a factor of 37.6 (5 → 188 s–1). Further, that the k offvalue for NR peptide dissociation from clDnaK(1–517) is so nucleotide-dependent, increasing from 0.1 to 188 s–1 when ADP is replaced with ATP shows that the β-sandwich subdomain can exist in two distinct conformations, in agreement with earlier studies (17Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.-P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Mayer M. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The combined results show that the lid acts like a brake on the rate of ATP-induced peptide dissociation and that the lid and the β-sandwich facilitate peptide binding to DnaK.One of the findings in this report is that the presence of DnaK lid increases the lifetime of a DnaK·peptide complex. For example, in the presence of ATP the lifetime, τ, of an ATP·DnaK*·fNR complex is 140 ms (ln 2/5 s–1), whereas deletion of the lid decreases the lifetime to 3.7 ms (ln 2/188 s–1). To explain the effect of the lid on the lifetime of the ATP·DnaK·peptide complex, below we discuss several variations of a two-step reaction mechanism that involves sequential conformational changes in the lid and β-sandwich subdomains. For simplicity, only forward reactions, i.e. closed-to-open transitions in the β-sandwich (βc→o) and lid (lc→o), are depicted.If the β-sandwich and lid subdomains are uncoupled in that deletion of the lid does not affect the rate constants for the βc→o or βo→ctransitions, then our results are consistent with Reaction 7, where ATP binding triggers conformational changes first in the β-sandwich and then in the lid ATP+Eβclc·P→188s−1ATP·Eβolc·P→5s−1ATP·Eβolo+P REACTION7where Eβclc·P is the high affinity wtDnaK·peptide complex in which both the β-sandwich and lid are closed; ATP·Eβolc·P is an intermediate in which the β-sandwich and lid are open and closed, respectively; and ATP·Eβolo is the low affinity state in which both the β-sandwich and lid subdomains are open. Note that the second step in Reaction 7, lid opening (k lc→o = 5 s–1), is the rate-limiting step for peptide dissociation peptide. Upon deletion of the lid peptide dissociation is governed by the βc→o transition, therefore the maximal rate of peptide dissociation jumps from 5 to 188 s–1.Because at present we cannot determine the sequence of the conformational changes upon ATP binding to DnaK, it must be noted that our results are also consistent with Reaction 8, where ATP binding triggers conformational changes first in the lid and then in the β-sandwich. ATP+Eβclc·P→5s−1ATP·Eβclo·P→188s−1ATP·Eβolo+P REACTION8In the above reaction, the first step, lid opening (k lc→o = 5 s–1), is the rate-limiting step for peptide dissociation peptide from wtDnaK. Upon deletion of the lid peptide dissociation becomes governed by the βc→o transition, therefore the maximal rate of peptide dissociation jumps from 5 to 188 s–1.Alternatively, suppose the β-sandwich and lid"

SDF-1 inhibits infection of CD4+ cells by X4 (CXCR4-dependent) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains. We previously showed that SDF-1α interacts specifically with heparin or heparan sulfates (HSs). Herein, we delimited the boundaries of the HS-binding domain located in the first β-strand of SDF-1α as the critical residues. We also provide evidence that binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) determines the capacity of SDF-1α to prevent the fusogenic activity of HIV-1 X4 isolates in leukocytes. Indeed, SDF-1α mutants lacking the capacity to interact with HSPGs showed a substantially reduced capacity to prevent cell-to-cell fusion mediated by X4 HIV envelope glycoproteins. Moreover, the enzymatic removal of cell surface HS diminishes the HIV-inhibitory capacity of the chemokine to the levels shown by the HS-binding-disabled mutant counterparts. The mechanisms underlying the optimal HIV-inhibitory activity of SDF-1α when attached to HSPGs were investigated. Combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer and laser confocal microscopy, we demonstrate the concomitant binding of SDF-1α to CXCR4 and HSPGs at the cell membrane. Using FRET between a Texas Red-labeled SDF-1α and an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged CXCR4, we show that binding of SDF-1α to cell surface HSPGs modifies neither the kinetics of occupancy nor activation in real time of CXCR4 by the chemokine. Moreover, attachment to HSPGs does not modify the potency of the chemokine to promote internalization of CXCR4. Attachment to cellular HSPGs may co-operate in the optimal anti-HIV activity of SDF-1α by increasing the local concentration of the chemokine in the surrounding environment of CXCR4, thus facilitating sustained occupancy and down-regulation of the HIV coreceptor.

Thus, SDF-1 plays an essential role during embryonic life, regulating organogenesis (neuronal patterning and cardiovascular development) and development of the hematopoietic system, namely B lymphopoiesis (6Nagasawa T.

Apart from these physiological functions, SDF-1 has the unique and selective capacity to inhibit entry of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) that use CXCR4 as coreceptor into CD4 T lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (1Oberlin E.

HIV enters cells through sequential interaction of the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein with the cell surface CD4 molecule and either CXCR4 or CCR5, another G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (13Michael N.L. Moore J.P. Nat. Med. 2000; 5: 740-741Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HIV strains that infect macrophages and primary T cells use CCR5 (R5 viruses), whereas HIV strains that infect transformed CD4+ cell lines and primary T cells use CXCR4 (X4 virus). X4 HIV isolates, previously known as T lymphotropic, are characteristic of the late phases of infection and are frequently associated with a sharp decline on CD4 T cell counting and worsening of the clinical status (14Tersmette M.

SDF-1 does not interfere with the primary binding of the surface subunit (gp120) of the X4 HIV-Env glycoprotein to CD4. Binding to CD4 promotes conformational changes of gp120 allowing subsequent interaction of the reorganized HIV-Env with CXCR4. Such interaction is thought to lead to exposure of the fusion domain of the HIV-Env transmembrane subunit (gp41), which eventually triggers fusion of CD4+/CXCR4+ cell targets with either cell-free HIV or HIV-infected cells (16Chan D.C.

Occupancy of CXCR4 by SDF-1 prevents the interaction of X4 HIV Env with CXCR4, thus blocking the activation of the fusogenic capacity of gp41 and, ultimately, the entry of virions into the cell. The biological functions of chemokines are thought to be influenced by their association with cellular or matrix extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Usually attached to a core protein to form proteoglycans (19Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), the common GAGs (heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate (CS)) are highly sulfated oligosaccharides. With the exception of CS, all of the above-mentioned GAGs are characterized by a high degree of structural heterogeneity (20Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 21Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Another common GAG is hyaluronic acid, but it is never attached to a core protein and is not a GAG sulfate (19Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev.

A cluster of basic residues (Lys24, His25, and Lys27) in the first β-strand of SDF-1α is necessary for the interaction of SDF-1α with HS both in vitro and in intact cells. Indeed, a SDF-1α derivative carrying three Ser substitutions in the Lys24, His25, Lys27 cluster (SDF-1 3/6) is unable to bind HS. Inactivation of the putative HS-binding site does not affect the capacity of SDF-1α to ligate CXCR4, suggesting that cellular HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) are dispensable for the HIV inhibitory effect of the chemokine. However, the contribution of cellular GAGs to the optimal, inhibitory activity of the CC chemokines RANTES or macrophage inflammatory protein 1β against HIV R5 is supported by an increasing body of evidence. Surprisingly, in some cases, the optimal inhibition of HIV-1 infection shown by RANTES·HS complexes contrasts with the impairment of the agonistic capacity of the complex as compared with the chemokine alone (23Burns J.M. Lewis G.K. DeVico A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14499-14504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consequently, it can be hypothesized that despite the apparent preserved functionality of HS-binding disabled SDF-1α mutants, complexes of SDF-1α with cellular HSPGs may also be determinant for maintaining the optimal capacity of the chemokine to prevent entry of X4 HIV isolates. Analysis of the kinetics of SDF-1α/CXCR4 interactions investigated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and real time measurement of CXCR4 activation indicates that complexing with HS does not modify the intrinsic capacities of SDF-1α to interact with its cognate receptor. However, our findings indicate that selective interaction of SDF-1α with cell membrane HS is required for optimal inhibition of CXCR4 envelope-mediated cell-HIV fusion. Neither SDF-1α induced endocytosis nor recycling of CXCR4 is influenced by cell surface HSPGs. However, combining FRET and laser scanning confocal microscopy, we demonstrate the accumulation of large amounts of SDF-1α at the cell surface, which is largely independent of CXCR4 and relies on the presence of HS. We propose that attachment of SDF-1α to HSPGs increases the local concentration of the chemokine in the surrounding of CXCR4 thus facilitating sustained occupancy and down-regulation of the HIV coreceptor. SDF-1α bound to cell membrane HS may be a major constituent of a natural barrier limiting transmission and propagation of X4 HIV isolates in vivo. Soluble HS was obtained from Sigma (catalogue number H5393). Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8) and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. K15C is an anti-SDF-1 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a κ) against the amino-terminal region of SDF-1 (22Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M.

Q4120, an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that blocks the binding of gp120 to CD4, was obtained from the Medical Research Council AIDS Reagent Project. 125I-SDF-1α (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fluorescent calcein-AM, Indo-1/AM, and 5- (and 6)-{[(4-chloromethyl)benzoyl]-amino} tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR) probes were obtained from Molecular Probes. The HeLa P4.2 cell clone is stably transfected with a human CD4 cDNA and a HIV-LTR-driven β-gal reporter gene (24Clavel F. Charneau P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa 243 cells, provided by Dr. M. Alizon, co-express both Tat and Env HIV-1 proteins from an HIV-LTR-driven vector derived from the X4 pLai proviral molecular clone (25Schwartz O. Alizon M. Heard J.M. Danos O. Virology. 1994; 198: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), Glutamax, antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 µm of Methotrexate. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) (ATCC CCL-10) were maintained in Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% FCS, 20 mm Hepes, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. To express HIV-Env Lai BHK-21, cell monolayers were infected with a defective Semliki Forest virus encoding a full-length sequence of the HIV-1 LAI env gene at multiplicity of infection of 10 for 1 h. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors using Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient centrifugation. PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. PBMC were activated during 3 days with 1 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Murex Diagnostics S. A.). Adherent human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Wild type SDF-1α, SDF-1 3/6 (K24S/H25S/K27S), SDF-1 2/6 (K24S/K27S), and SDF-1α P2G were synthesized by the Merrifield solid phase method on a fully automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Perspective Biosystems, and PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The procedure used for chemokine synthesis we described previously (22Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H.

The concentration of each chemokine was determined by amino acid analysis on a 6300 Beckman amino acid analyzer after hydrolysis for 20 h in 6 n HCl, 0.2% phenol in the presence of a known amount of norleucine as internal standard. All chemicals for the synthesis were purchased from Perspective Biosystems and PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CEM cells (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in PBS with 0.25 nm iodinated SDF-1α (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and various concentrations of unlabeled SDF-1α or SDF-1 2/6 for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 300 µl. Incubations were terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 µm unlabeled SDF-1α. Cell pellet-associated radioactivity was counted using an LKB-Wallac microcomputer controlled 1272 CliniGamma counter. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPrad Prism 2.0 software. Adherent cells were plated 2 days before binding experiments. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS and washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 20 mm Hepes, 1% bovine serum albumin). 4 × 105 cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of chemokines in a total volume of 200 µl for 90 min at 4 °C with stirring. Unbound chemokine was removed by washing with binding buffer, and cell-bound SDF-1α was detected by incubation with the anti-SDF-1 monoclonal antibody K15C (15 µg/ml, diluted in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin), which recognizes an epitope encompassing the amino-terminal end of the chemokine. After staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Southern Biotechnology), cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). HeLa 243 cells were co-incubated with HeLa P4.2 cells in a total volume of 250 µl in 96-well plates at a 1:1 ratio during 18 h. After 18 h of co-culture, cells were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C and lysed with 50 µl of lysis buffer (from Roche β-gal reporter gene assay kit) for 20 min, and the enzymatic activity was evaluated according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (β-gal reporter gene assay (chemiluminescent), Roche Diagnostics). This technique was modified from a procedure described previously by Puri et al. (26Puri A. Hug P. Jernigan K. Barchi J. Kim H.Y. Hamilton J. Wiels J. Murray G.J. Brady R.O. Blumenthal R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14435-14440Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, BHK-21 expressing HIV-1 Lai Env and phytohemagglutinin-activated PBMC were loaded with aqueous calcein-AM and CMTMR, respectively. After for 15 h in culture, cell syncytia labeled with the two cytoplasmic dyes were analyzed by flow cytometry. When indicated, enzymatic cleavage of cell surface GAG was obtained by pretreating cells for 30 min before the onset of the culture with 5 milliunits/ml of either heparitinase I or chondroitinase ABC. GAG lytic enzymes were maintained in the cell cultures until the end of the experiment. HeLa P4.2 cells were incubated culture medium containing 5 µm Indo-1/AM for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 15-min incubation in probe-free medium. Measurements were made at 37 °C in Hepes buffer (5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 137.5 mmNaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 6 mm KCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with protease inhibitors (40 µg/ml bestatin, 40 µg/ml bacitracin, 50 µg/ml chymostatin, 20 µg/ml phosphoramidon, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin). Fluorescence emission was detected at 405 and 475 nm (excitation, 338 nm). Real time intracellular calcium measurements from cell suspensions were made on a Fluorolog (SPEX) spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450-W xenon lamp, a double grating excitation monochromator, and two single grating emission monochromators. Slits were set to 4 or 6 mm, yielding bandwidths of 7.2 or 10.8 nm at excitation and 14.4 and 21.6 nm at emission, respectively. Data were acquired with two photon counting photomultipliers. Real time measurements were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SK1E rapid mixing apparatus modified for mixing with living cells (final concentration, 106 cells/ml). The observation chamber was an Hellma 176.002 (100 µl) quartz circulation cuvette placed on the cuvette holder of the SPEX fluorolog spectrofluorometer. At a typical 12 bars air ram pressure, the flow rate was 4 ± 0.5 ml/s. Each measurement started after renewal of 7–8 times the volume of the observation cuvette. The dead volume (100 µl) and dead time of the apparatus (25 ± 5 ms) were experimentally determined. Time-based recordings were typically sampled every 20–100 ms. Actin polymerization was tested as described by Bleul et al. (27Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Activated PBMC were incubated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, Glutamax, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C and induced with the chemokines as indicated. Forty-five s after induction, 100 µl of a stop solution containing 4 × 10−7m FITC-labeled phalloidin, 0.5 mg/ml 1-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma), and 15% formaldehyde in PBS were added to PBMC (in 400 µl). Analysis of FITC-phalloidin-labeled cells was performed by flow cytometry. Detection and quantification of association and dissociation kinetics of SDF-1α/CXCR4 interaction were measured by FRET, between enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and Texas Red (TR) chromophores on living cells. To this purpose, we engineered an EGFP-CXCR4 chimeric protein by fusing EGFP to the extracellular, amino-terminal end of CXCR4 as described (28Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and synthesized a SDF-1α derivative carrying a single TR molecule bound to Lys68. A clone of HEK 293 cells stably expressing EGFP-CXCR4 was isolated. Upon excitation of EGFP-CXCR4 at 460–470 nm wavelength, association of the fluorescent ligand with the receptor was measured by monitoring the reduction of EGFP emission at 510 nm as described by Vollmer et al. (28Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, dissociation was measured as the increase of EGFP emission at 510 nm, when bound SDF-1α-TR was displaced by an excess of unlabeled SDF-1α. Real time fluorescence data (in counts per second (cps)) were stored using the DM3000 software provided with the fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer and analyzed with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) by various analytical expressions, such as exponentials, sum of exponentials, or sum of exponentials and linear relationships (29Heidmann T. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 255-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Neubig R.R. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 734-740PubMed Google Scholar). The uniqueness of the fit was checked by repeated calculations performed with distinct experimental data points (from several experiments) or with distinct values for initiation of the fitting procedure. For a bimolecular reaction scheme,R+L↔RL(Eq. 1) describing ligand-receptor interactions, fluorescence traces were analyzed using the following relationship,y=λexp(−kapp×t)(Eq. 2) where λ is the amplitude of the exponential fluorescence decline, t is the recording time, andk app is the apparent rate constant of the reaction. The apparent rate constant k app is equal to k app = k 1 ×L + k –1, where L is the concentration of ligand, k 1 is the forward rate constant, and k –1 is the backward rate constant of Equation 1. HEK 293 cells expressing EGFP-CXCR4 were grown on glass coverslips and incubated in Ringer solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.3) at 19 °C to avoid CXCR4 endocytosis. Images were taken on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) equipped with a confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES) using a Plan Apo × 40 oil immersion objective (Nikon). Excitation light (488 nm) was obtained using 1 or 3% power from a 30-mW krypton-argon laser. Emitted fluorescence was recorded at 522 ± 5 and 605 ± 22 nm and was color-coded (256 gray levels). Images were acquired from a section located 3–6 µm above the glass coverslip at 2–4 Hz and analyzed using Bio-Rad time course software. Ligands were applied in the bath using a perfusion pipette. We have previously identified a cluster of basic residues (Lys24, His25, and Lys27) in the first β-strand of SDF-1α necessary for interaction with HS, bothin vitro and in intact cells (22Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol.

Indeed, a mutant SDF-1α carrying the substitutions K24S/H25S/K27S (SDF-1 3/6) selectively failed to bind HS. To further delimit the boundaries of the HS-binding site, new SDF-1α mutants were engineered by replacing each amino acid of the basic cluster with Ser. Binding of SDF-1α derivatives to cell surface HS was assessed using an anti-SDF-1α monoclonal antibody (K15C) that recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal end of the chemokine. Each single-point mutant (K24S, H25S, or K27S) SDF-1α induced CXCR4-dependent actin polymerization and bound to cell surface HS with efficiency and affinity comparable to wild type SDF-1α (data not shown). In contrast, a mutant combining K24S/K27S substitutions (SDF-1 2/6) failed, like SDF-1 3/6, to bind to cell surface HS at concentrations up to 1 µm (Fig.1 b). Gel chromatography and plasmon resonance spectroscopy confirmed that SDF-1 2/6 lost, to the same extent as SDF-1 3/6, the affinity for immobilized heparin. Like SDF-1 3/6, the SDF-1 2/6 mutant bound (Fig. 1 a) and induced CXCR4 activation with affinity and efficiency comparable to the wild type counterpart (Fig. 1 c). These results reinforce our conviction (22Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that amino acid substitutions inactivating the putative HS-binding site of SDF-1α preserve the overall three-dimensional conformation of the protein. Moreover, our findings confirm that the HS-binding site on SDF-1α is indeed outside the amino-terminal domain involved in occupancy and signaling of CXCR4. However, they do not exclude the possibility that other residues, such as Arg41and Lys43, contribute to forming an accessible, positively charged surface for interaction with HS. In any case, Lys24and Lys27 appear to be the critical residues, which either make physical contact with or critically shape the surface for attachment of HS. The conserved ability of HS-binding-disabled derivatives of SDF-1α to bind and activate CXCR4 prompted us to investigate whether attachment of SDF-1α to cell surface HSPGs contributes to the HIV inhibitory activity of the chemokine. For this purpose, an HIV-Env-mediated cell-ce"

In contrast, only the peptide containing a tandem repeating unit of the receptor binding domain sequence of apoE, apoE-(141-155)(2), was capable of inhibiting PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration. Peptide containing only a single unit of this sequence, apoE-(141-155), or the apoE-(211-243) peptide were ineffective in inhibiting PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration. Additional experiments showed that reductively methylated apoE, which is incapable of receptor binding yet retains its heparin binding capability, was equally effective as apoE in inhibiting PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation. However, reductively methylated apoE was unable to inhibit smooth muscle cell migration toward PDGF. Additionally, the receptor binding domain-specific apoE antibody 1D7 also mitigated the anti-migratory properties of apoE on smooth muscle cells. Finally, pretreatment of cells with heparinase failed to abolish apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration. Taken together, these data documented that apoE inhibition of PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation is mediated by its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, while its inhibition of cell migration is mediated through apoE binding to cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2034304329,"When starved for a single amino acid, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase GCN2 in a GCN1-dependent manner. Phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits general translation but selectively derepresses the synthesis of the transcription factor GCN4, which leads to coordinated induction of genes involved in biosynthesis of various amino acids, a phenomenon called general control response. We recently demonstrated that this response requires binding of GCN1 to the GI domain occurring at the N terminus of GCN2 (Kubota, H., Sakaki, Y., and Ito, T. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 20243–20246).

The phosphorylation converts eIF2α from the substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF2; phosphorylated eIF2-GDP forms a stable complex with eIF2B to hamper recycling of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP (2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scarcity of eIF2-GTP accordingly decreases the level of the ternary complex composed of eIF2, GTP, and the charged initiator tRNA, a prerequisite for translational initiation, and hence leads to general suppression of protein synthesis. Thus, eIF2α kinases play pivotal roles in this famous translational control. Mammalian cells have four eIF2α kinases, each of which is activated in response to a distinct stress. Heme-regulated inhibitor is activated by hemin deprivation (3Clemens M.J. Translational Control.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). In contrast, the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has the sole eIF2α kinase, GCN2, the founding member of this family. The yeast GCN2 is activated by starvation for amino acids, glucose deprivation, purine limitation, and impaired tRNA synthetase activity (8Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2161-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The gene for this kinase was originally identified in the studies of a response to amino acid starvation called general control of amino acid synthesis, and hence was termed GCN2 (generalcontrol nonderepressible 2). The molecular mechanism underlying general control response is currently considered as follows. When the budding yeast starves for a single particular amino acid, free tRNAs, which are not charged with amino acids, accumulate within the cells and bind to a bipartite domain composed of the histidyl tRNA synthetase-related domain and the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of GCN2 (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This bipartite domain forms an inhibitory interaction with the kinase domain, which is disrupted upon binding of tRNAs (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition to uncharged tRNAs, which unmask the kinase domain, genetic evidence suggests that in vivo activation of GCN2 requires another gene, GCN1, encoding a protein bearing a region homologous to translation elongation factor 3 (12Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GCN1 forms a stable complex with the ATP-binding cassette protein GCN20 and functions on an elongating ribosome (13Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3148-3199Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chalraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs in the presence of GCN1 and phosphorylates eIF2α to suppress protein synthesis via the mechanism described above. However, the mRNA encoding GCN4 is selectively translated by a unique mechanism, which depends on the four short open reading frames (ORFs) preceding the one for GCN4 (10Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2161-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The transcription factor GCN4 induces the expression of genes involved in various amino acid synthetic pathways. In contrast to the action of uncharged tRNAs and the mechanism for derepressed translation of GCN4 mRNA, how GCN1 participates in the activation of GCN2 was poorly understood at the molecular level. Recently, we and others showed that a direct interaction between GCN1 and GCN2 is necessary for general control response, thereby providing the first insight into the underlying mechanism (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we determine the minimal essential regions of GCN1 and GCN2 for the complex formation and demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF2α, translational derepression of GCN4 mRNA, and general control response are impaired in the gcn1 andgcn2 mutants defective in this interaction. These results provide the first direct evidence for a crucial role of GCN1-GCN2 interaction in the activation of the eIF2α kinase.

Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar) was adopted except for the addition of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide prior to the heat shock step (20Ito T. Tashiro K. Muta S. Ozawa R. Chiba T.

AGCN1 DNA fragment (nucleotides 6142–7146) was cloned between the segments encoding the GAL4 activation domain (AD) and the C-terminal 75-amino acid (aa) region of CDC24, which bears a PC motif and is called the PC motif-containing region (PCCR) (18Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We subjected the GAL4 AD-GCN1-PCCR fragment to error-prone PCR in 50 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, 200 μm dATP, 2 mm dCTP, 2 mm dGTP, 2 mm dTTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 pmol of each primer under the following thermal cycling: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified products of error-prone PCR were cloned into pGAD424g by a transformation-associated recombination technique (21Oldenberg K., R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) using PJ69–4AΔ (MAT a) as a host. Transformants were then mated with Mavχ (MATα) bearing pGBK-GCN2 and pHLZ-BEM1-PB1. The former plasmid encodes a hybrid protein between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GI domain of GCN2, and the latter one encodes a protein between LexA and the PB1 domain of BEM1 (aa 472–551), which specifically binds to PCCR of CDC24. 2T. Ito and H. Sumimoto, unpublished observation. Diploid cells were then plated onto synthetic complete medium (20Ito T. Tashiro K. Muta S. Ozawa R. Chiba T. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto K. Kuhara S. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) lacking Trp, Leu, and His (SC−Trp−Leu−His) supplemented with 20 mm3-aminotriazole (3AT) and 0.2% 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5FOA). Thegcn1-F2291L DNA fragment (nucleotides 6538–7401) was cloned in pUC-URA3, a pUC13 derivative bearing the URA3 marker (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), to obtain pUC-URA3-gcn1-F2291L, which was subsequently linearized with Bglll, and introduced into the yeast MB758-5B cells. The Ura+ transformants were tested for successful targeted integration by diagnostic colony PCR. These clones were then selected for 5FOA resistance and examined for the desired allele replacement to obtain the strain JBZ1 (MAT a ura3 gcn1-F2291L). For epitope tagging of GCN1, we first constructed a pUC-URA3 derivative bearing a DNA fragment encoding the 3′-end portion of GCN1ORF with its flanking region (nucleotides 7705–8214) followed byAshbya gossypii TEF2 terminator, which is derived from thekanMX cassette (22Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Following the insertion of a T7 epitope-encoding sequence by an inverse PCR-mediated procedure to C-terminally tag GCN1, the plasmid was linearized and transformed into MB758-5B and JBZ1 to obtain the strains JBZ2 (MAT a ura3 GCN1-T7::URA3) and JBZ3 (MAT a ura3 gcn1-F2291L-T7::URA3), respectively. These strains were spotted onto agar plates of SC−Ura or SC−Ura−His plus 20 mm 3AT as described previously (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The p180 reporter construct is a low copy number plasmid, which encodes an mRNA bearing the GCN4-lacZ fusion ORF preceded by the entire 5′ leader region of GCN4 mRNA containing four upstream ORFs to monitor the translational derepression (23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This plasmid was introduced into MB758-5B, JBZ1, JBY4, and JBY5 cells, and the transformants were grown to midlogarithmic phase and shifted to SC or synthetic dextrose (SD) medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) containing 10 or 20 mm3AT. Following the incubation at 30 °C for 3 h, cells were collected and subjected to β-galactosidase assay as described previously (18Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The yeast JBY2, JBY3, JBZ2, and JBZ3 cells were grown to midlogarithmic phase and shifted to YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.004% adenine sulfate, 2% glucose) or SD medium supplemented with 10 or 20 mm 3AT. Following incubation at 30 °C for 4 h, ∼107 cells were collected, resuspended in 1.0 ml of distilled H2O, and broken by the addition of 150 μl of breaking buffer (2 m NaOH, 2 mβ-mecaptoethanol). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the lysate was neutralized by the addition of 130 μl of 60% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g and washed twice with 700 μl of acetone. Protein extract equivalent to 106 cells was subjected to each lane of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked by PBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% nonfat dry milk). Phosphorylated eIF2α was visualized by using PBS-T containing an antibody that specifically recognizes eIF2α phosphorylated at serine 51 (BIO-SOURCE). We previously showed that the characteristic GI domain (aa 1–125) occurring at the N-terminal extremity of GCN2 directly binds to GCN1 (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Others also demonstrated that GCN2 interacts with GCN1 via its N-terminal 272-aa region, which contains the GI domain followed by an acidic region (16Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar). To delimit the minimal essential region to interact with GCN1, we prepared a series of truncated mutants for the N-terminal region of GCN2 and tested them for binding with GCN1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. All of the mutants bearing intact GI domain (aa 1–125) showed two-hybrid interactions with GCN1 (Fig.1). The yeast cells with the longest GCN2 hybrid protein (aa 1–598), which includes the GI domain, acidic region, and degenerate protein kinase domain (ψPK), showed higher β-galactosidase activity than those lacking ψPK (aa 1–272). Although many factors affecting two-hybrid interactions, including intracellular level of hybrid proteins and efficiency of nuclear transport, make it difficult to evaluate strength of binding by this method, the result described above is in accordance with the one obtained using an in vitro pull-down binding assay (16Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar). Notably, removal of the acidic region did not diminish β-galactosidase activity any more, and we failed to detect any evidence for this region to bind GCN1 (Fig. 1). In contrast, further deletion from either end of the GI domain (aa 1–125) completely abolished the interaction (Fig. 1). We had also shown that substitution of conserved residues in the GI domain abrogated the interaction (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the GI domain itself serves as the minimal essential region for the binding to GCN1 and that the acidic region has little if any role in the interaction. Two-hybrid screening using the GI domain as bait had revealed the C-terminal portion (aa 1925–2552) of GCN1 as its binding partner. This is coincident with the results recently reported by others, which identified the region spanning aa 2052–2428 as the sole GCN2-binding region of GCN1 (24Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To pinpoint the minimal binding region, we prepared variously truncated fragments around this region using PCR and tested their binding to the GI domain using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.2). Two-hybrid interactions were examined for growth on the medium lacking adenine and histidine. The segment spanning aa 2064–2382 of GCN1 supported the growth as efficiently as those by longer constructs when expressed as a DNA-binding domain fusion. However, we failed to detect the interaction in the opposite orientation for unknown reason. Further deletion either from its N- or C-terminal end completely abolished the interaction (Fig. 2). From these results, we concluded that the region spanning amino acids 2064–2382 is sufficient for binding to the GI domain of GCN2. We next intended to isolate gcn1 mutants defective in association with GCN2, because they would highlight critical residues for the recognition of the GI domain and because they can be used to examine the role of this interaction. For this purpose, we used a PCR-based random mutagenesis. However, since we had already pinpointed the minimal essential GCN1 region for GCN2 binding, we do not need nonsense mutations to truncate the protein anymore. To selectively obtain missense mutants, we developed a novel strategy described below (Fig. 3 A). We first modified the pGAD-GCN1-(2048–2382) plasmid so that the GAL4 AD-GCN1 fusion protein is further tailed with the PCCR of CDC24 (18Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which specifically interacts with the PB1 domain occurring at the C-terminal end of BEM1.2 Following random mutagenesis to GCN1 by error-prone PCR, clones were selected for two-hybrid interaction with the PB1 domain, which guarantees that the hybrid protein retains the C-terminal PCCR and hence is not truncated within the GCN1 portion. From these untruncated populations, clones incapable of interacting with GCN2 were identified using the reverse two-hybrid selection based on URA3 reporter gene and 5FOA (25Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Notably, this screening may be useful not only for the elimination of truncated proteins but also for the identification of those with missense mutations leading to protein instability, because such clones display weaker two-hybrid signals than the wild-type parental clone. In practice, we used a dual bait two-hybrid system to perform both selections simultaneously. We prepared a mutagenized GAL4 AD-GCN1-PCCR library in PJ69–4AΔ (MAT a). These cells were then mated with Mavχ (MATα) cells that bear two plasmids expressing GAL4 DNA-binding domain-GCN2 hybrid protein and LexA-PB1 hybrid protein. Note that the genome of Mavχ has URA3 andHIS3 reporter genes driven by GAL4 and LexA, respectively (Table I). The diploid cells formed by the mating were selected for resistance to both 3AT and 5FOA. The resistance to 3AT indicates that the HIS3 reporter gene is induced and that an interaction is occurred between the GCN1-hybrid protein and the PB1 domain. On the other hand, 5FOA resistance is an indicative of failed induction ofURA3 or impaired association of the GCN1-hybrid protein with GCN2. From the clones displaying resistance to both 3AT and 5FOA, we identified three single amino acid substitutions, namely F2291L, S2304P, and L2353P. While showing two-hybrid interactions with the PB1 domain comparable with that of the parental clone, these threegcn1 single point mutants all failed to interact with GCN2 (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the mutations affect the ability of GCN1 to interact with GCN2 but not the stability of hybrid proteins (see below). We also identified seven mutants, each bearing two amino acid substitutions, namely (L2303S,V2329D), (F2291S,V2376A), (K2317R,L2319P), (S2304P,L2356S), (F2291I,T2307N), (F2281L, Q2294R) and (F2299A,R2328D). Although we did not determine which of the two is critical for binding, it is intriguing to note that all of these mutations occurred in the C- terminal half of the pinpointed GCN1 segment, as do those in the three single point mutants (Fig. 4). To examine the role of GCN1-GCN2 interaction, we intended to generate a yeast strain bearing GCN1 incapable of interacting with GCN2. For this purpose, we chose F2291L substitution, because it occurs within a cluster of identically conserved amino acid residues among GCN1 from various species (Fig. 4). We also tagged GCN1 in this mutant and its parental strain with the T7-epitope at their C-terminal ends to facilitate detection by anti-T7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, comparable amounts of GCN1 were detected in wild type andgcn1-F2291L cells, thereby demonstrating that the mutation does not destabilize the full-length protein in vivo. We then examined these cells for sensitivity to 3AT, which is an inhibitor of HIS3, a typical GCN4 target, and has been used as an indicator of general control response. The mutant cells displayed remarkably higher 3AT-sensitivity than the parental strain (Fig. 5 B). A similar phenotype was reported for yeast cells bearing thegcn2-Y74A allele, which encodes GCN2 defective in interaction with GCN1 (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction between GCN1 and GCN2 is necessary for general control of amino acid synthesis. The Gcn− phenotype described above suggests that the derepression of GCN4translation is impaired in both gcn1-F2291L andgcn2-Y74A mutants. We thus examined the translation ofGCN4 mRNA using a reporter construct bearinglacZ preceded by the characteristic GCN4 leader region, which is responsible for the derepression (23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The wild-type cells showed a remarkable induction of β-galactosidase activity under starved or derepressed conditions (Fig.6). In contrast, the induction was severely impaired in both gcn1-F2291L andgcn2-Y74A cells (Fig. 6). Thus, the interaction between GCN1 and GCN2 is required for efficient derepression of GCN4translation under amino acid-starved conditions. Finally, we intended to determine whether the eIF2α kinase is activated in these mutants upon amino acid starvation, because GCN2-independent mechanisms to derepressGCN4 translation are also possible (9Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2161-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 26Anderson J.

The phosphorylated eIF2α in mutants and their parental strains were examined under rich or poor conditions using an antibody specific to eIF2α phosphorylated at Ser-51. While phosphorylated eIF2α was barely detected under rich or repressed conditions, substantial phosphorylation of eIF2α was readily observed in the wild-type cells subjected to amino acid starvation (Fig.7). In contrast, the induction of the phosphorylation was substantially impaired in the cells bearinggcn1-F2291L or gcn2-Y74A compared with their respective parental strains, although residual levels of phosphorylation were detected (Fig. 7). Since GCN2 is the sole eIF2α kinase in the budding yeast, these results indicate that the interaction with GCN1 is necessary for the GCN2 to be fully activated in amino acid-starved cells. GCN1 is required for the activation of GCN2 in the budding yeast under amino acid starvation; deletion or mutations of GCN1 were reported to abolish phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is mediated by the sole eIF2α kinase GCN2 (12Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chalraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It had, however, remained totally unknown how GCN1 activates GCN2 until we and others provided evidence for their direct association and its requirement for a general control response (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the minimal essential regions for GCN1-GCN2 association and demonstrated, for the first time, that the interaction is critical to the activation of GCN2 itself, which leads to the selective derepression of GCN4translation and subsequent general control response. The minimal essential region of GCN2 to interact with GCN1 was mapped to its N-terminal 125 residues (Fig. 1), which we had designated as the GI domain (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 272 residues involving the GI domain followed by an acidic region were reported necessary for the interaction by others (16Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar). However, our data shown here and in a previous report (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) clearly indicate that the GI domain per se, but not the acidic region, serves as the core for the binding. As pointed out previously (15Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the GI domain is found in various proteins other than GCN2. They include Impact (a product of an evolutionarily conserved gene that is genetically imprinted in mice) (29Hagiwara Y. Hirai M. Nishiyama K. Kanazawa I. Ueda T. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), YDR152W (a yeast hypothetical protein), YLR419W (a member of the DEAH-box RNA helicase family), and so forth. It remains to be elucidated whether these GI domains also function in protein binding. We also found that amino acid residues 2064–2382 comprise the minimal essential region of GCN1 to recognize the GI domain of GCN2 (Fig. 2). In accordance with this result, the segment spanning residues 2052–2428 of GCN1 was recently reported responsible for binding to GCN2 (24Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to GCN2, the primary sequence of the GI domain-binding region of GCN1 lacks any apparently characteristic feature (Fig. 4). We thus took a random mutagenesis approach to identify critical residues for the recognition of GI domain. For this purpose, we developed a unique dual bait two-hybrid strategy, which allows one to selectively identify missense mutations leading to defective interaction (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, this strategy would be also useful to eliminate mutants encoding unstable proteins, which can be identified as clones with weaker interaction between the C-terminally attached domain and its binding partner (i.e.PCCR and PB1). Therefore, it provides a versatile tool for fine analysis of protein-protein interactions. Using this strategy, we have so far identified three single amino acid substitutions, namely F2291L, S2304P, and L2353P, each of which abolishes interaction between GCN1 and GCN2 (Fig. 3 B). Others reported that GCN1(R2259A) also fails to associate with GCN2 (24Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, all of these mutations occur in the C-terminal half of the GCN2-binding region. In addition, 14 amino acid substitutions in the seven mutants that we identified as bearing two mutations were also mapped to this portion (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the C-terminal half functions as the interaction surface with the GI domain. The apparent lack of N-terminal mutants may indicate that the N-terminal half is not involved in target recognition and rather plays a role in structural integrity of the domain. Then, most mutations in this region lead to disordered and unstable proteins and hence would be excluded by our screening strategy as discussed above. More exhaustive screening to fully uncover the important residues is necessary to obtain deeper insight into the mechanism for recognition of the GI domain. It would also be informative to compare the sequence of GCN1 with those of the binding partners for other GI domains, which remain to be identified. We and others showed that yeast cells defective in GCN1-GCN2 interaction display 3AT-sensitive growth, indicative of impaired induction of HIS3, which is under the regulation of the transcription factor GCN4 (15Kubota H.

Indeed, the derepression of GCN4 translation was impaired in these mutants (Fig. 6). However, note that the derepression of GCN4 translation is not always caused by the activation of GCN2. Mutations in subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B can mimic the effect of phosphorylation of eIF2α as exemplified by several GCD genes (9Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2161-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The reduction in amounts (10Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2161-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar) or impaired base modification (26Anderson J. Phan L.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3650-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) of initiator tRNA also induces a similar phenotype. Other studies demonstrated that GCN2-independent derepression of GCN4 translation is elicited by overexpression of NME1 (27Tavernarakis N. Alexandraki D. Liodis P. Tzamarias D. Thireos G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 179: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), encoding the RNA component of RNase MRP (34Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or PUS4, encoding the tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase (28Qiu H. Hu C. Anderson J. Björk G.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2505-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We thus directly examined the phosphorylation of eIF2α in these mutants and demonstrated its considerable impairment (Fig. 7); the Gcn− phenotype of mutants defective in GCN1-GCN2 interaction is associated with impaired phosphorylation of eIF2α. Therefore, these mutants fail to fully activate GCN2, because it is the sole eIF2α kinase of the budding yeast. Residual phosphorylation of eIF2α in these mutants (Fig. 7) indicates that weakened GCN1-GCN2 interactions can still support minimal activation of the kinase. Notably, GCN1 and GCN2 are anchored onto ribosome through their respective ribosome-binding domains (14Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chalraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), presumably, in such close proximity that they can interact. It is thus conceivable that the two proteins occasionally take a configuration leading to activation of the kinase although the interaction is considerably impaired by the mutations. In this context, it is intriguing to note that overexpression of GCN2 can suppress the Gcn− phenotype of gcn1-R2259A, also defective in binding to GCN2, but not that of gcn1-ΔD, which encodes GCN1 totally lacking the GCN2-binding region (24Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we conclude that the GI domain-mediated association of GCN2 to GCN1 is necessary for the full activation of GCN2 kinase in vivo upon amino acid starvation and hence for efficient derepression of GCN4 translation, leading to general control response.

Although SNAP-23 has been shown to participate in a variety of intracellular transport processes, the structural domains of SNAP-23 that are required for its interaction with other SNAREs have not been determined. By employing deletion mutagenesis we found that deletion of the amino-terminal 18 amino acids of SNAP-23 (encoded in the first exon) dramatically inhibited binding of SNAP-23 to both the target SNARE syntaxin and the vesicle SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP). By contrast, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids (encoded in the last exon) of SNAP-23 does not affect SNAP-23 binding to syntaxin but profoundly inhibits its binding to VAMP. To determine the functional relevance of the modular structure of SNAP-23, we overexpressed SNAP-23 in cells possessing the capacity to undergo regulated exocytosis. Expression of human SNAP-23 in a rat mast cell line significantly enhanced exocytosis, and this effect was not observed in transfectants expressing the carboxyl-terminal VAMP-binding mutant of SNAP-23. Despite considerable amino acid identity, we found that human SNAP-23 bound to SNAREs more efficiently than did rat SNAP-23. These data demonstrate that the introduction of a “better” SNARE binder into secretory cells augments exocytosis and defines the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 as an essential regulator of exocytosis in mast cells.

Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). One key set of proteins that regulate these diverse biological processes are called SNAREs.1 SNARE proteins are present on both vesicle membranes (vesicle SNAREs, or v-SNAREs) and on target membranes (target SNAREs, or t-SNAREs). The v-SNAREs include proteins of the VAMP family, whereas t-SNAREs include proteins of the syntaxin and SNAP-25 families. The neuronal SNAREs include syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and VAMP 2, and these proteins readily associate with one another to form a stable ternary complex that is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The neuronal SNARE complex is composed of a parallel four-helical bundle of coiled-coils (3Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1A and VAMP 2 (tethered to opposing membranes) each contain one coiled-coil domain, and SNAP-25 contains two coiled-coil domains, one at its amino terminus and one at its carboxyl terminus (5Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By employing deletion analysis, several groups have analyzed the domains of the neuronal SNAREs that are essential for efficient SNARE complex assembly (5Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while the major syntaxin binding region is present in the first coiled-coil (5Chapman E.R. An S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, proteolysis of SNAP-25 by Botulinum neurotoxins that remove the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25 does not alter its binding to syntaxin but dramatically inhibits its binding to VAMP 2 (6Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar).

(Paris). 1994; 88: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), highlighting the functional importance of the carboxyl-terminal region of SNAP-25 to VAMP binding. Two non-neuronal homologs of SNAP-25 have been identified, and they have been named SNAP-23 (Refs. 9Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol.

These isoforms exhibit a significant similarity at the protein level with SNAP-25, and each possesses the two coiled-coils necessary for the formation of SNARE complexes. The role of SNAP-29 is still unresolved, with one study suggesting that it plays a role primarily in intra-Golgi traffic (13Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Griffiths G. Lowe S.L. Subramaniam V.N. Seow K.T. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and another suggesting that SNAP-29 regulates a variety of intracellular traffic events (12Steegmaier M. Yang B.

On the other hand, SNAP-23 is thought to play a role both in regulated and constitutive protein trafficking pathways in non-neuronal cells. For example, SNAP-23 is involved in diverse protein trafficking events such as GLUT4 trafficking in adipose cells (14Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17732-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because of its wide tissue distribution, its ability to interact with several syntaxin and VAMP isoforms, and the aforementioned functional data, SNAP-23 is likely to be a key player in many distinct protein trafficking events in non-neuronal cells. Both SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 are thought to function primarily as t-SNARE heterodimers together with syntaxin (20Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, the ability of SNAP-23 to replace SNAP-25 in regulated exocytosis is limited (22Sadoul K. Berger A. Niemann H. Weller U. Roche P.A. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33023-33027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A systematic analysis of the domains of SNAP-23 that are required for its binding to syntaxin and VAMP could allow the identification of SNAP-23 mutants that could alter intracellular granule-plasma membrane fusion events in distinct cell types in vivo. In this study, we have characterized the interaction of SNAP-23 with syntaxin 4 and VAMP 2. These SNARE isoforms were chosen because complexes containing these proteins with SNAP-23 are common in exocytic events in non-neuronal cells (23Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24St-Denis J.F. Cabaniols J.P. Cushman S.W. Roche P.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Truncation analyses revealed that while the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of SNAP-23 are not required for SNAP-23 binding to syntaxin, they are essential for SNAP-23 binding to VAMP in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type human SNAP-23 in rat mast cells resulted in enhanced exocytosis from the cells, and this effect was completely abolished in mast cells expressing a human SNAP-23 carboxyl-terminal VAMP-binding mutant. Thus, these data demonstrate that SNAP-23 mutants that bind to syntaxin but not to VAMP are unable to support exocytosis from rat mast cells and point to the SNAP-23 carboxyl terminus as an important regulator of exocytosis. cDNAs encoding full-length human SNAP-23 (9Ravichandran V.

Gene. 1994; 143: 303-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged rat VAMP 2 in pRc-CMV was the gift of Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University). GST-syntaxin and GST-VAMP fusion proteins were generated by standard cloning and expression strategies in Escherichia coli (9Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturers instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deletion mutants of SNAP-23 in pcDNA3 were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using mutant oligonucleotide primers encoding stop codons. The sequence of all mutants was verified by automated DNA sequence analysis. Radiolabeled proteins were generated by in vitro translation reactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine using the T7 Quick in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega). For in vitro binding studies, GST alone, GST-syntaxin 4, or GST-VAMP 2 (10 μg each) were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads and were mixed with in vitrotranslated wild-type or mutant proteins in a final volume of 200 μl of binding buffer (4 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. All incubations contained nearly identical amounts of in vitro translated material, and total amount of rabbit reticulocyte lysate in all tubes was kept constant by adding aliquots from a mock translation mixture. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) and the resulting pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (27Anderson H.A. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4850-4858PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize protein bands and impregnated with Enlightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for fluorography. The gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and the intensity of each band was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using a Molecular Dynamics model HHF PhosphorImager. Anti-peptide rabbit antisera recognizing the amino terminus of human SNAP-23 have been described previously (25Low S.H. Roche P.A. Anderson H.A. van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Zhang M. Mostov K.E. Weimbs T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3422-3430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A broadly reactive SNAP-23 antisera was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified, recombinant human His6-SNAP-23 fusion protein. To ensure that these antibodies reacted equally well with SNAP-23 truncation mutants, we analyzed in vitro translated wild-type or mutant proteins by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses. These studies confirmed that the introduction of these mutations did not alter the immunogenicity of the various constructs used in this study. The SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody was from Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc. (Baltimore, MD), the syntaxin 4 monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Labs, and the FLAG-epitope monoclonal antibody M5 was from Sigma. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates or immunoprecipitation from cell lysates was performed as previously described (27Anderson H.A. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4850-4858PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations from cell extracts, cells were briefly washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed at 4 °C with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 5 mm iodoacetamide). The lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the cleared lysates were used for immunoprecipitation reactions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting or fluorography (as indicated). In some cases the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to confirm that samples contained similar amounts of GST fusion proteins. Subconfluent HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAmine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transfected HeLa cells were generally analyzed 18–24 h after transfection. The rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 was maintained as adherent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RBL cells (5 × 106/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum were transfected by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad) using 10 μg of empty vector, 10 μg of wild-type human SNAP-23 in pcDNA3, or 10 μg of human SNAP-23-(1–188) in pcDNA3. Dilutions of cells were immediately replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum and allowed to recover overnight. G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the cultures, and stable transfectants were selected within 7 days by picking individual colonies with a sterile pipette tip. Stable transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum containing 0.25 mg/ml G418. Exocytosis in the RBL-2H3 mast cells was triggered using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. RBL cells (1 × 106) were washed with RPMI (without phenol red), and degranulation was induced by adding phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nm) and ionomycin (1 μm) in a final volume of 1.5 ml. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, aliquots of the medium were withdrawn at various times, and β-hexosaminidase activity released into the medium was measured. Mock degranulation studies were carried out in parallel using vehicle in medium alone. At the end of the assay, cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in RPMI to measure residual cell-associated β-hexosaminidase. To determine β-hexosaminidase activity, aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatants and cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of the substrate solution (1.3 mg/ml ofp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (Sigma) in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 m NaOH/0.2 m glycine. Absorbance was read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader, and the amount of exocytosis was expressed as the percentage of total β-hexosaminidase activity present in cells. SNAP-23 is known to be an important participant in the formation of the SNARE complex that leads to membrane-membrane fusion. In our attempt to identify the regions of SNAP-23 that are essential for its function, we set out to identify the domains of SNAP-23 that are essential for its ability to form binary SNARE complexes. We have recently cloned the entire SNAP-23 gene (28Vaidyanathan V.V. Roche P.A. Gene. 2000; 247: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and because distinct exons often encode functional domains in proteins, we generated a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of human SNAP-23 based on the exon structure of SNAP-23 (Fig.1A). These mutants correspond to deletions of the first coding exon (SNAP-23-(19–211)), the first and second coding exon (SNAP-23-(33–211)), the first four coding exons (including the first coiled-coil domain, SNAP-23-(76–211)), the last coding exon (SNAP-23-(1–188)), and the last two coding exons (SNAP-23-(1–140)). In vitro binding assays revealed that deletion of 18 amino acids from the amino terminus of SNAP-23 (SNAP-23-(19–211)) reduced the ability of SNAP-23 to bind to GST-VAMP 2 by 60% (Fig.1B). Deletion of an additional 14 residues from the amino terminus (SNAP-23-(33–211)) eliminated binding of SNAP-23 to VAMP 2, establishing the presence of a VAMP 2 binding region at the extreme amino terminus of SNAP-23. We also examined carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of SNAP-23 using in vitro binding assays. A deletion mutant lacking the last 23 amino acids of SNAP-23 (SNAP-23-(1–188)) bound very poorly to GST-VAMP 2 (12% binding as compared with wild-type SNAP-23), and further truncations that removed the entire second coiled-coil domain (SNAP-23-(1–140)) completely eliminated the binding of SNAP-23 to VAMP 2. After observing that the integrity of the extreme amino-and carboxyl-terminal regions of SNAP-23 contributed to its binding to VAMP 2, we examined the importance of these regions in the interaction of SNAP-23 with syntaxin 4. As was seen in the binding assays with VAMP 2, deletion of 18 amino acids from the amino terminus of SNAP-23 almost completely eliminated binding to GST-syntaxin 4 (Fig. 1C). However, unlike the results obtained with VAMP 2, deletion of 23 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 did not inhibit its ability to bind syntaxin 4. Removal of the entire second coiled-coil domain of SNAP-23 (SNAP-23-(1–140)) completely prevented the binding of SNAP-23 to syntaxin. Control experiments confirmed that each reaction condition contained similar amounts of SNAP-23 protein (Fig. 1D). These data reveal that the first 18 amino acids of SNAP-23 harbor a major binding site for both syntaxin and VAMP, that the presence of the first coiled-coil alone is insufficient to allow SNAP-23 binding to syntaxin and VAMP, and that the extreme carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 is not required for the binding of SNAP-23 to syntaxin 4 but is essential for the binding of SNAP-23 to VAMP 2. To confirm and extend the results obtained from our in vitro binding studies, we examined the binding characteristics of wild-type SNAP-23 or SNAP-23-(1–188) to syntaxin and VAMP in transfected HeLa cells. In agreement with results obtained in ourin vitro binding assays, the association of VAMP 2 with SNAP-23-(1–188) was significantly reduced as compared with the association of VAMP 2 with wild-type SNAP-23 (Fig.2A). Immunoblotting of the cell extracts confirmed that the expression of wild-type SNAP-23-(1–211) and SNAP-23-(1–188) was similar in the various transfectants and that transfection did not alter the amount of VAMP 2 or syntaxin 4 expressed in the cells. Quantitation of various immunoblots revealed that truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of SNAP-23 inhibited its binding to VAMP 2 by 65%. Cotransfection experiments examining SNAP-23/syntaxin 4 interactions demonstrated that the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23-(1–188) was as good as that observed with wild-type SNAP-23 (Fig. 2B). When the binding properties of the other SNAP-23 truncation mutants were analyzed in vivo the results were similar to those obtained in our in vitro binding studies (data not shown). Therefore, our binding data obtained using recombinant SNARE proteins is in excellent agreement with our in vivo binding data in transfected cells and clearly demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of SNAP-23 is important for binding to VAMP but not to syntaxin. In an attempt to confirm the importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain of SNAP-23 in a functional exocytosis assay, we overexpressed wild-type SNAP-23-(1–211) and the SNAP-23-(1–188) mutant in the RBL mast cell line and isolated stable transfectants. We chose to express human SNAP-23 in these cells since we have an antibody that specifically recognizes the human SNAP-23 amino terminus, and immunoblot analysis of cell lysates confirmed that wild-type SNAP-23-(1–211) and the SNAP-23-(1–188) mutant were expressed at similar levels in these clones (Fig.3A). Immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes both human and rat SNAP-23 revealed that the amount of human SNAP-23 expressed in these cells was low because the total amounts of SNAP-23 present in mock-transfected and human SNAP-23-transfected RBL cells were similar, and the expression of human SNAP-23-(1–188) can only be seen in long exposures of the immunoblot (Fig. 3A). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated that wild-type SNAP-23 and SNAP-23-(1–188) were expressed primarily on the plasma membrane of these RBL clones (Fig.3B). This agrees with the localization of endogenous SNAP-23 in rat peritoneal mast cells (16Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and in RBL cells (our data not shown and Ref. 29Paumet F. Le Mao J. Martin S. Galli T. David B. Blank U. Roa M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5850-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The low level of SNAP-23 expression was observed in several independent clones, and we never obtained clones expressing large amounts of human SNAP-23. RBL mast cell exocytosis can be triggered by cross-linking high affinity receptors for IgE or by direct stimulation with phorbol esters and ionomycin. Despite the low level of expression of human SNAP-23 in the RBL transfectants, cells expressing wild-type human SNAP-23-(1–211) were capable of increased exocytosis when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig.4A) and untransfected RBL cells (data not shown). In the absence of these agents there was no detectable degranulation from these cells (data not shown). The increase in exocytosis was apparent even at the earliest time points examined, demonstrating that in addition to increasing the absolute amount of exocytosis, overexpression of human SNAP-23 led to an increase in the rate of exocytosis of rat mast cells. Unlike cells expressing wild-type human SNAP-23, cells expressing the human SNAP-23 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant SNAP-23-(1–188) showed no increase in exocytosis as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig.4B). These data demonstrate that the elevated levels of exocytosis from mast cells overexpressing human SNAP-23 were indeed a consequence of expression of wild-type human SNAP-23 protein and demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal VAMP-binding domain of human SNAP-23 is important for its function in regulated exocytosis in mast cells. We were intrigued by our data showing that expression of small amounts of human SNAP-23 in mast cells that already express significant amounts of SNAP-23 was able to significantly augment exocytosis, and we set out to identify a molecular mechanism for this effect. Because SNARE complex assembly is essential for exocytosis, we compared the ability of rat SNAP-23 and human SNAP-23 to bind to syntaxin 4 and VAMP 2 using in vitro binding assays. Rat and mouse SNAP-23 (which are 98% identical) bound syntaxin 4 poorly and their binding to VAMP 2 was almost undetectable (Fig.5). The binding of human SNAP-23 to these SNAREs was considerably better, and the binding of SNAP-25 to each of these GST-SNARE fusion proteins was very efficient. It is important to note that in these binding assays nearly identical amounts of in vitro translated SNAP-23 or SNAP-25 were used, allowing a direct comparison between the binding of these different SNAP-23 family members to GST-SNARE fusion proteins. Data from multiple differentin vitro binding assays were compared and show quantitatively that human SNAP-23 binds to syntaxin 4 and VAMP 2 much better than does rat SNAP-23 (Fig. 6). This is in good agreement with a yeast two-hybrid analysis showing that human SNAP-23 bound to syntaxin 4 ∼10 times better than did mouse SNAP-23 and that SNAP-25 bound to many different syntaxins very well whereas SNAP-23 did not (11Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in exocytosis from rat mast cells can be explained in part by the expression of a better SNARE binding form of SNAP-23 in these cells.Figure 6Human SNAP-23 binds to SNAREs better than does rat SNAP-23. The binding of in vitro translated rat SNAP-23, human SNAP-23, or SNAP-25 to GST-syntaxin 4 or GST-VAMP 2 fusion proteins was quantitated by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis and is expressed as a percentage of the total input radioactivity. The data represent the average ± S.E. from samples analyzed in triplicate from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Assembly and disassembly of SNARE complexes and their role in exocytosis has been studied in several systems (1Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Formation of a core complex consisting of SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP is a central event in steps leading to membrane fusion, and the biogenesis of the neuronal SNARE complex has been studied in detail (2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). SNAP-23 is considered to be the functional homolog of SNAP-25 in non-neuronal cells and participates in a variety of constitutive and regulated exocytotic events (14Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S.

Furthermore, these two proteins are the products of an ancestral gene duplication event and share significant amino acid identity (9Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J.

Despite this, sequence determinants that regulate the assembly of non-neuronal SNARE complexes are poorly understood. In this study we have investigated the interactions of the ubiquitously expressed SNAP-25 homolog SNAP-23 with both syntaxin 4 and VAMP 2. We have chosen these particular SNAREs for analysis because they have been shown to be physiologically relevant partners for SNAP-23 in living cells (23Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24St-Denis J.F. Cabaniols J.P. Cushman S.W. Roche P.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By truncation analysis we have identified a major syntaxin and VAMP binding domain within the first coding exon of SNAP-23 (amino acids 1–19). It is unlikely that the failure ofin vitro translated SNAP-23-(19–211) to bind to GST-SNARE fusion proteins is due to a misfolding of the protein since even GST-SNAP-23-(19–211) fusion proteins did not bind to in vitro translated SNAREs and SNAP-23-(19–211) expressed in HeLa cells did not bind to SNAREs in vivo 2V. V. Vaidyanathan, N. Puri, and P. A. Roche, unpublished observations. . Furthermore, even full-length SNAP-25 does not have appreciable secondary structure until it binds to syntaxin (7Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that syntaxin binding actually assists in the folding of a relatively unfolded SNAP-25 molecule. In addition to identifying a SNARE-binding motif in the extreme amino terminus of SNAP-23, a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant that possessed only the first coiled-coil domain of SNAP-23 did not bind to either syntaxin or VAMP, demonstrating that although the extreme amino terminus of SNAP-23 is necessary for SNARE binding it is not sufficient. The amino terminus of SNAP-25 is known to possess a syntaxin binding site; however, carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of SNAP-25 that contain only the amino-terminal coiled domain of the protein (e.g. SNAP-25-(2–141) and SNAP-25-(1–100)) still retain syntaxin binding activity (5Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This could reflect the fact that there are 12 heptad repeats in the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of SNAP-25 and only six in the corresponding region of SNAP-23, thereby limiting the affinity of the SNAP-23 amino-terminal coiled-coil for syntaxin. We have also identified the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of SNAP-23 as important determinants for binding to VAMP but not to syntaxin. This is in very good agreement with previous studies examining the behavior of SNAP-25 deletion mutants (5Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the effects of Botulinum neurotoxin cleavage of SNAP-25 on its SNARE-binding properties (6Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). To test the functional importance of the SNAP-23 carboxyl-terminal VAMP-binding domain in vivo, we generated rat mast cell lines overexpressing wild-type human SNAP-23 and the human SNAP-23-(1–188) carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant. Despite the fact that the total amount of SNAP-23 was minimally altered in these transfectants, expression of human SNAP-23 significantly enhanced exocytosis from these cells. Furthermore, the observed increase in exocytosis required the presence of the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of SNAP-23 as the human SNAP-23-(1–188) mutant was unable to support enhanced exocytosis in rat mast cells. This finding is in very good agreement with data showing that treatment of permeabilized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with Botulinum neurotoxin E, which cleaves ∼20 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of canine SNAP-23, dramatically inhibits transferrin receptor recycling (19Leung S.M. Chen D. DasGupta B.R. Whiteheart S.W. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17732-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and apical and basolateral membrane traffic (17Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Wimmer C. Whiteheart S.W. Komuves L.G. Mostov K.E. Weimbs T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These data highlight the importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain of SNAP-23 (encoded by the last exon) in the binding to VAMP 2 and regulating exocytosis. Despite the similarity in structure and proposed similarity in function for SNAP-23 and SNAP-25, we and others (11Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) found that SNAP-23 bound to various syntaxins and VAMP 2 much more poorly than did SNAP-25 in vitro. This result is unlikely to be due to our assay system as similar results were obtained in experiments examining the binding ofin vitro translated SNAP-23 or SNAP-25 to GST-syntaxin and GST-VAMP fusion proteins and in experiments examining the binding ofin vitro translated syntaxins to GST-SNAP-23 and GST-SNAP-25 fusion proteins. 3K. Vogel and P. A. Roche, unpublished observations. In addition, these observations are in excellent agreement with our earlier in vivo experiments demonstrating that SNAP-25 was able to bind to syntaxin more effectively than was SNAP-23 in transfected HeLa cells (30Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we also found that human SNAP-23 bound to syntaxin and VAMP 2 better than did rat or mouse SNAP-23, demonstrating that among the SNAP-23 family of proteins there are dramatic differences in SNARE binding ability. It is currently unknown if these differences alone can account for enhanced exocytosis in human SNAP-23-expressing rat mast cells or whether additional features of human SNAP-23 can augment exocytosis in rat cells. Pancreatic β-cells possess SNAP-25, and it has been shown that SNAP-25 is involved in insulin secretion from these cells (31Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Interestingly, under conditions in which SNAP-25 is cleaved by Botulinum neurotoxin E and exocytosis is diminished, human SNAP-23 (which is not cleaved by this toxin) can rescue exocytosis only if it is expressed at extraordinarily high levels (22Sadoul K. Berger A. Niemann H. Weller U. Roche P.A. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33023-33027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In light of our current work, we interpret this result by proposing that replacement of SNAP-25 (an excellent SNARE-binder) by human SNAP-23 (a moderate SNARE-binder) would require very large amounts of human SNAP-23. On the other hand, enhancing exocytosis from mast cells that use rat SNAP-23 (a poor SNARE-binder) by introducing human SNAP-23 (a moderate SNARE-binder) would require only small amounts of human SNAP-23. Our data presented here, together with the functional results of Sadoulet al. (22Sadoul K. Berger A. Niemann H. Weller U. Roche P.A. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33023-33027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) are in very good agreement with this hypothesis. Although we had hoped to overexpress the excellent SNARE-binder SNAP-25 in rat mast cells, we were unable to isolate healthy RBL transfectants expressing significant amounts of SNAP-25. This could be due to toxicity of overexpressed SNAP-25 in these cells, and in agreement with this we were also unable to isolate stable RBL transfectants expressing very large amounts of human SNAP-23. We conclude from these studies that the efficiency of exocytosis is regulated in part by the ability of SNARE complexes to form in living cells since compensation for a loss of SNAP-25 requires expression of large amounts of human SNAP-23 and expression of even small amounts of human SNAP-23 can potentiate secretory processes in cells possessing rat SNAP-23. The carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 has previously been implicated in GLUT4 trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Microinjection of a carboxyl-terminal peptide of SNAP-23 into 3T3-L1 cells inhibited GLUT4 trafficking (14Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this peptide inhibited translocation was not explored. In a related study, infection of 3T3-L1 cells with a recombinant virus encoding mouse SNAP-23-(1–202) also inhibited GLUT4 trafficking (15Kawanishi M. Tamori Y. Okazawa H. Araki S. Shinoda H. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), yet in this study even wild-type SNAP-23 inhibited GLUT4 trafficking. Our study is the first to reveal that the introduction of human SNAP-23 into regulated secretory cells actually augments exocytosis, that this form of (human) SNAP-23 binds to SNARE proteins better than endogenous (rat) SNAP-23, and that the increase in exocytosis can be directly attributed to the integrity of the carboxyl-terminal VAMP-binding domain of SNAP-23. These data also highlight the similarities between the mechanism of GLUT4 translocation in fat cells and granule exocytosis in mast cells. Besides the current work, several studies have shown a direct relationship between SNARE complex assembly and fusion. In the neuroendocrine PC12 cell line Ca2+ was found to enhance SNARE complex assembly and subsequently drive membrane fusion (32Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Studies in adrenal chromaffin cells have suggested thattrans-SNARE complexes (i.e. complexes of v-SNAREs with t-SNAREs from opposing membranes) exist in two interconvertible states: a “tight” state that mediates the fast component of release and a “loose” state that mediates a sustained slow phase (33Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, in general, the kinetics of non-neuronal exocytosis are far slower than neuronal exocytosis. Because non-neuronal exocytosis involves SNARE complexes containing SNAP-23 and not SNAP-25, it is possible that at least one contributing factor to the diminished kinetics of exocytosis in non-neuronal cells is the presence of the “weak” SNARE SNAP-23 in secretorytrans-SNARE complexes. We thank Dr. Richard Scheller for the gift of various SNARE expression vectors, Dr. Elizabeth Hiltbold for assistance with confocal microscopy, Dr. Shashi Srivastava for statistical analysis, David Winkler for oligonucleotide synthesis and automated sequence analysis, and Dr. Juan Rivera for helpful discussions regarding RBL cell culture."

Capacitation allows sperm to acquire the capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction and fertilization. Capacitation is correlated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins within sperm (1Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Osheroff J.E. Visconti P.E. Valenzuela J.P. Travis A.J. Alvarez J. Kopf G.S. Mol. Hum.

Capacitation is associated with profound changes in the membrane properties of sperm, including the efflux of cholesterol from the plasma membrane (4Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X.

The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases during capacitation (3Luconi M. Barni T. Vannelli G. Krausz C. Marra F. Benedetti P. Evangelista V. Francavilla S. Properzi G. Forti G. Baldi E. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1476-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggests that capacitation requires an extracellular signal. However, an intriguing aspect of the process is that it occurs spontaneously in vitro without a requirement for exogenous mediators. This spontaneous response requires that ejaculated sperm be removed from the components of seminal plasma and their dilution in simple defined medium, containing metabolic energy substrates, Ca2+, and HCO 3− (5Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). There is, however, a requirement for exogenous protein in the form of albumin (5Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Since albumin is not generally recognized as a signaling molecule, alternative explanations for its role have been sought. A model to explain this “bootstrapping” of the capacitation process in defined medium has been proposed and involves extracellular albumin acting to remove sperm membrane cholesterol (6Davis B.K. Byrne R. Hungund B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 558: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Seminal plasma contains decapacitating activity (7Bedford J.M. Chang M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 202: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and removal of seminal plasma is required for capacitation. It was proposed that lipid-dense vesicles within seminal plasma donate cholesterol to the sperm membrane, preventing capacitation (8Davis B.K. Arch. Androl. 1980; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The removal of seminal plasma and the presence of albumin reverse this process resulting in a net efflux of cholesterol from the sperm membrane. It was postulated that the resulting change in membrane properties leads to the intracellular signaling events that comprise capacitation. This proposed form of signal induction seems to be unique to the spermatozoon. As well as acting as a sink for cholesterol, albumin may also act as an acceptor for membrane phospholipids. The phospholipid component of the plasma membrane of most cell types is composed mainly of esterified phospholipids (the acyl chains are linked to the glycerol backbone by ester bonds). A characteristic feature of the spermatozoon is that it has, compared with somatic cells, a high (40%) ether phospholipid component (9Jones R.E. Arch.

Ether phospholipids have the acyl chain replaced by long chain alcohols linked by ether bonds, and these are primarily 1-O-alkyl phospholipids.

An hypothesis that may link these observations is that the dilution of sperm away from seminal plasma limits PAF:acetylhydrolase activity allowing sperm-derived PAF to be released onto albumin and accumulate without degradation by PAF:acetylhydrolase. Upon achieving threshold concentrations, PAF acts on specific receptors on sperm to induce signal transduction and the molecular changes of capacitation. To test this hypothesis, this study determined whether (i) sperm release PAF upon dilution in capacitation medium containing albumin; (ii) sperm possess a specific and functional PAF receptor that is required for capacitation; and (iii) the deletion of this PAF receptor (by homologous recombination) affects capacitation and fertilization. The results support a role of sperm-derived PAF as an autocrine pathway for the induction of capacitation of mammalian sperm. Preparations of sperm for the assessment of hyperactivated motility was in BWW medium (20 mm sodium lactate, 5 mm glucose, 0.25 mm sodium pyruvate, 95 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4). For all other procedures sperm were prepared in HTF medium (101.6 mm NaCl, 4.69 mmKCl, 0.20 mm MgSO4, 0.37 mmKH2PO4, 21.4 mm sodium lactate, 2.78 mm glucose, 2.04 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mm sodium pyruvate) (27Quinn P.

Hepes-buffered HTF medium (HTF media with NaHCO3reduced to 5 mm and replaced by equimolar Hepes buffer) (27Quinn P. Warnes G.M. Kerin J.F. Kirby C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 442: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was used for collecting and washing oocytes, zygotes, and embyros. Embryos were cultured in modified HTF medium (HTF with 1 mmglutamine and 0.11 mm EDTA added) (28O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All media contained 3 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml (Pentex crystallized BSA, Miles Inc., Kankakee, IL) unless otherwise indicated. Recombinant PAF:acetylhydrolase (rPAF:acetylhydrolase) was a generous gift of ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA); UR-12519 was a generous gift of J. Uriach and Cia, SA (Barcelona, Spain). A monoclonal PAF receptor antibody was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). PAF (1-O-hexadecyl/octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; an approximately equimolar mixture of hexadecyl and octadecyl form of PAF, Sigma) was stored as a stock solution of 10 mg/ml in chloroform at −20 °C. Aliquots were placed in sterile siliconized glass tubes and dried under N2. The PAF was solubilized by the addition of medium, followed by vigorous vortexing for 3 min, and then allowed to stand for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle mixing. Mice were Swiss outbred (Laboratory Animal Services, University of Sydney), C57BL/6 (Laboratory Animal Services), or PAF receptor knock-out (KO) (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo (29Ishii S. Kuwaki T. Nagase T. Maki K. Tashiro F. Sunaga S. Cao W.H. Kume K. Fukuchi Y. Ikuta K. Miyazaki J. Kumada M. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar)). The KO strain had been backcrossed to wild-type C57BL/6 mice 10–12 times. All animals were housed and bred in the Gore Hill Research Laboratory, St. Leonards, New South Wales, Australia. The use of animals was approved by the Royal North Shore Hospital Animal Care and Ethics Committee, according to the Australian Code of Practice for Use of Animals in Research. Mouse sperm was collected from the epididymides of male mice (14–35 weeks old) of proven fertility and immediately placed into 1 ml of medium. Sperm were allowed to disperse for 10 min at 37 °C. Human sperm was obtained by masturbation from donors of proven fertility. Following incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the ejaculate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The seminal plasma was removed and frozen, and the spermatozoal pellet was washed 3 times. For mouse and human preparations, the sperm concentration and motility were assessed by hemocytometer, and the sperm suspension was diluted as required for each experiment. PAF was extracted by a modified version of the Bligh-Dyer organic extraction method, followed by partial purification by TLC (30Collier M. O'Neill C. Ammit A.J. Saunders D.M. Hum. Reprod. 1990; 5: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using a PAF-specific scintillation proximity immunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The assay used to measure PAF:acetylhydrolase was as described previously (31O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 1-Hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (262.7 GBq mmol−1; [3H]PAF) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (unlabeled PAF) was from NOVA Biochem AG (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). Reactions were performed in a final volume of 500 µl containing a final concentration of 5 µmol/liter [3H]PAF (5.25 GBq mmol−1), 60 µg of BSA. The reaction was at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 170 µg of BSA, followed by trichloroacetic acid. The free [3H]acetate was counted on a Packard Tricarb model 1500 scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Evidence for the expression of mRNA for the G-protein-linked PAF receptor, the subunits of the intracellular form of PAF:acetylhydrolase 1b (α2- and β-subunits), and the plasma/macrophage form of PAF:acetylhydrolase was sought using RT-PCR. Control tissues (liver and brain) were examined in parallel. Sperm were prepared as above and allowed to swim up into a column of medium. The motile sperm were collected, and several hundred were picked off under a dissecting microscope. This method ensured that a pure sample of motile sperm, without contamination by other cells, was tested. For all RT-PCR assays the following controls were always undertaken. (i) Mouse β-actin was used as a positive control for the effectiveness of all RNA extractions, and RT-PCRs were performed on those samples (the β-actin primer pair was designed to span the first intron (87 base pairs in length) of the rodent β-actin gene; thus contaminating genomic DNA could be detected using these primers). (ii) To control for false-positive PCR amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, some samples did not include reverse transcriptase. (iii) Water was added instead of sample to test for contamination with extraneous DNA. (iv) Some samples were randomly treated with RNase I (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) prior to RT, confirming the RNA origin of positive RT-PCRs. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide to visualize PCR product on an UV transilluminator. Fragments were verified by size, and the product was extracted and the sequence analyzed to confirm they were from the target gene (ABI PRISM Dye terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, performed by SUPAMAC, Redfern, New South Wales, Australia). Primers were obtained from Fisher Biotech (Perth, Australia). The primers are as follows: PAF-R (5′-GAT GGC TCA GGC AAC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-TGA TGA ATA CCG CCA AGA CC-3′) (32Ishii S. Matsuda Y. Nakamura M. Waga I. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem.

Reprod. 1999; 60: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted with TRIzol™ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 µg of carrier RNA (yeast transfer RNA, Sigma) as described previously (35Stojanov T. O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA was treated with DNase to eliminate possible contamination with genomic DNA, by resuspending the RNA pellet in 20 µl of resuspension solution (RS, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, and 6 mmMgCl2) (36Doherty A.S. Temeles G.L. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) containing 2 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega) and incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the addition of a second equal volume of RS, RNA was phenol-chloroform re-extracted. The RNA pellet was dissolved in double-autoclaved Milli-Q water in the presence of RNase Inhibitor (Promega) (final concentration 1 unit/ml). RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 30 min with 1.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase primed with 0.25 µm oligo(dT) in 20 µl of reaction mix containing 3 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm each dNTP, and 1 unit of RNase Inhibitor (all reagents supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The RT reaction was then terminated by heating at 98 °C for 5 min and cooling to 5 °C. Twenty (20Sengoku K. Tamate K. Takaoka Y. Ishikawa M. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 8: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) µl of RT reaction volume were used for test sample in a final PCR volume of 50 µl containing 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.2 mmol each dNTP, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and 0.4 µm each of a specific primer pair were subjected to 35 rounds of amplification in a Corbett Thermal Reactor. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to visualize PCR product on a UV transilluminator. A sperm suspension was fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Sheep heat-inactivated serum in phosphate-buffered saline (30% v/v) with 2% BSA at 25 °C for 30 min was used to block nonspecific binding. Sperm were incubated in primary antibody 1:500 monoclonal anti-PAF receptor (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) at 25 °C for 24 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) at 25 °C for 1 h. Embryos were viewed with an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon). Photographs were taken with Kodak Tri-X pan 400 print film (Eastman Kodak Co.), using the same exposure conditions for all images. Each experiment incorporated several negative control treatments as follows: incubation of sperm in non-immune IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, Alabama); no primary antibody; no secondary antibody; and non-fluorescent secondary antibody. Changes in the motility of sperm were assessed by their ability to migrate through a polycarbonate filter containing 8-µm pores (Nucleopore) as described previously (37Eisenbach M. Ralt D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 31: C1095-C1101Crossref Google Scholar). The lower wells of a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe AP48, Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) were filled with a swim-up preparation of mouse or human sperm. The concentration of sperm used is indicated for each experiment. Sperm were treated with putative capacitation factors and/or inhibitors. The upper wells were separated from the lower ones by the polycarbonate filter and were filled with medium containing the desired treatments. The chambers were incubated for 15–30 min at 37 °C, and the sperm accumulating in the upper chamber were assessed by direct counting. This was achieved by placing over the top of the upper well a slide that was pre-coated with a solution of 0.01% (w/v) polylysine and 0.5% (w/v) spermidine. The chamber was then centrifuged upside down at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The sperm in the upper chambers adhering to the coated slide were counted by light microscopy. The status of the acrosome was assessed using the Coomassie Blue G-250 staining method (38Larson J.L. Miller D.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm were fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times with 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.0, and stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). The intact acrosome stained an intense dark blue. A minimum of 100 sperm was scored per sperm smear. IVF was performed as described previously (39Singh J. O'Neill C. Handelsman D.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Females were superovulated by pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin followed 48 h later by human chorionic gonadotrophin (for each gonadotrophin the following doses were given: 10 IU outbred, 5 IU C57b1/6, and PAF receptor KO). Oocytes were collected 13–15 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin and washed. Epididymal sperm were added according to the description for each experiment. Fertilization was performed in a final volume of 1 ml of medium. Putative capacitation factors and/or inhibitors were added to the fertilization medium as indicated in the relevant experiments. Oocytes and sperm were cultured together for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. The oocytes were then retrieved, washed in Hepes-buffered HTF, and their fertilization status assessed by microscopic detection of pronuclei and polar bodies. Fertilized oocytes were transferred to 10-µl drops of modified HTF medium under mineral oil, and their development status was assessed each 24 h for 120 h. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 9.0. Differences in the PAF release, enzyme activity, and sperm motility were assessed by analysis of variance. Differences in fertilization rate and the acrosome reaction were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Freshly collected mouse epididymal sperm contained significant quantities of PAF (74.1 + 26.1 pmol PAF/105sperm). Following incubation in culture medium for 1 h, the amount of PAF associated with sperm was similar, 77.0 ± 34.8 pmol of PAF/105 sperm, whereas an additional 117.2 ± 13.0 pmol of PAF/105 sperm was found released into the culture medium. After 100 min in capacitation media, the concentration of PAF in both sperm and the culture media increased to 152.3 ± 47.4 pmol/105 sperm and 103.0 ± 20.5 pmol/ml media, respectively. In the nominal absence of albumin from medium, the amount of PAF found in capacitation medium following 60 min of incubation was significantly less than in the presence of albumin (p< 0.01), being 34.0 ± 17.9 pmol released from 105sperm. The results are the mean ± S.E. of three separate replicates. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of mRNA within human and mouse sperm that coded for the G-protein-linked PAF receptor (Fig.1). There was also present mRNA coding for the α2- and β-subunits of intracellular PAF:acetylhydrolase 1b enzyme and the macrophage/plasma-type PAF:acetylhydrolase (Fig. 1). In all cases the homology of the RT-PCR product with the genes of interest was confirmed by sequence analysis. Since sperm were individually picked off from a swim-up preparation, it can be concluded that the mRNA was unequivocally from sperm. Labeling of sperm with a specific antibody for the G-protein-linked PAF receptor clearly showed the presence of this receptor on both human and mouse spermatozoa (Fig. 2, iand ii), whereas mouse sperm from a PAF receptor knock-out strain lacked the receptor (Fig. 2 iii). For both species, staining was heaviest in the post acrosomal region of the sperm head and in the mid-piece, being particularly evident in the mid-piece of mouse sperm. The treatment of sperm with PAF caused an increase in the migration of both human and mouse sperm through a membrane with 8-µm pores (Fig. 3). Human sperm showed a significant quadratic dose-response (p < 0.0001) with a significant enhancement reaching a peak of 18 nmol PAF/liter but declining at 18 µmol/liter PAF (p < 0.001). In mice, PAF enhanced migration across the concentration range 18 nmol/liter to 18 µmol/liter (p < 0.001). The specificity of the actions of PAF was assessed by determining whether a PAF receptor antagonist (Fig.4) could inhibit the effect on sperm migration. The sperm were treated with PAF (1.8 µmol/liter) and increasing concentrations of the selective PAF receptor antagonist, UR-12519. For both mouse and human sperm, PAF induced a significant increase in sperm migration confirming the results of the previous experiment. UR-12519 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of this enhanced migration. At a concentration of 0.23–2.3 µmol/liter UR-12519, the migration was not different to that of the negative control (p > 0.05). The results confirm that exogenous PAF acts in a specific fashion to induce sperm motility changes associated with capacitation. The presence on sperm of PAF receptors and the release of PAF by sperm creates the conditions for an autocrine PAF loop. To assess whether there is a role for endogenous PAF, the effects of UR-12519 and exogenous rPAF:acetylhydrolase on sperm motility in the chemotaxis device were measured. A sperm concentration 10-fold higher was used to accentuate any effect of endogenous PAF. In both mouse (p < 0.01) and human sperm (p < 0.0001), UR-12519 cause dose-dependent inhibition of sperm migration in the absence of exogenous PAF (Fig. 5). There was no adverse effect of this drug on human sperm viability assessed by the vital staining with Eosin-Nigrosin or the proportion of sperm that were motile (76% control compared with 71% UR-12519). The addition of rPAF:acetylhydrolase also caused a significant (p < 0.0001) dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous migration of human and mouse sperm across the membrane (Fig. 6). These effects occurred in the absence of exogenous PAF, and it is therefore assumed that the enzyme blocked the actions of endogenous sperm-derived PAF by degrading it to inactive lyso-PAF. Following the dilution of mouse sperm in defined medium in the presence of albumin, capacitation occurs in a time-dependent manner resulting in a spontaneous onset of the acrosome reaction. The role of PAF in this phen"
https://openalex.org/W2046356090,"Pax-6 and microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) are required for proper eye development. Pax-6, expressed in both the neuroretina and pigmented retina, has two DNA-binding domains: the paired domain and the homeodomain. Mice homozygous for Pax-6 mutations are anophthalmic. Mitf, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (b-HLH-LZ) transcription factor associated with the onset and maintenance of pigmentation, identifies the retinal pigmented epithelium during eye development. Loss of Mitf function results in the formation of an ectopic neuroretina at the expense of the dorsal retinal pigmented epithelium. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between Pax-6 and Mitf. In transient transfection-expression experiments, we found that transactivating effects of Pax-6 and Mitf on their respective target promoters were strongly inhibited by co-transfection of both transcription factors. This repression was due to direct protein/protein interactions involving both Pax-6 DNA-binding domains and the Mitf b-HLH-LZ domain. These results suggest that Pax-6/Mitf interactions may be critical for retinal pigmented epithelium development."

The secreted proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and have to pass both membranes of the cell envelope. Four main pathways for the secretion of proteins, usually referred to as the type I, II, III, and the autotransporter pathway, have been identified in P. aeruginosa (1Tommassen J. Filloux A. Bally M.

In addition to elastase, which is the most abundant secreted protein, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, exotoxin A, two phospholipases C, the staphylolytic protease LasA, the chitin-binding protein CbpD, and a putative aminopeptidase are secreted via this pathway (2Filloux A.

Proteins secreted via the type I or type III pathways are translocated across the two membranes of the cell envelope in a single step, without a periplasmic intermediate. In contrast, the type II pathway is a two-step mechanism. The first step is the translocation across the inner membrane, which is mediated by the Sec machinery. In the periplasm, which contains chaperones and folding catalysts, the exoproteins fold into a (near-)native conformation (8Hirst T.R. Holmgren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For several proteins that are secreted via a type II mechanism (9Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that folding in the periplasm is essential for the subsequent translocation across the outer membrane to occur. In P. aeruginosa, the translocation of the periplasmic intermediates across the outer membrane is mediated by a machinery composed of at least 12 proteins, encoded by the xcp genes (for a review, see Ref. 2Filloux A. Michel G. Bally M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 177-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To investigate the biogenesis of proteins secreted via the type II pathway of P. aeruginosa, we have chosen elastase as a model. This metalloprotease, which is encoded by the lasBgene (14Bever R.A. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4309-4314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is produced as a preproprotein. The pre- part is the signal peptide, which directs the translocation of the proenzyme across the inner membrane (15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The propeptide is essential for the folding of elastase in the periplasm (12McIver K.S. Kessler E. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and this folding allows for further processing of the proenzyme by autoproteolytic cleavage (16McIver K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7781-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The propeptide remains noncovalently associated with the mature elastase (15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits further proteolytic activity of the enzyme (17Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the propeptide-enzyme complex is secreted and dissociates during or after translocation across the outer membrane (6Braun P. de Groot A. Bitter W. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3467-3469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30225-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the propeptide-enzyme complex is a well coordinated process, and a host-specific factor is required to induce this event (19Braun P. Bitter W. Tommassen J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The propeptide is finally degraded by an extracellular protease (6Braun P. de Groot A. Bitter W. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3467-3469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30225-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), probably elastase itself. Proteins secreted via a type II pathway can acquire disulfide bonds, which are formed in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm by the presence of the Dsb system (for a review, see Ref. 20Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The propeptide of elastase does not contain any cysteines, whereas the mature polypeptide contains four of them, which together form two disulfide bonds in the folded enzyme (21Thayer M.M. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2864-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both bonds are not localized in close proximity of the active center of the protein. One disulfide bond, between Cys-30 and Cys-57, is located in the N-terminal part of the mature enzyme and connects two β-strands. The other disulfide bond, between Cys-270 and Cys-297, is located close to the C terminus and connects two α-helices. Here we demonstrate that the formation of these disulfide bonds is well ordered in time. One disulfide bond is formed in the proenzyme and is essential for subsequent autoproteolytic processing to occur. The other disulfide bond is formed only after autocatalytic processing and appeared to be required for the full proteolytic activity of the enzyme and contributes to its stability. The bacterial strains used are listed in Table I. To allow for replication of pKNG101 derivatives, Escherichia coli strain CC118(λpir) was used. Selection for mutant forms of elastase was done with E. coli strain DH5α. For isolation of other plasmids, E. coli strain PC2495 was used. Cells ofE. coli and P. aeruginosa were grown in LB medium with agitation at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. For LB-agar plates, the medium was solidified with 1.5% agar. The antibiotic concentrations used for plasmid maintenance were 25 and 20 µg/ml kanamycin and 100 and 500 µg/ml streptomycin for E. coliand P. aeruginosa, respectively, 100 µg/ml ampicillin forE. coli, and 20 µg/ml piperacillin for P. aeruginosa. The dsbC gene in E. coli strain CE1224 was inactivated by P1 transduction (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), using thedsbC::Km strain SR3515 as a donor, and transductants were selected on LB plates, supplemented with kanamycin. The lasB gene in P. aeruginosa strains PAO25 and PAO7510 was inactivated by using pPB55, which is a derivative of the suicide vector pKNG101 containing alasB::Km allele, essentially as described (23Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).

For the insertional inactivation of the lasB gene, plasmid pPB3, encoding pre-elastase without the propeptide, was digested withPstI, and the kanamycin resistance box of plasmid pUC4K was cloned as a PstI fragment in this site. From the plasmid obtained, designated pPB12, the modified lasB gene was isolated as an EcoRI-SphI fragment, which was made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase and cloned in the SmaI site of the suicide vector pKNG101, resulting in plasmid pPB55. Cys-30 and Cys-57 were simultaneously replaced by alanine residues, using a modified QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Plasmid pRB1804 was used as a template, and the DNA was amplified with the mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′CAACGACCGCgcCGAGATGGACG and 5′TTGGTCGGGgcGGCGAAGCGGAAC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by 20 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and DNA synthesis at 68 °C for 2 min. Transformants encoding elastase without the disulfide bond were elected by the altered migration of elastase using SDS-PAGE1 analysis, and the nucleotide substitutions were confirmed using nucleotide sequence analysis. Thus, plasmid pUC Δ NSS was obtained. To substitute the cysteines forming the C-terminal disulfide bond, first, the substitution C297A was made using the 3-primer method of Landt et al. (25Landt O. Grunert H-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The “megaprimer” was obtained by amplification of the DNA fragment with the oligonucleotides 5′AGCGGCGCCgcCGGGGTGAT and 5′cTgcAGCAGCCGCCCTCC in 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 47 °C for 1 min, and DNA synthesis at 73 °C for 2 min. The entire elastase gene with the C297A substitution was obtained using pRB1804 as template, the megaprimer, the reverse sequencing primer, and 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 47 °C for 2 min, and DNA synthesis at 73 °C for 2.5 min. The DNA fragment obtained was digested with EcoRI andPstI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pUC18 resulting in plasmid pUCΔCS. The second cysteine of the C-terminal disulfide bond, C270, was subsequently substituted, using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method using pUCΔCS as the template and the oligonucleotides 5′GGCGTGACCgcCCCGAGCGC and 5′GCGCTCGGGgcGGTCACGCC. The QuickChange mutagenesis was carried out as described above, except that the annealing temperature in the polymerase chain reaction was 55 °C. Thus, plasmid pUCΔCSS was obtained. For expression in P. aeruginosa, the mutant lasBalleles were isolated as EcoRI/PstI fragments from pUCΔNSS and pUCΔCSS and cloned in the corresponding sites of pMMB67EH, resulting in plasmids pMMBΔNSS and pMMBΔCSS, respectively. Transformation of E. coli strains and transfer of plasmid DNA to P. aeruginosa by triparental mating, using the conjugative properties of pRK2013, were done as described (13Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosatransconjugants were selected on King's medium B agar plates (26King E.O. Ward M.K. Raney D.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1954; 44: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 20 µg/ml naladixic acid. Growth of the cultures, the induction of elastase expression from the tacpromoter, pulse labeling of the cells, and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously reported (13Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Where indicated, oxidation of reduced thiols by air was prevented by incubating the pulse-labeled cells for 20 min at 0 °C with 100 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), according to standard procedures (27Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 28Eppens E.F. Nouwen N. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. A polyclonal antielastase serum was made using purified mature elastase (Nagase Laboratory) that was injected into a rabbit. The serum obtained was used in a 1000-fold dilution and was a kind gift from A. Lazdunski. The polyclonal antipropeptide serum was a generous gift from and prepared by E. Kessler (15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, the propeptide was isolated from the partial purified elastase precursor using SDS-PAGE. Gel slices containing the antigen were homogenized, mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant, and injected into rabbits. The IgG fraction was purified from the blood samples by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The serum was preadsorbed with a cell extract of P. aeruginosa strain AP103-II and E. coli strain DH5α(pUC18). The thus 20-fold diluted serum was used in Western blotting analysis using a 20,000-fold final dilution. To obtain cell-free extracellular fluids, cells were removed from cultures by centrifugation (6500 × g, 3 min, room temperature), and the supernatant obtained was centrifuged again (13,000 ×g, 3 min, room temperature). Proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and washed with acetone. The precipitated proteins and the cells obtained in the pellet of the first centrifugation were resuspended in sample buffer without dithiothreitol (DTT). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated or immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in sample buffer (29Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) without β-mercaptoethanol. For the reduction of disulfide bonds, DTT was added to a concentration of 20 mM. Protein patterns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13Braun P. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) on gels of 9 cm in length (Figs. 2 and 3) or on the Bio-Rad Protean II system (Figs. 1 and 4) followed, where indicated, by autoradiography. Immunodetection by Western blot analysis was performed as described (30Hekstra D. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6546-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect free thiols, proteins were incubated withN-[6-(biotinamido)]hexyl-3′(2′pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP) as described (28Eppens E.F. Nouwen N. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins trichloroacetic acid-precipitated from culture supernatants were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C in the presence or absence of DTT. Subsequently 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, supplemented with 0.8 mm biotin-HPDP (Pierce), was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Next the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.45 µm) using a semidry electroblotting apparatus (2117 Multiphor II, LKB). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was used to detect biotin-labeled proteins. The peroxidase activity was developed with a solution of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (0.5 mg/ml) in 15% methanol, 85% phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.01% H2O2.Figure 3Formation of disulfide bonds in elastase expressed in P. aeruginosa. Cells of P. aeruginosa strain PAO-E105, carrying plasmid pML27 encoding elastase, were grown to an A 600 of 0.35 at 30 °C. Thirty minutes after the induction of elastase expression, the cells were labeled for 3 min, followed by varying chase periods as indicated. Proteins from total cells were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in Triton buffer, and elastase was immunoprecipitated. A and B represent two independent experiments. Samples corresponding to a 200-µl culture were resuspended in sample buffer with or without DTT, as indicated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Murgier M. Wretlind B. Lazdunski A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 40: 159-163Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Before studying the formation of disulfide bonds during the biogenesis of elastase, we first analyzed whether their presence can be demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. Frequently polypeptide chains possessing disulfide bonds have a higher electrophoretic mobility than the reduced forms of these polypeptides because of their more compact shape. Indeed when proteins from the supernatant of an overnight culture of the wild-type strain PAO25 were analyzed in the absence of DTT, elastase migrated with a higher electrophoretic mobility (Fig.1 A, lane 1) than in the presence of the reducing agent (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The absence of free cysteines in elastase was further demonstrated by incubating the proteins with biotin-HPDP, which reacts with free thiols. Biotin-HPDP reacted only with elastase after reduction of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the presence or absence of disulfide bonds in mature elastase can indeed be demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. To examine the formation of disulfide bonds in elastase, E. coli strain CE1224 was transformed with thelasB-containing plasmid pML27, and elastase maturation was studied after pulse labeling of the cells. Two forms of the proenzyme were detected, tentatively designated PE 0and PE 1 (Fig. 2,lane 1). Reduction of the proteins with DTT before SDS-PAGE eliminated the PE 1 form (Fig. 2, lane 2) and resulted in a concomitant increase in the amount of the PE 0 form (Fig. 2, lane 2). This result shows that the bands represent different conformational states of the proenzyme and that the proenzyme form PE 1contains at least one disulfide bond. Two forms of mature elastase were detected, a faint band tentatively designated E 1 and a major band designatedE 2 (Fig. 2, lane 1). When the proteins were exposed to DTT before SDS-PAGE, both theE 1 and the E 2 forms of the mature elastase were converted into another form, designatedE 0, which migrated even slower in the gel thanE 1 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Hence it appears that three different forms of mature elastase can be discriminated, which differ in the number of disulfide bonds. FormE 0 is the fully reduced state of the protein, whereas E 1 and E 2 contain most likely one and two disulfide bonds, respectively. Because theE 1 form could be detected after expression of elastase in vivo, it is apparently not necessary that both disulfide bonds are formed for autoproteolytic processing to occur (see also below). Because the experiments described above were performed in E. coli, the possibility that the slow formation of the second disulfide bond in mature elastase is an artifact of elastase expression in a heterologous host, rather than a genuine step in the biogenesis of elastase, had to be investigated. Therefore, the maturation of elastase was also studied in P. aeruginosa lasB mutant strain PAO-E105 carrying pML27 in pulse-labeling experiments. The various forms of proelastase (PE 0, PE 1) and mature elastase (E 1, E 2), which were previously detected in E. coli, were also detected inP. aeruginosa, but their relative abundance varied from experiment to experiment. Two extreme cases are illustrated in Fig.3, A and B. In the experiment illustrated in panel A, the majority of the proenzyme and the mature enzyme detected immediately after pulse labeling of the cells was already in the oxidized states PE 1 and E 2, respectively (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1–5 with 6). In the experiment illustrated in panel B, the proenzyme is in the reduced state PE 0 (Fig. 3 B,lane 1), whereas the mature enzyme is slowly converted during the chase from the E 1 form into theE 2 form (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–5). Apparently, as in E. coli, (i) at least one disulfide bond is already formed in the proenzyme, (ii) the second bond is not required for autoproteolytic processing to occur, and (iii) this second bond can be formed in the already processed enzyme. Therefore, we conclude that the shift in electrophoretic mobility of the mature elastase reflects a relevant step in"
https://openalex.org/W2134430835,"Defects in the human MSH2 mismatch repair system have been implicated in cellular mutagenesis, tumorigenesis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. The current studies characterized the 5′ upstream proximal promoter region of thehMSH2 gene using transient transfection of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Serial deletions of a 1.88-kb fragment of the proximal promoter region of the hMSH2 gene revealed that promoter activity was restricted to the first −281 bp. Targeted deletions within this −281 bp region coupled with specific sequence mutagenesis identified a response element for the p53 tumor suppressor protein located between −242 and −222 bp. The −242 hMSH2 p53 element is configured as a direct tandem repeat palindrome with 80% homology to the p53 consensus binding sequence. Co-transfection of anhMSH2 reporter and p53 expression vector into the p53-null cell line SK-OV-3 produced 10-fold enhanced transcription, which was lost when the −242 to −222 p53 binding site was mutated. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of a previously unidentified p53 response element in the hMSH2 proximal promoter. Its location at −242 bp upstream of the start site of transcription is distinct from two previously reported p53 sites at −447 and −416, which transactivate in Saos-2 cells (Scherer, S. J., Maier, S. M., Seifert, M., Hanselmann, R. G., Zang, K. D., Muller-Hermelink, H. K., Angel, P., Welter, C., and Schartl, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37469–37473). Finally, in sharp contrast to their activity in Saos-2 cells, deletion of the −447 and −416 sites in A2780 cells had no effect onhMSH2 promoter activity. Thus, it appears that p53 regulates hMSH2 expression through multiple cell type-specific DNA response elements. Defects in the human MSH2 mismatch repair system have been implicated in cellular mutagenesis, tumorigenesis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. The current studies characterized the 5′ upstream proximal promoter region of thehMSH2 gene using transient transfection of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Serial deletions of a 1.88-kb fragment of the proximal promoter region of the hMSH2 gene revealed that promoter activity was restricted to the first −281 bp. Targeted deletions within this −281 bp region coupled with specific sequence mutagenesis identified a response element for the p53 tumor suppressor protein located between −242 and −222 bp. The −242 hMSH2 p53 element is configured as a direct tandem repeat palindrome with 80% homology to the p53 consensus binding sequence. Co-transfection of anhMSH2 reporter and p53 expression vector into the p53-null cell line SK-OV-3 produced 10-fold enhanced transcription, which was lost when the −242 to −222 p53 binding site was mutated. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of a previously unidentified p53 response element in the hMSH2 proximal promoter. Its location at −242 bp upstream of the start site of transcription is distinct from two previously reported p53 sites at −447 and −416, which transactivate in Saos-2 cells (Scherer, S. J., Maier, S. M., Seifert, M., Hanselmann, R. G., Zang, K. D., Muller-Hermelink, H. K., Angel, P., Welter, C., and Schartl, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37469–37473). Finally, in sharp contrast to their activity in Saos-2 cells, deletion of the −447 and −416 sites in A2780 cells had no effect onhMSH2 promoter activity. Thus, it appears that p53 regulates hMSH2 expression through multiple cell type-specific DNA response elements. mismatch repair base pair kilobase hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer wild type mutant purine pyrimidine polymerase chain reaction In humans, the product of the MSH2 gene is a protein belonging to the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)1 system. The MMR proteins play a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of the cellular genome by correcting errors in base pairing introduced into the newly synthesized “daughter strand,” during DNA replication (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). MMR proteins were first identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (2Claverys J.P. Lacks S.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 133-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently characterized in Escherichia coli as the MutS, MutL, and MutH proteins (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The hMSH2 protein forms the core of the human homologue to the bacterial MutS protein via dimerization with two other members of the MMR family, hMSH3 (4Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and hMSH6 (5Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). hMSH2 and hMSH6 dimers form the hMutSα complex responsible for the initial recognition and targeting of mismatched nucleotides (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar).Defects in the hMSH2 gene have been implicated in the genesis of a number of malignancies of the gastrointestinal, gynecological, and genitourinary tracts (6Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). In the case of colorectal cancers, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome has been shown to have greater than 90% germline mutation of the MMR genes, a large percentage of which are directly attributable to mutations of hMSH2 (7de la Chapelle A. Peltomaki P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a majority of the other cancers associated with MMR defects, mutations arise spontaneously in somatic cells, as is the case in ovarian cancers where recent data indicate that defective MMR proteins are present in ∼20% of sporadic tumors (8Fujita M. Enomoto T. Yoshino K. Nomura T. Buzard G.S. Inoue M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The loss of MMR proteins in tumor cells is also associated with resistance to certain DNA adduct-producing chemotherapeutic agents exemplified by the platinum-based compound, cisplatin. It has been suggested that the loss of MMR proteins in these cells leads to chemotherapeutic resistance via an inability of the cell to link DNA damage to an apoptotic signaling pathway. Support for a link between the MMR system and chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis comes from the following. 1) The hMSH2 protein MutS complex is responsible for the recognition and binding of cisplatin DNA-adducts (9Duckett D. Drummond J.T. Murchie A. Reardon J. Sancar A. Lilley D. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and 2) reintroduction of the hMSH2 gene via chromosome transfer into hMSH2-deficient cisplatin-resistant cells lines produces chemotherapeutic re-sensitization (10Umar A. Koi M. Risinger J.I. Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Kolodner R.D. Boland C.R. Barrett J.C. Kunkel T.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3949-3955PubMed Google Scholar). The current hypothesis is that loss of MMR genes leads to diminished DNA repair, an increase in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and a loss of apoptotic signaling pathways, eventually leading to widespread genome instability and ultimately mutations in other genes that are directly linked to tumorigenesis.Like the MMR system, the p53 tumor suppressor protein also plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of the cellular genome. As such, p53 mutations frequently occur in a number of cancers (11Carson D.A. Lois A. Lancet. 1995; 346: 1009-1011Abstract PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In ovarian cancers, more than 50% of advanced stage tumors show a loss of p53 function (12Marks J.R. Davidoff A.M. Kerns B.J.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2979-2984PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this is a primary event in tumorigenesis or secondary to instability in the cellular genome is an area of active investigation. p53 has been shown to respond to a variety of mutagenic factors such as chemotherapeutic agents, ionizing radiation, and nucleotide depletion, all of which result in cellular injury via DNA damage (13Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar), as well as down-regulating the expression of a number of cellular oncogenes (14Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Though several mechanisms of action have been proposed for the p53 protein, the most extensively studied is its ability to regulate transcription of target genes through direct binding to specific DNA sequences.Because of its primary function as a DNA-binding transcription factor, the p53 protein resides primarily within the nucleus of the cell. Transcriptionally active DNA-bound p53 protein exists as a tetramer (15Raycroft L. Wu H.Y. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Tetramers of p53 occur via binding of two pairs of p53 dimers to specific target sequences of DNA (p53 response elements) located in the regulatory regions of genes. These p53 response elements generally consist of two tandem repeats of a sequence homologous to the consensus p53 binding sequence, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ (16El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). p53 response elements have been characterized in several genes includingp21, GADD45, MDM2, and bax(17Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar), which are activated by p53 following cellular injury and, in turn, lead to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis.Recent studies point to a cooperative interaction between p53 and the MMR proteins with respect to activation of apoptosis after exposure of cells to mutagenic agents (18Li G.-M. Oncology Res. 1999; 11: 393-400PubMed Google Scholar). The point of overlap between the p53 and MMR systems may be located in the hMSH2gene promoter region, which has been recently cloned and sequenced (19Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,20Scherer S.J. Welter C. Zang K.-D. Dooley S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Electromobility shift experiments have identified two putative p53 palindromic binding sequences located at −447 bp and −416 bp upstream of the start site of transcription (20Scherer S.J. Welter C. Zang K.-D. Dooley S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Saos-2 cells the p53 binding sites were capable of mediating p53 induction of thehMSH2 promoter only in the presence of a co-activator such as ionizing radiation or co-transfected c-Jun (21Scherer S.J. Maier S.M. Seifert M. Hanselmann R.G. Zang K.D. Muller-Hermelink H.K. Angel P. Welter C. Schartl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37469-37473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The requirement for additional transcription factors for activity may reside in the fact that unlike the p53 consensus palindromic sequence that is arranged as two direct tandem repeats, the −447 and −416 sites each comprise only a single palindromic sequence and are separated by 23 bp. What affect this spacing has on dimer/dimer formation of the p53 protein and the ability of these sequences to function as a transcriptional activator in other cell types is presently unknown. Adding additional uncertainty to the role of p53 in hMSH2 expression is a report by Iwahashi et al. (19Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in which serial deletions of thehMSH2 promoter region were transfected into NIH3T3 cells. In NIH3T3 cells maximal transcriptional activity was present in as little as −298 bp of the hMSH2 promoter. Thus, it would appear that at least in NIH3T3 cells the p53 sites at −416 and −447 are not required for transcriptional activity of the hMSH2 promoter. Unfortunately, Iwashi et al. (19Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) did not further characterize the hMSH2 proximal promoter region to determine what elements were functionally active in the −298-bp region of the promoter.Therefore, in the present series of studies we sought to clarify the role of p53 in hMSH2 expression in ovarian cancer by rigorously characterizing the proximal promoter region of thehMSH2 gene.We began our investigation with a series of 5′ deletion mutants of thehMSH2 promoter region utilizing transient transfection of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Our data indicate that similar to NIH3T3 cells, in A2780 cells deletion of the previously identified p53 binding sequences at −447 and −416 had no effect on hMSH2 promoter activity. However, a comprehensive mutational analysis of thehMSH2 proximal promoter has identified a new p53 response element motif, located between −242 and −222 bp upstream of the start site of transcription. This new p53 site (−242 hMSH2) has an 80% sequence homology to the tandem repeat p53 palindromic consensus binding sequence. Co-transfection of the p53-null SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell line with −281 hMSH2-pGL3 and a p53 expression construct indicates that the −242 hMSH2 sequence is capable of functioning as a p53 response element.RESULTSPrior to initiating transient transfection studies of thehMSH2 promoter region, we first sought to identify a suitable ovarian cancer cell line that expressed both thehMSH2 and p53 genes. We examined the distribution of the p53 and hMSH2 mismatch repair proteins in the ovarian cell line, A2780 (Fig. 1). The photomicrographs show the immunohistochemical staining of A2780 cells for p53 (A) and hMSH2 (B) proteins. Consistent with reports in the literature that A2780 cells contain the wild-type p53 gene and express the p53 protein (24Brown R. Clugston C. Burns P. Edlin A. Vasey P. Vojtesek B. Kaye S.B. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we demonstrated positive immunostaining for p53 protein in ∼25–30% of the cells (Fig.1 A). Staining was localized to the nuclei, consistent with the role of p53 as a DNA-binding transcription factor. Similar immunostaining for hMSH2 occurred in roughly 80% of the cells with the stain once again confined primarily to the nucleus (Fig.1 B). Finally, as a control, A2780 cells were immunostained for another member of the MMR system, hMLH1. Staining for hMLH1 resulted in intense nuclear staining in greater than 99% of the A2780 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of p53 and hMSH2 staining of a portion of the cells present on each slide was not caused from an artifact of the tissue preparation or staining procedure, but more likely the result of differences in the expression of these genes at various points in the cell cycle.Having established that the A2780 cell line is capable of expressing both the p53 and hMSH2 genes, we turned our attention to investigating the regulation of the hMSH2 promoter region. Analysis of the hMSH2 proximal promoter region began with a PCR-based isolation of the hMSH2 5′ flanking sequence. Cloning the 5′ upstream proximal promoter region of thehMSH2 gene was accomplished using specific primers based on the published sequence (19Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” This cloning exercise resulted in the isolation of the transcription initiation site for the hMSH2gene along with 1.88 kb of the 5′ upsteam promoter sequence. A series of 5′ deletion mutants of the 1.88-kb hMSH2 promoter fragment were generated (Fig.2 A) for transfection into A2780 cells in order to characterize the hMSH2 proximal promoter through identification of DNA response elements (Fig.2 B). Transfection of the full −1.88-kb hMSH2promoter fragment contained within the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector produced luciferase expression significantly higher (p< 0.01) than that seen with the pGL3 luciferase vector alone (Fig.2 B). Deletion of the hMSH2 proximal promoter to −951 bp produced no significant change in promoter activity from that seen with the full-length −1.88-kb construct. Further deletion down to −281 bp produced a significant (p < 0.05) 2.5-fold rise in promoter activity compared with the −1.88-kb or −951-bp fragments (Fig. 2 B). Finally, deletion to −157 bp of thehMSH2 promoter resulted in a significant (p< 0.01) 95% reduction in promoter activity to levels one-twentieth of those seen with the −281 hMSH2 fragment. Though drastically reduced from the activity seen in the other constructs, the −157 hMSH2 fragment still retained significant (p < 0.05) promoter activity (3.5-fold) when compared with the empty pGL3 vector. Therefore, for the purposes of these studies, the low levels of promoter activity inherent in the −157 hMSH2 fragment served as our minimal (basal) promoter. Of note, the anticipated fall in promoter activity upon deletion of the previously identified p53 sites at −447 and −416 (20Scherer S.J. Welter C. Zang K.-D. Dooley S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the −281 hMSH2 construct was not observed. Thus, it appears that the p53 sites previously identified in Saos-2 cells are either masked or non-functional in A2780 ovarian cancer cells.From the data presented in Fig. 2, enhanced transcriptional activity was confined to a region of the hMSH2 promoter between −281 and −157 bp upstream of the start site of transcription. Analysis of this 124-bp region for potential enhancer elements yielded several candidate sequences, the majority of which had previously been identified (19Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Scherer S.J. Welter C. Zang K.-D. Dooley S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with one notable exception. Our analysis identified a potential enhancer sequence that had not been previously reported; a sequence (−242 to −222 bp) with 80% homology to the p53 consensus sequence (Fig. 3). The hMSH2promoter sequence between −242 and −222 bp (−242 hMSH2) contains two tandem repeats of the core palindromic p53 binding site, flanked by purines and pyrimidines. As indicated in the figure, the minor variations from the ideal consensus p53 sequence occur in the much less conserved flanking purines and pyrimidines, with the two core p53 binding palindromic sequences showing perfect homology to the p53 consensus (C(A/T(A/T)G). Finally, in addition to the minor variations in the flanking purines and pyrimidines, the −242 hMSH2 p53 site has an additional cytosine residue (indicated by an asterisk), separating the two palindromic repeats.Figure 3Homology between the p53 consensus sequence and hMSH2 −242 to −222.

Bold lettersindicate the positions of the core palindromic p53 binding sites within each decamer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the −242 hMSH2 sequence might function as a p53 response element in A2780 cells, we generated a construct (−225 hMSH2) that deletes the −242 hMSH2 p53 binding sites (Fig.4). Deletion of the hMSH2promoter to −225 bp in A2780 transfection assays resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) 95% loss of promoter activity. In fact, the activity of the −225 hMSH2 was statistically indistinguishable from the level seen with the minimal −157 bp hMSH2 promoter (Fig. 4). Thus, the 56-bp sequence between −281 and −225 contains an enhancer element that is required for stimulation ofhMSH2 promoter activity in A2780 ovarian cancer cells above that seen with the minimal 157-bp promoter.Figure 4Deletion of a region within thehMSH2 promoter containing the −242 to −222 bp sequence. A2780 cells were transiently transfected with a series of 5′ deletion mutants of the hMSH2 promoter to examine the effects of the loss of a region containing a sequence homologous to the consensus p53 binding site (−225 hMSH2-pGL3). Schematic representations of the constructs are shown at left. The data are expressed as relative luciferase activity. Data are the mean ± S.E. of two independent transfection experiments of four plates each (n = 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Whereas the loss of promoter activity in the −225 hMSH2 deletion construct is consistent with the loss of p53 binding to the −242 hMSH2 site. The above deletion encompassed a fragment larger than just the −242- to −222-bp p53 binding site. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of an unknown enhancer element located within this same 56-bp region. In an attempt to produce a more restricted mutation of the −242 hMSH2 site, we generated a site-specific mutation within the −281 hMSH2 promoter, specifically targeted at the −242 to −222-bp p53 site. The mutated construct (−281(mut)) contained the 15-bpEcoRI linker sequence 5′-ATAAGAATTCCATAA-3′ in place of the wild type p53 palindromic binding sites 5′-CTAGGCGCAGGCATG-3′ (bases; −239 to −225) in the −281 hMSH2 reporter construct. Both the −281(wt) and −281(mut) constructs were subsequently transfected into A2780 cells (Fig. 5). As previously observed, the −281(wt) construct showed enhanced hMSH2promoter activity 35–40 times that seen with the minimal −157-bp hMSH2 fragment. Mutating the 15-bp palindromic p53 binding sequence within the hMSH2 promoter (−281(mut)) resulted in a 97% reduction in promoter activity. Indeed, mutation of the 15-bp p53 site within the −281 hMSH2 construct resulted in promoter activity statistically indistinguishable from the minimal −157 hMSH2 construct. This result is consistent with a loss of p53 binding to the −242- to −222-bp p53 site within the hMSH2 promoter and is similar to the loss of activity seen with the −225 hMSH2 deletion construct (Fig. 4).Figure 5Mutation of the p53 site (−242 to −222) within the hMSH2 promoter. A2780 cells were transiently transfected with the following hMSH2 promoter constructs: wild type, 5′-ctaggcgcaggcatg-3′ (−281(wt) hMSH2-pGL3) or mutated containing a non-p53 binding EcoRI linker sequence, 5′-ataagaattccataa-3′ (−281(mut) hMSH2-pGL3).

We co-transfected SK-OV-3 cells, which lack endogenous p53 (25Yaginuma Y. Westphal H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4196-4199PubMed Google Scholar), simultaneously with a p53 expression vector and our hMSH2-pGL3 reporter vector. The constructs consisted of an expression vector containing the human p53 coding sequence (pORF-hp53) and either the −281(wt) or −281(mut) hMSH2 reporter vector (Fig.6). Transfection of SK-OV-3 cells with the −281(wt) hMSH2 construct and the empty pORF expression vector produced low basal levels of transcription (Fig. 6). Co-transfection with the p53-expressing (p53-pORF) vector produced a significant (p < 0.01) 10-fold induction of the −281 hMSH2 promoter when compared with the activity in the absence of p53 co-transfection. When the −281(mut) hMSH2 construct containing the mutated p53 site was co-transfected with a p53 expression vector, promoter activity was induced by only 1.8-fold with overall promoter activity the same as that observed for the −281(wt) construct in the absence of co-transfected p53. We interpret these results as indicating that the observed 10-fold induction in the wild-type −281 construct in SK-OV-3 cells is the result of p53 protein binding to the −242 hMSH2 enhancer element. These co-transfection experiments provide convincing evidence that the −242 to −222 sequence within the hMSH2proximal promoter functions as a p53 response element in ovarian cancer cells and is capable of conferring p53-mediated regulation ofhMSH2 expression.Figure 6Activation of the hMSH2promoter by co-transfection with a p53 expression vector.p53-null SK-OV-3 cells were transfected with either the −281(wt) hMSH2-pGL3 or −281(mut) hMSH2-pGL3 in the presence or absence of the human p53 expression construct, pORF-hp53.

A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for regulation ofhMSH2 expression may shed light on the role the hMSH2 protein plays in stabilizing the cellular genome. Additionally, the identification of regulatory elements and their associated transcription factors may also provide important clues toward understanding the association between the loss of hMSH2expression, tumorigenesis, and chemotherapeutic resistance.The present series of studies serves to expand our understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in the regulation of hMSH2expression by providing convincing evidence of the presence of a p53 response element (−242 to −222) in the hMSH2 proximal promoter region. The −242 hMSH2 p53 element identified in the present studies has 100% homology to the p53 consensus sequence within the core palindromic (C(A/T)(A/T)G) binding sites and an overall homology of 80% (Fig. 3). When compared to p53 elements from other genes (Fig.7) the −242 hMSH2 element shows a similar tandem repeat structure with divergence from the p53 consensus sequence confined to the less conserved flanking purine and pyrimidine sequences. Similar to two previously identified p53 binding sites IGFBP3 A and MCK, the −242 hMSH2 site has an additional base (cytosine) separating the tandem repeat sites (Fig. 7). What potential effect, if any, this additional spacing has on the affinity or specificity of p53 for this sequence will be discussed in detail later in this manuscript.Figure 7Sequence comparison of the p53 element inhMSH2 (−242 to −222) with known p53 binding sites. The sequence of the putative hMSH2 p53 response element (−242 to −222) was aligned with previously identified p53 elements from several previously identified p53 target genes. Bases matching the consensus sequence are shown in uppercase letters. An asterisk indicates a 1-bp separation between the two decamers comprising the p53 element. Bold letters indicate the core palindromic p53 binding site within each decamer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)That p53 acts as a regulator of the hMSH2 gene is consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor in maintaining the cellular genome. The MSH2 protein functions in concert with its dimer partners, MSH3 and MSH6, to identify and bind to mismatched DNA base pairs. MutS binding is the first step in the mismatch base excision repair pathway to correct the newly synthesized DNA daughter strand following replication of the cellular genome in anticipation of cell division. Because the hMSH2 protein forms the core of the human MutS mismatch repair complexes, its regulation by the tumor suppressor protein p53 would be consistent with p53's role in maintaining genomic integrity following DNA replication.Direct regulation of hMSH2 expression by p53, as demonstrated in Figs. 5 and 6 of this study, has broad implications pertaining to genome instability in p53-negative cancers. As previously mentioned, ∼50% of all cancers are p53-negative. Because our data indicate p53 is critical to the expression of the hMSH2 gene there is a high likelihood tha"

We used fura-2 fluorescence and patch clamp experiments to determine the role of PKC in mediating the activation of SOC after depletion of internal stores by thapsigargin. The measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) revealed that the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry pathway was abolished by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor. The PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), promoted a Ca2+ influx that was significantly attenuated by calphostin C and La3+ but not by diltiazem. Neither PMA nor calphostin C altered the thapsigargin-induced initial transient rise in [Ca2+]i. In cell-attached patch clamp experiments, the thapsigargin-induced activation of SOC was potentiated by PMA and abolished by both calphostin C and staurosporine. However, SOC was unaffected by thapsigargin when clamping [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis (o-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester. In the absence of thapsigargin, PMA and phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate evoked a significant increase inNP O of SOC, whereas calphostin C did not affect base-line channel activity. In inside-out patches, SOC activity ran down immediately upon excision but was reactivated significantly after adding the catalytic subunit of 0.1 unit/ml of PKC plus 100 µm ATP. Neither ATP alone nor ATP with heat-inactivated PKC rescued a rundown of SOC. Metavanadate, a general protein phosphatase inhibitor, also enhanced SOC activity in inside-out patches.

The physiological pathway for activating SOC is initiated by an agonist binding to its receptor with a subsequent generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and release of internal stores of Ca2+. Thus, the major role for SOC is to replenish intracellular stores of Ca2+ (10Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 11Putney J.W. Mckay R.R.

However, the mechanism by which the release of Ca2+ stores causes activation of SOC is not completely understood.Protein kinase C (PKC) has a significant role in signal transduction of several biologically active substances that regulate a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, migration, and vasoconstriction (9Gibson A.

J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), variable results have been reported on the modulation of SOC by PKC. For example, PKC decreases Ca2+influx through SOC in Xenopus oocytes (8Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and thyroid FRTL-5 cells (24Törnquist K. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), mouse pancreatic acinar cells (23Camello C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Camello P.J. J. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and NIH 3T3 cells with submaximal depletion of internal stores (26Ribeiro C.M. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In many of these studies, Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence was used to evaluate Ca2+ influx in response to depleting internal Ca2+ stores. However, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measured by this technique does not distinguish between enhanced Ca2+ influx and decreased Ca2+ efflux.Recently, single channel currents of SOC were recorded in cultured human mesangial cells (HMCs) (5Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-F961Google Scholar). It was found subsequently that epidermal growth factor activated SOC through a PKC pathway (27Ma R. Sansom S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC may directly regulate SOC. In this study, we have attempted to determine a specific pathway involving PKC regulation of SOC. The effects of PKC on the overall maintenance of cytosolic Ca2+ were determined with the fluorescent Ca2+indicator dye fura-2. To complement these observations, the influence of PKC on single SOC currents was determined using conventional cell-attached and inside-out patch configurations. The results suggest that PKC stimulates Ca2+ entry by direct phosphorylation of SOC proteins or an associated membrane complex.DISCUSSIONStore-operated Ca2+ channels are ubiquitous channels identifiable by their marked sensitivity to thapsigargin-evoked depletion of intracellular stores of Ca2+. This study showed that thapsigargin-evoked activation of SOC was inhibited by calphostin C, a relatively specific blocker of PKC. Moreover, the PKC activator PMA mimicked the activation of SOC by thapsigargin. Reversal of SOC rundown in inside-out patches by PKC and metavanadate suggested direct phosphorylation of SOC or a closely associated regulator. These results are seemingly in conflict with some previous studies. However, the role of PKC can be more clearly defined by fluorescent measurements of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ and Ca2+influx in combination with single SOC currents.Measurements of [Ca2+]i and Fluorescence Quenching by Mn2+As previously demonstrated by this laboratory, SOC are identified with fura-2 fluorescence microscopy as a large elevation in [Ca2+]i when raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from <10 nmto 1 mm in the presence of thapsigargin. This activation of SOC nearly was completely prevented by pretreatment with calphostin C. In addition, thapsigargin-induced fluorescence quenching by Mn2+ was significantly inhibited by calphostin C. Moreover, the addition of PMA to the bathing solution enhanced La3+-sensitive but not diltiazem-sensitive Ca2+entry. These effects of calphostin C and PMA on [Ca2+]i are strong evidence that PKC is an endogenous regulator of SOC.Because the PKC inhibitor effectively prevented the thapsigargin-evoked activation of SOC, it was expected that PMA would enhance thapsigargin-evoked activation of SOC. However, the addition of PMA before thapsigargin application did not have a significant effect on the SOC pathway. There are at least two possible explanations for this result. First, the store release by thapsigargin may have maximally stimulated PKC. In this case, PMA would not additionally affect SOC. Second, PKC may have multiple complex actions on Ca2+mobilization. Low intracellular concentrations of PKC may predominately stimulate Ca2+ influx. However, higher concentrations elicited by PMA may stimulate Ca2+ efflux by activating the plasmalemmal Ca2+-ATPase (36Lagast H. Pozzan T. Waldvogel F.A. Lew P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Okoro E.O. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1999; 51: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, Peterson and Berridge (34Peterson C.C. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PKC biphasically regulated [Ca2+]i depending on the level of intracellular PKC activity.Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels might also be involved in PMA-induced Ca2+ in-flow, because PKC was reported to modulate the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (20Nagahama T. Hayashi K. Ozawa Y. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 215-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although this possibility could not be ruled out entirely, the contribution of this type of Ca2+ channel is slight, if any, because diltiazem, a voltage-gated Ca2+ channels blocker, did not significantly affect the PMA-induced Ca2+influx (Fig. 3). The dose (5 µm) of diltiazem used in this study was much higher than its IC50 (0.4 µm) for blocking voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (38Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar).It is possible that PKC activated SOC by releasing intracellular stores of Ca2+. In human neutrophils (36Lagast H. Pozzan T. Waldvogel F.A. Lew P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (36Lagast H. Pozzan T. Waldvogel F.A. Lew P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), PKC affected the mobilization of Ca2+ between the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the present results do not support this notion, because neither calphostin C nor PMA affected the thapsigargin-evoked peak response of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, Bode and GöKe (22Bode H.P. GöKe B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that the activation of PKC with PMA did not affect thapsigargin-evoked store depletion.Patch Clamp ExperimentsThe regulation of SOC by PKC has been studied extensively using fura-2 Ca2+ measurements (22Bode H.P.

Some general features of SOC demonstrated in this laboratory have been acknowledged by most investigators (2Lückhoff A. Clapham D.E. Biophys.

These include a low single channel conductance, voltage-independent activation, high selectivity to Ca2+, and high sensitivity to blockade by La3+ (1Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol.

In the cell-attached configuration, the thapsigargin-induced activation of SOC was inhibited by the PKC inhibitors, calphostin C, and staurosporine, and enhanced by the PKC activators PMA and PDD. These results were consistent with the fura-2 experiments, suggesting an essential role for PKC in regulating SOC activity.In the absence of thapsigargin, PMA and PDD significantly increased basal SOC activity. This result was corroborated by the fura-2 experiments, which showed a small increase in [Ca2+]i on the addition of PMA. In contrast, calphostin C did not affect basal SOC activity. This result was consistent with the fura-2 experiments and the results of Yao and Tsien (8Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who discovered that calphostin C did not affect base-line capacitative Ca2+ influx into X. oocytes. Thus, PKC contributes minimally to the resting SOC activity.Inside-out patches were used to determine whether PKC could directly activate SOC or a closely associated regulator of SOC. It was discovered that PKCc, which does not require Ca2+ or phosphatidylserine to be in the active state (41Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15194-15199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), attenuated a rundown of SOC in the presence but not in the absence of Mg-ATP. This result suggested that the rundown of SOC activity was because of dephosphorylation on patch excision.Additional evidence that SOC is regulated by a phosphorylation mechanism was demonstrated by the rescue from rundown by metavanadate in inside-out patches. The rescue of SOC activity by metavanadate is consistent with the notion that both PKC and a protein phosphatase are present in the inside-out patches tightly associated with SOC. Many studies have shown that kinases or phosphatases are often excised with ion channels as a tightly associated complex (42Pfaff I.L. Wagner H.J. Vallon V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1861-1873PubMed Google Scholar, 43Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, SOC in the inside-out patch is probably governed by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. In the intact cell, protein phosphatases are probably inhibited by endogenous phosphatase inhibitors (44Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar). An excision rundown can be attributed to a loss of phosphatase inhibitors allowing the phosphatase-dephosphorylating limb of the cycle to predominate. Thus, SOC reactivates when metavanadate, an exogenous phosphatase inhibitor, is added to the bathing solution. Further studies using specific inhibitors could reveal the specific phosphatases involved in this reaction.The Ca2+ sensitivity of SOC was determined in both cell-attached and inside-out patches. When cytosolic Ca2+concentration was clamped using 10 µm BAPTA, thapsigargin still significantly increased SOC activity. In the inside-out experiments, elevating the bath [Ca2+] from 1 µm to 100 µm or reducing the bath [Ca2+] to 100 nm failed to influence SOC activity. Based on these experiments, we conclude that SOC is not influenced by direct interaction with Ca2+.Differential Results Regarding PKC Regulation of SOCPKC modulates a variety of intracellular events by regulating the activity of ion channels (16Schubert R.

However, the results are extremely variable with respect to the regulation of SOC by PKC (8Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Bode H.P.

Hallam T.J. Merritt J.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several factors besides the differences in cell types could account for these large discrepancies. One recent study (8Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) used the whole cell configuration in X. oocytes and monitored a Ca2+-activated Cl− current as an indirect indicator of a store-depleted activation of Ca2+current. The present experiments in which single channel Ca2+ currents were monitored should be a more direct assessment of PKC-modulated SOC activity. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, PKC inhibited Ca2+ entry after the cells were exposed to PMA for 60 min (34Peterson C.C. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, incubation with PMA for only 60 min could down-regulate PKC activity (41Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15194-15199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the multifarious isoforms of PKC and their variable functions and intracellular distribution may lead to disparate interpretations (12Yano K. Bauchat J.R. Liimatta M.B. Duan C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Ács P. Raizada V. Wolfe P.C. Fewtrell C. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J.

In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, PMA increased Ca2+ entry at 1.6 µm but decreased Ca2+ entry at lower concentrations (34Peterson C.C. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different levels of PKC in different studies also might account for disparate results.Although some isoforms of PKC are activated by Ca2+, it is improbable that the Ca2+ released from stores is involved in activating SOC via PKC. The present and previous studies have shown that SOC is activated upon store depletion despite clamping Ca2+ with intracellular buffers. It is possible, however, that an unknown PKC stimulating phospholipid or protein is generated upon the depletion of internal stores. It is also possible that when the endoplasmic reticulum becomes Ca2+ depleted the cytoskeleton rearranges and activates PKC. It has been shown previously that the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton activates PKCα in mesenchymal cells (47Wu X.Y. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also reported that calponin, a cytoskeletal protein, may function in smooth muscle to regulate PKC activity by facilitating the phosphorylation of PKC (48Leinweber B. Parissenti A.M. Gallant C. Gangopadhyay S.S. Kirwwan-Rhude A. Leavis P.C. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40329-40336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activated PKC may then play a role in either translocating vesicles containing SOC to the plasma membrane or phosphorylating the SOC already existing in the membrane.Studies intending to identify the SOC protein led to the cloning of mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential trp gene (49Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bähner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 50Huber A. Sander P. Bahner M. Paulsen R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The trp gene family has been proposed to encode the SOC in nonexcitable cells (45Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Drosophila, PKC forms a supramolecular complex with trp and other proteins involved in Ca2+ mobilization (49Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bähner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This complex may be a regulatory unit for Ca2+ influx and could convey complex regulatory signals to modulate the activity of SOC (50Huber A. Sander P. Bahner M. Paulsen R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC),1 present in the plasma membrane of most nonexcitable cells (1Donnadieu E. Bismuth G.

Sci. 1998; 19: 266-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological pathway for activating SOC is initiated by an agonist binding to its receptor with a subsequent generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and release of internal stores of Ca2+. Thus, the major role for SOC is to replenish intracellular stores of Ca2+ (10Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 11Putney J.W. Mckay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the release of Ca2+ stores causes activation of SOC is not completely understood. Protein kinase C (PKC) has a significant role in signal transduction of several biologically active substances that regulate a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, migration, and vasoconstriction (9Gibson A.

We found that the activation level of the enzyme is unambiguously reflected by the kinetic dependence of the succinate oxidation rate upon the Q-redox poise. Kinetic results indicated that succinate dehydrogenase is activated by both ATP (K ½ ∼ 3 µm) and ADP. The carboxyatractyloside insensitivity of these stimulatory effects indicated that they occur at the cytoplasmic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Importantly, our novel approach revealed that the enzyme is also activated by oligomycin (K ½∼ 16 nm). Time-resolved kinetic measurements of succinate dehydrogenase activation by succinate furthermore revealed that the activity of the enzyme is negatively affected by potassium. The succinate-induced activation (±K +) is prevented by the presence of an uncoupler. Together these results demonstrate that in vitro activity of succinate dehydrogenase is modulated by the protonmotive force.

It couples the reduction of ubiquinone (Q)1 to the oxidation of succinate and is, as such, a Krebs cycle as well as a respiratory chain enzyme. This duality suggests a potentially important role in the control of energy metabolism, a reason why the enzyme's regulation has been the subject of previous extensive investigations in both mammalian (2Gutman M.

The isolation of succinate dehydrogenase from mammalian sources yields a predominantly deactivated enzyme due to the presence of tightly bound oxaloacetate (6Kearney E.B. Ackrell B.A.C. Mayr M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Ackrell B.A.C. Kearney E.B. Mayr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated enzyme, however, can be activated by substrates and substrate analogues (8Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 363-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by many anions, acid pH (9Kearney E.B. Mayr M. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2726-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, succinate dehydrogenase is activated by ATP (3Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) via a mechanism that, even to date, is poorly understood. In the presence of ADP or an uncoupler, the mammalian enzyme is rapidly deactivated (3Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Gutman et al. (3Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) attributed physiological relevance to these observations reasoning that deactivation of succinate dehydrogenase would benefit the cell when the ATP:ADP ratio is low, because it would allow faster NADH oxidation and hence more efficient ATP synthesis. The subsequently formed ATP would then activate the enzyme to allow turnover of the Krebs cycle to proceed in an unhindered fashion (3Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In plants, succinate dehydrogenase is activated by substrates, QH2, ATP, anions, and acid pH in a manner similar to that observed in mammalian systems (4Singer T.P. Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 616-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Singer T.P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of ADP on the plant enzyme, however, has not been established conclusively. Oestreicheret al. (5Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Singer T.P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in mung bean and cauliflower mitochondria, succinate dehydrogenase is activated rather than deactivated by ADP, and therefore they concluded that the physiological significance of ATP-induced activation in plants could not be the same as that proposed for mammalian systems. In Arum maculatummitochondria, on the other hand, succinate dehydrogenase, similar to the mammalian enzyme, appears to be deactivated by ADP (13Leach G.R. Krab K. Whitehouse D.G. Moore A.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The incomplete understanding of the activation of succinate dehydrogenase by adenine nucleotides, particularly in plants, might be partly due to the techniques employed to measure this regulatory phenomenon. Traditional assays of the activation state of succinate dehydrogenase involve artificial electron acceptors (4Singer T.P. Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 616-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Singer T.P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or are based on oxygen uptake measurements (14Douce R. Neuburger M. Givan C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 64-71Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Rustin P. Lance C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Casolo V. Zancani M. Macrı̀ F. Vianello A. Plant Sci. 1998; 136: 149-157Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These methods both have limitations; the former cannot be readily used in well coupled mitochondria, whereas the latter does not yield data that reflect specific succinate dehydrogenase activity. Evidently, data that are obtained in uncoupled systems using non-endogenous substrates are not easily interpreted in terms of their potential physiological relevance. By measuring the oxygen uptake rate and, simultaneously, the reduction level of the Q-pool (cf. Ref. 17Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), information can be obtained as to the kinetic behavior of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes (including succinate dehydrogenase) toward their natural substrates within a tightly coupled environment. Such modular kinetic measurements have previously yielded valuable data concerning the kinetic interplay between Q-reducing and QH2-oxidizing enzymes both in isolated plant and yeast mitochondria (18Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Affourtit C. Albury M.S. Krab K. Moore A.L. J. Biol.

Mathematical modeling of these kinetic data is proving an increasingly powerful tool in understanding the in vivo role of mitochondrial electron transfer (18Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K.

In this paper we have followed a modular kinetic approach to determine unequivocally the various activation states of succinate dehydrogenase in tightly coupled potato tuber mitochondria. It is confirmed that the enzyme is activated by both ATP and ADP, which, interestingly, appears to occur at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Importantly, our novel approach reveals that the activation state of succinate dehydrogenase is affected by oligomycin as well as by potassium. These observations suggest that in vitro activity of the plant succinate dehydrogenase can be modulated by the protonmotive force. Fresh potato tubers were purchased in a local supermarket and stored overnight at 4 °C. Mitochondria were isolated and purified according to a previously described protocol (24Whitehouse D.G. Fricaud A.-C. Moore A.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 487-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) either in the presence or the absence of added K+. The isolation and purification media used in the respective procedures were buffered at pH 7.4 with either MOPS/KOH or MOPS/NaOH. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared from male Wistar rats in the presence of K+essentially as described elsewhere (25Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Respiratory activity and the reduction level of the Q-pool were simultaneously measured voltametrically in a specially constructed chamber (University of Sussex) housing a Rank oxygen electrode and glassy carbon and platinum electrodes connected to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode similar to that described by Moore et al. (17Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In experiments with mitochondria isolated in the absence of K+, the reference electrode was connected via a NaCl, rather than a KCl, agar bridge. Mitochondria were incubated in 2.2-ml reaction medium (medium A) that contained mannitol (0.3 m), MgCl2 (1 mm), K2HPO4 (5 mm), KCl (10 mm), MOPS (20 mm, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH), and ubiquinone-1 (1 µm). K+ salts were replaced by Na+ salts (medium B) in experiments with mitochondria isolated in the absence of K+. Other chemicals were added as indicated in the figure legends. Data were recorded digitally using a PowerLab/4SP system (ADInstruments Pty Ltd., UK) connected to iMac running Chart version 3.6s software (ADInstruments Pty Ltd.). Similar to their mammalian counterparts, fresh potato tuber mitochondria contain only the cytochrome pathway through which reducing equivalents are transferred from QH2 to oxygen. Upon oxidation of succinate, the respiratory chain in isolated potato mitochondria can therefore be considered to consist of two kinetic units that “communicate” through a single intermediate, the Q-pool. This pool is reduced by the combined action of succinate dehydrogenase and the dicarboxylate carrier (to allow succinate entry into the mitochondrial matrix) and subsequently oxidized by the cytochrome pathway (cf. Ref. 23Affourtit C. Krab K. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 59-70Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Activation of the Q-reducing side of the respiratory system (from this point simply referred to as SDH) will result in an increased rate of electron transfer and, concomitantly, in an increased reduction level of the Q-pool. On the other hand, stimulation of the QH2-oxidizing side will also cause an increased respiratory activity, but this will be accompanied by a decreased rather than an increased Q-reduction level. Simultaneous steady state measurement of the O2-uptake rate and the Q-redox poise will therefore readily reveal which side of the respiratory system is activated. This is clearly illustrated by the data shown in Fig. 1. The addition of succinate to a reaction mixture containing potato tuber mitochondria results in a 20–35% reduction of the Q-pool and in an oxygen uptake rate of ∼30 nmol of O2/min/mg (Fig. 1). The subsequent addition of ATP causes a slight increase in the respiratory rate and, significantly, a striking further reduction of the Q-pool (to ∼80%). The addition of ADP results in a substantially increased rate (typical respiratory control ratio ∼ 4) and in an oxidation of the Q-pool to ∼60% (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating that electron transfer is tightly coupled to phosphorylation. The considerable ATP-dependent rise in the Q-redox poise, together with the small but detectable increase in respiratory rate, confirms that SDH is activated by ATP. This activation is insensitive to CAT (Fig. 1 B), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (27Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 210: 1-14Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which suggests that ATP exerts its stimulatory effect at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. The addition of ADP in the presence of CAT does not significantly affect the respiratory rate or the Q-redox poise (Fig. 1 B), confirming that CAT prevents ADP entry into the matrix. As anticipated, CCCP-induced uncoupling also causes an increase in the respiratory rate (∼5-fold) as well as a substantial oxidation of the Q-pool (to ∼35%; Fig. 1 B). ATP-induced activation of SDH has, to our knowledge, not been quantified to date. The relatively large and fast change observed in the Q-redox poise (Fig. 1, A and B), however, readily enables quantification (Fig. 1 C). The level of activation can be defined as the difference between the Q-redox poise that is attained in the presence of succinate + ATP and the Q-reduction level that is reached in the presence of succinate alone (Fig.1 C, inset). A measure of relative activation is obtained by expressing the activation level observed at a limiting ATP concentration (A) as a fraction of that seen at a saturating concentration (T). The titration data presented in Fig. 1 Cshow that SDH is activated half-maximally by ∼3 µmATP. It has been reported previously (5Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Singer T.P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that SDH in mung bean and cauliflower mitochondria is not only activated by ATP but also by ADP. The addition of ADP to fresh potato mitochondria that were pre-incubated in the presence of CAT and Ap5A (inhibitor of adenylate kinase (28Lienard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) caused an immediate and significant reduction of the Q-pool (from ∼20 to ∼80%) as well as an increase in the respiratory rate (Fig. 2A). This indicates that SDH is indeed activated by ADP. That this activation is affected neither by CAT nor by Ap5A shows that the effect is not due to indirect ATP formation through phosphorylation of ADP within the mitochondrial matrix or through adenylate kinase activity within the intermembrane space, respectively. These observations demonstrate that SDH activity is stimulated by ADP per se,which, similar to the activation by ATP, occurs at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Such an activation is in contrast with the observation that SDH is deactivated by ADP in Arummitochondria (13Leach G.R. Krab K. Whitehouse D.G. Moore A.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the deactivation in Arum was observed in the absence of CAT. Addition of ADP under such conditions causes an oxidation of the Q-pool (cf. Fig. 1 A) and most likely a decrease of the membrane potential (Δψ) because of proton flux into the matrix through the ATP synthase (cf. Ref. 29Moore A.L. Bonner W.D. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it cannot be excluded that the observed deactivation of SDH by ADP inArum mitochondria is accounted for by these effects (cf. “Discussion”). The Q-redox poise attained in potato mitochondria upon the addition of ADP in the presence of CAT is not significantly affected by the subsequent addition of ATP (Fig.2 A). This suggests that both nucleotides activate SDH in a similar fashion. The respiratory trace shown in Fig. 2 Bconfirms that Ap5A indeed inhibits adenylate kinase activity, because its presence prevents an AMP-induced state 3 (cf. Ref.30Fricaud A.C. Walters A.J. Whitehouse D.G. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 253-261Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The effects of adenine nucleotides may implicate the mitochondrial ATP synthase, even though activation of SDH by these compounds occurs in the presence of CAT. To assess this possibility, ATP-induced activation was studied in the presence of oligomycin. It was found that oligomycin does not affect the activation by ATP (data not shown). Importantly, oligomycin alone appears to activate SDH. This is illustrated by the data presented in Fig. 3A, which show that addition of oligomycin to mitochondria oxidizing succinate results in a considerable and immediate reduction of the Q-pool (to ∼70%) and in a small but significant increase in the respiratory activity (from ∼30 to ∼60 nmol of O2/min/mg). Similar effects are observed when oligomycin is substituted by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, another inhibitor of the ATP synthase (data not shown). The subsequent addition of CCCP results in a strong oxidation of the Q-redox poise (to ∼25%) and does not affect the oxygen uptake rate significantly. This indicates that the oligomycin-induced activation of SDH is reversed by CCCP. When ATP is added under these conditions, reactivation of SDH occurs, which is reflected in a gradually increasing respiratory rate and Q-reduction level (Fig. 3 A). This reactivation, however, is significantly slower than the ATP-induced activation observed in the absence of oligomycin and CCCP (cf. Figs. 3 A and1 A). In Fig. 3 B the oligomycin-induced activation is presented quantitatively and expressed as a fraction of the activation that is achieved in the presence of a saturating amount of ATP. It can be inferred from Fig. 3 B that activation of SDH by oligomycin is not to the same extent as that by ATP (maximal activation by oligomycin is ∼85% of the stimulation observed at a saturating ATP concentration) and that half-maximal stimulation occurs at ∼16 nm. It has previously been reported that oligomycin causes an increase in Δψ when added to potato mitochondria oxidizing succinate under state 2 conditions (30Fricaud A.C. Walters A.J. Whitehouse D.G. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 253-261Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that SDH is not directly activated by oligomycin but indirectly by an increased Δψ. This notion agrees well with the observed deactivating effect of CCCP (Fig. 3 A). It has recently become apparent that plants contain a mitochondrial ion channel that mediates unidirectional K+ entry into the matrix (31Pastore D. Carmela Stopelli M. Di Fonzo N. Passarella S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26683-26690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The activity of this K+ channel effectively de-energizes the inner membrane and, importantly, is inhibited by both ATP and ADP (31Pastore D. Carmela Stopelli M. Di Fonzo N. Passarella S. J. Biol.

Thus, when mitochondria are incubated in the presence of KCl, succinate alone is incapable of generating a Δψ. However, Δψ is readily established in the additional presence of ATP or indeed in the absence of KCl (31Pastore D. Carmela Stopelli M. Di Fonzo N. Passarella S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26683-26690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that activation of SDH by adenine nucleotides, similar to that by oligomycin, is mediated by Δψ. To explore this possibility further, activation experiments were performed with mitochondria isolated either in the presence or the total absence of K+. From Fig. 4A (trace 1) it can be seen that the addition of succinate to mitochondria isolated in K+-containing media results in an initial Q-reduction level of ∼10%. Over a period of ∼6 min the Q-pool becomes gradually more reduced (to ∼40%), indicating a relatively slow succinate-induced activation of SDH. Under these conditions, however, a steady state Q-redox poise (i.e. SDH activation level) is not reached before oxygen is exhausted. On the other hand, when succinate is added to mitochondria isolated in the absence of K+, a comparatively rapid increase in Q-reduction is observed (Fig. 4 A, trace 2). Under these conditions, a steady state Q-redox poise (∼80%) is achieved prior to anaerobiosis. Activation of SDH by succinate is almost completely prevented by CCCP, as evidenced by the low and steady Q-redox poise that is attained in samples either containing or lacking K+ (Fig. 4 A, traces 3 and 4, respectively). In both samples, the fastest and most substantial activation is observed in the presence of ATP, which is reflected by a Q-redox poise of ∼95% reached within 1 min following the addition of succinate (Fig. 4 A, traces 5and 6). In Fig. 4 B data are presented from a typical experiment using mitochondria isolated in the absence of K+. It is clear that activation by succinate (Fig. 4 B, trace 1) is significantly slower when KCl is added to the reaction mixture (Fig.4 B, trace 4). The resultant activation kinetics are indeed very similar to those observed in mitochondria isolated in the presence of KCl (cf. Fig. 4 A, trace 1). Activation by succinate is also slow in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 4 B, trace 3), albeit to a lesser extent than in the presence of KCl. Cholinechloride does not significantly affect the activation (Fig. 4 B, trace 2) confirming that the observed effects are cation- rather than chloride-induced. In rat liver mitochondria, the Q-pool is rapidly reduced to almost 100% upon the addition of succinate (Fig. 4 C, trace 1; note that K+ was present during isolation but absent in the assay). In this system, SDH is therefore fully activated by succinate alone, which is also apparent from the observation that ATP has no significant additional effect (Fig. 4 C, trace 2). The activation by succinate (±ATP) appears to be even somewhat faster than the ATP-induced activation of SDH observed in potato tuber mitochondria, isolated ±KCl (Fig. 4 C, compare traces 1 and 2 with traces 3 and 4). It is evident from the above results that Q-reduction measurements provide important information on SDH activation, particularly in terms of time-resolved kinetics. However, the Q-kinetic method is most powerful when Q-reduction levels are related to the corresponding oxygen uptake rates. Titration of the respiratory activity with an appropriate inhibitor thus reveals the kinetic dependence of both Q-reducing and QH2-oxidizing enzymes upon the reduction level of the Q-pool (18Van den Bergen C.W.M.

In Fig. 5A the steady states reached upon oxidation of succinate in the presence of various malonate concentrations are shown, reflecting the kinetic behavior of the cytochrome pathway. It is clear that the rate of electron transfer through this pathway under state 4 conditions increases only slightly with the Q-redox poise. The presence of ADP alters these kinetics such that respiratory activity is substantially increased at any Q-reduction level. A further slight stimulation of the oxygen uptake rate, at Q-reduction levels greater than ∼20% only, is observed when respiration is uncoupled by CCCP. Also shown in Fig.5 A are steady states that were attained upon oxidation of NADH both in the presence and the absence of ADP. It is clear that the NADH data are readily described by the appropriate kinetic curves fitted through the succinate data. This confirms that activity of the cytochrome pathway is kinetically independent of Q-reducing enzymes. The kinetic behavior of SDH with respect to the Q-reduction level was determined by titrating the succinate-dependent respiratory activity with antimycin A. From Fig. 5 B it is evident that these kinetics are clearly affected by ATP such that SDH activity is stimulated at any Q-redox poise. A similar, although less substantial, effect on SDH kinetics is exerted by oligomycin. Both observations clearly demonstrate that Q-kinetic measurements unequivocally establish the different activation levels of SDH under tightly coupled (cf. Fig. 5 A) conditions. The curves that describe the kinetics of SDH and the cytochrome pathway as well as the steady states reached upon oxidation of succinate in the absence of malonate and antimycin A are displayed together in Fig.6A. Several aspects concerning SDH activation are further clarified by this Q-kinetic representation. First, the steady state achieved in the presence of oligomycin and CCCP (Fig. 6 A, ○) is closer to the kinetic curve representing the inactive SDH (Fig. 6 A, SDH (I)) than to the curve describing the oligomycin-activated enzyme (Fig.6 A, SDH (OLI)); this corroborates the earlier observation (cf. Fig. 3 A) that activation by oligomycin is reversed by CCCP. Second, a notable difference can be observed between the steady states reached upon oxidation of succinate alone in mitochondria isolated either with K+ (Fig.6 A, ■) or without K+ (Fig. 6 A, ▪). The presence of K+ results in a steady state (■) that is perfectly modeled by the inactive SDH curve (Fig.6 A, SDH (I)), whereas the absence of K+ causes the respiratory state (▪) to shift toward a position that is better described by the active SDH curve (Fig.6 A, SDH (ATP)). Note, however, that a (small) difference does exist between the succinate-induced steady state (−K+; Fig. 6 A, ▪) and that attained in the presence of ATP (±K+; Fig. 6 A, ⋄). Finally, it is evident that CCCP effectively prevents the activation of SDH by succinate (±K+; Fig. 6 A, ▾). Importantly, all these steady states are modeled accurately by the curves representing the kinetics of the cytochrome pathway under state 4 (Fig. 6 A, CYT (ST4)) or uncoupled (Fig. 6 A, CYT(CCCP)) conditions, confirming that it is not the activity of this pathway but indeed that of SDH that is modulated by oligomycin and K+. For comparative reasons and because, to our knowledge, this information has not yet been reported, we also studied Q-pool kinetics in rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 6 B). Although relatively few mammalian data were obtained, it is clear that this system is somewhat different from that in potato. Most notable are the differences in the specific (i.e. pe"

They are characterized by a conserved core region of ∼300 amino acids that contains eight highly conserved domains. Some of these motifs are involved in hydrolyzing NTP, mainly ATP, and in coupling the hydrolysis to the unwinding process. RNA helicases have also been nicknamed DEAD-box helicases after the conserved motif II, the so-called DEAD box (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp). Amino acid variation in the DEAD-box motif further divides the RNA helicases into three subfamilies, subsequently called the DEAD, DEAH, and DExH families (reviewed in Ref. 1Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The number of members assigned to the DEAD-box family has increased substantially over the past few years. They have been found in all organisms and many viruses. RNA helicases form a diverse group of enzymes participating in essentially all cellular processes that involve RNA: transcription, translation, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA transport, etc. Helicase activity has only been demonstrated for a few of the proteins grouped as members of the RNA helicase family. However, many of these proteins hydrolyze NTP, mainly ATP, in the presence of RNA and are therefore RNA-dependent NTPases or putative helicases. This may in part reflect their substrate specificity or cofactor requirements for RNA helicase activity. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) with local replication, transcription, and translation functions. The majority of their proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and transported into the mitochondria. A few of these proteins are shared between the mitochondria and the rest of the cell. In some cases separate isoforms of the same protein are transported either to the nucleus or to the mitochondria (2Otterlei M. Haug T. Nagelhus T.A. Slupphaug G. Lindmo T. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4611-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In other cases, different genes in the nuclear genome code for proteins that perform the same function in mitochondria and elsewhere in the cell. Examples of this are the proteins of the mitochondrial ribosomes that share little homology with those of cytoplasmic ribosomes (3O'Brien T.W. Fiesler S.E. Denslow N.D. Thiede B. Wittmann-Liebold B.

Four putative RNA helicases located to mitochondria have been described in other organisms. Two are found in yeast: Suv3, which belongs to the DExH subfamily (4Stepien P.P. Margossian S.P.

Fragments containing a previously localized CpG island were subcloned into pZero-2 to give, among others, pEco29 (2.9 kb,2 GenBankTMAccession Number AF329821) and pKURT (a 1.1-kb insert in pEco29, from base 179–1346) (10Frengen E.

Three clones were obtained from a human testis cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. K. Taskèn, University of Oslo) and hybridized to pEco29. Deletion clones were made from pEco29, pKURT, and the cDNA clones and sequenced on an ALF DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences were aligned using the Gene Skipper program (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). To make the MBP-MDDX28 fusion protein for purification, theMDDX28 gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the genomic clone (pEco29u) using the PfuII enzyme (Stratagene). Both the forward (GGGATCCATGGCTCTAGCGCGGCCGG) and the reverse (GGGGATCCCTCAGGTTGCTTGGGGCAA) primers introducedBamHI sites. The insert was subcloned usingEcoRV sites into pZero-2 (Invitrogen) and withBamHI sites into pMal-cRI (New England Biolabs) in XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). The construct was moved into the protease-deficient strain 801-K (New England Biolabs). The MDDX28 gene was also cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) with polymerase chain reaction usingPfuII and the forward primer GGGATCCAGCCACCATGGCTCTAGCGCGGCCGG and the reverse primer GGTGGATCCAAGGTTGCTTGGGGCAAAGGC viaEcoRV-digested pZero. The MBP-MDDX28 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli 801-K according to instructions from New England Biolabs. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm Cameo 25 gas filter (Micron Separations, Inc.) and loaded onto an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs). The column was washed with 15 volumes of the binding buffer, and the protein was eluted with binding buffer containing 10 mmd-(+) maltose (Janssen Chimica). The purified protein was concentrated on a 10K Microsep centrifugal concentrator (Pall Filtron) and further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Prepgrade Superdex column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cleaving of the fusion protein was attempted with factor Xa (Hematologic Technologies) at an ∼1:50 (enzyme/substrate) molar ratio, but this resulted in degradation of the MDDX28 protein, which has several putative cleavage sites for factor Xa. The MBP part of the fusion protein, however, remained intact and was used as a negative control in the ATPase assay. The insert from pKURT was hybridized to a human multiple-tissue Northern blot membrane (CLONTECH) using standard methods. The mRNA half-life was estimated in COS-1 cells treated with 10 µg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). The cells were harvested by washing in ice-cold PBS, then scraped off into 0.6 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate, and 5 mmdithiothreitol), and sheared with a 21-gauge syringe. For the isolation of mRNA, oligo(dT)-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal) were used according to manufacturer instructions. Samples were run on agarose/formaldehyde gels in MOPS buffer and blotted in 10× SSC buffer. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in ExpressHybTM solution (CLONTECH). For the detection of MDDX28, a 1.1-kb insert from pEco29 was used (p1b2a, from base pairs 1608–2751). Complete cDNA was used to generate a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The filters were scanned on STORM 860 (Molecular Dynamics), and quantification was done with ImageQuant 5.1 (Molecular Dynamics). Rabbit oligoclonal antibodies were raised against two peptides from MDDX28 (QRQLEQRQSRRRNLPR, position 43–58 (Ab27), and KSRRARRDHFSIERAQQE, position 98–115 (Ab29)) selected for their hydrophilicity. The peptides were synthesized using an ABI 430A, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine, and injected into rabbits. The antibodies were purified on a protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), concentrated on a 10K Microsep centrifugal concentrator (Pall Filtron) to 10 mg/ml, aliquoted, and kept at −20 °C until use. COS-1 cells were grown on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Integro) and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). At the appropriate times, the coverslips were washed briefly in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. The cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked for 30 min in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed three times, and incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO). When appropriate, the cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) or Cy-3-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) before mounting. The samples were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope, and the pictures were taken with a SPOT digital camera and combined with SPOT32 software (Diagnostic Instruments). The MDDX28-EGFP-N1 construct was transfected into COS-1 cells using the FuGene6 transfection reagent in a 4:1 FuGene/plasmid ratio according to the Roche protocol. COS-1 cells were treated as described by Burtelow et al. (15Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with minor changes to yield mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. Briefly, the cells were washed in PBS and lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml antipain, 10 µg/ml chymostatin, 10 µg/ml phosphoramidon, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cells were then homogenized, and the buffer was adjusted to 250 mm sucrose (Sigma) with lysis buffer containing 1m sucrose. Cells were centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min to obtain the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min to obtain a mitochondria-containing pellet. The protein components of the fractions were used in immunoblotting experiments with the MDDX28-specific antibody (Ab27). The fractionation was checked by immunoblotting with antibody against the nucleolar protein NO38 (a kind gift from Dr. Trond Stokke, The Norwegian Radiumhospital, Oslo, Norway). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were grown for 20–24 h on coverslips before treatment with the following transcription or translation inhibitors: 10 µg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma), 10 µg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma), 100 µg/ml 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Calbiochem), 10 µm Tagetin (Epicentre), or 10 µg/ml cycloheximide. At various times the cells were fixed as described above and viewed immediately in the fluorescence microscope. The samples were scored blindly for nuclear localization of the fusion protein by counting at least 100 cells/sample. ATPase activity of purified MBP-MDDX28 protein was measured as described by Iggo and Lane (16Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, to 30 µl of ATPase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) containing 5 µl of purified fusion protein (2.5 µg, estimated from a silver-stained gel) or controls, 200 pmol of cold ATP and 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added. The samples were incubated at 37 °C. At each time point, 5 µl of sample were withdrawn and added to 300 µl of 7% activated charcoal (Sigma) in 50 mm HCl/5 mmH3PO4. The charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation (10 min at 11,000 × g) to remove unreacted ATP. The supernatant (100 µl) was mixed with Pico Aqua liquid scintillation mixture (Packard) and counted in a Packard 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer. COS-1 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with MDDX28-EGFP-N1. Five h post-transfection 100 µm carbonyl cyanidep-(trichloromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (CCCP, Sigma) was added to the cell culture, and the cells were incubated for an additional 5 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% PFA and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Heterokaryon assays were performed as described by Càceres et al. (17Càceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with MDDX28-EGFP-N1. Twenty to twenty-four h post-transfection, excess untransfected NIH/3T3 cells were added to the COS-1 culture and incubated in the presence of 50 µg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h. The cycloheximide concentration was then increased to 100 µg/ml for 0.5 h before the cells were washed in PBS and fused for 2 min with PEG-4000 (Merck). The cells were then washed thoroughly in PBS and incubated in fresh medium containing 100 µg/ml of cycloheximide. One h later the cells were fixed in 4% PFA and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to distinguish COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells. The samples were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. When appropriate, 100 µm CCCP was added to the cell culture immediately after the fusion, and the cells were fixed 1 h later. The 5′ end of the MDDX28 gene lies within a sequence that shows CpG island characteristics (Ref. 18Larsen F. Gundersen G. Prydz H. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Fig.1). A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was attempted, but it did not give interpretable results, probably because of the high GC content (data not shown). Therefore, the start site of the gene has not been determined conclusively. However, we assumed a start site at the only ATG within the CpG island, which was followed by an open reading frame, consistent with the size of the MDDX28 mRNA and protein. The gene spans 1623 base pairs from the proposed start site and ends with TGA. A canonical polyadenylation signal AAUAAA is found 253 base pairs downstream of the stop codon, and the cDNA clone continues for an additional 20 base pairs before the poly(A) tail starts. This indicates that the total size of the mRNA is about 2 kb, which agrees with the size seen on Northern blots (Fig.2). The cDNA sequence is identical with the genomic sequence with no introns. The corresponding open reading frame indicates a protein of 540 amino acids (Fig. 1) and a calculated molecular mass of 59 kDa containing three cysteine residues. The codon usage pattern does not deviate significantly from the average of mammalian genes. The calculated pI of the MDDX28 protein is ∼11.Figure 2Northern blot analysis.

Biochem. 1998; 123: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) consisting of 16 amino acids, potentially forming an amphiphilic α-helix with a net positive charge (data not shown). MDDX28 has also a putative nuclear localization signal at amino acids 520–523 (RRRR) and a putative leucine-rich nuclear export signal at amino acids 180–191 (LSYLLPLLQRLL). There are 19 potential serine sites and four potential threonine sites but no tyrosine phosphorylation sites, as predicted with the NetPhos 2.0 software (20Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). The protein has all the well conserved DEAD-box helicase motifs (Fig.1). Sequence similarity searches with BLASTP 2.0.12 (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) revealed ∼30% similarity with other described putative RNA helicases in a region of 300–400 amino acids. The similarities are clustered around the conserved motifs. No homologues were found, and MDDX28 did not show any more similarity to previously described mitochondrial RNA helicases than to other RNA helicases (Fig. 3). A low stringency BLASTP search (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) using the first 130 amino acids of the protein revealed no similarity with previously characterized RNA helicases. Hybridization of pKURT to RNA from various human tissues showed that the MDDX28 transcript is about 2.0 kb. The gene was transcribed in all tissues studied (Fig. 2 A). The half-life of the mRNA was estimated to be 45 min (Fig.2 B). The purified recombinant MBP-MDDX28 fusion protein (102 kDa, Fig.4A) was used to assess the ATPase activity. As a negative control we used purified MBP, off of which MDDX28 had been cleaved with factor Xa. The purified fusion protein showed marked ATP hydrolysis activity, whereas MBP alone showed none (Fig. 4 B). MgCl2was necessary for the ATPase activity (data not shown). Furthermore, no hydrolysis was observed when ATP was replaced with GTP (data not shown). The purified recombinant protein was already bound to RNA as observed with UV spectroscopy. This revealed a peak at 260 nm in addition to the peaks at 210 and 280 nm (data not shown). The presence of RNA was confirmed when bacteria grown in the presence of [14C]-UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were lysed, and the MBP-MDDX28 protein was pulled down using amylose resin. This showed the presence of radioactive RNA that was not present when only MBP was pulled down. To remove the RNA, recombinant protein was treated with 10 µg/ml of either RNase T1 or A (Sigma) while the protein was bound to the amylose resin. The beads were subsequently washed to remove the RNase before the protein was eluted from the beads. This resulted in a loss of the ATP hydrolysis activity of the recombinant protein (Fig.4 B). The ATPase activity was not rescued by the addition of total RNA from COS-1 cells (Fig. 4 B). These results show that the purified MDDX28 protein has ATPase activity that depends on the presence of both RNA and Mg2+ ions. The MDDX28 protein was C-terminally tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein (MDDX28-EGFP-N1), and its subcellular localization was studied in transiently transfected cells. The fusion protein was localized in the mitochondria of all the transfected cells (Fig.5A). The mitochondrial localization was confirmed by using either an antibody to cyclooxygenase I or Cy-3-conjugated ExtrAvidine (Sigma), which specifically stains mitochondria (Ref. 22Ruggiero F.P. Sheffield J.B. J. Histochem. Cytohistochem. 1998; 46: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and data not shown). The mitochondrial localization of the MDDX28 protein was predominantly disperse, but apparently the protein was concentrated in one spot in the mitochondria in some cells (Fig. 5 B). The MDDX28 protein was present in the nucleus in about half of the transfected cells. The nuclear signal was disperse, with the protein also present in the nucleoli in a small fraction of the cells (Fig.5 C). Endogenous MDDX28 stained with the oligoclonal primary antibodies revealed similar mitochondrial- and faint nuclear-staining patterns (Fig. 5 E). The nuclear localization of the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein varied with time post-transfection. Eight h post-transfection, the protein was only present in the mitochondria. The nuclear localization of MDDX28 increased with time post-transfection, reaching a plateau after 24 h when the protein was seen in about half of the cells. The nucleolar signal was seen in up to 20% of the cells 24 h post-transfection but was not detected 48 h post-transfection (data not shown). MDDX28 contains a putative leucine-rich nuclear export signal (Fig. 1) found in proteins exported via the CRM1/exportin 1 pathway, which is sensitive to leptomycin B (23Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 24Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The number of transfected cells showing nuclear localization of MDDX28 was not significantly altered when the cells were treated with leptomycin B (100 ng/ml, a kind gift from Dr. B. Wolff-Winiski, Novartis). No difference was seen in the size of the MDDX28 protein isolated from the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 5 F). The fractionation was controlled with an antibody against the nucleolar protein NO38. The import of the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein to the mitochondria was inhibited when CCCP, an uncoupler of the mitochondrial electron transport that also inhibits the import of proteins to the mitochondria, was added to cell cultures 5 h post-transfection and the cells were cultured for another 5 h (Fig.6E). The protein was, however, present in the nucleus of the transfected cells, and excess protein did not appear to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The addition of cycloheximide (10 µg/ml) (Fig. 7A) or actinomycin D (10 µg/ml, data not shown) to COS-1 cells demonstrated that the level of MDDX28 protein in immunoblotting of cell extracts was essentially constant for at least 24 h. This long half-life made it possible to study the intracellular localization of MDDX28 in response to inhibitors of RNA synthesis even though the mRNA half-life of MDDX28 was short. Twenty- to twenty-four h after the transfection of COS-1 cells with MDDX28-EGFP-N1, the cells were treated with the RNA polymerase inhibitors actinomycin D and α-amanitin. This resulted in the disappearance of the fluorescent signal from the nucleus of the majority of cells after a further 24-h incubation (Fig.7 B), but the mitochondrial signal was retained. This effect became even more apparent when the inhibitors were added earlier (4–8 h post-transfection, Fig. 7 B). In comparison, cells transfected with EGFP-N1 only (Fig. 5 D) showed no change in subcellular localization of the fluorescent protein upon inhibition with actinomycin D. Inhibition of protein synthesis with 10 µg/ml cycloheximide for 24 h had no effect on localization (Fig.7 B), suggesting that processes related to transcription and not de novo protein synthesis are crucial for the subcellular localization of the MDDX28 protein. Actinomycin D inhibits all RNA transcription, and α-amanitin inhibits polymerase II and III (27Lindell T.J. Weinberg F. Morris P.W. Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Science. 1970; 170: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We conclude that the subcellular localization of MDDX28 depends directly or indirectly on active polymerase II transcription, because inhibition with the polymerase III-specific inhibitor, Tagetin (28Steinberg T.H. Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not alter the localization significantly (Fig. 7 B). Treatment with the reversible transcription inhibitor DRB resulted in the disappearance of the nuclear signal from half of the cells after only 4 h. The signal was restored within 30 min after the removal of DRB even in the presence of 10 µg/ml cycloheximide to inhibitde novo synthesis of proteins (Fig. 7 C). The same results were obtained when cycloheximide was added to the cell culture 1 h before the removal of DRB and kept on after the removal of DRB (data not shown). Thus the effect of transcription inhibition on MDDX28 localization was reversible. The distribution of the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein was examined 1 h post-fusion of the COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells. To distinguish the nuclei derived from mouse and monkey cells, the cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 after fixation (Fig. 6, B and C). The fusion protein derived from the monkey cells was detected in the majority of the nuclei derived from the mouse cells, indicating that the protein had been exported from the nuclei or mitochondria of the monkey cells to the mouse nuclei. The fusion protein was also seen in essentially all the mitochondria of the heterokaryon cells (Fig. 6 A). When cells were treated with CCCP immediately after the fusion, the protein did not translocate to the mouse mitochondria, but the nuclear transport appeared to be normal (Fig. 6 C). DNA replication, RNA transcription, and ribosome biogenesis are important mitochondrial processes. It has long been recognized that RNA helicase function must be a necessary component of these activities. We describe here a novel human RNA-dependent ATPase of the DEAD-box family, MDDX28, which to our knowledge is the first putative RNA helicase with mitochondrial localization to be described in mammals. The gene is located on the human chromosome 16q22.1 and is a typical housekeeping gene, being expressed in all tissues investigated. Correspondingly, its 5′ end is covered by a CpG island (18Larsen F. Gundersen G. Prydz H. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TheMDDX28 gene encodes a protein that displays ∼30% similarity at the amino acid level with other putative RNA helicases over the best-conserved core region. It contains all the conserved DEAD-box helicase motifs. The MDDX28 protein exhibits ATPase activity, which apparently depends on RNA, because RNase treatment of the RNA-containing purified protein abolished this activity. We have, however, not been able to rescue the activity by adding back total RNA from COS-1 cells. This may suggest that MDDX28 needs a specific RNA target or an additional factor to interact with the RNA. Several other helicases (DbpA, Dbp5, and RhlB) have been suggested to need cofactors to be able to function as RNA helicases (reviewed in Ref. 29Pugh G.E. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to explore putative cofactors needed for MDDX28 function. A common concept is that the highly conserved domains of the DEAD-box helicases contribute to their RNA helicase activity, whereas the N- and C-terminals of the proteins determine their functional specificity. MDDX28 has no significant homology with other hitherto described RNA helicases over its first 130 N-terminal amino acids, suggesting that MDDX28 has a novel function, although folding similarity with other helicases cannot be excluded. MDDX28 is not homologous to any of the four other mitochondrial RNA helicases described and does not show more similarity to these than to other RNA helicases. The MDDX28 protein is localized both to the mitochondria and the nucleus, which is consistent with the putative MTS and the nuclear localization signal carried by the protein. A subfraction of the cells displayed the protein also in the nucleolus, raising the possibility that MDDX28 may have a function in relation to ribosomal RNA. We have found that the protein is very stable when COS-1 cells are treated with cycloheximide, making it possible to study the effect of inhibitors of transcription on the distribution of the protein. Unexpectedly, the RNA polymerase inhibitors, actinomycin D, DRB, and α-amanitin, caused the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein to disappear from the nucleus of the majority of cells but remain in the mitochondria. The nuclear localization specifically depended on active RNA polymerase II transcription or products thereof and was not affected by inhibition ofde novo protein synthesis. The effects of DRB on the subcellular localization of the fusion protein were shown to be reversible, as the protein returned to the nucleus when DRB was removed from the medium, in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor. These results suggested that MDDX28 could shuttle to and from the nucleus, consistent with its putative nuclear import and export signals, and depending on ongoing RNA synthesis. Bearing in mind that MDDX28 can bind RNA, it is possible that the protein is involved in RNA processing or transport. The shuttling ability of the fusion protein was studied further in a system independent of transcription inhibition using an interspecies heterokaryon assay. Untransfected NIH/3T3 mouse embryo cells were fused to MDDX28-EGFP-N1-transfected COS-1 cells derived from monkey kidney. A high concentration of cycloheximide was maintained throughout the experiment to prevent de novo synthesis of protein; therefore, all fusion protein present in the heterokaryons would have originated in the transfected COS-1 cells and have been present in its nucleus or mitochondria prior to the fusion. The heterokaryon assay clearly showed that the protein could shuttle to the mouse nucleus. Unlike other shuttling proteins that mainly reside in the nucleus, the MDDX28 protein showed no detectable accumulation in the cytoplasm during the transcriptional inhibition. The protein was still found in the mitochondria of the transfected cells 24 h after the transcription inhibition. This suggested that either the protein was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it was readily broken down and thus could not be observed or it was translocated from the nucleus to the mitochondria. It was therefore of interest to study the possibility for nucleo-mitochondrial transport further. In the heterokaryon assay, the mitochondria of the heterokaryons, regardless of their origin, appeared to contain the fusion protein 1 h post cell fusion. However, when the cells were treated from the time of cell fusion with CCCP, which inhibits the import of the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein to the mitochondria, the protein appeared to be transported normally to the nucleus of the mouse cells but did not translocate to the mitochondria. Excess protein did not appear to accumulate in the cytoplasm. This indicated that in the absence of CCCP, the fusion protein could be transported to the mitochondria derived from the mouse cells either from the nucleus or the mitochondria of the monkey cells. To test whether the transport of MDDX28 could also occur in the opposite direction, from mitochondria to the nucleus, cells were treated with the reversible transcription inhibitor DRB. This caused the protein to be translocated from the nucleus. The protein reappeared very rapidly in the nucleus when DRB was removed and DRB-free medium was added. Because the experiment was performed in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis and the protein did not visibly accumulate in the cytoplasm upon transcription inhibition, the nuclear-localized protein could only have derived from protein that was pre-existing in the mitochondria. These results therefore suggest that the protein can also be transported from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Several mitochondrial-matrix proteins have been found previously at unexpected locations in the cell (reviewed in Ref. 30Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 174-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a mechanism(s) for the export of proteins from the mitochondria. For nucleo-mitochondrial shuttling to be possible the protein must, however, retain its MTS after the mitochondrial import. Fractionation of cells and immunoblotting of the MDDX28 protein showed that the size of the protein in the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions was identical, indicating that the mitochondrial targeting signal peptide was not cleaved off when the protein located to the mitochondria. In conclusion, we have cloned a novel human putative RNA helicase encoding a protein that is localized within mitochondria and nucleus. Our findings suggest that MDDX28 is transported between these two compartments, making it possible that MDDX28 is involved in communication between the mitochondria and nucleus. Molecular communication from the mitochondria to nucleus is a relatively uncharted phenomenon. Several pathways have been suggested but none have yet been discovered. MDDX28 might serve as a tool for studies of these processes."

A number of organo-phosphates may, however, serve as substrates for the enzymesin vitro. The enzymes are classified as PTPs on the basis of a unique sequence of amino acids ((I/V)HCX 5R(S/T)) that is found in their active sites and serves to provide a binding site for the phosphotyrosine substrate (4Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The invariant cysteine residue in the signature motif provides the active site nucleophile for the hydrolysis of the tyrosine phosphate; a mechanism that proceeds through an enzyme-substrate intermediate (5Guan K. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTPs were originally not appreciated as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention of certain diseased states since the enzymes were generally thought of as acting in opposition to protein-tyrosine kinases with little specificity. Recently, however, this notion of PTPs is beginning to change with some illuminating studies in cell-based models (6Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Flint A.J. Tiganis T Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence on PTPs suggest that these enzymes are involved in the regulation of specific signaling pathways in the cell and thus their inhibition may not have undesirable pleiotropic effects. For example, the phenotype of PTP1B −/− mice highlights this phosphatase's principal role in insulin signaling and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis with no overt increased tumor formation (8Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng J. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C-C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Similar specific roles have been identified for CD45 in thymocyte development and B-cell maturation (10Byth K.F. Conroy L.A. Howlett S. Smith A.J. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Such studies have provided the impetus for understanding the specificity determinants of the enzymes to allow for their selective inhibition. It has been estimated that there are ∼100 PTPs in the human genome (14van Huijsduijnen R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The large number of PTPs in the human genome coupled with their specific regulation of signaling pathways requires that inhibitors targeted toward any one PTP must not only be highly specific but selective as well. It is therefore imperative that structural features that govern the specific interaction of substrates and inhibitors be investigated and understood. We decided to study TCPTP as a model phosphatase in an attempt to unravel specificity determinants in this phosphatase. TCPTP is a ubiquitous enzyme whose substratein vivo remains unknown. Mice lacking the gene that encodes for TCPTP develop normally in utero but die by 5 weeks of age from defects in hematopoiesis and immune function (15You-Ten K.E. Muise E.S. Itie A. Michaliszyn E. Wagner J. Jothy S. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TCPTP shows a remarkable similarity to PTP1B (see Fig. 1) but it is quite different from most of the other phosphatases in the data base. Results from studies on TCPTP could therefore be compared with those obtained previously for the closely related PTP1B, one of the well studied PTPs. By contrasting results to other phosphatases that show little homology to TCPTP important insights on specificity requirements may thus be gleaned from such studies. The crystal structure of a catalytically inactive mutant (Cys215 → Ser) of PTP1B in complex with a peptide substrate revealed that residues 48–50 (TCPTP numbering) play important roles in peptide substrate binding (16Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Tyr46interacts with the aromatic ring of the phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Tyr(P)) in the substrate via π-π interactions whereas Arg47 and Asp48 form specific hydrogen bonds with the substrate to orient it in the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of these implicated residues have corroborated results from the structural studies (17Sarmiento M. Zhao Y. Gordon S.J. Zhang Z-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26369-36374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because of the high similarity between TCPTP and PTP1B at the amino acid level this region of the enzyme was targeted. In this report, we present results of our analysis on the influence of this region on substrate and inhibitor binding in TCPTP. Implications of our results for the design of potent and selective inhibitors for this phosphatase and potentially others in the family are discussed. HiTrapTM Blue and HiTrapTM Q were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-Flag-agarose and Anti-Flag mAb were purchased from Sigma. The Flag peptide was custom synthesized by Research Genetics. Super Signal west pico chemiluminescent immunoblotting kit was procured from Pierce. Full-length human TCPTP was cloned from expressed sequenced tags obtained from IMAGE consortium following established methods (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Green Publishing Associates/John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 8.3-8.5Google Scholar). The catalytic domain (residues 1–281) was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI unique sites of the pFLAG-2 expression vector by amplifying the appropriate sequences by polymerase chain reaction methodology. Correct construction of the full-length clone and catalytic domain derivative was confirmed by DNA sequencing on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by the software application package Sequencher 4.0.5 (Gene Code Corp.). A plasmid that expresses the isolated catalytic domain of human TCPTP, pFlag2-hTCPTP-(1–281), was used as template DNA for the mutagenesis. Construction of the expression vector has been described above (see cloning). The ChameleonTM double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was employed for all site-directed mutagenesis by following the manufacturers instructions. Oligonucleotides used for the site-directed mutagenesis were custom synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Codons specifying the targeted amino acid changes were incorporated into the mutant oligonucleotide primers as follows (the codon changes that were introduced have been underlined): R49K, 5′-AATCGAAACAGGTACAAAGATGTAAGCCCA-3′; R49M, 5′ AATCGAAACAGATACATGGATGTAAGCCCA-3′; R49A, 5′-AATCGAAACAGGTACGCAGATGTAAGCCCA-3′; D50A, 5′-CGAAACAGATACAGAGCTGTAAGCCCATATG-3′; D50N, 5′-CAGAAATCGAAACAGGTACAGAAATGTAAGCCCATATG-3′. The correct construction of the mutant derivatives was verified by DNA sequencing. DNA was subsequently isolated from the positive clones and introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for protein expression. Protein expression was assessed by growing cells to an optical density (OD) of 0.7 at 600 nm in Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp). The culture was then induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested 3 h post-induction and the lysate analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10–20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE). The separated bacterially expressed proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, probed with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and detection was done using chemiluminescence. The Super signalTM west pico kit was used for immunoblotting of proteins by following the suggested protocol (Pierce). Briefly, bacteria cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. The supernatant was retained following centrifugation of the cell lysate and applied to a Cibacron blue affinity column. Following elution, the appropriate fractions were pooled and the ionic strength adjusted before applying to a Sepharose Q anion-exchange column. Following a wash step that reduced absorbance at 280 nm to baseline levels, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentration. The resulting homogenous protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol at a pH of 7.5 for storage. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. An alternate protocol was employed for the purification of the R49A, R49K, and R49M mutant derivatives. The supernatant from the cell lysate was obtained as described above and applied to an anti-Flag mAb affinity column (Sigma). The manufacturers instructions were followed for the anti-Flag affinity purification step. The appropriate protein fractions were pooled and applied to a Sepharose Q anion exchange column. This and subsequent steps in the purification scheme were performed as described above. A 40 and 50% loss in specific activity was observed for the R49M and R49K derivatives, respectively, following a year of storage at −80 °C. The catalytic activities and kinetic parameters of all proteins were determined spectrophotometrically by following the hydrolysis of fluorescein diphosphate (FDP) at 450 nm and p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) at 405 nm as described previously (19Huang Z. Wang Q. Ly H.D. Gorvindarajan A. Scheigetz J. Zamboni R. Desmarais S. Ramachandran C. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of DADEpYL was monitored by fluorescence as described by Zhang et al. (20Zhang Z-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by excitation at 280 nm and emission at 305 nm. The assays were performed at 25 °C in a buffer that consisted of 50 mm BisTris buffer, 5 mm N,N′-dimethyl-bis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine, 2 mmEDTA, 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2% glycerol at a pH of 6.3.N,N′-Dimethyl-bis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine was excluded from the assay buffer when hydrolysis of DADEpYL was being monitored as it interfered with the assay. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting reaction rates data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the aide of the nonlinear regression analysis package Grafit 4.0.10 (Erithacus Software Inc.). Inhibition constants of compounds were determined by fitting the rates determined in the presence and absence of inhibitors to the rate equation for competitive inhibition by nonlinear regression analysis using Grafit. The data were also replotted by the method of Dixon (21Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar) for confirmatory purposes. Four different inhibitor concentrations at five different fixed concentrations of substrate (FDP) were analyzed to obtain the family of curves. The inhibition constant of the potent inhibitor (N-benzoyl-l-glutamyl-[4-phosphono(difluoromethyl)]-l-phenylalanyl-[4-phosphono(difluoromethyl)]-l-phenylalanineamide, or BzN-EJJ-amide where E and J refer to glutamic acid and (4-phosphono(difluoromethyl))-l-phenylalanine, respectively) on wild-type TCPTP was estimated by the method of Henderson ((22Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar); see Fig. 2). The figure was based on the equation for a tight-binding competitive inhibitor as follows,[It]/1−(vi/vo)=[Ei]+Ki{([s]+Km)/Km}vo/vi(Eq. 1) where v i and v o represent the rates measured in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively. [I t] and [E t] refer to the total concentration of inhibitor and enzyme, respectively. The remaining terms carry their usual meaning. Five different inhibitor concentrations (5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 nm) were varied at constant substrate concentrations (10, 12.5, 20, 30, and 40 µm) in a buffer containing 20 mm BisTris, 5 mm N,N′-dimethylmercaptohydrazine, 2 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2% (v/v) glycerol at a pH of 6.3 and a temperature of 25 °C. The kinetic analyses were performed on a Varian EclipseTM fluorometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The synthesis of the peptide inhibitor has been reported previously (23Desmarais S. Friesen R.W. Zamboni R. Ramachandran C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The affinity selection protocol for peptide analogues has been described previously (24Huyer G. Kelly J. Moffat J. Zamboni R. Jia Z. Gresser M. Ramachandran C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following affinity selection, peptides were directly analyzed using LC-MS. All experiments were carried out using a Waters Alliance 2690 high performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Samples (25 µl) were injected onto a Phenomenex Luna 4.6 × 50-mm C18 (5 µ) column operated at 1 ml/min. The flow was split such that 200 µl/min went to the mass spectrometer and the remainder to waste. The mobile phase consisted of: A, 12.5 mm triethylamine adjusted to pH 9.8 with acetic acid; B, acetonitrile. A linear gradient was used to elute library components starting at 2% B and ending at 30% B over a 10-min period. Data acquisition was achieved using selected ion monitoring of 18 different channels with a dwell time of 0.1 s per channel, representing all possible masses of peptides. These masses were determined by the analysis of a concentrated sample of the peptide libraries before affinity selection using full scan acquisition. Relative selection was based on analysis of the libraries before and after affinity selection and all samples were run in triplicate. The crystal structure of an inactive mutant of PTP1B (carrying a C215S substitution) in complex with a phosphotyrosine peptide substrate, DADEpYL-NH2, revealed that the loop spanning residues 48–50 (TCPTP numbering adopted) is particularly important for substrate binding (16Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1 is the region spanning this triad of amino acids and the percent identity regarding the relatedness of other PTPs to PTP1B by amino acid sequence alignment of their catalytic domains. The sequence comparison shows that TCPTP is most closely related to PTP1B with ∼70% sequence identity. The region spanning residues 48–50 (underlined) are identical between the two enzymes hence we wished to explore the importance of the three residues on catalytic function of TCPTP. The triad of amino acids that constitute residues 48–50 begins with a tyrosine that is conserved among PTPs. The conserved nature of the residue may be explained by the observation that it interacts specifically with the tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated on the substrate; a catalytic function that is expected for all PTPs (16Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In contrast to the invariant tyrosine (Y) at position 48, a high degree of amino acid variability (X) is observed at position 49. There, however, occurs a preponderance of lysine residues at this position with a virtual absence of negatively charged amino acids. The choice of amino acid residue at position 50 is largely restricted to either an aspartic acid or asparagine (B). Residues 48–50 will henceforth be referred to as the YXB motif to reflect the choice of amino acid by PTPs at these particular positions. Because Tyr48 is invariant among PTPs and serves to interact with the all important phosphotyrosine moiety of the substrate, this residue is not expected to influence substrate or inhibitor selectivity among phosphatases to any significant degree. Thus, we focused our attention on Arg49 and Asp50. To evaluate the influence of the YXB motif on substrate and inhibitor binding in TCPTP, we introduced amino acid substitutions at positions 49 and 50. We replaced independently Arg49 to lysine, methionine, and alanine; Asp50 was substituted with alanine and asparagine. The resulting mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and characterized kinetically (see “Experimental Procedures”). The kinetic parameters were determined for two aryl phosphate substrates (a bulkier FDP and a much smaller pNPP) and a hexapeptide substrate, DADEpYL. The determined kinetic parameters for FDP, DADEpYL, and pNPP are presented in Tables I, II, and III, respectively.Table IKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of FDP by wild-type TCPTP and substituted derivativesKinetic parametersK mk catk cat/K mµmmin−1× 104m−1 s−1Wild-type15 ± 372 ± 48 ± 0.5D50N17 ± 660 ± 35.9 ± 0.9D50A6 ± 188 ± 424 ± 5R49K47 ± 352 ± 31.8 ± 0.3R49M43 ± 333 ± 31.3 ± 0.4R49A37 ± 657 ± 32.6 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of DADEpYL by wild-type TCPTP and substituted derivativesKinetic parametersK mk catk cat/K mµms−1× 106m−1 s−1Wild-type0.6 ± 0.121 ± 234.7 ± 5D50N1.0 ± 0.121 ± 120.5 ± 3D50A9.8 ± 1.92 ± 0.30.2 ± 0.07R49K1.6 ± 0.39 ± 15.4 ± 1R49M2.1 ± 0.27 ± 13.2 ± 0.6R49A1.9 ± 0.317 ± 18.9 ± 1.9 Open table in a new tab Table IIIKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of pNPP by wild-type TCPTP and substituted derivativesKinetic parametersK mk catk cat/K mmms−1× 104m−1 s−1Wild-type0.80 ± 0.2520 ± 32.5 ± 1D50N0.88 ± 0.3221 ± 22.4 ± 1D50A0.40 ± 0.1312 ± 13.0 ± 1R49K0.79 ± 0.0825 ± 23.2 ± 0.4R49M0.78 ± 0.0618 ± 12.3 ± 0.1R49A0.95 ± 0.0324 ± 22.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab The replacement of Asp50 with Asn did not alter appreciably the kinetic parameters of the resulting mutant, D50N, protein (TableI). The K m and kcat values were comparable to the wild-type protein indicating that the presence of the negatively charged carboxyl group was not crucial for substrate binding or turnover. Substitution of the aspartic acid with alanine (D50A), however, reduced the K m for FDP by almost 3-fold without much change in the turnover of the enzyme. It seems possible that the size of the amino acid at position 50 rather than the negative charge per se may be the crucial feature for binding of FDP. All the amino acid substitutions at position 49 resulted in an increase in the K m value for FDP. Substituting the native arginine with a conservative lysine (R49K) resulted in a 3-fold increase in K m while essentially maintaining the turnover rate. The R49M mutant protein also showed about a 3-fold increase in K m and about a 2-fold reduction in k cat when compared with the wild-type enzyme. The R49A substitution also resulted in close to a 3-fold increase in K m with only a minor change inkcat. The effect of the amino acid replacements on hydrolysis of a peptide substrate, DADEpYL is presented in TableII. Whereas the D50N substitution resulted in less than a 2-fold reduction in K m with no effect on enzyme turnover, the D50A substitution led to a drastic effect on the kinetic parameters. The substitution resulted in a 16-fold increase in K m and a 10-fold reduction ink cat. The Arg substitutions at position 49 resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in the K m value for the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate. The R49K and R49M replacements also led to a 2–3-fold drop in k cat. In contrast, the R49A mutant showed no appreciable effect on enzyme turnover. Thus, the effect exerted by the arginine substitutions on theK m of the peptide substrate mimicked the trend that was observed with FDP as substrate. We also investigated the effect of the amino acid substitutions on a much smaller substrate, pNPP (Table III). No appreciable differences were observed for the TCPTP derivatives compared with the wild-type enzyme with respect to thek cat/K m values. Although the D50A derivative also maintained a similark cat/K m value this was achieved by a compensatory 2-fold reduction in both theK m and k cat values. As the location of residues 49 and 50 on the enzyme are such that an interaction with pNPP is not expected, we conclude that the amino acid changes did not significantly alter the structural integrity of the active sites in the resulting enzymes (perhaps with the exception of D50A). The results suggest that Arg49 may be important for binding of FDP and other substrates to TCPTP. The observation that theK m values obtained with the alanine-substituted protein is similar to that of both the lysine- and methionine-substituted proteins argues against a significant hydrophobic interaction that involves the alkyl side chains of these residues and the substrate. The differential effects of the arginine and lysine substitutions at position 49 on FDP and DADEpYL but not on pNPP was intriguing particularly because this residue exists in several PTPs (Fig. 1). We therefore examined further the potential role of Arg49 and Asp50 on selective inhibition of this enzyme. We investigated the effect of the amino acid changes on the affinity of a potent peptide inhibitor (BzN-EJJ-amide) of TCPTP (Fig.2 a). A derivative of this inhibitor lacking the N-terminal benzoyl group has previously been observed to be very potent on PTP1B (23Desmarais S. Friesen R.W. Zamboni R. Ramachandran C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the Henderson plot (Fig. 2 b), BzN-EJJ-amide is a very potent inhibitor of TCPTP that accurately estimates the concentration of the enzyme (7 nm, the intercept on the ordinate axis) used in the assay. The replot of the slopes (inset) against the concentration of substrate used in the analysis shows that the inhibitor is competitive with an estimated K i of 1 nm and an IC50 of about 4 nm (data not shown) using FDP as substrate. To our knowledge, this compound represents the most potent compound described for a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The effect of the amino acid substitutions on the inhibitory potency of BzN-EJJ-amide is presented in Table IV. Substituting Asp50 with asparagine (D50N) neither affected the potency nor the competitiveness of the inhibitor for the enzyme. In contrast, a loss in inhibitory potency of greater than a 100-fold was observed with the D50A-substituted protein compared with the wild-type enzyme. The inhibitor remained competitive to FDP binding. It appears that the lack of hydrogen-bonding potential on the alanine side chainvis à vis that of asparagine and aspartic acid contributes to the tremendous loss in binding affinity. The substitutions involving Arg49 all resulted in a >10-fold decrease in inhibitor potency on the resulting mutant proteins. The presence of a positive charge on the R49K mutant and its absence from the R49M and R49A derivatives did not significantly influence the binding affinity of the peptide inhibitor; all the substitutions acted similarly. Thus, we conclude that the interaction between BzN-EJJ-amide and TCPTP appears to involve the guanidinium group of Arg49without much contribution from the alkyl side chain.Table IVInhibition constants and IC50 values for BzN-EJJ-amide on wild-type TCPTP and substituted derivativesInhibitor potencyIC50K inmWild-type4 ± 21 ± 0.3D50N5 ± 23 ± 1D50A500 ± 70243 ± 30R49K42 ± 624 ± 3R49M53 ± 1020 ± 2R49A49 ± 323 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Substituting Asp50 with alanine resulted in a greater than 100-fold decrease in inhibitory potency of BzN-EJJ-amide clearly establishing the importance of this residue in achieving inhibitor potency. Unfortunately, most PTPs retain an Asp or Asn at residue 50 and hardly Ala hence, the residue is not expected to contribute significantly to inhibitor selectivity. On the other hand, position 49 is variable among many PTPs and could be exploited for inhibitor selectivity. In order to understand further a potential role for this Arg in inhibitor selectivity, we employed an affinity selection approach to investigate the effect of the conservative R49K substitution in TCPTP on inhibitor binding. As indicated previously (Table II) the R49K substitution resulted in a greater than 6-fold loss in the specificity constant of the enzyme with DADEpYL as substrate. Hence, we sought to determine if the conservative substitution could influence substrate/inhibitor specificity significantly. Thus, amino acid preferences of the R49K derivative were compared with that of the wild-type enzyme by employing a DADEF2PmpL peptide library for these studies (23Desmarais S. Friesen R.W. Zamboni R. Ramachandran C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The peptide library incorporated all naturally occurring amino acid residues (with the exception of cysteine) in the four positions preceding the tyrosine residue that is dephosphorylated (Tyr(P)) in the parental, DADEpYL-NH2, substrate. Each of the four positions was analyzed separately by using a library that introduced the 19 different amino acids into that position alone. For example, peptide library X2, DXDEF2PmpL-NH2, has all 19 amino acids independently present at the second position indicated with anX in the context of the other invariant amino acids that constitute the substrate analogue.

Fresh tumor tissue samples were obtained from the Department of Surgery (University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept frozen at −80 °C. Two sets of oligodeoxynucleotides (flank-5′VNTR and flank-3′VNTR) were designed from sequences flanking the 5′ end or the 3′ end of the MUC1-VNTR domain. Repeat-specific primers were synthesized complementary to the sequence variations (DT→ES, P→Q, P→A, and P→T) within the VNTR domain. The 5′ end of each MVR-specific primer carried a noncomplementary tail (N(20)). Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by BioTeZ Berlin-Buch GmbH. The sequences of primers used for MVR-PCR are as follows: (a) N(20), 5′-TCCCgCgTCCATggCAgCTg (22Conway K. Edmiston S.N. Hūlka B.S. Garrett P.A. Liū E.T.

Genomic DNA from the blood samples was prepared using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genomic DNA from cell lines and tissue samples was isolated using the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Kit (Qiagen). The MVR-PCR analysis performed in this study was based on the method described by Jeffreys et al. (18Jeffreys A.J. Neumann R. Wilson V. Cell. 1990; 60: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,19Jeffreys A.J. MacLeod A. Tamaki K. Neil D.L. Monckton D.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). MVR analyses were performed by using a combination of MVR-specific primers and a primer fixed at the 5′ or 3′ sites in the DNA flanking the minisatellite to generate a ladder of PCR products starting from each variant repeat along the amplified alleles. Detection of minisatellite variant repeats and their amplification were uncoupled by providing a 5′ extension of 20 bp (N(20)) to each MVR-specific oligodeoxynucleotide. Variant specific primers were used at a low concentration (50 nm), whereas the driving amplification passed with high concentration (1 µm) of the flanking primer of the VNTR domain and the N(20) primer itself. Samples (100 ng) of genomic DNA were amplified in 25-µl reactions using the PCR buffer and enzyme system of GC-rich PCR Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 95 °C, and then cycled for 40 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C and 4 min at 70 °C (10 cycles) on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Hybaid MBS; Hybaid, Heidelberg, Germany), followed by a chase for 40 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 65 °C, with 4 min and 5 s increment/cycle at 70 °C for 22 cycles, with a final extension of 10 min at 70 °C. The MVR-PCR product ladders were separated by electrophoresis in 1.4% MoSieve agarose gels (10 cm in length; peqLab, Erlangen, Germany) using TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA) and stained with ethidium bromide. The MVR-PCR product ladder starting at the 5′ or 3′ end of the VNTR domain was read from the bottom of the gels. The first repeat unit at the 5′ end of the domain was visible at approximately 650 bp, whereas the first repeat of the 3′ end was isographic with polynucleotides of approximately 550 bp. MVR analyses were performed for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the MUC1-VNTR with the appropriately designed primers. Single bands within the PCR product ladders were cut from the agarose gel and purified using QiaEx Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The cleared DNA samples were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). After plasmid preparation using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), DNA was sequenced using SP6 or T7 primer. The primer (10 pm) was annealed in the presence of 300 ng of plasmid DNA, 2 µl of the Big Dye Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and double distilled H2O in a 10-µl reaction mixture under the following conditions: 2 min at 96 °C and 25 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 10 s and annealing at 55 °C for 4 min. The primer-annealed template was sequenced by the Big Dye terminator technique. After purification of the sequenced samples, electrophoresis was performed on an automated sequencing machine (ABI 377; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In this way, the sequencing of single bands within the PCR product ladder revealed the nucleotide sequence of 4–6 repeat units. By sequencing of overlapping regions of the domain periphery, it was possible to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence from the first 11 repeats of the 5′ end as well as of the first 13 repeat units of the 3′ end of the VNTR domain. These sequences could be aligned with those obtained by analysis of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions accessible after amplification of the entire VNTR domain by primers annealing in the terminal regions of exon 2. Sequence information corroborated the data from MVRA with respect to the identity and topology of each of the four sequence variations (Fig. 1,a and b). The entire VNTR domain of MUC1 was amplified by PCR using a primer set flanking the VNTR domain (5′ primer, 5′-TgAgTATgACCAgCAgCgTACTCTCCAgCC; 3′ primer, 5′-ggAggTgAgAggAggTACCgTgCTATggTg). 200 ng of genomic DNA were amplified in 50-µl reaction mixtures using the GC-rich PCR Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The temperature profile was as follows: once 3 min at 95 °C, cycling for 30 s at 95 °C, 4 min at 65 °C (10 cycles) on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Biometra) followed by 30 s at 95 °C, 4 min + 5 s increment per each cycle at 65 °C for 25 cycles with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. In each sample, only one allele of the MUC1-VNTR domain was detectable. The number of repeat units that corresponded to the length of each individual allele was determined. To verify the identity of the amplified MUC1-VNTR domain, the band was cut from the gel, and the DNA was purified (QiaEx Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen) and cloned into pCR XL-Topo vector (Topo XL PCR Cloning Kit; Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands). The insert was cut out using restriction enzyme EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt a.M., Germany) and subcloned into pBluescript vector. After plasmid preparation (Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kit; Qiagen), DNA was sequenced using T3 or T7 primers (ABI 377; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequence data obtained were compared with the available nucleotide sequence of MUC1 (GenBankTM accession numberM61170). At the 5′ end of the VNTR domain, legible sequence started in nucleotide position 3601. In position 3821, the tandem repeat unit started, and it was possible to read the sequence of two peripheral repeat units. Sequence data at the 3′ end of the domain started in nucleotide position 4181 and ended in position 3952 with the first degenerate repeat. Four different sequence variations at the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the human MUC1 VNTR domain were analyzed by MVRA of 27 individual genomic DNA samples (TableI). The samples comprised normal tissues and cells (10 individual blood samples, 6 individual tissue samples adjacent to solid tumors, and 1 immortalized “normal” breast epithelial cell line) and a variety of cancer samples, including cell lines (2 gastric, 4 breast, 2 pancreatic, and 2 colorectal carcinoma cell lines) and solid tumors (2 pancreatic, 2 colorectal, and 2 gastric carcinomas). MVRA allowed for the identification of sequence variations in 11–13 terminal repeats from the 5′ and 3′ peripheries of the VNTR domain (Fig. 2, a andb). Amplification products containing larger numbers of repeats were visible in the gels, but unequivocal assignments could not be made. Hence, the reported relative frequencies of the occurrence of variant sequences do not represent the entire domain. The incidence of variant repeats was higher in the 5′-terminal region than in the 3′-terminal regions. Considering 11 repeats at the 5′-terminal region, about 54% of the repeats contain at least one of the four sequence variations, on average (Table I). Within 13 repeats at the 3′-terminal regions, the incidence is about 22%. It is obvious that some of the replacements, in particular, the DT→ES substitution (sequence variation 1), occur in clusters (diads or triads), whereas others, like the P→Q (sequence variation 2), P→A (sequence variation 3), and P→T (sequence variation 4), appear mainly in isolated repeats (TableI).Table ITopology of amino acid replacements at 5′ and 3′ peripheral regions in individual MUC1 VNTR domains1-aFour amino acid replacements within the repeat peptide of MUC1 VNTR domains were analyzed on the DNA level by MVRA of individual genomic samples.

Open table in a new tab To verify that the PCR band ladders from MVRA represented real sequence variations and not artifacts related to the primer design or PCR parameters, individual samples were analyzed by sequencing of the PCR products. By alignment of overlapping stretches (each corresponding to about 4–6 repeats) with partial sequences obtained after amplification of the entire VNTR domain, complete sequence information was revealed for 11–13 repeats of the peripheral regions. Data on human breast cancer cell line T47D are presented in Fig. 1 a to place the new sequence information into the context of previous reports (7Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.

An additional sequence variation, which was extracted from sequence information on a partial DNA corresponding to a pentarepeat of human MUC1 (6Siddiqui J. Abe M. Hayes D. Shani E. Yunis E. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2320-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the concerted replacement of His-Gly (CAC GGT) by Val-Arg (GTC CGT), was also analyzed by MVRA. Specifically designed detection primers indicated the occurrence of this sequence variation in a few individual samples at low frequency and with highly variable repeat topology. However, sequence analyses of amplified PCR products revealed that the replacement did not exist and that the primers had stochastically annealed. The DT→ES replacement (GAC ACC → GAG AGC) was found in all individual samples and represents the most frequent sequence variation within the peripheral regions of the VNTR domain (Table I). Within the 5′-terminal regions, sequence variation 1 is localized primarily in repeats 9 and 10 (Figs. 1 and 2). Nearly 90% of the individual samples contain this sequence variation in a repeat cluster (two or three adjacent repeats). A similar pattern is revealed for the 3′-terminal region. All individual samples show a clustering from 2–4 adjacent repeats, with the highest frequency in repeats 11 and 12. No evidence for a random distribution of this replacement in the terminal VNTR regions of individual MUC1 samples could be obtained. The topology and incidence of the DT→ES replacement do not show strong individual fluctuations. Both alternative variations occur at the same position within the repeat sequence by replacing Pro13 (CCA) with Q (CAA) or A (GCA), respectively. Their topology in the 5′ region is distinct but constant in all individual samples (Figs. 1 and 2; Table I). Accordingly, sequence variation 2 is restricted to repeats 2 and 6, whereas sequence variation 3 is confined mainly to repeats 5 and 10. With two exceptions, these variations were not detected in the 3′ regions of the VNTR domain. The replacement of Pro13 (CCA) with Thr (ACA), which was detected in this study by sequencing of PCR products, introduces a new potential glycosylation site into the repeat. It has not been described previously and seems to occur at low incidence. We could detect it exclusively in repeat 7 (5′ region) (Figs. 1 and 2; Table I) with the exception of AGS cells, in which the first repeat of the 3′ region was positive for this variant. Interestingly, analysis of the individual lengths of VNTR domains revealed that the occurrence of this variant was negatively associated with higher numbers of repeats (see below). A representative pattern of sequence variations is shown for the 5′ and 3′ regions in Fig. 3. This pattern represents the majority of the individual samples and hence indicates the nonrandom distribution of sequence variations 1–4. No differences with respect to the topology or incidence of the sequence variations in tumor versus normal samples became evident. Also individuals of non-Caucasian race or different ethnic background were found to have the same set of replacements and, except for one individual, identical topology. In 20 individual samples, MUC1 allele lengths ranged from 40–52 tandemly repeated 60-bp units, whereas 60–84 repeat units were found in 5 individual samples. In 18 of the 20 individuals, who have a smaller MUC1 allele, the substitution of P→T (variant 4) in repeat 7 (5′ peripheral region of the VNTR domain) was detectable. Only two individuals in the group did not show this replacement. By contrast, in all individual domains that exhibit more than 60 repeat units, a P→T substitution was not identified in the respective repeat. The length determination of individual MUC1 alleles allowed us to estimate that 30–60% of the VNTR domain was covered by MVRA. The present study reveals for the first time insight into the nucleotide sequences of peripheral regions in the human MUC1 repeat domain. Although the primary structure of this mucin was elucidated about a decade ago, the entire domain of repetitive 60 bp comprising between 20 and 120 units was never subjected to a detailed sequence analysis. Repetitive DNA sequences, in particular, GC-rich polynucleotides, are difficult to amplify by standard PCR protocols. Accordingly, only partial information was previously accessible after amplification of the entire domain in exon 2 and sequence analysis of a few terminal repeats. The published repeat sequences from four independent groups (7Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E. Wilson D. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) agree in the finding that the sequence of a common 60-bp unit does not show structural variation in different cellular specimens. In contrast to this, we recently obtained evidence on the protein level that individual domains can display considerable sequence variation reflected in a series of amino acid replacements in the 20-amino acid repeat (11Müller S. Alving K. Peter-Katalinic J. Zachara N. Gooley A.A. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The singular observation was demonstrated in the present study to represent a general phenomenon by showing that all individual MUC1 alleles under study do contain the same pattern of sequence variations with largely identical topology. The nearly constant localization of variant repeats in the peripheral regions indicates that they may have originated before multiple duplications generated a length polymorphic VNTR domain. The entire domain may have evolved accordingly as a recent expansion of sequence variable super-repeats. Sequence variability of repeat peptides seems to be a common feature of mucins because other members of the MUC family (MUC4) also exhibit multiple replacements in their repetitive units (20Porchet N. van Cong N. Dufosse J. Audie J.P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Gross M.S. Denis C. Degand P. Bernheim A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Sequence variability raises the question of whether functional aspects of the mucin domain may be affected. However, because only one repeat in MUC1 was demonstrated to contain a further potential glycosylation site, whereas all other replacements preserve the site pattern, it can be assumed that the sequence context-dependent initiation of O-glycosylation should not be influenced. Semiquantitative Edman analyses of repeat peptides from tumor-associated MUC1 have confirmed this assumption and, in particular, did not reveal any indication of altered O-glycosylation of the variant ESR motif (11Müller S. Alving K. Peter-Katalinic J. Zachara N. Gooley A.A. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vitro studies have recently shown that the replacement of Pro13 with Ala in the repeat peptide AHG21 has a strong negative effect on initial O-glycosylation catalyzed by recombinant UDP-galNAc polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase galNAc-T2 (21Hanisch, F.-G., Reis, C., Clausen, H., and Paulsen, H. (2001)Glycobiology, in press.Google Scholar). Variations of the peptide sequence are expected to have a strong influence on the conformation and hence the antigenicity of the repeat unit. The most frequent variation, DT→ES (sequence variation 1), could be of importance in the context of tumor vaccination because it may represent an alternative target for humoral or cellular immune responses. Some murine monoclonal antibodies with a specificity for the DTR motif are cross-reactive to this variant motif, whereas the majority are not. 3F.-G. Hanisch, unpublished observations. This indicates that the ESR motif exhibits distinct structural features, despite the fact that the amino acid replacements are conservative. To reveal the conformational features of the variant motif and its glycosylated derivatives, synthetic (glyco)peptides are currently analyzed by 800 MHz NMR spectroscopy. Knowledge of the structural features of the two alternative motifs (DTR versus ESR) in the repeat peptide of MUC1 is expected to aid the development of efficient tumor vaccines."

Mass spectrometry analysis and immunodepletion studies reveal p50 as PACSIN 1/syndapin I, a Src homology 3 domain-containing protein functioning in endocytosis and regulation of actin dynamics. In addition to PACSIN 1, which is neuron-specific, mSos also interacts with PACSIN 2, which is expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. PACSIN 2 shows enhanced binding to the mSos proline-rich domain in pull-down assays from brain extracts as compared with lung extracts, suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of the interaction. Proline to leucine mutations within the Src homology 3 domains of PACSIN 1 and 2 abolish their binding to mSos, demonstrating the specificity of the interactions. In situ, PACSIN 1 and mSos1 are co-expressed in growth cones and actin-rich filopodia in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitate from brain extracts. Moreover, epidermal growth factor treatment of COS-7 cells causes co-localization of PACSIN 1 and mSos1 in actin-rich membrane ruffles, and their interaction is regulated through epidermal growth factor-stimulated mSos1 phosphorylation.

These interactions may function to target mSos to Ras activation on the endocytic pathway (11Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.-J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M.

Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, mSos is the prototype member of a family of bifunctional GEFs, including Ras-GRF1 and Ras GRF-2, having dual specificity for Ras and Rac (16Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through its Dbl homology domain, mSos binds directly to Rac (17Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the GEF activity of mSos toward Rac appears to be unique relative to other Rho family GEFs in that it catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange as part of a macromolecular complex with Eps8 and E3b1, two proteins functioning in growth factor signaling (18Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Grazia Malabarba M. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Rac activation has multiple effects in cells, the most prominent being alterations in the actin cytoskeleton leading to membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation (20Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Thus mSos, through its ability to activate Rac, is thought to play a functional role in growth factor-mediated regulation of actin dynamics (18Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).To screen for novel mSos binding partners, we performed overlay assays of brain extracts with fusion proteins encoding the PRD of mSos1. A major mSos1-binding protein of 50 kDa was detected and purified by affinity chromatography. Mass spectrometry analysis identified the protein as PACSIN 1/syndapin I. PACSIN 1 was originally identified based on its differential expression in intact and lesioned mouse brain (22Plomann M. Lange R. Vopper G. Cremer H. Heinlein U.A.O. Scheff S. Baldwin S.A. Leitges M. Cramer M. Paulsson M. Barthels D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 15: 201-211Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and syndapin I was independently identified through its SH3 domain-dependent interaction with dynamin 1 (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We will use the name PACSIN throughout to collectively refer to PACSIN and syndapin. Whereas PACSIN 1 is neuron-specific, its closely related homologue PACSIN 2 is expressed in brain and several nonneuronal tissues (24Ritter B. Modregger J. Paulsson M. Plomann M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PACSINs appear to be involved in regulation of endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton. Through a C-terminal SH3 domain, the PACSIN isoforms interact with the endocytic regulatory enzymes dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1, as well as with N-WASP, a stimulator of Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation and assembly (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of full-length PACSIN stimulates cortical actin assembly, leading to filopodia formation, and the PACSINs localize to sites of high actin turnover, such as filopodia and lamellipodia (25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).After identifying PACSIN 1 as a mSos1 binding partner, we confirmed the interaction in vitro and used co-immunoprecipitation analysis to demonstrate the interaction in vivo. Interestingly, mSos1 co-distributes with PACSIN 1 in the growth cones and filopodia of cultured hippocampal neurons, and both proteins co-localize with actin in the filopodia from growth cones of dorsal root ganglia neurons in culture. Further, PACSIN 1 and mSos1 are co-localized in growth factor-induced membrane ruffles in COS-7 cells, and their interaction is regulated by mSos1 phosphorylation. Together, these data provide further evidence for a role for mSos in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe previously demonstrated that mSos interacts through its PRD with the endocytic protein intersectin, suggesting that intersectin may target mSos to Ras on the endocytic pathway (9Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. Adams A. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As the PRD of mSos contains multiple SH3 domain-binding consensus sites, we sought to identify additional mSos binding partners. Overlay of adult rat brain extracts with a GST fusion protein encoding the N-terminal half of the mouse Sos1 PRD (GST-NT) (amino acids 1111–1228) identified three proteins of 120 (p120), 90 (p90), and 50 (p50) kDa (Fig.1 A). None of the bands were detected with a GST fusion protein encoding the mouse Sos1 PRD C-terminal half (GST-CT) (amino acids 1223–1341) or with GST alone (Fig. 1 A). Previously, Leprince et al. (8Leprince C. Romero F. Cussac D. Vayssiere B. Berger R. Tavitian A. Camois J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15101-15105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) identified amphiphysin II as a mSos1 binding partner. To determine whether p120 and p90 correspond to amphiphysin I (120 kDa) and amphiphysin II (90 kDa), respectively, we used GST-NT, GST-CT, or GST alone in pull-down assays with soluble rat brain extracts. Western blots of the pull-downs demonstrated that both amphiphysin I and II bind specifically to GST-NT (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that they represent p120 and p90. Intersectin also bound selectively to GST-NT, whereas Grb2 bound equally well to GST-NT and GST-CT (data not shown). Surprisingly, neither Grb2 nor intersectin was detected on the overlay assays, possibly due to lower levels of expression in brain extracts than the amphiphysins or p50. The abundant SH3 domain-containing protein, endophilin 1, which is readily detected on overlays with the PRDs of synaptojanin 1 (33de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and dynamin 1 (34Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was not seen on the overlays with the PRD of mSos1, further demonstrating the specificity of the interactions detected.To characterize p50, the major mSos1 binding partner identified, we performed overlays with GST-NT on tissue extracts. p50 was detected in brain but not in a variety of nonneuronal tissues (Fig.2 A). This is consistent with the distribution of mSos1 that is expressed at higher levels in brain than in other tissues (9Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Within brain, subcellular fractionation revealed p50 in both soluble and particulate fractions (Fig.2 B). The greatest enrichment was seen in the second lysed supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 B, LS 2), which contained soluble proteins generated from the lysis of crude synaptosomes. This distribution is similar to that previously described for mSos1 (9Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as well as that of the presynaptically enriched endocytic regulatory enzymes dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1 (29McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To identify p50, we used the mSos1 GST fusion proteins to affinity purify mSos1-binding proteins from a soluble rat brain extract. As determined by Coomassie Blue staining, a 50-kDa band that bound to GST-NT but not to GST-CT or to GST alone was the major affinity-selected protein (Fig. 3). Minor bands at 120, 90, and 70 kDa were also weakly detected. The 50-kDa band was excised from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion, and the fragments were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. A ProFound search of the peptide masses provided a tentative identification for p50 as PACSIN 1/syndapin I. PACSIN 1 was identified based on its up-regulation during neuronal differentiation in mouse (22Plomann M. Lange R. Vopper G. Cremer H. Heinlein U.A.O. Scheff S. Baldwin S.A. Leitges M. Cramer M. Paulsson M. Barthels D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 15: 201-211Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas its rat orthologue syndapin I was identified through its SH3 domain-dependent interaction with dynamin 1 (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PACSIN 1, which contains an SH3 domain at its C terminus, is a neuron-specific protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50 kDa, consistent with its identification as p50. To support this identification, we performed overlay assays with GST-NT or GST alone on cells transfected with a cDNA encoding His6-tagged full-length PACSIN 1. GST-NT specifically interacted with a protein species that perfectly co-migrated with PACSIN 1, as detected with an anti-His6 Western blot (Fig.4 A), demonstrating that PACSIN 1 directly interacts with mSos1. The identity of p50 as PACSIN 1 was confirmed with the demonstration that immunodepletion of PACSIN 1 from brain extracts using an anti-PACSIN 1 antibody completely depletes p50, as determined by GST-NT overlay (Fig. 4 B).Figure 3Affinity purification of p50. A rat brain cytosolic extract was incubated with GST, GST-NT, or GST-CT conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins specifically bound to the beads (B) along with aliquots of the soluble brain extract (starting material (SM)) and equal amounts of the unbound material (void (V)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining.

The migratory positions of His6-PACSIN 1 and the molecular weight standards are shown on the right and left,respectively.

Modregger J. Paulsson M. Plomann M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast to PACSIN 1, which is expressed exclusively in neurons, PACSIN 2 is expressed in brain and nonneuronal tissues (24Ritter B. Modregger J. Paulsson M. Plomann M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). Because mSos1 is enriched in brain but is also expressed in nonneuronal tissues (9Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mSos-PACSIN 2 interactions may occur both within and outside the nervous system. To explore this question, we performed pull-down assays from Triton X-100-solubilized extracts prepared from brain, as well as from lung, which expresses high level of PACSIN 2 (Fig. 5 A) (26Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we detected binding of PACSIN 2 from both tissues to the mSos1 PRD (Fig. 5 B). In fact, PACSIN 2 is likely to represent the 70-kDa band that was weakly detectable on the Coomassie blue stained pull-downs from brain extracts using mSos GST-NT (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the level of PACSIN 2 recovered on the mSos1-PRD fusion protein was consistently greater when using brain versus lung extracts, even though PACSIN 2 was more abundant in the extracts from lung (Fig. 5, A andB). Moreover, a second, slightly smaller band that reacted with the PACSIN 2 antibody was detected in the GST-NT pull-downs from brain extracts but not from lung extracts (Fig. 5 B). This protein may represent the short splice variant of PACSIN 2 previously described in rat tissues (25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Comparable amounts of the 70-kDa protein were pulled down from lung and brain extracts with an anti-PACSIN 2 antibody, suggesting that PACSIN 2 is equally accessible in both tissues (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the differential binding of the long form of PACSIN 2 to the mSos1 PRD in brain compared with lung reveals a tissue-specific regulation of the interaction. The reason for this observation is currently unknown. However, it is possible that a tissue-specific posttranslational modification of PACSIN 2 alters its affinity for the mSos PRD.Figure 5Specific interaction of mSos1 with the SH3 domains of PACSIN 1 and 2. A, proteins of crude Triton-soluble extracts from various adult rat tissues (200 µg/tissue) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for Western blot using antibodies against PACSIN 2.B, GST-NT conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST-NT) and anti-PACSIN 2 antiserum precoupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (PACSIN 2 i.p.) were incubated with crude Triton-soluble extracts from rat lung and brain. Proteins specifically bound to the beads (bead) along with aliquots of the lung and brain extract (starting material (SM)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot using antibodies against PACSIN 2. C, a mouse brain extract was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads conjugated to GST alone or GST fused to full-length wild-type (wt) PACSINs or PACSINs with point mutations in their SH3 domains (PACSIN 1, proline 434 mutated to leucine (P434L); PACSIN 2, proline 478 mutated to leucine (P478L)). Material specifically bound to the beads was resolved by SDS-PAGE along with an aliquot of the brain extract (starting material (SM)) and processed for Western blot using antibodies against mSos1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address whether the observed interactions are dependent on the classical SH3 domain binding interface, we generated point mutations in the SH3 domains of PACSIN 1 and 2 that converted proline to leucine (P434L for PACSIN 1; P478L for PACSIN 2). Comparable mutations in theCaenorhabditis elegans Grb2 homologue sem-5 cause a lethal phenotype by preventing sem-5 interactions with its PRD-containing binding partners (35Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Using wild-type and mutated PACSIN 1 and 2 expressed as GST fusion proteins, we performed pull-down assays from brain extracts (Fig. 5 C). mSos1 was found to interact with both wild-type fusion proteins, whereas the proline to leucine mutations abolished mSos1 binding to both PACSINs, demonstrating that the interactions are specifically mediated through the PACSIN SH3 domains.To explore the potential interaction between PACSIN 1 and mSos1in situ, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain extracts. Immunoprecipitation of PACSIN 1 led to co-immunoprecipitation of mSos1 (Fig. 6). The interaction was specific, as no mSos1 precipitated in the presence of normal rabbit serum, and the abundant brain protein tubulin was not detected in the anti-PACSIN 1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). Only a limited percentage of the total mSos1 in the brain extract co-immunoprecipitated with PACSIN 1. This is not surprising given that PACSIN 1 interacts through its SH3 domain with multiple binding partners, including the abundant brain proteins dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1 (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In fact, dynamin 1 was found to strongly co-immunoprecipitate with PACSIN 1 (Fig. 6). As the interactions between PACSIN 1 and its various SH3 domain-binding partners are likely to be competitive, the PACSIN-mSos interaction may be restricted to specific subcellular domains that are enriched for mSos1 relative to other PACSIN binding partners. Alternatively, the PACSINs may be at the core of large protein complexes in which they simultaneously interact with multiple binding partners. Consistent with the later possibility, it has been recently demonstrated that the PACSINs can self-associate to form homo- and hetero-oligomers (26Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6mSos1 interacts with PACSIN 1 in vivo. Anti-PACSIN 1 antiserum (PACSIN 1) and normal rabbit serum (NRS), precoupled to protein A-Sepharose beads, were incubated with soluble extracts from rat brain. Material specifically bound to the beads (immunoprecipitation,i.p.) was resolved by SDS-PAGE along with an aliquot of the brain extract (starting material (SM)) and processed for Western blot using antibodies against mSos1, dynamin 1, tubulin, and PACSIN 1 as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the potential for interactions between PACSIN 1 and mSos1 in situ, we sought to determine whether the proteins were co-distributed in neurons. Immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal neurons at 2 days in vitro with polyclonal antibodies against each protein revealed strong staining in the neuronal cell bodies, with fluorescent punctae observed along the length of the neurites and in growth cones (Fig.7, A and C). Staining for both proteins extended into filopodia emanating from the growth cones (Fig. 7, B and D). To examine the localization within growth cones in more detail, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of primary rat dorsal root ganglia neurons maintained in culture for 1 day. Similar to hippocampal neurons, both PACSIN 1 and mSos1 were detected in dorsal root ganglia growth cones and were seen to extend into filopodia (Fig.8). Interestingly, co-staining with phalloidin, which reveals filamentous actin, demonstrated that both mSos1 (Fig. 8 A) and PACSIN 1 (Fig. 8 B) were strongly co-localized with actin filaments at the plasma membrane and throughout the length of the filopodia. PACSIN has been demonstrated to localize at sites of high actin turnover, including filopodia and filopodial tips in nonneuronal cells (25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Further, overexpression of full-length PACSIN causes filopodia formation in an N-WASP-dependent manner, although the mechanism of this activation is unknown (25Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The co-localization of mSos1 with PACSIN 1 in filopodia suggests that mSos1 may cooperate with PACSIN 1 in filopodia formation or function. This role may be particularly relevant during neuronal development, as actin-dependent filopodial dynamics are critical in the response of neuronal growth cones to extracellular guidance cues (36Zheng J.Q. Wan J.J. Poo M.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filopodia formation is dependent on N-WASP (37Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), which is activated by interactions with SH3 domains (38Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C.

A. 1992; 89: 10955-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), GLT1 (5Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), and EAAC1 (6Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), respectively. The stoichiometry of substrate ion flux-coupling has been determined for the EAAT3 and GLT1 subtypes where glutamate is co-transported with 3 Na+ and 1 H+ followed by the counter-transport of 1 K+ ion (7Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate transporters also allow an uncoupled flux of anions through the transporter, which requires the presence of glutamate and Na+ ions but does not appear to influence the rate or direction of glutamate transport (2Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 9Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the uncoupled anion flux relative to the glutamate-coupled ion fluxes varies with the different transporters, with the anion flux greatest for EAAT4 and EAAT5, followed by EAAT1 and then EAAT3 and EAAT2. Thus, electrophysiological measurements of glutamate transport have components derived from the ion-coupled transport conductance and the uncoupled chloride conductance. Zn2+ is found in a number of regions of the brain, with >90% bound to proteins such as various Zn2+ finger proteins. Chelatable Zn2+ is enriched in a number of regions of the brain, especially in the mossy fibers of the hippocampus where it is stored in synaptic vesicles with glutamate (reviewed in Ref. 10Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the mossy fibers leads to release of Zn2+ (11Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), and Zn2+ has been shown to modulate the activity of a number of proteins within excitatory synapses, including the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtypes of glutamate receptors (12Westbrook G.L. Mayer M.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 13Peters S. Koh J. Choi D.W. Science. 1987; 236: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), Ca2+ channels (14Busselberg D. Platt B. Michael D. Carpenter D.O. Haas H.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and also glutamate transporters (15Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Spiridon et al. (15Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibits glutamate transport currents, whereas stimulating the uncoupled chloride conductance associated with the transporters in Muller cells of the salamander retina. In contrast to the Muller cells, Zn2+ inhibits the chloride conductance associated with glutamate transporters of the retinal cone cells (15Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The predominant glutamate transporter in Muller cells shows most similarity to the human EAAT1, and in a previous study we demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibits the transport current of EAAT1, but had little effect on the uncoupled chloride flux associated with the transport process (16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In many proteins, the side chains of histidine, cysteine, glutamate, or aspartate residues (17Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 280-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) coordinate the binding of Zn2+. In EAAT1, we established that the side chains of histidine 146 and histidine 154 form part of the Zn2+ binding site. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of EAAT1–5 in this region (Fig.1) shows that histidine 146 is conserved in EAAT1, -2, -4, and -5, and that the residue corresponding to histidine 154 of EAAT1 is divergent. In EAAT2, which is insensitive to Zn2+, a glycine residue corresponds to the second histidine residue of EAAT1, and mutation of this residue to histidine generates a transporter that is inhibited by Zn2+ at comparable Zn2+ concentrations to that of EAAT1 (16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). From these results we hypothesized that the chemical nature of the side chains of the residues at the two positions will determine the sensitivity to Zn2+. In this study we have investigated the actions of Zn2+ on the glutamate transporter EAAT4 and found that Zn2+ increases the EC50 forl-aspartate activation of the chloride conductance and also decreases the extent of activation of the chloride conductance. Both of the Zn2+ binding site histidine residues identified in EAAT1 are conserved in EAAT4, and mutations of these residues reduce Zn2+ modulation of the anion conductance of the transporter. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Sydney, Australia) unless otherwise stated. TBOA was kindly supplied by Dr. Keiko Shimamoto and was also obtained from Tocris. ZnCl2 was diluted from a stock solution of 20 mm in frog ringer's solution. The stock solution was stored at 4 °C and was made fresh each week. The wild-type and mutant EAAT4 transporters subcloned in the pOTV plasmid (1Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were linearized with BamHI and cRNA transcribed from the cDNA construct with T7 RNA polymerase and capped with 5′-7methyl guanosine using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Mutations in EAAT4 were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oocytes were harvested from X. laevis as previously described (18Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and 50 nl of cRNA was injected into defoliculated stage V X. laevis oocytes and incubated in standard frog ringers solution (ND96; 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55), supplemented with 2.5 mmsodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 µg/ml gentamicin. 2–8 days later, current recordings were made using the two electrode voltage clamp technique with a Geneclamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with an MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) using the Chart software and a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) controlled by an IBM compatible computer using the pCLAMP software (version 7, Axon Instruments). The current-voltage relationships for l-glutamate orl-aspartate transport were determined by subtraction of steady state current measurements in the absence ofl-glutamate or l-aspartate, obtained during 300-msec voltage pulses to potentials between −100 and +60mV in 10 mV steps, from corresponding current measurements in the presence of substrate. In recordings where the extracellular chloride concentration was altered, a 3 m KCl agar bridge was used to connect the ground electrode to the bath solution to minimize offset potentials. The chloride-free buffer used contained 96 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mmcalcium(gluconate)2, 1 mmmagnesium(gluconate)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Zn2+ chelates l-glutamate andl-aspartate, and the free l-glutamate and free Zn2+ concentrations were calculated according the method of Dawson et al. (19Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 76Google Scholar) and employed by Spiridon et al. (15Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In all figures and calculations free Zn2+and l-glutamate or l-aspartate concentrations are used. The following protocol was used to isolate the effects of Zn2+ on the transport, and the transport-activated anion conductances of the transporters. The conductance elicited byl-glutamate (or l-aspartate) was first measured and after washoff of substrate, Zn2+ was applied and baseline conductance measurements made, followed by co-application of substrate with Zn2+, and the conductance measured again. After washoff of Zn2+ and substrate, substrate alone was re-applied to ensure that the conductance measurements return to control values. Analysis of kinetic data was carried out using the Kaleidagraph Software version 3.1. Substrate (l-glutamate and l-aspartate) dose responses were fitted by least squares as a function of current (I) toI/I max = [S]/(EC50 + [S]), where I max is the maximal current, EC50 the concentration of substrate that generates a half-maximal current, and [S] is the substrate concentration. Dose-dependent Zn2+ inhibition of substrate-activated currents were fitted by least squares to Equation1, I=I(Glu/Asp)−(Imax[Zn2+]/(IC50+[Zn2+]))+R(Eq. 1) where I (Glu/Asp) is current due tol-glutamate or l-aspartate alone,I max is the maximal current inhibited by Zn2+, [Zn2+] is the Zn2+concentration, IC50 is the concentration of Zn2+ causing half-maximal inhibition, and R is the residual transport current at a maximal dose of Zn2+.

Application of l-aspartate orl-glutamate to oocytes expressing EAAT4 generates a conductance that is carried predominantly by chloride ions (2Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Co-application of 100 µm Zn2+ with 100 µml-aspartate to oocytes expressing EAAT4 causes a reduction in amplitude of the aspartate-evoked conductance compared with 100 µml-aspartate alone with little or no change in reversal potential (Fig.2 A). Whereas the reduction in current amplitude in the presence of Zn2+ was apparent at both positive and negative membrane potentials, the reduction in current amplitude was greater at positive potentials. A slightly different result was obtained for l-glutamate-evoked currents. In the absence of Zn2+, l-glutamate generates a conductance ∼50% of the conductance evoked byl-aspartate (Ref. 2Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, see Fig. 2 B). In the presence of 100 µm Zn2+, the reduction in thel-glutamate-evoked conductance was only apparent at positive potentials with little or no change in conductance at negative potentials (Fig. 2 B). In subsequent experiments on EAAT4 and the various mutants of EAAT4, we have presented the results for the effects of Zn2+ on l-aspartate-evoked conductances, because the larger conductance changes are more reliably measured than for l-glutamate and the extent of Zn2+ modulation of the currents is greater. The onset of inhibition by Zn2+ was rapid and reversible with washoff of Zn2+ from the bath solution, which suggests a direct interaction between Zn2+ and the transporter. Inhibition of substrate-evoked currents by Zn2+ could be due to inhibition of the coupled transport conductance or inhibition of the uncoupled anion conductance or both conductances. Under the conditions of this experiment and assuming that the stoichometry of ion flux coupling for EAAT4 is the same as for EAAT3 and GLT1, a net inward flux of l-glutamate or l-aspartate is expected at membrane potentials up to +60 mV, and therefore any outward current at positive potentials is caused by the uncoupled anion conductance. The reduction in outward current at positive membrane potentials suggests that Zn2+ inhibits the anion conductance. If the extracellular chloride ions are replaced with the more permeant anions bromide, iodide, or nitrate, significantly greaterl-aspartate-evoked outward currents are observed, with a relative order of magnitude (and relative current amplitude at +60 mV) of NO3− (27.3) > I− (8.3) > Br− (3.75) > Cl− (1.0). Although 100 µm Zn2+ reduced the anion conductance for all 4 anions, the degree of reduction varied, with the greatest reduction observed for iodide (76 ± 2%, n = 4), followed by chloride (66 ± 3%, n = 7) and bromide (66 ± 7%, n = 4) and with the smallest reduction observed for nitrate (48 ± 4%, n = 5) (Fig.3 B). In each case there was no significant change in reversal potential measured in the presence and absence of 100 µm Zn2+. These results are consistent with Zn2+ inhibiting the uncoupled anion conductance, and although there are variations in the extent of inhibition for different anions, Zn2+ does not alter the relative anion permeability. To measure the effects of Zn2+ on the ion-coupled transport conductance, oocytes expressing EAAT4 were incubated in a buffer in which chloride ions were completely replaced with the impermeant anion gluconate for >40 h. This procedure has been reported to reduce the intracellular chloride concentration of the oocyte to <4 mm (9Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and allows transport conductances to be measured in the absence of a significant uncoupled anion conductance. Application of l-aspartate to oocytes in chloride-free buffer generates inward currents at potentials up to + 60 mV, as opposed to an outward current measured under standard conditions. At −60 mV, currents measured under both chloride-free and standard conditions were inward but differed in relative amplitude. The l-aspartate-evoked current measured under chloride-free conditions was 15 ± 3 nA (n = 7) compared with 74 ± 8 nA (n = 3, from the same batch of oocytes) under standard conditions, which confirms previous observations that under standard conditions a majority of the l-aspartate-evoked conductance is caused by activation of a chloride conductance. Under chloride-free conditions, co-application of 100 µm Zn2+with 100 µml-aspartate generated a similar conductance compared with 100 µml-aspartate alone (Fig. 3 C), which suggests that Zn2+ has no effect on the coupled transport component of the currents mediated by EAAT4. Thus, Zn2+ inhibition of the substrate-gated conductance of EAAT4 is most likely to be due to inhibition of the uncoupled anion conductance. In further experiments on EAAT4 and EAAT4 mutants, we have not distinguished between the coupled transport and the uncoupled anion components of the conductance and have assumed that Zn2+has a selective effect on the uncoupled anion conductance. The EC50 for l-aspartate activation of the chloride conductance measured in the presence of 100 µmZn2+ (5.1 ± 0.5 µm, n = 7) was increased compared with the EC50 measured in the absence of Zn2+ (3.4 ± 0.5 µm,n = 7, p = 0.05 2-tailed ttest) (Fig. 4 A), which suggests that Zn2+ modulates the interaction betweenl-aspartate and EAAT4. At −100 mV, Zn2+ caused a maximal inhibition of 58 ± 10% (n = 4), whereas at +60 mV a maximal dose of Zn2+ inhibited the current by 81 ± 5% (n = 4) (Fig. 4 B). The IC50 values for Zn2+ inhibition of the anion conductance also differed at the different membrane potentials. At −100 mV, the IC50 was 86 ± 29 µm(n = 4) and at +60 mV the IC50 was 38 ± 10 µm (n = 4). We have previously identified two histidine residues in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of EAAT1 that form part of the Zn2+ binding site. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of EAAT4 with EAAT1 shows that both histidine residues are conserved between the two transporters. In the following experiments we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate whether the conserved histidine residues also form the Zn2+ binding site on EAAT4 that mediates inhibition of the anion conductance. The two histidine residues were mutated to alanine to remove the imidazole group that is thought to interact with Zn2+. In addition the second histidine residue, at position 164, was changed to glutamate because a glutamate residue is found at this position of the glutamate transporter EAAT5. Application of l-aspartate to oocytes expressing the EAAT4 mutants, H154A, H164A, and H164E generated dose-dependent conductances that reversed direction at similar membrane potentials to that of wild type EAAT4 (Table I). This suggests that the mutations have not caused significant structural changes to the pore of the transporter. In contrast to wild type EAAT4, co-application of 100 µm Zn2+ with 100 µml-aspartate to oocytes expressing the EAAT4 mutant, H154A, had no significant effect on the conductance compared with L-aspartate alone (Fig. 5) or the EC50 for l-aspartate-evoked conductance. This suggests that the mutation has selectively disrupted Zn2+ modulation of the substrate-activated anion conductance. Similar results were also observed for the second site mutants H164A and H164E (Fig. 5). Thus, histidines residues at positions 154 and 164 appear to influence Zn2+ affinity for EAAT4, which is analogous to the results observed for EAAT1 (16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues have also been identified in other proteins as forming Zn2+ binding sites and as EAAT4 contains two cysteine residues we investigated whether either of these two residues play a role in mediating the effects of Zn2+ on EAAT4. Application of 100 µml-aspartate to oocytes expressing the EAAT4 C194A and EAAT4 C400A mutants showed similar current-voltage relationships as wild type EAAT4, and co-application of 100 µm Zn2+ caused similar reductions in the conductance as observed for the wild type EAAT4. Thus, the C194A and C356A mutations do not appear to alter the functional properties of the transporter or the sensitivity to Zn2+ and are unlikely to form part of the Zn2+ binding site on EAAT4. In most cells expressing EAAT4, but not in uninjected oocytes, application of Zn2+ alone appears to block a constitutive conductance. This constitutive conductance could be an intrinsic property of EAAT4 or could be because of the expression of an endogenous oocyte protein as a consequence of overexpression of the transporter. The following observations suggest that an endogenous oocyte ion channel mediates the constitutive conductance. First, if the constitutive conductance were an intrinsic property of the transporter it would be expected that there should be a correlation between the amplitude of the leak conductance and the amplitude of the anion conductance. The amplitude of the constitutive conductance was variable both between, and within, batches of oocytes. The amplitude of the leak conductance blocked by 100 µm Zn2+ varied from 250% of the substrate activated anion conductance to <5% of the anion conductance. Second, application of the glutamate transport blocker TBOA to oocytes expressing EAAT4, at concentrations that inhibit the substrate-activated anion conductance, does not block the constitutive conductance. Third, the amplitude of the Zn2+-blocked leak conductance does not appear to influence any of the transporter-mediated functional properties, such as the EC50 for Zn2+ inhibition of the anion conductance or the extent of inhibition. Fourth, the same variability in amplitude of the leak conductance observed for EAAT4 was also observed for the EAAT4 mutants, EAAT4 H154A, EAAT4 H164A, EAAT4 H164E, EAAT4 C194A, and EAAT4 C356A. Finally, other researchers have also described various Zn2+-blocked conductances in oocytes (20Miledi R. Parker I. Woodward R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 417: 173-195Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that could be responsible for the leak conductance in oocytes expressing EAAT4. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the constitutive conductance, or some proportion of the conductance, is an intrinsic property of the transporter that functions independently of the transport function, the above observations make this interpretation unlikely. Zn2+ is found throughout the brain and may modulate the actions of glutamate by influencing the activity of NMDA receptors (12Westbrook G.L. Mayer M.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 13Peters S. Koh J. Choi D.W. Science. 1987; 236: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), Ca2+ channels (14Busselberg D. Platt B. Michael D. Carpenter D.O. Haas H.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and also glutamate transporters (15Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The actions of Zn2+ are most clearly demonstrated in the mossy fibers of the hippocampus where Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate upon stimulation (11Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Whereas there are a number of physiological and pathological implications of Zn2+ modulation of excitatory neurotransmission, Zn2+ may also be used to study potential mechanisms for modulation of various proteins, including glutamate transporters. In this study we have used Zn2+ as a molecular probe to identify the molecular basis for differential modulation of the coupled and uncoupled conductance states of the glutamate transporter EAAT4. There are two distinct types of conductances associated with glutamate transporter function: a coupled flux of Na+, H+, K+, and glutamate ions (7Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and an uncoupled anion conductance that requires the presence ofl-glutamate and Na+ ions (2Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 9Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of the two components vary with the different transporter subtypes, and the effects of Zn2+ on these conductances also vary between transporter subtypes. In the case of EAAT1, we have previously demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibits the coupled Na+, K+, H+, and glutamate fluxes with little, if any, effect on the uncoupled anion conductance, whereas application of Zn2+ to oocytes expressing EAAT2 or EAAT3, does not appear to modulate any of the transporter-associated conductances (16Vandenberg R.J.

In the present study we have investigated the actions of Zn2+ on the uncoupled anion conductance and the coupled substrate transport conductance of the EAAT4 subtype. We have demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibits the uncoupled anion conductance of EAAT4 and also causes a small, but significant, increase in l-aspartate EC50. Although Zn2+reduced the amplitude of the anion conductances of EAAT4, Zn2+ did not change the reversal potentials of the anion conductances when carried by chloride, bromide, iodide or nitrate ions. The lack of changes in anion permeability suggests that Zn2+ binds to a site on EAAT4 that is distinct from the pore region of the transporter. The IC50 for Zn2+ inhibition of the anion conductance decreases with an increase in membrane potential from 86 µm at −100 mV to 38 µm at +60 mV and the extent of maximal inhibition of the anion conductance also changes from 58% at −100 mV to 81% at +60 mV. These observations could be explained if the time spent in transport mode compared with anion-conducting mode is also dependent on membrane potential. At positive membrane potentials, the anion-conducting mode may predominate and as Zn2+selectively inhibits the anion conductance of the transporter, the measured effects of Zn2+ may be more apparent at these membrane potentials. We have previously demonstrated that two histidine residues within the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 form part of the Zn2+ binding site on EAAT1. Mutations of either of these histidine residues to alanine do not alter the glutamate transport kinetics of EAAT1 but do diminish the effects of Zn2+ on EAAT1 and therefore these Zn2+ binding site residues are unlikely to form part of the pore through which glutamate, Na+, K+, H+ and possibly Cl− ions pass during the transport process. We have now extended this work to include a description of the Zn2+ binding sites on the EAAT4 subtype of excitatory amino acid transporters. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the EAATs shows that the two histidine residues of EAAT1 that bind Zn2+ are conserved in EAAT4. Mutation of either of these histidine residues to alanine abolishes Zn2+ inhibition of the anion conductance of EAAT4 and also Zn2+ modulation of l-aspartate EC50, which demonstrates that Zn2+ interacts with EAAT4 at a similar site to that of EAAT1. Although the Zn2+ binding sites are similar on EAAT1 and EAAT4, the effects of Zn2+ are different. In the case of EAAT1, Zn2+ inhibits the coupled fluxes ofl-glutamate, Na+, K+, and H+ with minimal effect on the anion conductance (16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas for EAAT4 Zn2+ causes a small increase in EC50 for l-aspartate with no change in the level of inhibition of l-aspartate transport and significant inhibition of the anion conductance. There are a number of possible explanations for these differences. Wadiche and Kavanaugh (23Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that glutamate transporters do not simultaneously function as a coupled transporter and an anion channel, but rather the transporters are likely to switch between the two modes of function. As the chloride conductance dominates the combined coupled transport/uncoupled chloride channel conductance in the cases of EAAT4, it may be predicted that the time spent in the anion channel mode is significantly greater than the transporter mode compared with EAAT1. Thus, Zn2+ modulates the dominant process, i.e.the anion conductances of EAAT4 and the coupled glutamate, Na+, K+, H+ fluxes of EAAT1. If we compare the results of the human glutamate transporters expressed in oocytes with that observed for the actions of Zn2+ on glutamate transporters in the salamander retina there are a number of similarities, but also some distinct differences. In Muller cells of the salamander retina the predominant transporter is homologous to EAAT1, and in these cells Zn2+ inhibits glutamate transport currents, but in contrast to human EAAT1 Zn2+ stimulates the uncoupled chloride conductance. Furthermore, the K 0.5 for Zn2+modulation of the Muller cell transporter is 0.66 µm, which is ∼10–20-fold less than that observed for EAAT1. In other Zn2+-binding proteins the number of coordinating residues roughly correlates with the affinity of Zn2+. With 2 coordinating histidine residues affinities range from 10–100 µm whereas with 3 coordinating residues affinities in the range of 0.01–1 µm have been observed (17Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 280-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher affinity of Zn2+ for the salamander EAAT1 may be due to the presence of an additional coordinating residue. If the amino acid sequences of the human and salamander EAAT1 s are compared in the putative Zn2+ binding site region a number of subtle differences are apparent that could explain the different effects of Zn2+ (Fig. 1). The salamander EAAT1 contains an extra histidine residue between the two histidine residues conserved between the human and salamander EAAT1s that could possibly influence the binding affinity or could create different conformational changes when Zn2+ is bound compared with Zn2+ binding to EAAT1 such that the different functional effects are created. The differences could also arise because of the expression of other glutamate transporter subtypes or accessory proteins (24Jackson M. Song W. Liu M. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.G. Bowers W.J.

(Lond.). 1999; 520: 393-397Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the Muller cell with each subtype responding differently to Zn2+. In cone cells of the salamander retina, Zn2+ inhibits the chloride conductance associated with glutamate transporters of the retinal cone cells (27Sarantis M. Everett K. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 332: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The predominant glutamate transporter in cone cells is homologous to human EAAT5, but in oocytes expressing human EAAT5, Zn2+ appears to stimulate the anion conductance. 3W. Fairman and S. Amara, personal communication. The quarternary structure of glutamate transporters is poorly defined, but recent characterization of electron micrographs ofX. laevis oocyte membranes containing the EAAT3 transporters suggests that transporters may exist as homomultimers consisting of between 3–6 subunits, with 5 subunits the most favored option (28Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8641-8646Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that the subunits may function as separate transporters, but the chloride channel function of the transporters may arise through the association of the subunits to form a central channel. The binding of substrate to each of the subunits may alter the association of the subunits to change the conformation of the central chloride channel and allow passage of chloride ions. If this functional model is correct then the actions of Zn2+ offer a particularly interesting insight into the mechanisms for differentially modulating the dual roles of glutamate transporters. Thus, the functional role of Zn2+ ions may be to modify the association between subunits so as to change the rate of conformational changes required for the different modes of function of the transporters. The concentrations of Zn2+required to modulate EAAT4 are within the reported concentration range of the free extracellular Zn2+ found in various regions of the brain. EAAT4 is expressed predominantly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, which also co-express EAAT3 (29Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Furuta A. Martin L.J. Lin C.L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Rothstein J.D. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whereas Zn2+ is found in the cerebellum, and numerous studies have investigated the effects of exogenously applied Zn2+ on synaptic neurotransmission in this region, the levels of free Zn2+ found in regions accessible to the transporters under normal or pathological conditions are not well established (10Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). If present in sufficiently high concentrations, Zn2+ would inhibit activation of the anion conductance of EAAT4, which may alter the excitability of the Purkinje cells. An alternative suggestion for the physiological role of Zn2+ binding to glutamate transporters is that the functional consequences of the action (inhibition of transport or modulation of the chloride conductance) may not be of particular relevance and that the primary role of Zn2+ binding to transporters may be to provide a mechanism to limit exposure of other synaptic proteins to the deleterious effects of Zn2+ during pathological insults. In a number of brain regions glutamate transporters are expressed at very high levels in close proximity of the synapse (29Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8751-8757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with one estimate being that the number of transporters in close proximity to the glutamate release site is greater than the number of glutamate molecules released from a single synaptic vesicle (32Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8751-8757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when Zn2+concentrations are elevated, which may occur under various pathological conditions (33Weiss K.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), transporters may provide a sink for excessive Zn2+ and thereby limit exposure of other synaptic proteins, such as ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are unlikely to be present at the same density as the transporters. The binding of Zn2+ to highly abundant glutamate transporters may also serve to limit the extent of Zn2+ uptake, which can be excitotoxic to neurons (33Weiss K.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).

The importance of this channel type for neurological disorders is further emphasized by the recent finding that Cav2.1-deficient mice develop hallmark characteristics of severe ataxia and dystonia and subsequently die 3–4 weeks after birth (13Jun K. Piedras-Renteria E.S. Smith S.M. Wheeler D.B. Lee S.B. Lee T.G. Chin H. Adams M.E. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15245-15250Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The rate of voltage-dependent channel closure during depolarization, a process termed inactivation, is an important determinant of Ca2+ entry during a neuronal action potential. Three different types of Ca2+ channel inactivation processes have been identified in Cav2.1 channels: fast and slow voltage-dependent inactivation (14De Waard M. Campbell P.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,15Sokolov S. Weiss R.G. Hering S. J. Physiol.

Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Cav2.1 inactivation is strongly influenced by α12.1-β-subunit interaction. For example, coexpression of β2a results in substantially slowerIBa inactivation compared with channels composed of either β1a- or β3-subunits (14De Waard M. Campbell P.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W.

Sequence stretches responsible for α12.1 interaction with different β-subunits have been identified on intracellular linkers between domains I-II (I-II linker) and the amino and carboxyl termini (19Pragnell M.

Moreover, a soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide factor) attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-protein interaction domain within the II-III linker also influences inactivation gating of Cav2.1 (22Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 23Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structural determinants of Cav2.1 inactivation are widely spread over the α12.1-subunit (see Ref. 25Hering S. Berjukow S. Sokolov S. Marksteiner R. Weiss R.G. Kraus R. Timin E.N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 528: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar for review). The first molecular determinants involved in the process of Cav2.1 inactivation were disclosed by Zhang et al. (26Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated a key role of segment IS6 and adjacent intra- and extracellular stretches in the rate of channel inactivation. An important role of segment IVS6 was subsequently demonstrated by Döring et al. (27Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations within IVS6 of Cav2.1 produce profound effects on the pharmacological properties of Cav2.1 as well as on inactivation (28Hering S. Aczél S. Grabner M. Doring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J.

However, the precise relationship (e.g.common or independent mechanisms) between IVS6- and β-subunit-mediated alterations in CaV2.1 inactivation remains to be elucidated. Here we evaluate previously observed IVS6-mediated changes in Cav2.1 inactivation (27Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at the level of single amino acids. The results identify a number of residues within IVS6 that represent critical determinants of voltage-dependent inactivation of CaV2.1. Systematic substitution of the important inactivation determinant Met-1811 by amino acid residues of different side chain length, charge, or polarity resulted in an array of channel constructs with inactivation properties that varied from being comparable with that of wild-type (e.g. M1811S) to an acceleration of inactivation by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (M1811Q). Thus, Met-1811 obviously imparts a strong influence on the rate of fast voltage-dependent inactivation of CaV2.1. Coexpression of the α12.1 mutants with either “fast-inactivating” (β1a, β3) or “slow-inactivating” (β2a) β-subunits demonstrates that the β2a-subunit destabilizes the fast-inactivated channel conformation of CaV2.1. A model is proposed to describe the kinetic changes induced by β2a-subunit interaction with the different α12.1 mutants. The Cav2.1 mutants were constructed by introducing point mutations into α12.1 cDNA (BI-2 accession numberX57477; Ref. 3Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F.

Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). IVS6 segments of CaV2.1 and CaV1.1 differ by only eight amino acids. Thus, we systematically replaced each of these residues within Cav2.1 by their Cav1.1 counterparts (30Grabner M. Friedrich K. Knaus H.G. Striessnig J. Scheffauer F. Staudinger R. Koch W.J. Schwartz A. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Residue Met-1811 (displaying the most dramatic changes in inactivation gating) was subsequently mutated to a number of alternative amino acids resulting in constructs M1811A, M1811S, M1811F, M1811I, M1811E, M1811N, M1811K, and M1811Q. Amino acids in segment IVS6 that are conserved in all Ca2+channels were substituted by alanine residues (except for the alanine at position 1817, which was replaced by a serine residue). Only 3 out of the 8 mutant cDNAs (N1813A, A1817S, and M1820A) resulted in functional channels when the cRNAs were injected intoXenopus oocytes. However, substitution of the other amino acids by a methionine residue resulted in functional Cav2.1 mutants: Y1799M, F1800M, S1802M, F1803M, F1809M. Ala-1817 was additionally mutated to a methionine, resulting in functional A1817M construct. All constructs were inserted into the polyadenylating transcription plasmids pNKS2 (a kind gift of Dr. O. Pongs) and verified by sequence analysis. Preparation of stage V-VI oocytes fromXenopus laevis, synthesis of capped off run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from linearized cDNA templates, and injection of cRNA were performed as previously described in detail by Grabner et al. (31Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Barium currents through calcium channels (IBa) were studied 2–7 days after microinjection of approximately equimolar cRNA mixtures of wild type α12.1 IVS6 mutants (0.3 ng/50 nl) with β1a, β2a, or β3 (0.1 ng/50 nl) and α2-δ (0.1 ng/50 nl) using the two microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The bath solution contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm CsOH adjusted to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid as previously described (32Berjukow S. Marksteiner R. Gapp F. Sinnegger M.J.

Endogenous chloride currents were suppressed by injecting 20–40 nl of a 0.1 mBAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) solution 30–240 min before voltage clamp measurements. Voltage-recording and current-injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mmEGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and had resistances of 0.3–2 megaohms. Only IBa with amplitudes ranging between 0.3 and 1.5 μA were analyzed. The rate of inactivation (kdecay) was determined by fitting the initial phase of the current decay toIBa = C exp(-kdecay t). Voltage steps were applied from −80 mV to the peak current potential of the current voltage relationship (I-V) (i.e. voltage of the maximal inward current of the different α12.1/α2-δ/β1a constructs ranged from 7 ± 3 mV in L1812I to 20 ± 3 mV in mutant Y1797V). Coexpression of β2a did not significantly shift the peak of the I-V curve compared with other β-subunit compositions. The voltage of half-maximal inactivation (V0.5,inact) under quasi steady-state conditions was measured using a multi-step protocol. A control test pulse (50 ms to the peak potential of the I-V curve) was followed by a 1.5-s step to −100 mV followed by a 3-s conditioning step, a 4-ms step to −100 mV, and a subsequent test pulse to the peak potential. Inactivation during the 3-s conditioning pulse was calculated asIBa,inact = 1 − IBatest/IBa control. The pulse sequence was applied every 3 min from a holding potential of −100 mV, and the estimated inactivation curves were fitted to a Boltzmann equation: IBa,inact =Iss + (1 − Iss)/(1 + exp[(V −V0.5,inact)/k]), where Vis the membrane potential, V0.5,inact is the midpoint voltage of the inactivation curve, k is a slope factor, and Iss represents the fraction of a noninactivating current. The voltage of half-maximal activation (V0.5,act) was estimated fromgpeak/gpeak,max = 0.5, where gpeak =Ipeak/(V −Erev), gpeak,max is the maximum value of gpeak measured at the descending part of the I-V curve, and Erev is the reversal potential. Recovery from inactivation was studied using a conventional double-pulse protocol. After depolarizing the channels from a holding potential of −80 mV for 3 s to the peak current potential of the I-V curve, 30-ms test pulses were applied at various time intervals to the same voltage. Peak IBa values were normalized to the peak current measured during the pre-pulse, and the time course of IBa recovery from inactivation was fitted to a biexponential function (IBa,recovery = Aexp(−t/τfast) + Bexp(−t/τslow) +C). The pClamp software package (Version 6.0 Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used for data acquisition and preliminary analysis. Microcal Origin 5.0 was employed for analysis and curve fitting. Data are given as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated according to Student's unpaired t test (p < 0.05 forn ≥ 4). We have previously reported that replacing α12.1 segment IVS6 by α11.1 sequence results in a pronounced acceleration of the inactivation kinetics of the resulting Cav2.1/Cav1.1 chimera (AL23 in Ref. 27Döring F.

Fig. 1 A illustrates the putative folding structure of a Cav2.1 channel (segment IVS6 is highlighted). Of the 25 amino acids predicted to form transmembrane segment IVS6, 8 residues are different between α12.1- and α11.1-subunits (shaded residues shown in Fig. 1 B). To assess their individual impact in inactivation gating, we substituted each of these residues by the corresponding α11.1 amino acids. The resulting 8 mutant channels, Y1797V, V1801L, I1804Y, F1805M, S1808A, M1811I, L1812I, V1818L (Fig. 1 C), were expressed together with α2-δ and β1a auxiliary subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and their inactivation properties were analyzed using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild type α12.1/α2-δ/β1a channels inactivated at a rate (kinact) of 1.35 ± 0.25 s−1. Only two of the point mutations (M1811I and L1812I) induced a pronounced acceleration of inactivation kinetics. Mutants V1801L, F1805M, and S1808A exhibited a small but significant acceleration, whereas V1818I inactivated at a significantly slower rate compared with wild type Cav2.1 (Fig.2 A). An 8-fold acceleration in the rate of IBa inactivation observed for M1811I (kinact = 10.8 ± 1.5 s−1) was not significantly different from that of AL23 (kinact = 11 ± 0.8 s−1, see inset of Fig.2 A). The second fastest inactivation rate (kinact = 5.26 ± 0.39 s−1) was observed for mutation L1812I, located adjacent to M1811. Compared with wild type, the double mutant ML1811/1812II (ML/II)1exhibited an accelerated rate of current inactivation (not significantly different from M1811I, p > 0.05, Fig.2 A). However, only ML/II, and not M1811I, exhibited aV0.5,inact value comparable with that of AL23 (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, these data indicate that both Met-1811 and Leu-1812 significantly contribute to the AL23 inactivation phenotype. The effects of the amino acid substitutions on the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation are illustrated in Fig.2 B. The mean voltages of half inactivation (V0.5,inact) ranged between −32 ± 2 mV in ML/II to −6 ± 3 mV in Y1797V. A comparison of the mean half-activation voltages revealed that only L1812I and V1801L induced a significant shift to more negative voltages (V0.5,act = −3 ± 2 mV (L1812I) andV0.5,act = −7 ± 2 mV (V1801L) compared with Cav2.1 V0.5,act = 2 ± 2, Fig. 2 B). The data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that Met-1811 plays a pivotal role in the rate of voltage-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1. To more thoroughly evaluate the role of residue 1811, we systematically replaced this amino acid by residues of different size, polarity, and charge. Surprisingly, all substitutions of Met-1811 accelerated the time course of current inactivation. Replacements of Met-1811 by amino acids with side chains of different charge or polarity (Gln, Glu, Asn, Lys) induced a substantial acceleration of the IBa decay ranging from about 12-fold M1811K (kinact = 16.3 ± 1.3 s−1) to about 75-fold for M1811Q (kinact = 102 ± 3 s−1). Interestingly, M1811Q inactivated with similar kinetics as Cav3.1 (kinact = 104 ± 3 s−1), a channel known to display one of the fastest inactivation kinetics among all Ca2+channel subtypes (Fig. 3). Substitutions by hydrophobic residues of different size resulted in less pronounced effects on IBa decay (range between 2-fold in M1811A (kinact = 2.23 ± 0.24 s−1) and 8-fold in M1811I (kinact = 10.8 ± 1.5 s−1); Fig. 3, A andB). The effect of a given mutation on the time course of fastIBa inactivation usually correlated with the half-maximal voltage of Ca2+ channel inactivation (M1811K (V0.5,inact = −41 ± 1 mV), M1811E (V0.5,inact = −40 ± 2 mV), M1811Q (V0.5,inact = −32 ± 2 mV), and M1811N (V0.5,inact = −33 ± 2 mV), see Fig.3 C). The half-inactivation voltages of M1811F, M1811S, and M1811A were not significantly shifted compared with wild type α12.1/α2-δ/β1a(V0.5,inact = −8 ± 2 mV, Fig. 3 C). Half-maximal activation of the various Met-1811 mutants occurred between V0.5,act = 0 ± 2 mV (M1811S) and 10 ± 2 (M1811F). Small (<10 mV) but significant shifts inV0.5,act to more positive voltages were observed for M1811Q, M1811F, and M1811K (p < 0.05, Fig.3 C). To investigate inactivation properties of methionine 1811 substitutions in more detail, we also analyzed the rate of recovery from inactivation. The rapidly inactivating construct M1811Q/α2-δ/β1a recovered from fast inactivation with surprisingly similar kinetics as that of wild type α12.1/α2-δ/β1a channels (see Fig. 4 A). Analogous observations were made for other Met-1811 mutants (Fig. 4 B). Thus, these data suggest that despite pronounced acceleration in the rate of fast inactivation (ranging from about 12-fold in M1811K to almost 75-fold in M1811Q, Fig. 3 A), these mutations facilitate entry into the fast-inactivated state without affecting stability of the inactivated state. As illustrated in Fig.1 B, eight amino acids in segment IVS6 are perfectly conserved in all Ca2+ channel subtypes. To analyze the impact of these residues on inactivation gating, we mutated each conserved amino acid to an alanine (alanine at position 1817 to serine). Only three of these mutants (N1813A, A1817S, and M1820A) formed functional Ca2+ channels in Xenopusoocytes after injection of the cRNAs together with α2-δ - and β3-subunits. The remaining five amino acids (and additionally A1817) were subsequently mutated to methionine. Each methionine mutant (Y1899M, F1800M, S1802M, F1803M, F1809M, and A1817M) formed a functional α12.1(mutant)/α2-δ/β3(kinact = 3.15 ± 0.25 s−1) channel. The strongest effects onIBa decay were observed for mutants A1817M (3.6-fold, kinact = 11.6 ± 0.9 s−1), N1813A (2.7-fold,kinact = 8.03 ± 0.6 s−1), and S1802M (1.5-fold withkinact = 5.57 ± 0.27 s−1, see Fig.5 A for other mutants). The same trend was observed for mutants N1813A and A1817M coexpressed with the β1a-subunit (data not shown). Significant (p < 0.01) shifts (compared with −19 ± 2 mV in α12.1/α2-δ/β3) in the half-maximal voltage of the inactivation curves were observed for mutants A1817M (−40 ± 2 mV), A1817S (−35 ± 3 mV), N1813A (−24 ± 2 mV), and M1820A (−24 ± 1 mV). The voltages of half-maximal activation and inactivation of the different channel constructs are summarized in Fig. 5 C. It is well established that different β-subunits differentially modulate the inactivation kinetics of Cav2.1 (14De Waard M. Campbell P.P. J. Physiol.

To elucidate the role of structural changes in different parts of segment IVS6 on β-subunit modulation, we systematically analyzedIBa inactivation kinetics of our Cav2.1 mutants when expressed in combination with either β1a-subunit or β2a-subunits. As illustrated in Fig. 6, we observed two principal patterns of β2a-subunit modulation. In most of the IVS6 mutants, coexpression of the β2a-subunit dramatically slowed the fast component in IBadecay (called herein type I modulation, Fig. 6, A andB, left panels). This pattern of β2a modulation was previously documented for wild type α12.1 (14De Waard M. Campbell P.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Sokolov S. Weiss R.G. Hering S. J. Physiol.

A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A different type of modulation was observed for M1811Q, M1811E, M1811N, and M1811K. In those fast-inactivating α12.1(mutant)/α2-δ/β1aconstructs, coexpression of β2a had much less effect on the transient current decay but, instead, induced a slowly inactivatingIBa component (type II modulation, Fig. 6,A and B, right panels). Thus, our data clearly demonstrate that depending on the initial rate ofIBa inactivation, coexpression of the β2a-subunit results in distinct inactivation phenotypes. Structural determinants of Cav2.1 inactivation are located in different parts of Ca2+ channel α1-subunits, including pore-forming transmembrane segments and loops, intracellular domain linkers, and the carboxyl terminus (Refs. 35Herlitze S.

Fast and slow voltage-dependent inactivation of this channel type are regulated by auxiliary β-subunits and other intracellular regulator proteins (14De Waard M. Campbell P.P. J. Physiol.

The molecular mechanism of Ca2+ channel inactivation and its modulation by various β-subunits are still incompletely understood. In particular, the question of whether β-subunit-induced changes in Ca2+ channel gating are dependent on inactivation determinants in segment IVS6 remains unanswered. In the present study we created 25 α12.1 point mutants with substantially different inactivation properties by replacing residues in segment IVS6 that are conserved in all other Ca2+ channel classes by either alanine or methionine residues. In addition, we also mutated specific α12.1 IVS6 residues to the corresponding residues found in α11.2. The impact of inactivation determinants in segment IVS6 in β-subunit modulation was subsequently analyzed by expressing the mutant α12.1 with either fast-inactivating β1a- and β3-subunits or the slow-inactivating β2a-subunit. The individual replacement of eight non-conserved IVS6 amino acids in α12.1 by the corresponding α11.1 residues enabled the identification of two amino acids that strongly influence Cav2.1 inactivation. Our data demonstrate that mutations of M1811I result in an acceleration in the time course ofIBa decay to nearly the same extent as the replacement of the entire IVS6 segment by α11.1 sequence (Fig. 2 A). The second strongest effect was observed for substitution L1812I located adjacent to Met-1811 (Fig. 1 A). Simultaneous replacement of both α12.1 residues by their α11.1 counterparts almost perfectly reproduced the phenotype of chimera AL23 (27Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a chimera in which the entire IVS6 segment is of α11.1 sequence. The similarity between ML/II and AL23 is emphasized by the fact that these two constructs exhibit not only similar rates of IBainactivation (Fig. 2 A) but also similar midpoint voltages of activation and steady-state inactivation (Fig. 2 B). Significant but less pronounced effects on channel inactivation were also observed for mutations V1801L, F1805M, and S1808A (Fig.2 A). Other amino acid substitutions had minor effects on the time course of IBa inactivation. However, their contribution to Cav2.1 inactivation is illustrated by the significant shifts of the availability curve (Fig.2 B). Most dramatic changes in Cav2.1 inactivation occurred upon substitution of Met-1811 by glutamine or other charged/polar amino acids (M1811Q > M1811N > M1811E > M1811K). For example, M1811Q induced a 75-fold acceleration in the initial rate ofIBa inactivation compared with wild type, resulting in a Cav2.1 mutant inactivating with similar kinetics as Cav3.1 (Fig. 3). We mutated each of the amino acids that are conserved between all Ca2+ channel α1-subunits in order to probe the role of these residues in Ca2+ channel inactivation. Out of the eight alanine substitution mutants, only N1813A, M1820A, and A1817S formed functional Ca2+ channels. It is unclear if the cRNA of the non-expressing mutants is translated and the resulting α1-subunits represent non-conducting channels or if expression is stopped on the level of translation. However, substitution of the residues concerned by methionine (Y1899M, F1800M, S1802M, F1803M, F1809M, and A1817M) resulted in functional α12.1 mutants. Of these mutants, the most significant acceleration in channel inactivation was observed for mutations N1813A and A1817M. However, compared with up to a 75-fold acceleration inIBa inactivation observed upon mutation of Met-1811, substitutions of the non-conserved IVS6 residues clearly exhibit a less significant influence on the rate of Cav2.1 inactivation. Thus, we hypothesize that Met-1811 along with the closely located Leu-1812, Asn-1813, and Ala-1817 residues plays a critical role in helix packing within this putative bundle-crossing region of Ca2+ channel α1-subunits (in analogy to the orientation of S6 segments in KcsA channels (40Doyle D.A.

Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholarfor review). Consistent with this notion, strong effects of amino acid substitutions within the inner pore region of Ca2+ channel α1-subunits have previously been reported for segment IVS6 of α11.2 (42Berjukow S.

( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Multiple β-subunits appear to be associated to various extents in different parts of the mammalian brain with the α12.1-subunit (43Tanaka O. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 10-16Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 44Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Therefore, inactivation of Cav2.1 is expected to be modulated by tissue-specific β-subunit expression. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of β-subunit modulation of α12.1, we investigated the role of inactivation determinants within segment IVS6 on Cav2.1 inactivation observed in the presence of either β1a- or β2a-subunits. Thus, we compared the kinetic properties of fast-inactivating α12.1(mutant)/α2-δ/β1achannels with the corresponding channel construct formed using β2a-subunits (α12.1(mutant)/α2-δ/β2a). As illustrated in Fig. 6, A and B, we observed two principle phenotypes of β2a modulation. One pattern of modulation (type I, Fig. 6 A) was exhibited by wild type Cav2.1 channels and all IVS6 mutations that induced only moderate changes in the rate of fast inactivation (Figs. 2 Aand 3 A). Coexpressing these constructs with β2a resulted in a dramatic decrease of fast inactivation (illustrated in the left panels of Fig.6 B for wild type α12.1/α2-δ/β2a and M1811I/α2-δ/β2a channels). Type II modulation was found only in mutants that exhibited very rapid inactivation kinetics (such as M1811Q/α12.1/α2-δ/β1a and M1811N/α12.1/α2-δ/β1a, Fig.6, A and B, right panels). For these mutants, coexpression of β2a did not markedly slow the transient component in IBa inactivation but, instead, attenuated a slow component of current decay. One hypothesis that can be put forward to explain the different kinetic phenotypes is that structural changes in segment IVS6 affects the interaction of β2a with α12.1(mutant)-subunits. Under this scenario, IVS6 residues would form part of a receptor for a β2a-modulated inactivation gate or lid interacting from the intracellular side of the channel pore (see Ref. 46Stotz S.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24575-24582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar for a proposed hinged lid mechanism of Cav2.3 involving the I-II linker and segments IIS6 and IIIS6; see also Ref. 47Cens T. Restituito S. Galas S. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5483-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the frame of such a hypothesis, structural changes in segment IVS6 would alter inactivation by changing the affinity of such a receptor site. Alternatively, the α12.1-β interaction might be unaffected by structural changes in segment IVS6, and type I and type II modulation could simply result from an interplay of changes in microscopic inactivation rate constants induced by the different constructs. We have, therefore, analyzed the β2a-induced changes in inactivation gating of α12.1 point mutants with type I and type II modulation in terms of a simple Cav2.1 inactivation model that accounts for state transitions between open (O), fast-inactivated (Fast-I), and slow-inactivated states (Slow-I) during a membrane depolarization (Fig.7 A; see also Ref. 15Sokolov S. Weiss R.G. Hering S. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each of the α12.1 point mutations caused individual effects on the microscopic rate constants of fast (α, β) and slow inactivation (γ, δ). Fig. 7 B illustrates four typical examples for type I or type II modulation simulated by means of domestically written software: wild type α12.1/α2-δ/β1a channels, mutation M1811I/α2-δ/β1a inducing an 8-fold acceleration of IBa decay, and two mutants that were typical for type II modulation (M1811Q/α2-δ/β1a with 75- and M1811N/α2-δ/β1a with about 20-fold fasterIBa decay than wild type). An ∼1000-fold acceleration of a single microscopic transition rate (β) from the fast-inactivated to the open state reproduced the β2a-subunit-induced changes in inactivation in all cases. A similar acceleration in the rate constant β reproduced type I and type II modulation of other α12.1 mutants illustrated in Fig. 6 A (data not shown). Taken together, the simulations suggest that the β2a-subunit destabilizes the fast-inactivated channel conformation similarly for each of the α12.1 mutants. Therefore, the different inactivation patterns of wild type Cav2.1 and α12.1(mutant)/α2-δ/β2aconstructs (type I and type II) are likely to arise from the interplay of microscopic transition rates between the open and fast-inactivated states (see the legend of Fig. 7). In summary, we identified new hot spots of determinants of Ca2+ channel inactivation within the IVS6 segment of α12.1. Substitution of two Cav2.1 amino acids by their Cav1.1 counterparts (ML1811/1812II) reproduced the inactivation properties (i.e. rate of inactivation, V0.5,act, and V0.5,inact) of a previously studied chimeric channel (AL23, Ref. 27Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that these residues markedly contribute to voltage-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1. Nevertheless, the structural details of how the IVS6 segment within Cav2.1 influences channel inactivation remain to be clarified. Noncovalent interactions of specific IVS6 residues with neighboring transmembrane segments (i.e. IS6 or IVS5) are feasible. It will, therefore, be interesting to study if similar changes in Cav2.1 inactivation occur upon amino acid substitutions on other S6 segments by charged or polar residues. The most intriguing result of this study, perhaps is that IVS6- and β2a-subunit-mediated conformational changes during Cav2.1 inactivation apparently occur in an independent manner (Fig. 7). Hence, type I and type II kinetics of the different α12.1 IVS6 mutants can be simulated by assuming a uniform β2a-mediated destabilization of the fast-inactivated channel state (Fig. 7). We thank Prof. H. Glossmann for continuous support, Dr. Perez-Reyes for the cDNA of the α13.1-subunit, Dr. E. N. Timin for the computer simulation software, and Dr. R.T. Dirksen for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1980868563,"In mammalian cells transcription factors of the AP-1 family are activated by either stress signals such as UV radiation, or mitogenic signals such as growth factors. Here we show that a similar situation exists in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The AP-1 transcriptional activator Gcn4, known to be activated by stress signals such as UV radiation and amino acids starvation, is also induced by growth stimulation such as glucose. We show that glucose-dependent Gcn4 activation is mediated through the Ras/cAMP pathway. This pathway is also responsible for UV-dependent Gcn4 activation but is not involved in Gcn4 activation by amino acid starvation. Thus, the unusual phenomenon of activation of mitogenic pathways and AP-1 factors by contradictory stimuli through Ras is conserved from yeast to mammals. We also show that activation of Gcn4 by glucose and UV requires Gcn2 activity. However, in contrast to its role in amino acid starvation, Gcn2 does not increase eIF2alpha phosphorylation or translation of GCN4 mRNA in response to glucose or UV. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of action for Gcn2. The finding that Gcn4 is activated in response to glucose via the Ras/cAMP pathway suggests that this cascade coordinates glucose metabolism with amino acids and purine biosynthesis and thereby ensures availability of both energy and essential building blocks for continuation of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1977233573,"Caspases play important roles in regulating apoptotic signaling pathways. Here we report the cloning, by the yeast two hybrid system with dominant negative caspase-2 as “bait,” of a proapoptotic molecule named proapoptotic caspase adaptor protein (PACAP), encoded by a 372-base pair open reading frame. Binding of this novel protein to caspase-2 (casp-2) was confirmed in yeast two hybrid,in vitro, and in vivo assays. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed homology to functional motifs, including ATP and cytochrome c binding sites. PACAP mRNA was widely expressed in most human tissues; in transfected cells, PACAP was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm. Bindings studies with the PACAP recombinant protein demonstrated specific binding to casp-2 and casp-9 but not to casp-3, -4, -7, or -8 in cell extracts. Cotransfection experiments showed that PACAP binds to casp-2 and -9 in 293T cells. In addition, studies with truncated PACAP demonstrated a requirement for residues 39–72 of PACAP for specific binding to casp-2 and -9. Transient transfection of PACAP into 293T human kidney cells and rat-1 fibroblasts triggered apoptosis at 24 h, which was at least in part prevented by an inhibitor of casp-3-like enzymes. Transfection of PACAP into human B cell lines using a retroviral system also triggered apoptotic cell death. In addition, transcription of PACAP in primary human B cells was dramatically down-regulated early after cellular activation by CD40L and Staphylococcus aureus and markedly up-regulated as the cells apoptose. These findings identify a novel proapoptotic caspase adaptor protein. Caspases play important roles in regulating apoptotic signaling pathways.

Apoptotic signaling pathways are dependent on the activation, by proteolytic cleavage after key aspartic acid residues, of a family of cysteine proteases, termed caspases, which mediate cleavage and functional destruction of various essential intracellular proteins. Cleavage-dependent activation of caspases is mediated by other caspases or autocatalytically with the assistance of adaptor proteins, such as Apaf-1,1 Nod/caspase recruitment domain 4 (CARD4), RAIDD/CRADD, DEFCAP, and NAC, which facilitate the formation of multimolecular complexes, oligomerization of included caspases, and autocatalytic activation (4Nicholson D.W.

Fourteen structurally related mammalian caspases have been identified to date and subgrouped into three subfamilies based on phylogenetic considerations, sequence homology, predicted structure, and substrate specificity (4Nicholson D.W.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Various death stimuli, such as TNF α or Fas ligand, growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, certain drugs, etc., activate caspase-dependent intracellular signaling pathways (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). The “initiating” or “upstream” caspases in these pathways contain a large amino-terminal prodomain, termed a CARD, which contains motifs for protein-protein interactions, whereas effector or downstream caspases contain short prodomains (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). Activation of effector caspases leads to cleavage and functional destruction of various essential intracellular proteins and thus to apoptotic cell death (4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

Several apoptotic stimuli induce the release of cytochrome c(cyt c) from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it interacts with the WD40 motif of the adaptor protein Apaf-1. Apaf-1 and cyt c complexes apparently not only facilitate the hydrolysis of dATP/ATP, but they also oligomerize via CED4 domains into larger complexes, which bind and facilitate the activation of procaspase-9 (10Srinivasula S.M.

Such apoptosome complexes also contain casp-3 and -7, indicating that casp-9-mediated activation of these effector caspases occurs in the apoptosome (13Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G.

Other studies in cell-free lysates have shown that casp-9 is activated in cell free lysates in a Apaf-1-dependent manner after addition of cyt c and that Apaf-1-independent sequential activation of casp-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and 10, but not of casp-1, -4, and -5, follows (15Slee E.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). In the immune system, apoptosis triggered by ligation of T or B cell antigen receptors may trigger cellular proliferation and differentiation or, alternatively, negative signals leading to apoptosis, depending on many factors, including cellular maturation state, tissue location, and co-ligation of other cell surface receptors (2Rothstein T.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 476-487Google Scholar). In our previous studies of apoptosis triggered by ligation of the BCR on Epstein-Barr virus-negative mature and immature human B cell lines, we found that cell death proceeded via a previously unreported intracellular signaling pathway (17Chen W. Wang H.-G. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 163: 2483-2491Google Scholar). Casp-2 was activated early after B cell receptor ligation and was required for apoptosis, whereas casp-3, an effector caspase involved in most apoptotic pathways, was activated subsequently. Casp-9 was activated much later and likely functioned to amplify the apoptotic signal. Casp-8 and -1, which are activated by ligation of the CD95 and TNF-R1 cell death receptors, were not involved (17Chen W. Wang H.-G. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 163: 2483-2491Google Scholar). Although casp-2 has been found to become activated upstream of casp-3 in various primary cultures and cell lines in response to different apoptotic stimuli, including etoposide, γ-irradiation, or growth factor withdrawal, and to induce apoptosis upon overexpression in various cell types (18Kumar S.

J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its involvement early in apoptosis triggered by ligation of a membrane receptor is unprecedented. Casp-2 is unique among the caspases because it exhibits sequence similarity and shares structural features of two of the caspase subfamilies with a CARD prodomain characteristic of initiator caspases and a substrate specificity more typical of downstream effector caspases; for these reasons, it is grouped in a separate subfamily. Two mechanisms for casp-2 activation have been reported. First, the CARD of casp-2 binds to the CARD of a 22-kDa death adaptor protein termed RAIDD or CRADD (26Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar, 27Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because RAIDD/CRADD also contains a death domain (DD) capable of binding the DD of a protein termed RIP, a component of the TNF-R1 and CD95 signaling complex, it is postulated that RAIDD/CRADD couples casp-2 to the death signaling complex, leading to casp-2 activation (26Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar, 27Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Second, casp-2 has been shown to be activated by the cytotoxic lymphocyte granule proteins granzyme B and perforin (20Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13124-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, casp-2 is essential for apoptosis of B lymphoblasts triggered by granzyme B and oocytes triggered by doxorubicin (28Bergeron, L., Perez, G. I., Macdonald, G., Shi, L., Sun, Y., Jurisicova, A., Varmuza, S., Latham, K. E., Flaws, J. A., Salter, J. C. M., Hara, H., Moskowitz, M. A., Li, E., Greenberg, A., Tilly, J. L., and Yuan, J. (1998) Genes Dev. 1304–1314.Google Scholar) and for apoptosis of neurons stimulated by amyloid β-peptide (25Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Friedman W.J. Frappier T.F. Brown K. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were initiated in order to determine the mechanism of activation of casp-2 in apoptosis of B cells triggered by ligation of the antigen receptor. Because caspases interact with other proteins that regulate their activation and function, as noted above, we sought to identify a casp-2-interacting protein by screening a B cell library using the yeast two hybrid system with dominant negative casp-2 as “bait.” The cloning and functional studies of the novel protein termed proapoptoticcaspase adaptor protein (PACAP) are presented here. Human 293T embryonic kidney cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The human Epstein-Barr virus-negative B lymphoma lines B104 and ST486 (17Chen W. Wang H.-G. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 163: 2483-2491Google Scholar) and Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. FITC-labeled antibody to CD20; allophycocyanin-labeled antibodies to CD25, CD69, and CD86; biotin-labeled antibody to CD30; phycoerythrin-labeled antibody to CD80; and anti-casp-2, -4, -7, and -8 were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal anti-casp-9 was purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Mouse monoclonal antibody to Myc was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin was purchased from Pharmingen, and DEVD was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). A cDNA fragment encoding human dominant negative (DN) caspase-2 (17Chen W. Wang H.-G. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 163: 2483-2491Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the SmaI site in pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pBD-GAL4 Cam/DN casp-2. After verification of the sequence, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CG1945 cells (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were sequentially transformed with pBD-GAL4 Cam/DN casp-2 and a human B lymphocyte cDNA library (MATCHMAKER, CLONTECH; >108 cfu/ml) in pACT using a lithium acetate transformation protocol. Selection was done by growth on SD medium lacking histidine, uracil, and tryptophan (CLONTECH). Twenty clones exhibiting activation of the lacZ reporter gene were identified among 3 × 106 transformants by the β-galactosidase assay, but only one shown a reproducible interaction with casp-2 DN. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast colonies by a glass bead phenol-chloroform extraction protocol (CLONTECH). Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with the plasmids, and cells containing the pACT vector were selected in ampicillin resistant plates. The pACT plasmids were isolated from E. coli and restriction-mapped (XhoI), and the sequence of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The sequence upstream of the predicted ATG start site was determined through the use of the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with total RNA isolated with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) from human brain and peripheral blood leukocytes, both of which were found to express high levels of PACAP message. Three nested primers reflecting sequences ∼300 bp downstream from the predicted start site (5′-AGACGTTTCACTTGGTCCACTTCT-3′, 5′CTCCGGTCCAGGACATCCGTGTAG-3′, and 5′-AGTTTGGTCTCTGCC TTTGCCAGAT-3′) were assayed by PCR one at a time with abridged anchor primer provided in the kit. Identical sequences were contained in the 300–500-bp fragments amplified by the three combinations of primers. Yeast two hybrid binding assays were employed to confirm binding of PACAP to DN casp-2. In these experiments, S. cerevisiae CG1945 cells were sequentially transformed with purified pBD-GAL4 Cam/DN casp-2 and pACT containing the novel clone or other control proteins, including pCL1 (coding for the wild type GAL4 protein) and pVA3–1 (a fusion of murine p53 and GAL4DNA-BD). Interactions between the two proteins were confirmed by activation of both reporter genes (lacZ and LEU2). Radiolabeled (35S) DN casp-2 was generated using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Unincorporated isotope was removed by passage through a G25 Sephadex column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography revealed the presence of a strongly labeled 47 kDa band, consistent with the presence of DN casp-2. For the preparation of GST fusion proteins, full-length and truncated PACAPs were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX4-T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in-frame with the amino- or carboxyl-terminal GST tag. After expression in E. coli DH5α or BL21 (Life Technologies, Inc.), bacterial cells from 400-ml overnight cultures grown at 37 °C were resuspended in an equal volume of fresh LB medium. After 30 min of additional growth at 30 °C, a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for 90 min. The induced bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated. The bacterial cells were further incubated with Triton X-100 (1%) and lysozyme at 0.2 mg/ml at room temperature for 1 h. The GST fusion products were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled DN casp-2 (1 × 106 cpm) was incubated with recombinant PACAP-bearing glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to PACAP recombinant protein in a volume of 200 µl in the presence of EGTA (1 mm), Nonidet P-40 (0.2%), leupeptin (1 µl/ml), aprotinin (1 µl/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm). After overnight incubation at 4 °C with constant rotation, the beads were washed extensively, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and run on 4–12% gradient SDS gels followed by autoradiography. The human Rapid-Scan-Gene expression panel (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD), a semiquantitative PCR method, was used to evaluate the expression of PACAP in different human tissues. The high quality first strand cDNAs from 23 tissues provided in the kit were normalized using β-actin as the internal control according to the manufacturer's protocol and evaluated undiluted and at a 100-fold dilution. The PCR settings were established according to the T m of the primers and the hot start Taq polymerase optimal temperature requirements. The upstream and downstream primers were 5′-CGAGGATCCATGAGGCTGTCACTGCCACTG-3′ and 5′-CGGGAATTCGCCACGAAGGCCTTTTTTTTT-3′, respectively. The following PCR settings were used: 5 min at 72 °C, 15 min at 95 °C; and then 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; ending with 1 min at 72 °C. The products were analyzed on 12% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. NH2-terminal GST-tagged PACAP expression constructs were generated in a pGEX4-T usingBamHI/EcoRI restriction sites. PACAP mutants generated were 1–123 (full-length), Δ23–123 (mature peptide), Δ32–123, Δ36–123, and Δ72–123. Jurkat T cell lysates (1 × 106 cells) were generated with 1× lysis buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1.9 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h on ice. GST-control and GST-recombinant PACAP and mutant PACAP fusion proteins (10 µl) were incubated with the cell lysates for 3 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. Samples were pelleted and washed with saline, and proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and detected by the Western blotting procedure. Human 293T cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with PACAP using the calcium phosphate and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) methods, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For these studies, PACAP was subcloned into engineered EcoRI and XbaI sites in the pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His EpiTag vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the carboxyl-terminal tags of this vector. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside staining was employed to monitor transfection efficiency in controls. Apoptosis was assessed by nuclear morphology 24 h after transfection by optic and fluorescent microscope (29Bonfoco E. Leist M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human 293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 Myc-His EpiTag-PACAP, pBactH37Z-casp-2, and pcDNA3.1-casp-9 using the calcium phosphate method. Eighteen hours posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysed in the buffer used in the pull-down experiments, and the lysates were precleared with protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred into clean tubes and incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were then incubated with protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analyses followed by immunoblotting with anti-casp-2 and -9 antibodies. Controls included cells transfected with PACAP alone and casp-2 and -9 alone, as well as a sample of the lysates of the triply transfected cells, prior to immunoprecipitation. Full-length PACAP was cloned into a carboxyl-terminal GFP-expressing amphotropic Epstein-Barr virus/retroviral vector termed PINCO, obtained from Dr. P.G. Pelicci, Milan, Italy (30Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). Phoenix packaging cells, obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with control PINCO and with the PINCO/PACAP vector. Recombinant retroviral particles were collected from the supernatant 2 days later and used to infect ST486 and B104 Epstein-Barr virus-negative human B cell lines. Three days later, GFP-positive B cells were sorted on a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the positive cells (<1% GFP-positive) were cultured in fresh medium. Immunohistochemical studies were performed as earlier described (29Bonfoco E. Leist M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslip cultures of 293T and Rat-1 cells were fixed with methanol:acetone (80:20) for 5 min and then incubated overnight with monoclonal IgG1 anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG followed by FITC anti-mouse antibody or horseradish peroxidase-labeled biotin and substrate. TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a nuclear counterstain with FITC and hematoxylin with horseradish peroxidase. The percentage of FITC-positive cells was assessed by a laser scanning cytometer (Compucyte, Cambridge, MA). Cells or proteins were lysed with 2× SDS buffer and boiled, and cytosolic extracts were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions. After electrotransfer to Immobilon membranes and blocking (5% milk), the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-Myc (Invitrogen) or mouse anti-casp-2, -3, -9, or -8 (Pharmingen) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody to mouse immunoglobulin followed by substrate. Positively selected, CD19+ MACS-purified human B cells (AllCells, San Jose, CA) were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in Yssel's medium without antibody (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Aliquots of the B cell suspension were distributed into flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (100 µl/well). Activation was initiated by the addition of either 5 µg/ml CD40 ligand-κ fusion protein (obtained from Dr. V. Brinkmann, Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) together with 10 ng/ml IL-4 (Sigma), or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA) in Yssel's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Successful activation was monitored by assessing CD20, CD25, and CD69 expression on days 0, 1, 2, and 5 in a flow cytometer. B cell proliferation was assessed by the addition of 2 × 104Nite Red microsphere particles (Spherotech, Libertyville, IL) to each well just before staining. Time course studies were carried out by pooling the cells from several wells at 0 min, 30 min, 2 h, 6 h, 1 day, 2 days, and 5 days. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and PACAP mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR carried out on 1 µg of RNA per sample using 5′-CGAGGATCCATGAGGCTGTCACTGCCACTG-3′ and 5′-CGGGAATCCGCCACGAAGGCCTTTTTTTTT-3′ as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. These primers amplify an 800-bp sequence. Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was monitored for equal loading and amplification efficiency using 5′-CTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively; these primers amplify a 600-bp sequence. Screening of a human B cell cDNA library (3 × 106 transformants) by the yeast two hybrid system with human DN casp-2 (C303A) as bait yielded 20 yeast colonies, which activated both reporter genes (LEU2and lacZ). We used DN casp-2 as bait, because the wild type casp-2 reduced the normal growth rate of the yeast cells. After transformation into E. coli, selection, isolation, and restriction mapping, the sequence of the insert was determined. Only one of these colonies, coding for a novel gene we named PACAP (Fig. 1), was confirmed to bind DN casp-2 by activation of both reporter genes when the yeast 2-hybrid binding assay was repeated with the plasmid from the initial screens and DN casp-2 (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2PACAP-casp-2 binding assays.

Controls include SDS eluates of glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST alone that had been incubated with 35S-labeled DN casp-2 (lane 1) and 35S-labeled DN casp-2 alone (lane 3). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cDNA sequence of the insert contains an initiator methionine, a stop codon, a polyadenylation signal, and a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). The insert contains 905 bp from the initiator codon to the end of the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). The initiator codon, which conforms to Kozak's rules for initiation (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), was confirmed by the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends studies, which also yielded 300–400 additional bp of 5′ sequence. The stop codon is located 371 bp downstream of the initiator methionine (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 123 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 13.6 kDa. A TGA stop codon is located 225 bp upstream of the initiator methionine. The GenBankTM accession number for the cDNA is AF338109. Residues 1–22 of the deduced amino acid sequence conform to the consensus sequence of a cleavage site of a signal peptide for a secreted protein (32Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar, 33McGeoch D.J. Virus Res. 1985; 3: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The inability to detect amino-terminal Myc-tagged PACAP (1) coupled in the ease of detecting carboxyl-terminal Myc-tagged PACAP (1) in transfection studies in mammalian systems, as described below, suggests that residues 1–22 represent a signal peptide, which is absent from the mature protein.

https://openalex.org/W2062142617,"Abstract Processing of the p105 precursor to generate the p50 subunit of the nuclear factor κB transcription factor is an exceptional case in which the ubiquitin system is involved in limited processing rather than in complete destruction of the target substrate. A Gly-rich region “stop” signal in the middle of the molecule along with a neighboring downstream ubiquitination, and probably an E3 anchoring domain, have been demonstrated to be important for processing. In addition, we have shown that IκB kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to recruitment of the SCFβ -TrCP ubiquitin ligase with subsequent accelerated ubiquitination and processing/degradation of the precursor (Orian, A., Gonen, H., Bercovich, B., Fajerman, I., Eytan, E., Israel, A., Mercurio, F., Iwai, K., Schwartz, A. L., and Ciechanover, A. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 2580–2591). Here we show that processing of p105 molecules that contain more then four ankyrin repeats, but lack the C-terminal phosphorylation/ubiquitin ligase binding domain, is strongly inhibited by docked p50 subunits. Inhibition is caused by interference with the function of the proteasome, as conjugation is not affected. Inhibition is alleviated after IκB kinase phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to accelerated, β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and processing/degradation of p105. We suggest that under basal conditions, slow generation of p50 probably involves the mid-molecule ubiquitination/E3 recognition motif. Following stimulation, the C-terminal domain is involved in rapid processing/degradation of p105 with release of a large amount of the stored subunits that now become transcriptionally active."
https://openalex.org/W2012712064,"γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors were immunopurified from bovine brain using a monoclonal antibody directed against the α1 subunit. Of the several proteins that copurified, a 34-kDa protein was analyzed further. After enrichment and tryptic proteolysis, the resulting fragments were sequenced, and the protein was identified as gC1q-R. Using anti-gC1q-R and anti-GABAA receptor antibodies, mutual coimmunoprecipitation could be demonstrated from solubilized rat brain membranes. The stability of this interaction was estimated to be very high. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, various GABAAreceptor subunit intracellular loop constructs were tested for an interaction with gC1q-R. All β subunits, but not α1 and γ2 subunits, were found to bind to gC1q-R. NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated β2 subunit loops were used to find the region responsible for the interaction with gC1q-R. A stretch of 15 amino acids containing 7 positively charged residues was identified (amino acids 399–413). This region contains residue Ser-410, which is a protein kinase substrate, and it is known that phosphorylation of this residue leads to an alteration in receptor activity. Localization studies suggested a predominantly intracellular localization. Our observations therefore suggest a tight interaction between gC1q-R and the GABAA receptor which might be involved in receptor biosynthesis or modulation of the mature function. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors were immunopurified from bovine brain using a monoclonal antibody directed against the α1 subunit.

GABAA receptors are drug targets for a range of clinically important substances, among them the benzodiazepines and barbiturates (9Sieghart W. Pharmacol.

As other ion channels promoting fast synaptic transmission, GABAA receptors are clustered at postsynaptic membranes (11Craig A.M. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Banker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12373-12377Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Nusser Z. Roberts J.D.B. Baude A. Richards J.G. Somogyi P. J.

Neurosci. 1995; 7: 630-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is presumed that clustering at synapses is achieved by anchoring the receptors to the cytoskeleton. Tubulin and actin as well as a number of additional proteins were found to coimmunoprecipitate with the GABAA receptor from bovine brain (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, the GABAA receptor-interacting protein (GABARAP) has been described. Apart from binding to the γ2 subunit of GABAAreceptors, this protein also interacts with tubulin and gephyrin (15Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and promotes receptor clustering in QT-6 cells (16Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, immunofluorescence experiments in retinas showed no colocalization between GABARAP and the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit at synapses. In cultured cortical neurons GABARAP was found to be localized to intracellular compartments, implicating a function in receptor sorting and targeting processes that precede and/or initiate receptor clustering (15Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors can be functionally modulated by phosphorylation of specific residues on the intracellular loops of β and γ subunits by serine/threonine kinases such as PKC, PKA, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as well as the tyrosine kinase Src (17Kellenberger S.

PKCβII as well as the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK-1) were shown to coimmunoprecipitate with β subunits from rat brain (25Brandon N.J. Uren J.M. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also a yet unidentified serine/threonine kinase with a presumable molecular mass of 34 kDa was coimmunoprecipitated with α1 containing GABAA receptors from bovine brain (26Kannenberg K. Sieghart W. Reuter H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study we attempted to identify and clone this protein. A protein of the same molecular mass was biochemically purified, digested with trypsin, and the resulting fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation. Our results identify this protein as the multifunctional protein gC1q-R (27Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We show that gC1q-R interacts with the GABAA receptor with very high affinity. The interaction site on the GABAA receptor was located to a basic region within the intracellular loop of β subunits which also contains functionally relevant phosphorylation sites. GABAA receptors were immunoprecipitated from Zwittergent 3-14-solubilized calf brain membranes as described previously (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For precipitation, the monoclonal antibody bd24 (28Häring P. Stähli C. Schoch P. Takacs B. Staehelin T. Möhler H. Proc.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (bd24 beads) was used. This method coimmunoprecipitates a 34-kDa protein with the GABAA receptor. 6 g of bovine brain membrane protein was used for the immunoprecipitation, which yielded about 3 µg of the 34-kDa protein. The 34-kDa protein was separated from the GABAA receptor-bd24 beads complex by extraction with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After chloroform-methanol precipitation (30Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 141-143Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar) of the high salt extracted 34-kDa protein, the pellet was resuspended in 10 µl of 8 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 2 µl of 100 mm iodoacetamide was added. The solution was incubated for 15 min followed by the addition of 87 µl of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 µl trypsin (1 µg/µl). The protein was trypsin treated for 12 h at 37 °C. Peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 column (Vydac, 1-mm inner diameter × 250 mm) using the linear gradient between solvent A (0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (0.09% v/v trifluoroacetic acid, 80% v/v acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 µl/min. The following gradient was used: 5% solvent B for 5 min, 5–60% solvent B for 60 min. Peptide masses were determined on-line by mass spectrometry (Sciex, API III+), using ∼10% percent of the effluent. The remaining 90% of the effluent was collected manually for sequence determination. Peptide sequences were determined by Edman degradation, using a model G1005A protein sequencer (Agilent Technologies). Recombinant rat gC1q-R (mature form, starting at amino acid residue 72) was expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coliusing plasmid pQE-31 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Two yeast expression libraries from rat hippocampus/cortex (oligo(dT) and randomly primed, kindly provided by Dr. P. R. Worley (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore)) were used as a template for polymerase chain reaction using primer Ma32f (5′-CGGGATCCTCTGCACACGGAAGGAGACAAGG-3′) designed to allow in-frame cloning into pQE-31 and primer Ma32r (5′-GAGAGCTGGCCGTTTATATTAGAG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and subcloned into pQE-31 cut withBamHI and SmaI. Expression was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen). Full-length and mature gC1q-R (starting at residue 72) were also cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV (31Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.-W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for expression of gC1q-R in HEK 293 cells. Three Burgunder rabbits were injected with 1 mg of recombinant gC1q-R dissolved in 1 ml TiterMaxTM (CytRx, Norcross, GA). Two subsequent immunizations were made at intervals of 2 weeks before the rabbits were bled. Blood was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to let it clot and incubated at 4 °C overnight to let it contract. Serum was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. Demyelinated rat brain membranes were prepared from fresh tissue essentially after the procedure of Bennettet al. (32Bennett V. Baines A.J. Davis J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, and 1% (w/w) Triton X-100 (Pierce). The protease inhibitors pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin were used at concentrations of 5 µg/µl, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was included. The protein concentration of the solubilisate was 5 mg/ml. gC1q-R and GABAA receptors were immunoprecipitated by adding 5 µl of anti-gC1q-R serum or 12 µl of anti-β3 (1–13), an antiserum that recognizes β2 and β3 subunits (33Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to 2 ml solubilisate. Incubation was carried out at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies were recaptured with 5 µl of protein A beads and washed five times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer containing 1% (w/w) β-octyl glucoside instead of Triton X-100. Washed protein A beads containing bound anti-gC1q-R antibody, gC1q-R, and the GABAA receptor were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm K-EDTA (pH 7.4). Resuspended beads (0.5 ml) were incubated for 90 min on ice in the presence of 3 nm [3H]Ro 15-1788 (87 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 25 µm unlabeled Ro 15-1788. Beads were collected through rapid filtration on GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. After three washing steps with 4 ml of buffer each, the filter-retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The specific binding at 3 nm is close to the maximal binding and therefore allowed an estimation of the absolute amount of GABAA receptor. After immunoprecipitation and washing of the beads (5 µl), gC1q-R was extracted with 20 µl of washing buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl as described before (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gel, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and immunodecorated as described previously (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Anti-gC1q-R serum was used at 1:1,000. After incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000, DAKO), positive bands were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coimmunoprecipitation efficiency was determined by comparing the intensity of the gC1q-R band from the immunoprecipitate with standard amounts of rat brain membranes. gC1q-R was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain extract with anti-gC1q-R antibody. After centrifugation and washing of protein A beads, one aliquot of protein A beads was used in a radioligand binding assay to determine the amount of bound GABAA receptor directly after the immunoprecipitation. Two other aliquots of protein A beads were first transferred to tubes containing 50 ml of solubilization buffer containing 1% (w/w) β-octyl glucoside instead of Triton X-100 to allow associated GABAA receptor to dissociate. The tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min and 360 min, respectively, with constant agitation. Thereafter the protein A beads were washed, and the residual amount of GABAA receptor bound to the gC1q-R complex was determined by radioligand binding assay. The experiment was carried out twice as indicated above and twice using the same dissociation buffer supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol to prevent an S-S double bond formation. Dithiothreitol did not influence dissociation behavior. The MatchmakerTMtwo-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used to assay for an interaction between gC1q-R and the GABAA receptor subunit intracellular loops. Mature rat gC1q-R (starting from residue 72) as well as COOH- and NH2-terminally truncated gC1q-R-constructs were cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH). The α1, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 subunit loops as well as NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated β2 loop constructs were cloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH). Expression of the two fusion proteins was done in the yeast strain SFY526. A β-galactosidase filter assay was used to test for interactions between gC1q-R and GABAAreceptor subunit loop constructs. The assay was made twice withn = 5 for each interaction tested. HEK 293 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin through standard cell culture techniques. α1, β2, γ2, or α1, β3, γ2 subunits (34Lolait S.J.

Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (total of 20 µg of DNA/90-mm dish) coding for GABAA receptor subunits and/or gC1q-R were used. Rat hippocampal cell cultures were prepared as described (39Scotti A.L. Chatton J.Y. Reuter H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hippocampal cell cultures used for mitochondrial staining were incubated with 200 nmMito Tracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. For fixation of hippocampal cultures or transfected HEK 293 cells, medium was washed with a saline solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 30 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The saline was then replaced by 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and eventually by fixative solution containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer. Fixation was made overnight at 4 °C. Prior to immunocytochemistry, cells were incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and preincubated with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. The monoclonal antibody bd17 against β2/β3 subunits was used at a dilution of 1:200 and the anti-gC1q-R serum at 1:1000, both in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline. Rhodamine-coupled anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson Immunoresearch) and FITC-linked anti-mouse IgGs were diluted 1:50 in 13 mm phosphate-buffered saline and incubated either alone or simultaneously for 2 h. Coverslips were mounted on slides with 80% (v/v) glycerol and 0.2% paraphenyldiamine in 0.1 m phosphate (pH 8.6). The cells were visualized using a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 510). Rhodamine was excited by an HeNe Laser (543 nm), FITC with an argon laser (488 nm). The cDNAs coding for the α1, β2, and γ2S subunits of the rat GABAAreceptor channel have been described elsewhere (34Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.-M. Kusano K. Muller J.-M. Brownstein M.J. Mahan L.C.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell transfection, the cDNAs were subcloned into the polylinker of pBC/CMV. This expression vector allows high level expression of a foreign gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and a SP6 promoter for in vitro transcription. The α subunit was cloned into the EcoRI, and the β and γ subunits were subcloned into the SmaI site of the polylinker by standard techniques. Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, defolliculated, and currents recorded as described (40Sigel E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 386: 73-90Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA dissolved in 5 mm K-HEPES (pH 6.8). This solution contained the transcripts coding for the different subunits at a concentration of 10 nm for α1, 10 nm for β2, 50 nm for γ2 together or without 150 nm of either full-length or mature gC1q-R. RNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized plasmids encoding the desired protein using the message machine kit (Ambion) according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. A poly(A) tail of about 300 residues was added to the transcripts using yeast poly(A) polymerase (United States Biochemical or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cRNA combinations were coprecipitated in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Transcripts were quantified on agarose gels after staining with Radiant Red RNA stain (Bio-Rad) by comparing staining intensities with various amounts of molecular mass markers (RNA-Ladder, Life Technologies, Inc.). Electrophysiological experiments were performed by the two-electrode voltage clamp method at a holding potential of −80 mV. The medium contained 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). GABA was applied for 20 s, and a washout period of 4 min was allowed to ensure full recovery from desensitization. Concentration-response curves for GABA were fitted with the equation IC=I max/[1 + (EC50/c)n], where c is the concentration of GABA, EC50 is the concentration of GABA eliciting half-maximal current amplitude,I max is the maximal current amplitude,I is the current amplitude, and n is the Hill coefficient. The strategy used for the identification of gC1q-R and characterization of its association with the GABAA receptor is shown in Fig.1. Calf brain membranes were solubilized with Zwittergent 3-14 and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody bd24 covalently bound to Sepharose beads. This procedure immunoprecipitates the GABAA receptor and leads to the copurification of several additional proteins, five of which show prominent bands on a silver-stained gel (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Incubation of the bd24 precipitate with 0.6 m NaCl extracted a 34-kDa protein (14Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). About 3 µg of the 34-kDa protein was extracted from bd24 immunoprecipitates and concentrated by methanol-chloroform precipitation (30Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 141-143Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Peptides resulting from a tryptic digest of the 34-kDa protein were separated and subjected to Edman sequencing. Thereby the partial sequence EVSFQATGESD was obtained which matched the human gC1q-R, a protein of molecular mass 33 kDa (Swiss ProteinQ07021). Nine out of 11 residues were identical to the human protein. Of the other 2 residues the alanine residue is also found in the mouse protein, and the aspartic acid residue is conservatively substituted in the human protein by a glutamic acid residue. An additional partial sequence (A/P)(Q/E)(D/E)QNPVLTSXPNF also showed high homology to the human gC1q-R and therefore confirmed the identity of the 34-kDa protein with gC1q-R. Further evidence came from a Western blot in which a monoclonal antibody against the human gC1q-R (a generous gift from Dr. B. Ghebrehiwet, SUNY at Stony Brook) gave a weak signal for the bovine 34-kDa protein (not shown). Three independent clones of the gene for gC1q-R were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from two different rat brain cDNA libraries. All three clones had the same DNA sequence, which differed in several positions from the published sequence of the original clone (41Lynch N.J. Reid K.B. van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B. Schwaeble W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 110-114Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the amino acid level, 6 amino acid residues were different, and in addition, one amino acid residue was introduced. Interestingly, all 7 of these amino acid residues are present at the same homologous locations in the mouse gC1q-R gene. Furthermore an expressed sequence tag (GenBank BE128085) from a rat cDNA library was found that contained five of the same mismatching codons as our cloned sequence. The other two differing codons are at a location not encoded by the expressed sequence tag. Differences in our clones compared with the data base entry of the original clone are thus suggestive of a polymorphism in the gC1q-R gene. The open reading frame of the gC1q-R encodes an immature protein of 279 amino acid residues of which the first 71 amino acids are cleaved off during maturation. It is believed that this sequence is involved in cellular translocation and contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (41Lynch N.J. Reid K.B. van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A. Ghebrehiwet B.

The DNA coding for the mature form of the protein was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-31 allowing overexpression of His-tagged gC1q-R. The mature and the immature form of gC1q-R were also subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV allowing transfection of HEK 293 cells. Overexpressed mature gC1q-R was used for the production of a rabbit polyclonal antibody. Initially gC1q-R had been coimmunoprecipitated with the GABAA receptor from bovine brain membranes. After the production of an antibody against the rat gC1q-R we tried to purify gC1q-R from rat brain by coimmunoprecipitation with the GABAA receptor, using a different immunoprecipitation technique. The GABAA receptor was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain membranes with an antibody against the β2/β3 subunits. As negative controls the same procedure was done in parallel without membranes or alternatively without antibody. After the addition of protein A beads, the immunoprecipitates were extracted with buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl. This separates the gC1q-R protein from the insoluble GABAA receptor complex. This procedure was chosen because of the high background signal that arose from the presence of protein A beads. High salt extracts of the immunoprecipitation, the negative controls, and a standard amount of rat brain membranes (8 µg of protein) were loaded on a gel for Western blotting with anti-gC1q-R antibody (Fig.2). The signal resulting from the coimmunoprecipitated gC1q-R (Fig. 2, lane 2) was about as strong as the signal resulting from 8 µg of membrane protein (Fig. 2,lane 1). The negative controls gave no signal (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). The experiment was carried out twice with similar results. Rabbit polyclonal anti-gC1q-R antibody was used to immunoprecipitate gC1q-R from Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain homogenate (Fig. 3 A). Coimmunoprecipitated GABAA receptor was detected by benzodiazepine binding using [3H]Ro 15-1788 (Fig.3 B). This method was chosen because the heavy chain of the precipitating antibody comigrates with the GABAA receptor on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As negative controls the immunoprecipitation was made either without protein or without anti-gC1q-R antibody (Fig. 3 B). A second analogous experiment gave comparable results. During immunoisolation experiments from bovine brain it became evident that the affinity between gC1q-R and the GABAA receptor must be very high. Washing the protein A beads usually took between 15 and 20 min. It was estimated that during this time most of the GABAA receptor would have dissociated from gC1q-R if the K d characterizing this interaction would have been higher than about 1 nm.

https://openalex.org/W2022633952,"The sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter type 2 (ASCT2) was recently identified as a cell surface receptor for endogenously inherited retroviruses of cats, baboons, and humans as well as for horizontally transmitted type-D simian retroviruses. By functional cloning, we obtained 10 full-length 2.9-kilobase pair (kbp) cDNAs and two smaller identical 2.1-kbp cDNAs that conferred susceptibility to these viruses. Compared with the 2.9-kbp cDNA, the 2.1-kbp cDNA contains exonic deletions in its 3′ noncoding region and a 627-bp 5′ truncation that eliminates sequences encoding the amino-terminal portion of the full-length ASCT2 protein. Although expression of the truncated mRNA caused enhanced amino acid transport and viral receptor activities, the AUG codon nearest to its 5′ end is flanked by nucleotides that are incompatible with translational initiation and the next in-frame AUG codon is far downstream toward the end of the protein coding sequence. Interestingly, the 5′ region of the truncated ASCT2 mRNA contains a closely linked series of CUG(Leu) and GUG(Val) codons in optimal consensus contexts for translational initiation. By deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, cell-free translation, and analyses of epitope-tagged ASCT2 proteins synthesized intracellularly, we determined that the truncated mRNA encodes multiple ASCT2 isoforms with distinct amino termini that are translationally initiated by a leaky scanning mechanism at these CUG and GUG codons. Although the full-length ASCT2 mRNA contains a 5′-situated AUG initiation codon, a significant degree of leaky scanning also occurred in its translation. ASCT2 isoforms with relatively short truncations were active in both amino acid transport and viral reception, whereas an isoform with a 79-amino acid truncation that lacked the first transmembrane sequence was active only in viral reception. We conclude that ASCT2 isoforms with truncated amino termini are synthesized in mammalian cells by a leaky scanning mechanism that employs multiple alternative CUG and GUG initiation codons."
https://openalex.org/W1975573126,"Nerve-induced muscle activity suppresses nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene expression by increasing intracellular calcium levels. This suppression is mediated by nAChR promoter sequences harboring at least 1 E-box (CANNTG) that bind myogenic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. How muscle depolarization or increased calcium mediates changes in nAChR promoter activity is not well understood. In chick muscle, protein kinase C (PKC) activation is necessary for activity-dependent nAChR gene suppression. Similar effects of PKC activation have not been found in mammalian skeletal muscle. Therefore, we used rat primary muscle cultures to screen for other calcium-regulated enzymatic activities that may mediate the effects of muscle activity and calcium on nAChR promoter activity. We report here that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) can specifically suppress nAChR promoter activity in mammalian muscle. This regulation was mediated by a single E-box sequence residing in the previously characterized nAChR δ-subunit genes 47-base pair activity-dependent enhancer. In vitro protein/DNA interaction studies suggest that CaM kinase II inhibits binding of the myogenic factor, myogenin, to the δ-promoter 47-base pair activity-dependent enhancer. CaM kinase activity is increased in active muscle and inhibition of this enzymatic activity results in increased nAChR δ-promoter activity.

During development of the neuromuscular junction the level, distribution, and properties of the nAChR change (1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Prior to muscle innervation or following muscle denervation, nAChRs are expressed at high levels throughout the muscles membrane and have a stoichiometry α2βγδ. After innervation these γ-containing receptors disappear and nAChRs with a stoichiometry α2βεδ are found localized to the neuromuscular junction. The γ- to ε-subunit switch during development results in expression of receptors with a shorter channel open time and higher conductance in adult, compared with embryonic, skeletal muscle (2Mishina M. Takai T. Imoto K. Noda M. Takahashi T. Numa S. Methfessel C. Sakmann B. Nature. 1986; 321: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The nerve plays an important role in the above patterns of nAChR expression. Nerve-derived neuregulins mediate selective expression of nAChR subunit encoding genes in end plate-associated nuclei, while nerve-induced muscle activity mediates suppression of nAChR gene expression in extrajunctional regions of the muscle fiber. Nerve-derived neuregulins mediate their effects via a Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction cascade that activates Ets family transcription factors and bind cis-acting regulatory sequences in the nAChR subunit gene promoters (3Goldman D.

Interestingly, there is little evidence for a PKC-dependent suppression of nAChR gene expression in mammalian muscle (10Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol.

These elements contain one or more E-boxes (CANNTG), that bind myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (12Tang J. Jo S.A. Burden S.J.

Myogenin has emerged as the preferred helix-loop-helix myogenic factor mediating activity-dependent expression of nAChR subunit gene expression because: 1) its expression pattern is very similar to that of nAChR subunit genes (18Duclert A.

Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that muscle activity suppresses nAChR subunit gene expression by a calcium-dependent activation of PKC that results in phosphorylation of myogenin, abrogating its ability to bind DNA (26Mendelzon D. Changeux J.P. Nghiem H.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the above mechanism of regulation is an attractive one, it is disconcerting that evidence for PKC-dependent regulation of nAChR gene expression in mammalian skeletal muscle is lacking (10Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that increasing intracellular calcium dramatically suppressed nAChR subunit gene expression in rat skeletal muscle (7Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still not known. In addition to being required for PKC activation, calcium also participates in activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinase) via its interaction with calmodulin. The CaM kinase family consists of CaM kinase I, II, and IV. CaM kinase II is encoded by four distinct genes, α, β, γ, and δ (27Heist E.K. Schulman H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The kinase forms multimers of 8–12 subunits. CaM kinase II only requires calcium and calmodulin for activation. In contrast, CaM kinase I and IV are monomers and require phosphorylation by a CaM kinase kinase prior to activation by calcium and calmodulin (28Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). CaM kinases are multifunctional proteins, affecting numerous processes including gene expression, cell cycle progression, and synaptic plasticity (29Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). CaM kinases have been found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions (27Heist E.K. Schulman H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This latter location suggests that CaM kinases may directly regulate transcription factor activity. Indeed, CaM kinase IV mediates calcium-dependent activation of CREB via phosphorylation of Ser133, while CaM kinase II inhibits CREB activity by phosphorylation of Ser142 (30Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle CaM kinase I and IV have been implicated in mediating calcium-dependent activation of MEF2 (31Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 32McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Skeletal muscle cells express CaM kinase II genes encoding β-, γ-, and δ-subunits along with a truncated α-subunit (33Tobimatsu T. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16082-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bennett M.K. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Harbers K. Schulman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although CaM kinase II can phosphorylate a number of substrates, a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression has not previously been reported. Here we report that CaM kinase II can repress nAChR promoter activity in muscle cells. This effect is specific to CaM kinase II, since a constitutively active version of CaM kinase IV had no effect. The cis-acting elements mediating the effect of CaM kinase II on nAChR δ-subunit promoter activity map to a previously identified 47-bp activity-dependent enhancer (15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An E-box sequence within this enhancer is necessary for CaM kinase II-dependent suppression. In vitro DNA binding assays showed that CaM kinase II activity impaired binding of a myogenin-containing protein complex to the nAChR δ-subunit promoter 47-bp activity-dependent enhancer, suggesting a mechanism for gene inactivation. These results identify CaM kinase II as a potent regulator of nAChR δ-subunit gene transcription and may provide a previously unappreciated mechanism for regulating these genes by calcium and muscle depolarization. Rat primary skeletal muscle cultures were prepared as previously described (37Goldman D. Carlson B.M. Staple J. Neuron. 1991; 1 7: 649-658Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Chahine K.G. Walke W. Goldman D. Development. 1992; 115: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C under 8% CO2. At 80% confluence, DNA transfection was performed. The C2C12 cell line was cultured in DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum. At 90% confluence, the above medium was replaced with differentiation medium (DMEM, 2% horse serum) to induce cell differentiation. Six days later, myotubes were harvested for preparing nuclear extracts. δ-550Luc contains a 550-bp promoter fragment of the nAChR δ-subunit gene driving luciferase expression (38Chahine K.G. Walke W. Goldman D.

Rat CaM kinase II γ-subunit cDNA was amplified from adult rat muscle by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with the upstream primer 1, CCGGAATTCCCCCGCCAGTATGGCCACCACC, and the downstream primer 2, TGCTCTAGAGCCTGAGCTCACTGCAGCGGTGCA. The cDNA was then cloned into the pCS2MT vector between the EcoRI andXbaI sites. A constitutively active version of CaM kinase II γ-subunit was generated by restricting the full-length cDNA in pCS2MT with NcoI. This results in a 3′ truncated product at codon 275 which removes the CaM kinase autoinhibitory and association domains. This constitutively active CaM kinase II γ-subunit encoding cDNA was subcloned into the NcoI site of pCS2MT. A kinase-dead version of CaM kinase II γ-subunit was generated by mutating Lys43 to Ala (K43A) using mutant primers GAGTATGCAGCAGCAATCATCAAT and ATTGATGATTGCTGCTGCATACTC and the upstream and downstream primers 1 and 2 described above. Polymerase chain reaction products representing partial, but overlapping DNA sequence were annealed and the full-length K43A γ-subunit DNA was amplified using primers 1 and 2 described above. This mutant cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI digested pCS2MT and subsequently digested with NcoI to release a fragment identical to the constitutively active γ-subunit but harboring the K43A mutation. This K43A CaM kinase II γ-subunit fragment was subcloned into the NcoI site of pCS2MT. The full-length rat myogenin cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then subcloned into pCS2MT vector between StuI and XbaI. pCS2E12 plasmid harbors the rat E12 cDNA under control of the simian CMV promoter. Both the pCMVCAT used for normalization, and the RSVLuc have been previously described (15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primary muscle cells in 35-mm dishes at 80% confluence were transfected with a 1.5 µg of DNA mixture (generally, 0.3 µg of reporter DNA, 0.2 µg of effector DNA, 0.5 µg of normalizing DNA, and 0.5 µg of BSSK DNA) using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's directions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to differentiating medium (5% horse serum, 10 µm tetrodotoxin, and 2.8 µg/ml Ara-C). Three days later cells were harvested for luciferase and CAT assays as previously described (39Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 40Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum and differentiated in DMEM containing 2% horse serum. Myotubes were harvested 6–9 days after differentiation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) as modified by Amayr and Workman (42Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

In vitrotranscription/translation was performed according to the manufacturer's directions using a TNT SP6 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). For each reaction, 40 µl of TNT Quick Master Mix, 1 µl of 1 mm methionine, and 2 µg of plasmid template were mixed together and the final volume adjusted to 50 µl with nuclease-free water. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 100 min. Nuclear extracts (5–10 µg) or in vitro translated products were preincubated in 20 µl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1.5 µg of poly(dI-dC)) either with or without anti-myogenin antibody (43Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, F5D antibody developed by Dr. Wright was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa) for 30 min at room temperature. In vitrotranscription/translation constitutively active CaM kinase II γ-subunit was then added to the mixture along with 2 mmATP, 0.3 mm PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, and 3 µm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, PKI. These reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min then stopped on ice. Mixes were then incubated with32P-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the 47-bp activity-dependent enhancer from the nAChR δ-promoter (15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on high ionic strength 5% polyacrylamide gels as described by Chodosh (44Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar). Primary rat myotubes were grown in differentiation medium. To examine the effects of muscle activity on CaM kinase activity, cells were washed with DMEM 3 times and incubated in differentiation medium ± tetrodotoxin. Cells were either stimulated to contract using extracellular electrodes as previously described (15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or allowed to contract spontaneously. CaM kinase II activity was measured using a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were lysed, pelleted, and supernatants were supplemented with either EGTA or EGTA and specific CaM kinase II substrate, or calcium/calmodulin and the specific substrate. These mixtures were incubated with reaction buffer containing 100 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 4 min, and then stopped by adding 15% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged and the supernatant was spotted onto a phosphocellulose disc. Discs were washed with 1% H3PO4 buffer for 3 min, twice, and counted in a scintillation counter. The autonomous activity of CaM kinase II, i.e. calcium/calmodulin-independent activity, was calculated as percentage of the maximum CaM kinase activity. The assay has been repeated 3 times in individual experiments. Studentt test was used to evaluate the significance of the results. CaM kinase is composed of 3 domains: a N-terminal protein kinase domain, an inhibitory domain, and a C-terminal association domain (Fig.1 A). Removal of the inhibitory and association domains has been shown to result in a constitutive form of CaM kinase, whose activity is independent of calcium and calmodulin (45Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 46Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active versions of CaM kinase were used in the following experiments to alleviate the need for upstream activating signals (see “Materials and Methods”). A constitutively active version of CaM kinase II α-subunit (CaM kinase IIα) was previously shown to regulate the activity of transcription factors ATF-1 (47Shimomura A. Ogawa Y. Kitani T. Fujisawa H.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 48Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, this activity also induces expression from prolactin and Rous sarcoma virus promoters (45Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore we first examined if an active CaM kinase IIα can regulate nAChR δ-promoter activity (Fig.1 B). Primary muscle cells were transfected with our δ-550Luc reporter plasmid, ± active CaM kinase IIα. These experiments indicated a robust reduction in δ-promoter activity when an active CaM kinase IIα was co-expressed (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, a constitutively active version of CaM kinase IV had no effect on the δ-promoter (Fig. 1 B). Although skeletal muscle expresses the β-, γ-, and δ-subunits of CaM kinase II, a catalytically active α-subunit is not expressed in this tissue (36Bayer K.U. Harbers K. Schulman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To confirm that a skeletal muscle CaM kinase II can regulate nAChR δ-promoter activity, we examined the effect CaM kinase II γ-subunit (CaM kinase IIγ) activity had on nAChR δ-promoter-mediated gene expression. For these experiments we cloned CaM kinase IIγ from rat skeletal muscle and created a constitutively active version similar to that of the α-subunit (30Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar,45Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transfection assays showed a dose-dependent decline in δ-promoter activity as increasing concentrations of active CaM kinase IIγ were introduced into primary muscle cells (Fig.1 C). δ-Promoter suppression ranged from 5% at 0.05 µg to 86% at 0.7 µg of CaM kinase IIγ DNA. To confirm that the above effect of CaM kinase II on nAChR δ-promoter activity was the result of CaM kinase II enzymatic activity, we created a kinase-dead version of this enzyme. A mutation in the CaM kinase IIγ ATP-binding site, that changed Lys43 to Ala (K43A) was generated. This mutation prevents ATP binding to CaM kinase and therefore renders it inactive (49Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Takeuchi Y. Yamamooto H. Miyakawa T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transfection of primary muscle cells with wild-type and K43A CaM kinase IIγ showed that CaM kinase enzymatic activity is necessary for δ-promoter suppression (Fig.2 A). CaM kinase II-dependent suppression of δ-promoter activity may represent a general effect on the basal transcriptional apparatus. In this case we would expect many promoters to respond in a similar fashion. Therefore, we examined the effect active CaM kinase IIγ had on RSV promoter activity in transfected primary muscle cells. Unlike the pronounced suppression of nAChR δ-subunit promoter activity (Fig. 2 A), co-transfected active CaM kinase IIγ slightly activated the RSV promoter (Fig.2 B). In addition, the CMV promoter we used for normalization of transfection data was not influenced by active CaM kinase II (data not shown). Therefore, CaM kinase IIγ activity specifically suppresses expression from the nAChR δ-promoter. Myogenin is known to trans-activate nAChR subunit promoter activity (17Berberich C. Durr I. Koenen M. Witzemann V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Durr I. Numberger M. Berberich C. Witzemann V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Gundersen K. Rabben I. Klocke B.J. Merlie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by E-box sequences within the nAChR subunit promoters (17Berberich C. Durr I. Koenen M. Witzemann V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Simon A.M. Burden S, J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myogenin levels are high in cultured myotubes (51Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Therefore, CaM kinase II may mediate δ-promoter suppression by acting on myogenin. One possibility is that active CaM kinase II suppressed myogenin expression resulting in reduced basal levels of δ-promoter activity in primary myotubes. If this were the case one would expect myogenin overexpression by a promoter not regulated by CaM kinase II to compensate for this hypothetical reduction in myogenin protein. Interestingly, CaM kinase II-dependent suppression of δ-promoter activity was not prevented by myogenin overexpression driven by the CMV promoter (Fig.3 A). This result suggests that CaM kinase II may abrogate the ability of myogenin to bind and/or trans-activate the nAChR δ-promoter. Alternatively, other δ-promoter-binding proteins may also participate in CaM kinase II-dependent suppression. To determine if myogenin-dependent trans-activation is affected by CaM kinase II activity, we employed an artificial promoter (4E-TK) harboring 4 E-box sequences upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 4E-TKLuc ± myogenin. We chose these cells so there would be no endogenous myogenin expression. Myogenin overexpression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in about a 90% increase in promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). However, when active CaM kinase IIγ was included in the transfection, myogenin-dependent induction was abrogated (Fig.3 B), suggesting that CaM kinase II activity influences myogenins ability to bind and/or trans-activate this promoter. We have previously shown that muscle activity and increased intracellular calcium mediate their effects on δ-promoter activity via a 47-bp enhancer sequence (7Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence contains a single E-box that is necessary for enhancer activity (15Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examined if this enhancer can mediate the effects of CaM kinase II on nAChR δ-promoter activity. For"

Targeting complement inhibitors to the site of complement activation and disease may enhance their efficacy and safety. Data presented show that targeting of decay-accelerating factor (DAF, an inhibitor of complement activation) to a cell surface by means of antibody fragments is feasible and that cell-targeted DAF provides significantly enhanced protection from complement deposition and lysis compared with soluble untargeted DAF. An extracellular region of DAF was joined to an antibody combining site with specificity for the hapten dansyl, at the end of either CH1 or CH3 Ig regions. The recombinant IgG-DAF chimeric proteins retained antigen specificity and bound to dansylated Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both soluble CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF were effective at inhibiting complement-mediated lysis of untargeted Chinese hamster ovary cells at molar concentrations within the range reported by others for soluble DAF. However, when targeted to a dansyl-labeled cell membrane, CH1-DAF was significantly more potent at inhibiting complement deposition and complement-mediated lysis. Cell-bound CH1-DAF also provided cells with protection from complement lysis after removal of unbound CH1-DAF. Of further importance, the insertion of a nonfunctional protein domain of DAF (the N-terminal short consensus repeat) between CH1 and the functional DAF domain increased activity of the fusion protein. In contrast to CH1-DAF, CH3-DAF was not significantly better at protecting targeted versusuntargeted cells from complement, indicating that a small targeting vehicle is preferable to a large one. We have previously shown that for effective functioning of soluble complement inhibitor CD59, binding of CD59 to the cell surface close to the site of complement activation is required.

The activation phase is an enzymatic amplification cascade in which complement proteins are cleaved, resulting in the generation of cell-bound opsonins (e.g. C3b, iC3b, and C3dg) and bioactive soluble fragments (C3a and C5a). These complement activation fragments are important for host defense and immune complex catabolism. The terminal phase of the complement pathway is initiated following cleavage of C5 and consists of the nonenzymatic assembly of the complement proteins C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC),1 usually on the activating surface. Host cells are normally protected from the proinflammatory and cytolytic effects of complement activation by membrane-bound complement inhibitors that inhibit either the activation phase or the terminal phase and MAC assembly. Membrane inhibitors of complement activation include complement receptor 1, membrane cofactor protein, and decay-accelerating factor (DAF). These proteins regulate complement activation by inhibiting formation of C3 (and C5) convertase, a central enzyme complex involved in the amplification of the complement cascade. Inhibitors of complement activation all have a protein structure that consists of varying numbers of repeating units of about 60–70 amino acids termed short consensus repeats (SCR) (1Hourcade D. Holers V.M. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 45: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Law S.K.A. Reid K.B.M. Male D. In Focus. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 46-51Google Scholar). DAF is composed of four contiguous SCRs at its N terminus that are connected to a serine-threonine-rich region linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The active site of DAF (C3/C4 binding site) is located within SCRs 2–4 (3Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Antsee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J.

Control of the terminal complement pathway and MAC formation occurs principally through the activity of CD59, a membrane protein that binds to C8 and C9 in the assembling MAC (5Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meri S. Morgan B.P. Davies A. Daniels R.H. Olavesen M.G. Waldemann H. Lachmann P.J.

There is interest in developing membrane complement inhibitors as recombinant soluble proteins for therapy of disease states in which complement activation and deposition is involved in pathogenesis. In diseases in which the MAC is involved in pathogenesis, CD59-based inhibitors offer a potential advantage over inhibitors of complement activation because CD59 will only block MAC formation and not the generation of the earlier complement activation products that are important for host defense and immune complex catabolism. Although soluble CD59 is not an effective inhibitor of MAC formation, we have shown previously that the effectiveness of soluble CD59 can be significantly enhanced when it is targeted to the site of MAC formation (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in many disease states early complement activation products are involved in pathogenesis, and only an inhibitor of complement activation would have potential therapeutic value. In this context, recombinant soluble complement inhibitors based on membrane inhibitors of complement activation, including DAF, have been shown to be effective at attenuating complement-dependent pathology in a variety of animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disease and at considerably prolonging the survival of transplanted xenografts (for reviews on the subject of therapeutic intervention in the complement system see Refs. 9Morgan B.P.

Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, unresolved questions regarding the clinical use of systemic inhibitors of complement activation remain. Complement plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity to infection, and it is not clear what effect systemic complement inhibition may have on the ability of the host to control infection, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised. In addition, complement is required for the effective catabolism of immune complexes, and the administration of systemic complement inhibitors would probably exacerbate preexisting clinical features of immune complex disease, a potential candidate disease for complement inhibitor therapy. The efficacy and perhaps safety of inhibitors of complement activation may be improved by targeting them to sites of complement activation and disease. Local targeting of complement activation inhibitors may allow a much lower effective serum concentration and result in reduced levels of systemic complement inhibition. In this study we address the feasibility of targeting an inhibitor of complement activation to a cell surface and site of complement activation by means of antibody fragments containing an antigen binding site. The TWS2 cell line was produced by transfecting the Ig nonproducing mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 with a chimeric light chain composed of murine κ anti-dansyl variable domain joined to human Cκ constant domain (16Poon P.H.

TWS2 were cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DAF cDNA and anti-DAF polyclonal antiserum were kindly provided by Dr. V.

The linker-DAF sequence was then inserted at the 3′ end of human IgG3 CH1 domain (CH1-DAF), the hinge region (H-DAF), or the CH3 domain (CH3-DAF). The vector and cloning strategy is as described for the generation of IgG-CD59 constructs (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin.

An additional CH1-DAF construct containing the N-terminal SCR of DAF and termed CH1-DAF(1–4) was generated as described above except that the N-terminal primer for polymerase chain reaction amplification was at the beginning of the mature protein sequence. Transfection of TWS2 cells and clone selection were performed as previously described (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Detection of IgG-DAF fusion proteins and determination of their relative concentrations were achieved using a standard ELISA technique (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The capture antigen was dansylated bovine serum albumin, and anti-DAF mAb IIH6 or 1H4 was the primary detection antibody. Details of the assay have been described previously (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of IgG-DAF fusion proteins was determined either by UV absorbance or by using a Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce). IgG-DAF proteins were purified from culture supernatant by anti-DAF affinity chromatography using IIH6 mAb. The purified IIH6 mAb was coupled to HiTrap NHS-activated affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Culture supernatants containing IgG-DAF were adjusted to pH 7.5 and applied to affinity columns at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with 2–3 column volumes of 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.6. Fractions containing fusion protein were collected into tubes containing 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8 for neutralization, and samples were then dialyzed against PBS. Proteins were separated on 4–15% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) under nonreducing conditions by standard procedures (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and transferred DAF constructs were detected with anti-DAF mAb IIH6 or 1H4 at 10 µg/ml in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 buffer (Bio-Rad). After washing with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a 1:2500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. The membrane was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate nitroblue tetrazolium substrate tablets (Sigma). To detect IgG-DAF binding to targeted CHO cells, the cells were labeled with the hapten dansyl as previously described (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Control unlabeled or dansyl-labeled CHO cells were incubated with fusion proteins at a 160 nm final concentration (30 min/4 °C). Following incubation, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further incubated with anti-DAF mAb IIH6 (10 µg/ml) (30 min/4 °C). After washing, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was added (1:100) (30 min/4 °C). Cells were then washed, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Dansyl fluorescence and FITC fluorescence have distinct excitation and emission spectra, and machine gating ensured that only FITC fluorescence was recorded (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of the IgG-DAF fusion proteins on C3 deposition, labeled or unlabeled CHO cells were first incubated with IgG-DAF proteins at a 100 nm final concentration for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then sensitized with anti-CHO cell membrane antiserum (10%), and NHS depleted of complement protein C8 (Quidel, San Diego, CA) added to a final concentration of 10%. The use of C8-depleted serum prevents the formation of the MAC and cell lysis following complement activation. After a 45 min/37 °C incubation, the cells were washed, and FITC-conjugated anti-human C3 antibody (Accurate Chemical Corp., Westbury, NY) was added (30 min/4 °C). After washing, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed. CHO cells at between 60 and 80% confluence were detached with versene (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed once, and resuspended to 1 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then labeled with dansyl or treated under control conditions (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and sensitized to complement by adding rabbit anti-CHO cell membrane antiserum to a 10% final concentration. Following addition of antiserum, an equal volume of NHS diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then added, and cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined either by trypan blue exclusion (both live and dead cells counted) or by a fluorescence-based assay that measures release of fluorescence from cells pre-loaded with calcein-AM (23Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results obtained from either assay were similar. Cells were lysed with 0.01% saponin for 100% lysis controls, and heat-inactivated NHS was used for background lysis. Cell lysis assays were typically performed in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes in a final volume of 100 µl. A final NHS concentration of 10% resulted in ∼90% cell lysis of CHO cells, and this concentration of NHS was used in cell lysis experiments when assaying the complement inhibitory activity of IgG-DAF constructs. To determine the effect of IgG-DAF fusion proteins on cell lysis, purified fusion protein in PBS was added to unlabeled or dansyl-labeled cells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Anti-CHO cell sensitizing antiserum was then added, followed by the addition of NHS. Cell lysis was determined after 45 min at 37 °C. The extracellular portion of decay-accelerating factor is composed of four SCR units at its N terminus followed by a serine-threonine-rich sequence. Neither the N-terminal SCR nor the serine-threonine-rich region is required for function (3Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Antsee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533PubMed Google Scholar), and IgG-DAF constructs were prepared using cDNA encoding SCRs 2–4 of DAF. The DAF-encoding regions were inserted at the 3′ end of the coding sequence for IgG heavy chain fragments, after the CH1-, hinge-, or CH3-encoding regions. The two fusion partners were joined by a Ser-Gly linker. The predicted set of fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 1. The constructs contain murine variable regions with specificity for the hapten dansyl, linked to human IgG constant regions. The CH3-DAF fusion was constructed with a human IgG4 Fc region (CH2 and CH3), because human IgG4 does not activate complement. Cells stably expressing an anti-dansyl light chain were transfected with expression vectors containing the heavy chain-DAF fusion constructs. Following selection and limiting dilution, transfectoma clones secreting IgG-DAF proteins with specificity for dansyl were identified by assaying culture supernatant by ELISA. Fusion proteins were purified from culture supernatant by anti-DAF affinity chromatography, and clones secreting CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF at ∼0.3 and 0.1 µg/ml culture supernatant, respectively, were isolated. We failed to isolate a clone or stable population expressing a useful quantity of hinge-DAF (H-DAF) fusion protein. Analysis of purified IgG-DAF fusion proteins by ELISA using dansyl-bovine serum albumin as the capture antigen confirmed that each construct specifically recognized dansyl and that the constructs that were bound to dansyl were recognized by anti-DAF monoclonal (IIH6 and 1H4) and polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Analysis of CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting revealed proteins of ∼85 and 240 kDa, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular masses (Fig. 2) (the CH1-DAF(1–4) fusion protein shown in Fig. 2 is described in the last section of “Results”). The targeting specificity and complement inhibitory function of the IgG-DAF fusion proteins was assayed using CHO cells conjugated with the target antigen dansyl. Cell surface labeling of CHO cells with fluorescent dansyl was demonstrated by flow cytometry with UV excitation as previously described (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (data not shown). For analysis of binding, the IgG-DAF constructs were incubated with unlabeled control CHO cells or with dansylated CHO cells, and IgG-DAF binding was measured by flow cytometry by means of anti-DAF antibodies. The IgG-DAF constructs bound only to dansylated cells (Fig. 3). At similar molar inputs of CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF, flow cytometry indicated that a higher relative level of cell-bound DAF occurred with CH3-DAF (mean relative fluorescence of 215 for CH1-DAF versus 298 for CH3-DAF; Fig. 3). This is probably a consequence of the dimeric nature of the CH3, but not CH1, constructs. The functional activity of CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF was analyzed by measuring the effect of the fusion proteins on both cellular C3 deposition and complement-mediated cell lysis. To determine the effect of the IgG-DAF fusion proteins on complement-mediated lysis, antibody-sensitized unlabeled or dansyl-labeled CHO cells were incubated with either CH1-DAF or CH3-DAF in the presence of human serum. The concentration of human serum used in these experiments (10%) resulted in ∼90% lysis of unprotected CHO cells. Fig. 4 shows that both CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF protected both targeted and untargeted CHO cells from complement-mediated lysis. However, CH1-DAF provided targeted cells with significantly better protection; 50% inhibition of lysis required a CH1-DAF concentration of ∼35 nm for targeted cells and ∼100 nm for untargeted cells. The specific activity of untargeted CH1-DAF is within the range previously reported for recombinant soluble DAF (24Moran P. Beasley H. Gorrell A. Martin E. Gribling P. Fuchs H. Gillet N. Burton L.E. Caras I.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 25Higgins P.J. Ko J.-L. Lobell R. Sardonini C. Alessi M.K. Yeh C.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2872-2881PubMed Google Scholar, 26Christiansen D. Milland J. Thorley B.R. McKenzie I.F. Loveland B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CH3-DAF and CH1-DAF had similar molar activities in protecting untargeted cells from complement lysis, even though each CH3-DAF construct contained two DAF molecules. However, in contrast to CH1-DAF, there was little difference in the protection CH3-DAF provided to targeted cells compared with untargeted cells, with 50% inhibition of lysis requiring a concentration of ∼80 nm for targeted cells and ∼95 nm for untargeted cells. CH3-DAF was constructed using the IgG4 Fc region, and we have shown previously that anti-dansyl IgG4 has no effect on complement-mediated lysis of unlabeled or dansylated CHO cells (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dansylation of CHO cells also has no effect on their susceptibility to complement (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the increased potency of CH1-DAF at protecting targeted cells is due to cell-associated DAF. To confirm this, dansyl-labeled and unlabeled cells were incubated in the presence of CH1-DAF and then washed before exposure to sensitizing antibody and complement. As expected, unlabeled CHO cells were not protected from complement-mediated lysis (Fig.5). However, CH1-DAF did protect washed dansyl-labeled CHO cells from complement lysis, showing that cell-bound CH1-DAF functions effectively. The level of protection was less than when unbound CH1-DAF was not removed, and >60% protection from lysis could not be achieved. To determine the effect of the IgG-DAF fusion proteins on C3 deposition, unlabeled or dansyl-labeled CHO cells were incubated with either CH1-DAF or CH3-DAF in the presence of C8-deficient serum (to prevent complement-mediated lysis). Fig.6 shows that both fusion proteins inhibited C3 deposition on both targeted and untargeted cells. Targeted (dansyl-labeled) cells were better protected from C3 deposition than untargeted cells by CH1-DAF, but there was little difference between C3 deposition on targeted and untargeted cells with CH3-DAF. With regard to targeted CHO cells, CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF resulted in a respective 70 and 45% approximate reduction in C3 deposition (mean relative fluorescence) compared with controls. For untargeted CHO cells, CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF both resulted in a 40–45% reduction in C3 deposition. The inhibition of C3 deposition by the IgG-DAF constructs correlates with their activity at inhibiting complement-mediated lysis. IgG-DAF proteins were constructed using only SCR 2–4 of DAF, because the N-terminal SCR of DAF does not form part of its active site (3Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Antsee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533PubMed Google Scholar). Although the complement-regulatory function of the CH1-DAF construct reported above is within the range of activity previously reported for recombinant soluble DAF (24Moran P. Beasley H. Gorrell A. Martin E. Gribling P. Fuchs H. Gillet N. Burton L.E. Caras I.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 25Higgins P.J. Ko J.-L. Lobell R. Sardonini C. Alessi M.K. Yeh C.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2872-2881PubMed Google Scholar, 26Christiansen D. Milland J. Thorley B.R. McKenzie I.F. Loveland B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we subsequently prepared a CH1-DAF construct containing all four SCR units of DAF, designated CH1-DAF(1–4). Western blot analysis of affinity-purified CH1-DAF(1–4) revealed a protein of about 105 kDa. The molecular mass is slightly greater than predicted from the amino acid sequence, but there is anN-glycosylation site in the region linking SCRs 1 and 2 (not present in the other constructs). To perform a functional comparison, CH1-DAF and CH1-DAF(1–4) were titrated by dansyl-capture ELISA as described above, and flow cytometry showed that at similar input concentrations of CH1-DAF and CH1-DAF(1–4), similar relative levels of DAF bound to the cell surface (data not shown). When the activity of the two constructs was compared in complement lysis assays, the inclusion of the N-terminal SCR in the CH1-DAF(1–4) construct was found to result in a small, but statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in complement-inhibitory function in both cell targeted and untargeted assays (Fig. 7). Both CH1-DAF and CH3-DAF were effective inhibitors of complement in an untargeted system, and the activity of both constructs (50% inhibition of cell lysis at ∼100 nm) is within the range reported by others for the activity of recombinant soluble DAF in vitro. However, the potency of CH1-DAF at protecting cells from complement was significantly enhanced when the construct was targeted to the cell surface. In contrast, CH3-DAF was not significantly better at protecting targeted versus untargeted cells from complement. It has been shown previously that the efficiency of DAF at inhibiting complement activation is greatly enhanced when DAF is inserted in a cell membrane (24Moran P. Beasley H. Gorrell A. Martin E. Gribling P. Fuchs H. Gillet N. Burton L.E. Caras I.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 27Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1558-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, purified membrane DAF containing its GPI anchor was (spontaneously) inserted into cell membranes, and its activity was compared with recombinant soluble DAF protein that does not associate with cell membranes. At equivalent input concentrations, membrane DAF was 50-fold more effective than soluble DAF at inhibiting complement-mediated lysis (24Moran P. Beasley H. Gorrell A. Martin E. Gribling P. Fuchs H. Gillet N. Burton L.E. Caras I.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CH1-DAF was about 3-fold more effective at protecting targeted cells from complement deposition and lysis than it was at protecting untargeted cells. However, there are some important distinctions to be made. DAF containing its GPI anchor will insert into any membrane and is not targeted to a specific cell type. Furthermore, GPI-DAF is ineffective in the presence of serum due to its affinity for lipoproteins and hydrophobic serum proteins (24Moran P. Beasley H. Gorrell A. Martin E. Gribling P. Fuchs H. Gillet N. Burton L.E. Caras I.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 27Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1558-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), making it unsuitable for clinical application. CH1-DAF is not affected by the presence of serum lipoproteins, and it is straightforward to change the binding specificity of the variable region, potentially providing protection to any cell population recognized by a specific antibody. In this study, DAF was joined to the C terminus of IgG CH1 and CH3 domains via a [S(G)4)]3linkage, and one factor that could affect function is the type of linkage or spacer between the IgG domains and DAF. The N-terminal SCR of DAF is not required for function (3Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Antsee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533PubMed Google Scholar), and the increase in activity of CH1-DAF when the N-terminal SCR is included in the construct may be related to it functioning as a spacer. The additional SCR enhanced the function of both targeted and untargeted CH1-DAF(1–4), possibly by permitting better access of the DAF active site to its site of interaction on the C3 convertase, and perhaps reflecting some degree of steric hindrance by the antibody domains in CH1-DAF. With regard to cell-bound CH1 fusion proteins, the additional SCR spacer linked to the flexible serine-glycine linker may allow the active site of DAF to be positioned in a more favorable orientation (distance?) with respect to the site of C3 convertase formation on the cell membrane. Similar considerations may explain why the smaller CH1-DAF was more effective than CH3-DAF at inhibiting complement on targeted cells. Also of note, there was no difference between the complement-inhibitory activity of CH3-DAF and CH1-DAF for untargeted cells, even though each CH3-DAF contained two DAF molecules. Steric hindrance may explain this observation. Cell-associated CH1-DAF was effective at inhibiting complement-mediated lysis of the cells to which it was bound. However, even at saturation, cell-bound CH1-DAF alone was unable to achieve the level of protection that could be provided to cells when unbound CH1-DAF was also present. There are various factors that could influence the activity of cell-associated CH1-DAF, the most obvious being surface antigen density and characteristics of the targeting vehicle. The targeting vehicle can affect the positioning of cell-associated DAF, either with regard to its orientation or distance from the site of C3 convertase formation on the membrane. Data presented here indicate that a small targeting vehicle is preferable to a large one. In addition, in the case of antibody targeting, the location of the epitope relative to the cell membrane may influence the activity of a cell-targeted complement inhibitor. Addressing these considerations may result in further enhancing the effectiveness of targeted complement inhibitors of activation, and such considerations are issues that are better addressed using target antigens and corresponding antibodies that represent a biologic/disease-relevant system. With regard to their potential clinical use, humanization of antibody fragments would minimize the risk of an immune response, and there have been no reports of an autoimmune response to soluble complement-inhibitory constructs administered to animals. Although the removal of unbound DAF from our assay system resulted in the protection of only about 60% of targeted cells from complement, it is important to note that targeted DAF was still a significantly better inhibitor than untargeted DAF when unbound DAF is not removed. This is a therapeutically relevant observation because untargeted inhibitors of complement activation have shown promise in animal models of inflammatory disease and are in clinical trials. Rapid clearance from the circulation may be a concern for both targeted and untargeted constructs, but probably less so for targeted complement inhibitors because they are also cleared from the circulation by binding to their target tissue. The presence of antibody fragments may improve the half-life of constructs, particularly if the Fc region is present. Although current data did not show a significant improvement of targeted over untargeted CH3-DAF (i.e.Fc-containing construct), engineering of the constructs and choice of target epitope (see “Discussion” above) could potentially improve the effectiveness of a targeted CH3-DAF construct. We have previously shown that functional IgG-CD59 fusion proteins can be targeted to a cell surface (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CD59 is an inhibitor of the terminal complement pathway and cytolytic MAC formation. However, aside from the fact that DAF and CD59 inhibit different parts of the complement pathway, there are important differences in how the IgG-CD59 and IgG-DAF constructs function. Most significantly, unlike IgG-DAF constructs, untargeted IgG-CD59 constructs were not effective inhibitors of complement. In fact, IgG-CD59 only provided effective protection from complement-mediated lysis when bound to the cell surface, and data from us (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and others (28Fodor W.L. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4135-4138PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that CD59 must be positioned close to the membrane at the site of MAC formation to be effective. Such a constraint does not seem to apply for effective DAF function, and this is an important difference. A CH1-CD59 construct was also the most effective type of IgG-CD59 construct at inhibiting complement-mediated lysis but was about 5-fold less effective than CH1-DAF (50% inhibition of lysis required ∼35 nm CH1-DAF and 160 nmCH1-CD59 (8Zhang H.-F., Yu, J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). When unbound CH1-DAF was removed, the complement-inhibitory activity of cell-bound CH1-DAF was comparable with the activity of CH1-CD59, in which cell-associated CD59 accounts for almost all observed complement-inhibitory function. Selectively blocking different parts of the complement pathway may allow the generation of beneficial complement activation products but inhibit the generation of complement activation products involved in disease pathogenesis. For example, in disease conditions where the MAC or C5a are important mediators of inflammation and tissue damage, CD59-based inhibitors and antibodies to C5 (29Wang Y. Rollins S.A. Madri J.A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8955-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Hu Q. Madri J.A. Rollins S.A. Chodera A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 31Wang H. Rollins S.A. Gao Z. Garcia B. Zhang Z. Xing J. Li L. Kellersmann R. Matis L.A. Zhong R. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) may be advantageous, because they do not inhibit the generation of C3a and C3 opsonins. On the other hand, the generation of C3 activation products (often together with C5a) is involved in the pathogenesis of many cell-mediated inflammatory conditions, and intervention in the complement activation phase (C3 convertase formation) would be required to reduce inflammation. However, because C3 activation products are also important for host defense against infection and for the catabolism of immune complexes, systemic inhibition of complement activation may have undesirable side effects. Therefore, the targeting of an inhibitor of complement activation such as DAF may increase efficacy, with lower levels of systemic complement inhibition. It is possible that a short rather than a long serum half-life (as may be predicted for CH1 versus CH3 type constructs) may in fact be a desirable pharmacokinetic property for a targeted inhibitor, because it may be able to maintain appropriate local levels of inhibitor at the targeted site, with low levels of systemic complement inhibition. To summarize, recombinant soluble complement inhibitors (including soluble DAF) have been shown to be effective for the treatment of inflammatory disease in various rodent models. Targeting complement inhibitors to the site of complement activation and disease offers the potential of enhancing therapeutic efficacy and of reducing the level of systemic complement inhibition during treatment. This study demonstrates that targeting DAF to a cell surface by means of an antibody-combining site is feasible and that targeted DAF provides cells with enhanced protection from complement. The data justify the preparation of antibody-complement inhibitor constructs with antibody specificities to disease-relevant antigens for testing in animal models. Finally, the enhanced functioning of targeted versusuntargeted DAF has implications for a targeting approach in general and is not limited to antibody-mediated targeting of complement inhibitors.

The J5 cells lack acidic glycosphingolipids but accumulate their common biosynthetic precursor, lactosylceramide. We established the stable CST transfectants, J5/CST-1 and J5/CST-2 clones, highly expressing sulfated lactosylceramide (SM3). Both clones exhibited more spherical morphology in comparison to mock transfectant, and their adhesiveness to fibronectin and laminin was significantly lower. The loss of cell-substratum interactions in these SM3-expressing cells could be attributed to decreased expression of integrins (α5, α6, and β1) on the cell surface and their whole cellular levels. However, the levels of H-2Kb and H-2Db antigens remained unchanged. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analyses for these integrins exhibited significant decrease of β1 gene expression in J5/CST-1 and 2, but there was no change in the levels of α5 and α6transcripts. Deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H treatment clearly demonstrated that the precursor form of β1 integrin, possessing high mannose oligosaccharide chains, was preferentially decreased in the CST transfectants. These results demonstrate that endogenous SM3 negatively regulates β1 integrin expression at the transcriptional level, and the decrease of α integrin proteins in the CST transfectants was due to the post-transcriptional modification. We suggest the putative importance of the intracellular pre-β1 integrin pool for normal integrin maturation and subsequent function. Although the rates of cell proliferation in vitro for mock and CST transfectants were similar, tumorigenicity of J5/CST-1 and -2 cells inoculated into syngeneic C57/BL6 mice was greatly decreased or even absent. This was probably due to global loss of the efficient cell-matrix interactions, which are essential for the development of malignant tumors in vivo. Thus, we showed the evidence that cellular SM3 negatively regulates the cell-substratum interaction, resulting in the loss of tumorigenicity. To investigate the cellular functions of sulfated glycosphingolipids, we introduced the cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) gene into J5 cells, a subclone of 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The J5 cells lack acidic glycosphingolipids but accumulate their common biosynthetic precursor, lactosylceramide.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analyses for these integrins exhibited significant decrease of β1 gene expression in J5/CST-1 and 2, but there was no change in the levels of α5 and α6transcripts. Deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H treatment clearly demonstrated that the precursor form of β1 integrin, possessing high mannose oligosaccharide chains, was preferentially decreased in the CST transfectants. These results demonstrate that endogenous SM3 negatively regulates β1 integrin expression at the transcriptional level, and the decrease of α integrin proteins in the CST transfectants was due to the post-transcriptional modification. We suggest the putative importance of the intracellular pre-β1 integrin pool for normal integrin maturation and subsequent function. Although the rates of cell proliferation in vitro for mock and CST transfectants were similar, tumorigenicity of J5/CST-1 and -2 cells inoculated into syngeneic C57/BL6 mice was greatly decreased or even absent. This was probably due to global loss of the efficient cell-matrix interactions, which are essential for the development of malignant tumors in vivo. Thus, we showed the evidence that cellular SM3 negatively regulates the cell-substratum interaction, resulting in the loss of tumorigenicity. glycosphingolipids cerebroside sulfotransferase galactosylsulfatide lactosylsulfatide diethylaminoethyl phosphate-buffered saline major histocompatibility complex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid lactosylceramide galactosylceramide high performance TLC digoxigenin polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescence-activated cell sorter bovine serum albumin N-acetylneuraminyllactosylceramide base pair detergent-insoluble microdomains tetraspanin membrane protein.

CST transfers the sulfate group to the 3-position of the galactose in lactosylceramide (LacCer) and galactosylceramide (GalCer) and forms galactosylsulfatide (SM4) and lactosylsulfatide (SM3), respectively (2Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CST did not show sulfotransferase activity toward the oligosaccharides that had been used as substrates in the previous studies on the glycoprotein β-Gal-3′-sulfotransferase (3Honke K. Tsuda M.

Northern blot analysis showed that CST gene is preferentially transcribed in stomach, small intestine, brain, kidney, lung, and testis, in that order (4Hirahara Y. Tsuda M. Wada Y. Honke K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of sulfatides have long been noted for their unique property of having a strong negative electronic charge in the molecule. Sulfatides interact with various biomolecules especially in cell adhesion, differentiation, and signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 5Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar and 6Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In the case of cell-substratum adhesion, SM4 and SM3 have been found to bind several proteins such as laminin and thrombospondin (7Roberts D.D. Ginsburg V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When exogenous SM4 was incorporated into SMKT-R3 cells (human renal cell carcinoma), their attachment to laminin, but not to fibronectin, was enhanced (8Kobayashi T. Honke K. Kuramitsu Y. Hosokawa M. Miyazaki T. Murata J. Saiki I. Ishizuka I. Makita A. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, it was uncertain whether the data obtained from these experiments truly reflect the cellular functions of endogenous sulfatides. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the functional role of endogenous sulfatide in cell adhesion. We employed a subclone of the mouse 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cell line, 3LL-J5, which has high LacCer content but no galactosylceramide and SM3 (9Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Inokuchi J. Uemura S. Kabayama K. Igarashi Y. Glycoconj.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The stable CST transfectants expressing SM3 at a high level exhibited decreased adhesive abilities to both fibronectin and laminin. We demonstrated here an inverse (or negative) relationship between the level of cellular SM3 and cell adhesive ability as well as tumorigenicity. For the GSL analysis, DEAE-Sephadex A-25 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Sep-Pak C18and silica gel HPTLC plates were from Waters Associates (Milford, MA) and Merck, respectively. pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) and zeocin were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and LipofectAMINE PLUS™ Reagent was from Life Technologies, Inc. Human fibronectin and mouse laminin were from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). A cell counting kit based on a modified 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method was employed (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). For flow cytometry, anti-α5 integrin (clone 5H10-27) was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti-α6 (monoclonal antibody 1378) and -β1 (monoclonal antibody 1997) integrins were from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA); anti-SM3 (11Hiraiwa N. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Tadano-Aritomi K. Nagai K. Ishizuka I. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2917-2928PubMed Google Scholar) was from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan); and fluorescein-conjugated anti-H-2Db and H-2Kb were from Meiji Nyugyo Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) as the primary antibodies. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgM from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat IgG as the secondary antibodies were from Immunotech (Marseille, France). For Western blotting of integrins, anti-α5 integrin (antibody 1928) and anti-β1 integrin (monoclonal antibody 1997) were from Chemicon. For the chemiluminescence detection of glycolipids, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL kit) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech were used. Bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce was used for protein determination. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratories Animals and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee in Hokkaido University. A subclone of the murine 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cell line, J5, was described previously (9Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, 9.4% (v/v) sodium bicarbonate, and 100 mml-glutamine. Cells were cultured in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere tissue culture incubator and passaged every 3 days using a trypsin/EDTA (0.1% and 1 mm) solution. Transfected and mock-transfected cells were cultured in the above medium containing also 300 µg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). J5 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ Reagent with plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-hCST prepared with human sulfotransferase cDNA (1Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) integrated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). The hCST-transfected cells were primarily selected in the same medium used for growing them. As a control for transfection, mock cells were prepared with pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) without hCST cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the Trizol reagent, and one-step RT-PCR was performed using the mixture of reverse transcriptase and TaqDNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was reverse-transcribed at 45 °C for 30 min, and the cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 0.15 min, 50 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The following primer pairs were used: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC3′ and reverse 5′TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA3′ (product size 451 bp); mouse integrin α5, forward 5′TCGCCTCGATCTCCTCTCCA3′ and reverse 5′CGCTGCAGATAGATGTAGAC3′ (product size 1099 bp); mouse integrin α6, forward 5′GTGAACGTGAGGTGTGTGAAC3′ and reverse 5′CGCATGGTATCGGGGAATGC3′ (product size 377 bp); mouse integrin β1, forward 5′GACTTCCGCATTGGCTTTGGC3′ and reverse 5′CAAACACGACACCTGCACACG3′ (product size 1205 bp). The concentration ratio of target cDNA primers to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and the PCR cycle number was optimized for each reaction. Total RNA (10 µg) from cells was denatured in 50% formamide, 6% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at 65 °C, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. A digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe for CST mRNA was synthesized from theXhoI fragment of pBS-hCST1 (1Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using a DIG RNA labeling kit with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe for mouse β1 integrin mRNA was synthesized from theAvaII fragment of pGEM1-mouse β1 integrin (kindly provided by Dr. R. O. Hynes) using a DIG RNA labeling kit with Sp6 RNA polymerase. Mouse α5 integrin mRNA was synthesized by RT-PCR using RNA derived from mouse B16 melanoma cells with primers mouse α5 integrin, forward 5′TCGCCTCGATCTCCTCTCCA3′ and reverse 5′CGCTGCAGATAGATGTAGAC3′ (product size 1099 bp), and cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid was linearized with XbaI and transcribed with Sp6 RNA polymerase using a DIG RNA labeling kit as above. The membrane was stained with methylene blue for the detection of 18 S and 28 S rRNA and then hybridized with the RNA probe at 68 °C. Detection was with a DIG-Luminescent Detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells cultured in a 100-mm dish were scraped off and washed three times with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 300 µl of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and homogenized by sonication on ice. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. CST activity was assayed in 30 µl of a mixture containing 25 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.4), 50 µm GalCer in 5% Triton X-100, 10 mmMnCl2, 1% Lubrol PX, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm NaCl, and 40 µm [35S]3′phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, plus 20 µl of the enzyme source. This was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8) was added. The mixture was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was then washed with 2 ml each of chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8) and methanol. [35S]Sulfatide was eluted with 8 ml of 90 mm AcONH4 in methanol directly into a scintillation vial. The radioactivity was determined in 10 ml of scintillation fluid by a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, type 1211). The total lipids were extracted from the cells with chloroform/methanol/water (4:4:0.3 and 2:4:0.3), successively. The combined extracts were then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (acetate form, 2.4-ml bed volume), and the neutral lipids were eluted with 12 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8). The acidic lipid fraction was then eluted with 12 ml of chloroform/methanol/aqueous 0.8 m sodium acetate (30:60:8). The neutral and acidic lipid fractions were evaporated to dryness, and contaminating esters were methanolyzed with methanolic 0.1m NaOH for 1 h at 40 °C. The solution was neutralized with 1 m acetic acid in methanol, diluted with an equal volume of aqueous 50 mm NaCl, and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 40 ml of water, and lipids were eluted with 10 ml of methanol and 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), successively. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and the lipids were analyzed by HPTLC. The plates were then developed with chloroform/methanol/aqueous 12 mm magnesium chloride (60:25:4, for neutral lipids) or chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, for acidic lipids). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying orcinol reagent and heating at 100 °C for 10 min and then quantified with a dual-wavelength flying spot scanner (CS9300-PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in the reflectance mode at 500 nm with integrated areas. TLC immunoblotting was performed by the method of Taki et al. (12Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), slightly modified as follows. Acidic lipids were separated on an HPTLC plate with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) and then immersed in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol/aqueous 0.2% calcium chloride/methanol (40:20:7) for 20 s. The plate was then covered with a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and a glass microfiber filter (Atto Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). This was then pressed (level 8) for 50 s with TLC Thermal Blotter (Atto Instruments) at 180 °C, after which the PVDF membrane was separated from the plate and dried. The PVDF membrane was agitated in 5% skim milk/TBS-T (aqueous 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, and then the membrane was shaken in the primary antibody O4 (for galactosyl sulfatide and lactosyl sulfatide) (13Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) or anti-SM3 (for lactosyl sulfatide) (11Hiraiwa N. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Tadano-Aritomi K. Nagai K. Ishizuka I. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2917-2928PubMed Google Scholar) solution in 5% skim milk/TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and dipped and shaken in the secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, solution in 5% skim milk/TBS-T for 1 h. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was analyzed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL kit). Subconfluent mock and CST transfectants cells cultured in 75-cm2 culture dishes were rinsed with cold PBS and were solubilized in SDS-gel sample buffer containing 0.4% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteinase inhibitors, and the amounts of protein in all samples were determined using BCA reagent. The equal amounts of samples were then boiled for 3 min and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. When deglycosylation of high mannose oligosaccharide chains was performed prior to SDS-PAGE, each denatured sample was further treated with 1,000 units of endoglycosidase H (EndoHf, BioLabs Inc. Beverly, MA) for 1 h 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% skim milk/TBS-T. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody (anti-α5 or anti-β1 integrin), washed, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL kit). Cells were detached from the culture surface by a 20-min incubation at 37 °C in 10 mm EDTA/PBS, pelleted, washed with FACS buffer (0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3in PBS) twice, and then resuspended in FACS buffer containing 10 µg/ml anti-α5, α6, β1integrin or anti-SM3 for 1 h at 4 °C. For the detection of whole cellular integrins, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin containing FACS buffer for 15 min at 4 °C before adding the appropriate primary antibody. Then the cells were washed with FACS buffer three times, treated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat IgG or fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgM for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark, and washed with FACS buffer as above. The intensity of cell fluorescence was determined by a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For the detection of MHC, cells treated without or with saponin were stained with 100 µg/ml fluorescein-conjugated anti H-2Dbor H-2Kb in FACS buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with FACS buffer as above. 100 µl of fibronectin or laminin (1, 5, 10 and 25 µg/ml) in PBS were added to each well of 96-well plates, incubated overnight at room temperature, and removed. The coated wells were further incubated with 100 µl of 0.1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h and washed with PBS three times. Each well was incubated with 50 µl of 0.01% BSA in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 1 h. A 50-µl suspension of J5/CST-1, J5/CST-2, or mock cells (5 × 103) in 0.01% BSA/RPMI 1640 was added to the fibronectin- or laminin-coated wells and incubated for 30 min. Non-adherent cells were removed by inverting the plate, and each well was gently washed with 100 µl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. To each well were added 100 µl of the same medium followed by 10 µl of cell counting kit. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the absorbance (450 nm) of formazan generated in the wells was measured with a dual-wavelength flying spot scanner (CS9300-PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The attachment ability was expressed as the percentage of attached cells (absorbance of attachment cells in the well/absorbance of total cells added to the well × 100). Previously, we subcloned the J5 clone, which lacked acidic GSLs and accumulated LacCer, from the wild type of murine 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells (9Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The CST gene was introduced into the J5 clone to generate sulfatide-expressing clones. A total of 24 transfectant clones were finally obtained by limited dilution, and 2 clones (J5/CST-1 and J5/CST-2) which expressed relatively high levels of CST gene mRNA (Fig. 1 A) and CST activity (Fig. 1 B) were chosen for further study. The mRNA and the enzyme activity of CST appeared only in the clones into which the vector constructed with the CST gene had been introduced but not in the mock-transfected clones (Fig. 1, A andB). Because the J5 clone expresses only LacCer but not GalCer (9Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Inokuchi J. Uemura S. Kabayama K. Igarashi Y. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 1-7Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), introduction of the CST gene into this clone should express only SM3 as a sulfatide. The GSL fractions were prepared from mock and J5/CST-1 and -2 cells, and the SM3 content in proportion to the CST activity was confirmed on HPTLC visualized with orcinol reagent (Fig. 1 C). There was no visible staining of SM4 in both mock and the CST transfectants. Analyses of the neutral GSLs of J5/CST-1 and -2 cells showed that not only the contents of LacCer and its precursor GlcCer were decreased, but also that of the globo type GSL, Gb3 (Fig. 1 C). This indicated that the biosynthetic pathway from LacCer (at the LacCer branching point) was greatly shifted to the sulfo type. We further identified only SM3 but not SM4 by immunoblotting on HPTLC using anti-SM3 monoclonal antibody (11Hiraiwa N. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Tadano-Aritomi K. Nagai K. Ishizuka I. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2917-2928PubMed Google Scholar), which recognizes only SM3, and with O4 antibody (13Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), which recognizes both SM4 and SM3 (Fig.1 D). By using the anti-SM3 antibody, strong expression of SM3 on the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig.1 E). Thus, we designated J5/CST-1 and -2 cells as SM3 high expressors, and the following experiments were carried out using these two clones and the mock transfectant. When in vitro growth of mock and CST transfectants was compared, there was no difference in the rates of cell proliferation under the normal culture conditions on plastic plates (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, there was a significant increase of the spherical form in the CST transfectants (Fig. 2 B), indicative of weak adhesiveness of the SM3-expressing cells. Both J5/CST-1 and -2 cells exhibited a marked decrease in their adhesive abilities to the plastic coated with laminin and fibronectin (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the cells highly expressing SM3 were unable to spread on the surface coated with fibronectin even 2 h after seeding (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Cell adhesion and spreading on laminin and fibronectin. A, 96-well plates were coated with laminin and fibronectin, and cell attachment assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, J5/CST-1 and mock cells were seeded on a plastic plate coated with laminin and fibronectin at 10 µg/ml, and 2 h later, the plates were washed with PBS, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with Giemsa, and photographed (× 200). Bar = 100 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of integrin molecules on the cell surface involved in the recognition of fibronectin (α5 and β1) and laminin (α6 and β1) was analyzed by flow cytometry (Table I). All of the integrins examined here exhibited a marked decrease (around 32–43% in both J5/CST-1 and -2 cells). After cell permeabilization with saponin, almost similar decreases in the cellular integrins were observed, demonstrating that the decreases in cell surface integrins in the SM3 highly expressing cells were due to their decreased cellular contents. The expression of H-2Kb and H-2Db antigens did not show significant differences between the mock and the CST transfectants (Table I). Therefore, the decrease of integrin expression in the CST transfectants may be a specific cellular event regulated by cellular SM3. As shown in Fig. 4, the significant reduction of α5 and β1 proteins in CST transfectants was observed by Western blot analysis, confirming the data of flow cytometry (Table I). It has been reported that cellular integrins, especially β1-subunit, can be separated into two bands on SDS-PAGE due to the different oligosaccharide chains on the protein; the lower band has been designated the precursor form of β1-subunit (high mannose type) and the upper band is the mature form (complex type) (14Jaspers M. de Strooper B. Spaepen M. van Leuven F. David G. van den Berghe H. Cassiman J-J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Akiyama S. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed two immunoreactive bands in lysates of both mock and CST transfectants by anti-β1 antibody, and the transition from the pre-β1 to the maturely glycosylated form increases the size from ∼120 to 130 kDa (Fig. 4 A). Removal of immature N-linked glycan chains by digestion with endoglycosidase H (16Kobata A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) reduced the size to ∼80 kDa, whereas the maturely glycosylated β1 band of ∼130 kDa was not cleaved by endoglycosidase H (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the decrease of β1 integrin protein in CST transfectants was mainly due to the dramatic decrease of the precursor form (Fig.4 A). The amount of α5 integrin protein in CST transfectants was decreased to around 50% in comparison to that of mock transfectant (Fig. 4 B). The determination of α6 integrin by Western blotting using two different anti-α6 antibodies was unsuccessful due to nonspecific staining. By taking the data from Table I and Fig. 4, we concluded that the cell surface expression of α5, α6, and β1 integrins as well as their chemical quantities were decreased in CST transfectants.Table IFlow cytometric analysis of the amounts of cell surface and total cellular integrins and H-2 antigensMockJ5/CST-1J5/CST-2[Cell Surface]α5130.887.977.8α6198.8113.1114.1β1199.1121.0134.6H-2Db24.134.533.9H-2Kb18.419.117.7[Total]α5243.397.9147.6α6503.5336.4260.8β1327.1196.6172.8H-2Db111.098.088.1H-2Kb227.6194.8232.1The values were expressed as geometric mean fluorescence intensity. Open table in a new tab The values were expressed as geometric mean fluorescence intensity. We asked here whether the decreased integrin contents in the CST transfectants originated from the decreased cellular amounts of their mRNAs themselves. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for α5, α6, and β1integrins showed the selective decrease of β1 gene expression levels in J5/CST-1 and -2 (Fig.5). There was no difference between the mRNA levels of α5 and α6 integrins in both the mock and CST transfectants at various PCR cycles under non-saturating conditions, and the representative picture was presented in Fig. 5. Northern blot analysis clearly indicated the significantly lowered level of β1 integrin mRNA in both SM3 high expressing cells, J5/CST-1 and J5/CST-2, but only a slight decrease in the SM3 low expressing J5/CST-3 cells, showing the inverse relationship between the levels of cellular SM3 and β1 integrin mRNA content (Fig. 6, A versus C). The levels of α5transcript both in mock and CST transfectants were essentially the same (Fig. 6 B). These results demonstrate"

Our data reveal that both hydrophobic and acidic residues are important for transactivation and that these residues are clustered in two regions of the acidic segment of AhR. Both regions are crucial for function, because disruption of either one substantially impairs transactivation of the chromosomal CYP1A1target gene. Neither region contains an amino acid motif that resembles those reported for other acidic activation domains. Furthermore, proline substitutions in both regions do not impair transactivation in vivo, a finding that implies that α-helix formation is not required for function.

AhR and Arnt are structurally related, prototypical members of an interesting class of transcription factors that contain bHLH motifs juxtaposed to PAS domains (12Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R.

For example, their N-terminal segments mediate heterodimerization and DNA recognition whereas their C-terminal segments contain transactivation domains (12Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N.

Using AhR-defective mouse hepatoma cells, we have shown previously that the C-terminal segment of AhR is required for TCDD-inducible occupancy of the CYP1A1 promoter and transactivation of the gene in situ (21Ko H.P.

In these studies, we also found that an AhR chimera containing the N-terminal segment of AhR (amino acids 1–494) linked to a 69-amino acid domain from the C-terminal segment of AhR (amino acids 515–583) facilitatesCYP1A1 promoter occupancy and restores its responsiveness to TCDD in AhR-defective cells, whereas the N-terminal segment by itself does not (22Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The domain spanning amino acids 515–583 is rich in glutamate and aspartate residues (24%); by this criterion, it resembles an acidic activation domain (AAD) (23Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the function of this acidic domain in more detail. In particular, we have studied its transactivation function in a chromosomal setting by reconstituting AhR-defective cells with chimeric AhR mutants and measuring the response of the native CYP1A1target gene to TCDD. Our findings reveal similarities, as well as notable differences, between the function of the acidic domain of AhR and that of previously characterized AADs.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism by which AADs increase transcription in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we have analyzed an AhR segment that exhibits transactivation capability and resembles an AAD in its primary amino acid sequence. In addition to using standard reporter gene assays to measure transactivation, we have studied the ability of AhR to transactivate a native chromosomal target gene. Previous studies in other systems imply that transcriptional activators interact with the general transcriptional machinery, either directly or via multivalent coactivators (31Torchia J. Rose D.W.

Structural analyses of the prototypical activator VP16, as well as other AADs, suggest that the protein-protein interactions involve a transition from random coil to α-helix with hydrophobic residues along one face of the AAD helix contacting the target protein (35Uesugi M.

Our studies of the AAD of AhR reveal notable differences between it and AADs in other systems.Our experiments reveal that the acidic segment of AhR contains two regions that contribute to transactivation. Both regions contain important acidic and hydrophobic residues, and the two regions function synergistically. From a mechanistic standpoint, synergy could reflect either of two scenarios. First, the two regions may contact different sites within a single target protein (such as a coactivator or general transcription factor). For example, the interaction of the transactivation domain of p53 with MDM2 displays this type of synergy (44Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two regions may interact with separate target proteins to produce synergy; for example, two consecutive LXXLL motifs in SRC-1 contact distinct subunits of a PPAR-γ homodimer (45Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Although its mechanism remains to be elucidated, the synergy we observe for transactivation by AhR resembles that in other systems where hydrophobic regions mediate interactions with target proteins.Our studies also implicate acidic side chains in transactivation by AhR. We envision that electrostatic interactions complement hydrophobic protein-protein interactions, because the acidic and hydrophobic residues that strongly affect function are located adjacent to each other. The finding that only certain acidic side chains are important for function suggests that these residues confer local charge to specific regions of the acidic segment of AhR. In this respect, AhR is distinctly different from transactivators whose function depends more on overall negative charge than on the positions of individual acidic residues (33Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 35Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L.

Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest that transcriptional activation domains are largely unstructured in solution but adopt an α-helical conformation upon interaction with their target proteins. Mutational analyses of the AADs of Pho4 (49McAndrew P.C. Svaren J. Martin S.R. Horz W. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (32Hi R. Osada S. Yumoto N. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35152-35158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the ETS family member ERM (41Defossez P.A. Baert J.L. Monnot M. de Launoit Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support this concept, because their capacity to form an α-helix correlates with their transactivation potential. In contrast, our studies of proline substitution mutants imply that the capacity for α-helix formation is not a major factor in transactivation by the acidic domain of AhR even though the potential for α-helix formation has been conserved across species. Furthermore, we note that although they prevent α-helix formation, proline substitutions maintain hydrophobicity, reinforcing our impression that hydrophobicity is more important than α-helicity for transactivation by the acidic segment of AhR. Thus, our studies reveal an interesting example of an AAD whose action at a mammalian chromosomal target gene does not require that it form an α-helix. This property distinguishes the AAD of AhR from those described previously.Another noteworthy difference between the acidic segment of AhR and other transcriptional activation domains is the absence of an obvious signature motif. For example, the acidic activators p53 (43Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and VP16 (35Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) contain FXXΦΦ motifs (Φ, hydrophobic residues), which are essential for function. Furthermore, Uesugiet al. (43Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have suggested that the FXXΦΦ motif is a general recognition sequence for the coactivator hTAFII31. Similarly, the activation domain of CREB binds to CREB-binding protein via a related motif, YXXIL (37Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AAD of AhR contains no comparable amino acid sequence. Furthermore, there is no obvious similarity between the amino acid sequences of R1 and R2 within the AAD of AhR. The absence of known signature motifs in the AAD of AhR implies that its interactions with target proteins are novel and differ from those described for other AADs. A more complete understanding of the interactions between the acidic segment of AhR and target proteins awaits structural studies. Because AhR is a prototypical bHLH/PAS transcription factor, its mechanism of transactivation might be representative of other members of this class of regulatory proteins. If so, future studies of the AhR system may generate insights into transactivation of genes involved in responses to hypoxia, circadian rhythms, development, and other pathways (17Gu Y. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar).Finally, our studies indicate that different mutations in the acidic segment of AhR produce quantitatively different effects on transactivation capability. If analogous mutations were to occur in human populations, we envision that they could account, in part, for genetic polymorphisms among individuals in their responsiveness to TCDD. Whether such polymorphisms would be associated with different susceptibilities to dioxin-induced disease is an interesting issue for future research. The halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin)1 is a widespread environmental contaminant that elicits both adverse and adaptive responses in animals and humans (1Safe S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 371-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Poland A. Knudson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). An intracellular protein known as the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates the biological effects of TCDD (3Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, their N-terminal segments mediate heterodimerization and DNA recognition whereas their C-terminal segments contain transactivation domains (12Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N.

Our studies of the AAD of AhR reveal notable differences between it and AADs in other systems.Our experiments reveal that the acidic segment of AhR contains two regions that contribute to transactivation. Both regions contain important acidic and hydrophobic residues, and the two regions function synergistically. From a mechanistic standpoint, synergy could reflect either of two scenarios. First, the two regions may contact different sites within a single target protein (such as a coactivator or general transcription factor). For example, the interaction of the transactivation domain of p53 with MDM2 displays this type of synergy (44Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two regions may interact with separate target proteins to produce synergy; for example, two consecutive LXXLL motifs in SRC-1 contact distinct subunits of a PPAR-γ homodimer (45Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Although its mechanism remains to be elucidated, the synergy we observe for transactivation by AhR resembles that in other systems where hydrophobic regions mediate interactions with target proteins.Our studies also implicate acidic side chains in transactivation by AhR. We envision that electrostatic interactions complement hydrophobic protein-protein interactions, because the acidic and hydrophobic residues that strongly affect function are located adjacent to each other. The finding that only certain acidic side chains are important for function suggests that these residues confer local charge to specific regions of the acidic segment of AhR. In this respect, AhR is distinctly different from transactivators whose function depends more on overall negative charge than on the positions of individual acidic residues (33Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 35Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L.

Mutational analyses of the AADs of Pho4 (49McAndrew P.C. Svaren J. Martin S.R. Horz W. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (32Hi R. Osada S. Yumoto N. Osumi T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support this concept, because their capacity to form an α-helix correlates with their transactivation potential. In contrast, our studies of proline substitution mutants imply that the capacity for α-helix formation is not a major factor in transactivation by the acidic domain of AhR even though the potential for α-helix formation has been conserved across species. Furthermore, we note that although they prevent α-helix formation, proline substitutions maintain hydrophobicity, reinforcing our impression that hydrophobicity is more important than α-helicity for transactivation by the acidic segment of AhR. Thus, our studies reveal an interesting example of an AAD whose action at a mammalian chromosomal target gene does not require that it form an α-helix. This property distinguishes the AAD of AhR from those described previously.Another noteworthy difference between the acidic segment of AhR and other transcriptional activation domains is the absence of an obvious signature motif. For example, the acidic activators p53 (43Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and VP16 (35Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) contain FXXΦΦ motifs (Φ, hydrophobic residues), which are essential for function. Furthermore, Uesugiet al. (43Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have suggested that the FXXΦΦ motif is a general recognition sequence for the coactivator hTAFII31. Similarly, the activation domain of CREB binds to CREB-binding protein via a related motif, YXXIL (37Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AAD of AhR contains no comparable amino acid sequence. Furthermore, there is no obvious similarity between the amino acid sequences of R1 and R2 within the AAD of AhR. The absence of known signature motifs in the AAD of AhR implies that its interactions with target proteins are novel and differ from those described for other AADs. A more complete understanding of the interactions between the acidic segment of AhR and target proteins awaits structural studies. Because AhR is a prototypical bHLH/PAS transcription factor, its mechanism of transactivation might be representative of other members of this class of regulatory proteins. If so, future studies of the AhR system may generate insights into transactivation of genes involved in responses to hypoxia, circadian rhythms, development, and other pathways (17Gu Y. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar).Finally, our studies indicate that different mutations in the acidic segment of AhR produce quantitatively different effects on transactivation capability. If analogous mutations were to occur in human populations, we envision that they could account, in part, for genetic polymorphisms among individuals in their responsiveness to TCDD. Whether such polymorphisms would be associated with different susceptibilities to dioxin-induced disease is an interesting issue for future research. The mechanism by which AADs increase transcription in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we have analyzed an AhR segment that exhibits transactivation capability and resembles an AAD in its primary amino acid sequence. In addition to using standard reporter gene assays to measure transactivation, we have studied the ability of AhR to transactivate a native chromosomal target gene. Previous studies in other systems imply that transcriptional activators interact with the general transcriptional machinery, either directly or via multivalent coactivators (31Torchia J. Rose D.W.

Type I deiodinase (DI) can catalyze the conversion to produce the bulk of serum 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine. Acting as a mimic of DI, a selenium-containing catalytic antibody (Se-4C5) prepared by converting the serine residues of monoclonal antibody 4C5 raised against T4 into selenocysteines, can catalyze the deiodination of T4 with dithiothreitol (DTT) as cosubstrate. The mimic enzyme Se-4C5 exhibited a much greater deiodinase activity than model compound ebselen and another selenium-containing antibody Se-Hp4 against GSH. The coupling of selenocysteine with the combining pocket of antibody 4C5 endowed Se-4C5 with enzymatic activity. To probe the catalytic mechanism of the catalytic antibody, detailed kinetic studies were carried out in this paper. Investigations into the deiodinative reaction revealed the relationship between the initial velocity and substrate concentration. The characteristic parallel Dalziel plots demonstrated that Se-4C5-catalyzed reaction mechanism was ping-pong one, involving at least one covalent enzyme intermediate. The kinetic properties of the catalytic antibody were similar to those of DI, with K m values for T4 and DTT of approximately 0.8 µm and 1.8 mm, respectively, and a V m value of 270 pmol per mg of protein per min. The activity could be sensitively inhibited by 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) with a K i value of ∼120 µm at 2.0 µm T4concentration. The PTU inhibition was progressively alleviated with the increasing concentration of added DTT, revealing that PTU was a competitive inhibitor for DTT.

The majority of T3 in plasma is derived enzymatically from 5′-deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) in the peripheral tissues rather than directly from the thyroid. The enzymes responsible for the deiodination of T4, the iodothyronine deiodinases, are a family of homogenous selenoenzymes. On the basis of their reaction and inhibition kinetics and substrate specificity, iodothyronine deiodinases are classified as three types, i.e. type I (DI), type II, and type III (4Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Hennemann G. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1986: 189-229Google Scholar). DI is expressed mainly in liver, kidney, and thyroid and is a selenoprotein of relative molecule mass ∼27 kDa with a selenocysteine (Sec) in the substrate-binding active site for optimum enzyme activity (5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The enzyme can carry out both 5′- and 5- deiodination of T4, to produce active T3 and inactive 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine (reverse T3), and has an apparent K m for T4 in the micromolar concentration range. The 5′-deiodinative reaction proceeds in a two-substrate ping-pong mechanism with reduced dithiols as cosubstrates. The catalysis of DI is sensitively inhibited by gold thioglucose, which can form a very stable complex with the Sec residue in the active site of this enzyme, or by PTU, which can interact with an oxidized enzyme-selenenyl iodide intermediate to form a dead-end enzyme-Se-S-PTU adduct (4Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Hennemann G. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1986: 189-229Google Scholar, 5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R.

DI is thought to be responsible for the major part of peripheral T3 production, as well as for the clearance of plasma reverse T3. Thus, the enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism and the physiological function of T4. Deficiency of DI will result in some serious thyroid diseases. Because of the low abundance of DI (5–20 pmol of DI/mg of liver or kidney microsomal protein) and the instability of the catalytic activity in detergents, etc., attempts to isolate and purify DI by conventional techniques of protein chemistry,e.g. affinity and immuoaffinty purification, have not been successful (8Mol J.A. Berg T.P.V.D. Visser T.J. Mol. cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 55: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. Biochem. Biophy. Res.

For this reason the studies of biochemical properties and structure-function of the enzyme have been impeded. Obviating the concern is the preparation of a catalytic antibody with deiodinase activity for mechanistic studies and therapeutic applications. In addition, the antibody-catalyzed selective deiodination (or dechlorination) also will have broad prospects for organic synthesis, etc. Most of the catalytic antibodies reported to date (11Lerner R.A.

However, the generation of antitransition state analogs cannot be directly used to generate the catalytic antibodies containing in its binding pocket an inorganic cofactor or metal ion. Furthermore, the reaction transition state structure of T4 and the detailed catalytic mechanism of DI are not clear, so it is very difficult to prepare the antibodies with deiodinase activity targeted to transition state analogs. Based on the initial mechanism of DI and the fact that a Sec in the active site of DI is indispensable to the optimum enzyme activity, we described the preparation of the first catalytic antibody with DI activity produced by chemical modification of the antibody. The study broadened the scope of antibody-catalyzed reactions and lays a foundation for further study on DI mimics.

Then the solution was added to 1.0 ml of a 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0 mg of BSA (or ovalbumin). 200 µl of 0.02% solution of glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer was added dropwise to the mixture solution over 30 min, and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was purified by G-25 column chromatography to give the antigen, either T4-BSA conjugate for immunization or T4-ovalbumin, one screening with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Because the hapten had a maximum absorbance at 325 nm, hapten density was determined by measuringA 325. mAbs were raised against BSA-T4 conjugate by using hybridoma methodology (15Koelher G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12660) Google Scholar, 16Mpoko C.N. Gordon D.B. Laing I. Corbitt G. Storey C.C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1985; 146: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In short, five Balb/c mice were bled to obtain control serum and then injected interpritoreally with a 0.2-ml suspension of a 1 mg/ml solution of the antigen mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant for the initial injection or Freund's incomplete adjuvant for subsequent injection. The mice were immunized with the same batch of T4-BSA conjugate at 2-week intervals for 4 orders and then hyperimmunized with the antigen in the absence of adjuvant 3 days before fusion. Hybridoma was prepared by fusion of immunized mouse spleen cell with myeloma cells (NS-1) with ethylene glycol ∼4000. Two lines of positive hybridomas were detected out by ELISA, cloned three times, and propagated in vitro andin vivo. Asciteses were gathered after intraperitoneal injection with the hybridoma, and the antibody titers were measured by ELISA. The monoclonal antibody 4C5 from higher titer ascites was purified by 45% ammonium sulfate fractionation (4 °C; pH 7.2), anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-52 (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20–400 mm NaCl, the antibody eluted in the 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and affinity purification on a HiTrap protein A column. The subtype of the monoclonal antibody 4C5 was determined with the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagent kit (from Sigma). The amount of protein was determined by the method of Lowery et al. (17Lowery O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar) in which BSA was used as standard. Antibody structure analysis has shown that many antibodies contain 3–4 serine residues in the variable region of light chain of antibody (18Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These serine residues can be converted into secysteines by chemical modification (19Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z.Q. Luo G.M. Zhao D.Q. Ni J.Z. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Bell I.M. Fisher M.L. Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3754-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, Se-4C5 was prepared by the method as described by Bell et al. (20Bell I.M. Fisher M.L. Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3754-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 5.0 mg of mAb 4C5 was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 50 mm, pH 7.0, phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and allowed to react with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (20 µl of a 21 mg/ml solution in acetonitrile) at 20 °C for 1 h. The resulting sulfonylated mAb 4C5 was isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 using 50 mm, pH 7.0, phosphate buffer as eluent. The protein fraction was concentrated, mixed with 200 µl of 1m sodium hydrogen selenide solution prepared according to the procedure of Klayman and Griffin (21Klayman D.L. Griffin T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 197-199Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under an inert atmosphere. The protein was separated from the reaction mixture on a Sephadex G-25 column eluting with 50 mm, pH 7.0, phosphate buffer and further purified by affinity chromatography on thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B. The selenium content of the catalytic antibody was determined by titrating the sodium borohydride-reduced protein with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (22Cavallini D. Graziani M.T. Dupre S. Nature. 1966; 212: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (23Janghorbani M. Ting B.T.G. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Selenium 3d (3/2, 5/2) electron signals were studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Alkα as a target (24Wendel A. Pilz W. Ladenstein R. Sawatzki G. Weser U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Chiu D. Tappel A.L. Millard M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purities of monoclonal antibody 4C5 and Se-4C5 were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide discontinuous gel electrophoresis. The dissociation constants of 4C5-T4 and Se-4C5-T4 complexes were measured by a competitive ELISA method (26Friguet B. Ohaniance L.D. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Se-4C5 was assayed for deiodination of T4 using a modification of the method of Visser et al. (27Visser T.J. Does-tobe I.V.D. Docter R. Hennemann G. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 0.1 µm Se-4C5 was preincubated in a total volume of 0.9 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mm DTT at 37 °C for 10 min. The T4 5′-deiodination was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of a 10 µm solution of T4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5% BSA and terminated by extracting with 3 volumes of 95% ice-cold ethanol. The extracted samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 ×g, and the supernatants were taken out and diluted 100-fold by the addition of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to both minimize the influences of ethanol on measurements of T3 and dilute the concentration of T3 into the range of measurement of the RIA. The amount of T3 generated was measured by a competitive RIA using a free [125I]T3 RIA kit (from Incstar corporation) following the manufacture instructions. Both the T4deiodinative reaction and the radioimmunoassay were performed in duplicate. All reaction time was generally chosen so that no more than 10% of the substrate T4 was consumed in the reaction. To subtract the no enzymatic degradation of T4 in the reaction course, the control experiments were performed by substituting 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for the solution of Se-4C5 in the same reaction conditions as described above. The kinetics of the Se-4C5-catalyzed reaction was investigated by the measurement of the initial reaction rate at several concentrations of one substrate while keeping the concentration of the other constant. For determination ofK m and V m values, the straight lines of double-reciprocal plots were drawn by the least-squares method. To investigate the effect of PTU on the conversion of T4 to T3, 100 µl of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in the incubation mixture was replaced by an equal volume of a solution containing the desired amount of the PTU. For the studies of the thermostability of Se-4C5, the Se-4C5-catalyzed 5′-deiodination of 1.0 µm T4 by 1.0 mm DTT was performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, containing 0.5% BSA) at 50 and 80 °C. The unit of initial velocity was expressed as pmol of T3 product/milligram protein/min in accordance with that of natural deiodinase activity. Each antigen molecule contained, on average, 24 haptens for BSA-conjugated T4 and 17 haptens for Ovalbumin-conjugated T4as determined by the absorbance at 325 nm. The BSA-T4complex was used to immunize Balb/c mice for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Two hybridoma cell lines, 2E7 and 4C5, stably secreted monoclonal antibodies against T4. Because of the higher antibody titer of 4C5 ascites fluid as determined by ELISA, hybridoma cell 4C5 was propagated and injected into mice for the production of ascites fluid, and mAb 4C5 was chosen for the preparation of catalytic antibody. After multiple-step purification, mAb 4C5 showed only a single band of light chain (26 kDa) and one heavy chain band (56 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern (Fig.1), manifesting that 4C5 had already been homogenous. The results of antibody-subtype analysis showed 4C5 was the subtype of IgG2b. The dissociation constant of antibody-T4complex was 5.4 × 10−8m, and the antibody cross-reactivity with T3 was less than 0.5%. Although the mAb 4C5 had the same hydrophobic binding pocket as DI, there was no catalytic group such as Sec in its binding pocket. Therefore, introduction of the catalytic group into the hydrophobic pocket of mAb 4C5 might exhibit catalytic activity. The serines of variable regions of 4C5 were activated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to produce sulfonylester of the serine hydroxyl group and then sulfonate was replaced with selenium to generate Se-4C5. To expiate the probable oxidation of sodium hydrogen selenide by air, the amount of sodium hydrogen selenide used in the reaction was in great excess over that of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride used. The modification reaction was carried out at 37 °C rather than 40 °C reported (20Bell I.M. Fisher M.L. Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3754-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to minimize the denaturation of antibody. A mouse mAb Hp4 raised against glutathione was also chemically modified in the same way as mAb 4C5. The selenium contents of the two protein were determined, following anaerobic reduction of the samples with sodium borohydride, by titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 1.90 equivalents of selenol were incorporated into each antibody Se-4C5 molecule, and 2.0 equivalents were incorporated into each molecule of Se-Hp4. The selenium 3d electron signals of Se-4C5 and Se-Hp4 determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were essentially identical, each emerging in 54.4 ± 0.3 eV region assigned to the selenium of Sec, suggesting that the selenium in Se-4C5 and Se-Hp4 was not bonded to oxygen but existed in the form of Sec like that of natural enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed Se-4C5 also had two bands representing a single light and heavy chain that exhibited the same mobility as these of 4C5 (Fig. 1). The dissociation constant of Se-4C5-T4 complex was 3.2 × 10−7m, slightly lower than that of 4C5. The catalytic efficiencies of ascites, 4C5, Se-4C5, Se-Hp4, and ebselen were investigated at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. Their initial rates of the reaction (corrected for spontaneous degradation of T4in the absence of catalyst) are shown in TableI. Among them, Se-4C5 (0.1 µm) exhibited the fastest reaction rate generating 1130 pmol/liter/min at 1.0 µm T4 and 1.0 mm DTT, whereas Se-Hp4 (1.0 µm) demonstrated a reaction rate of only 17 pmol/liter/min. Ebselen, ascites, and 4C5 all did not exhibit catalytic activity. Assuming that the initial rate had a first-order dependence on T4 concentration, these data indicated that Se-4C5 was at least 66-fold more efficient than Se-Hp4. The background rate was also determined in the same conditions. Results showed that T4 hardly reacted with DTT, generating T3 formation. Thus, the background rate was not of consequence on the catalyzed rate of T3 generation. The studies of thermostability of Se-4C5 manifested that Se-4C5 had a higher deiodinase activity at 50 °C than at 37 °C, but higher temperature (80 °C) inactivated Se-4C5.Table IReactive rates of several samples4C5 (0.3 µm)Se-4C5 (0.1 µm)Se-Hp4 (1.0 µm)Ebselen (5.0 µm)Ascite fluid (1.0 mg/ml)1-aAscite fluid of 4C5.V (pm/min)011301700Reactions were carried out with 1.0 µm T4 and 1.0 mm DTT in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C, and the concentration of T3 was measured by RIA as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Ascite fluid of 4C5. Open table in a new tab Reactions were carried out with 1.0 µm T4 and 1.0 mm DTT in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C, and the concentration of T3 was measured by RIA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To probe the mechanism by which Se-4C5 promotes the 5′-deiodinative reaction, detailed kinetic studies were undertaken. The initial rates for the T4 5′-deiodination by DTT were determined as a function of substrate concentration at 37 °C and pH 7.0 by RIA, varying one substrate concentration while the other was fixed. As seen in Fig. 2, at each concentration of DTT, product T3 formation showed saturation kinetics with respect to T4, and double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versusT4 concentration yielded a family of parallel lines, consistent with a ping-pong mechanism involving at least one covalent enzyme intermediate. A replot of the intercepts of these parallel lines at the yaxis (Fig. 2) versus the reciprocal of DTT concentration yielded the apparent maximal Michaelis constant for DTT and the V m of the reaction (TableII). Michaelis-Menten kinetics for T4 and DTT were also observed under all the conditions investigated. The apparent kinetic parameters obtained at several DTT concentrations were summarized in TableIII.

From the data in Table II and Table III, k max = 4.05 × 10−2 min−1, K T4 = 0.8 µm, and K DTT = 1.8 mm. Thusk max/K T4 = 5.06 × 104m−1min−1, andk max/K DTT = 22.5m−1 min−1. V0 stands for the initial velocity of the reaction, and [E] stands for the concentration of the mimetic enzyme. These data were reminiscent of those obtained for native 5′-deiodinase (28Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and revealed that the Se-4C5-catalyzed T4 5′-deiodination was a bisubstrate reaction of a ping-pong type. Comparison of the apparent kinetic parameters for natural enzyme (28Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Se-4C5 revealed that that theK m of native enzyme for T4 substrate was 6 times greater than that of Se-4C5, indicating that the affinity of Se-4C5 for T4 was higher than that of natural enzyme, but the thiol requirement for Se-4C5 was 3.6 times that for the liver homogenate (source of 5′-deiodinase) (28Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies of PTU inhibition of T4 5′-deiodinase have shown that exposure of liver or kidney homogenates to PTU lead to the persistent inhibition of the enzyme, and the degree of inhibition is increased if the exposure to PTU is performed under conditions favoring catalysis (i.e. in the presence of substrate and 37 ± 2 °C) (6Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additional studies suggest that the mechanism of persistent PTU inhibition involves the formation of an enzyme/PTU mixture by reaction of E-SeI intermediate with PTU. Because of the kinetic similarity of Se-4C5 and natural enzyme, the effect of PTU on T4 deiodination by Se-4C5 was investigated. Se-4C5 was incubated under N2 with several fixed PTU concentrations, 2.0 µm T4, and increasing DTT concentration at 37 °C. A family of straight lines with a point of intersection at y axial was obtained in double-reciprocal plots of T4deiodination rate versus DTT concentration at varying PTU concentrations (Fig. 3), indicating that PTU was a strong competitive inhibitor of DTT, with aK i value of approximately 120 µm. Thus, we suggested that PTU could also form stable Se-4C5-PTU adduct with reactive intermediate (Se-4C5-SeI), similar to that of type I deiodinase. The Sec residue and T4-binding pocket are both critical factors for the catalytic activity of DI. For example, the substitution of Sec by Leu results in the enzymatic inactivation of DI. In this report, we here utilized both essential factors for the preparation of a DI mimics. The association of the mAb 4C5, elicited against T4, with the Sec residue has led to the formation of the tailor-made catalytic antibody Se-4C5. To confirm the catalytic activity of Se-4C5, the relative efficiencies of Se-4C5, 4C5, ascites fluid, Se-Hp4, and the model compound ebselen were investigated at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. As seen from the initial rates of reaction measured by RIA in Table I, neither ascites fluid nor 4C5 exhibited catalytic activities when background rate was deducted. This suggests that the hapten-binding site of 4C5 was insufficient to catalyze the deiodination of T4 and that no natural deiodinase was present in ascites fluid and 4C5. Se-4C5 generated by modifying 4C5 exhibited deiodinase activity, suggesting that the catalytic group Sec also played a pivotal role in enzymic catalysis. In addition, the hapten-binding pocket of antibody also exhibited an important effect on its catalytic efficiency. Although Se-Hp4 and the model compound ebselen posed such a catalytic group, reduced selenium, like that of Se-4C5, they showed very poor catalytic efficiencies, which could be mainly attributed to the fact that they all did not have the special T4-binding pocket. Therefore, the hapten-binding pocket coupled with the catalytic group Sec bestowed the enzymetic activity on Se-4C5. The facts that the rate for deiodination of T4 was linearly proportional to Se-4C5 concentration and that its activity could be destroyed by heat denaturation of the protein further demonstrated that Se-4C5 was an active zymoprotein. As seen from the calculated dissociation constants, antibodies Se-4C5 and 4C5 exhibited high affinities for T4, reflecting that there existed strong interactions between the antibodies and the hapten. This may contribute to the decrease of activation energy of the reaction (deiodination of T4) in catalysis. The similarity of the dissociation constants of Se-4C5 and 4C5 for the hapten indicates that the three-dimensional structure of the modified protein was likely unaltered by the modification reaction. We further examined the kinetic property and the PTU inhibition of T4 5′-deiodination by Se-4C5. It could be determined from the results that the deiodinative reaction displayed a typical enzymatic feature (see Fig. 2) and that the relationship between reactive velocity and substrate concentration was subjected to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The characteristic parallel Dalziel plots revealed that the Se-4C5-catalyzed reaction mechanism was a of a ping-pong nature, which was identical to that of type I deiodinase (7Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Thus, the Se-4C5 reacted with one of the substrates (T4) to form a Michaelis complex that was followed by the dissociation to the first product T3 leaving a modified enzyme form (E-Se-I) containing a moiety (I) from the first substrate. The second substrate, DTT, interacted with the modified enzyme (E-Se-I) only after dissociation of the first product and reduced the oxidized enzyme with release of iodide. The whole course of deiodination of T4 was shown in Fig.4. An important characteristic used to distinguish DI from the other deiodinase is its marked sensitivity to inhibition by PTU, which is thought to be highly dependent on the selenium atom. The results in Fig. 3 showed that PTU competitively inhibited the deiodination activity of Se-4C5 in a similar manner to the competitive inhibition of DI. Thus, the kinetic characteristics of Se-4C5 and the PTU inhibition of Se-4C5 define the catalytic antibody Se-4C5 as a mimic of DI. At the present time, pure natural deiodinase is not available. Hence, we only compared the kinetic parameters for Se-4C5 with those reported (28Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for rat liver homogenate containing natural enzyme with the exception of the apparent V m, which could not be compared, because the quantity of natural deiodinase was uncertain in rat liver homogenate. The comparison of Se-4C5 with that of DI present in homogenates revealed that the specificity of Se-4C5 for T4 was higher than that of DI, and the thiol requirement of Se-4C5 was very different from that of the liver homogenate. The differences indicate a difference in structure between Se-4C5 and DI. Further studies for Se-4C5 will contribute to the understanding of both the structure and the reaction mechanism of deiodinases. We are indebted to Dr. Quanshi Wang and Dr. Di Yao at the Department of Nuclear Medicine of University of Bethune Medical Sciences for invaluable help in assay of T3 measurement.

Bayne E.K. Lohmander L.S. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, a precise understanding of the regulation of aggrecan expression is critical to investigating the mechanisms of normal development and of diseases that involve abnormalities of the extracellular matrix. The dynamics of transcriptional control of gene expression are complex and intriguing, such that it is often the context of transcription factors and DNA elements that determines the functionality of a regulatory region. It has been proposed that some transcription factors may have multiple domains, some specific for repression and others for activation (10Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions can influence the basal DNA-protein interactions observed in a regulatory region. Thus formation of protein complexes and how they interact with DNA may influence the transcriptional machinery that enables specific expression of genes at a precise time and in response to appropriate stimuli (11Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). An emerging paradigm is that there are a variety of mechanisms by which individual cis elements interact withtrans factors. The initial interaction with a ciselement may be a site of nucleation to which a series of other proteins are recruited, and it may then be this complex, rather than a single factor, that interacts with the RNA polymerase machinery. In fact, the DNA may act as a tether to enable localized and distal interactions between transcription factors. Recently, we reported (12Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) the cloning and sequencing of a 1.8-kilobase genomic fragment containing the 5′-flanking sequence of the chick aggrecan gene. By using transient transfections of chick sternal chondrocytes and fibroblasts with reporter plasmids bearing progressively deleted portions of the chick aggrecan promoter and enhancer region, we demonstrated tissue-specific promoter activity and identified a 420-base pair region in the genomic 5′-flanking sequence responsible for negative regulation of the aggrecan gene. Analysis of this nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of potential tissue-specific control elements including a consensus sequence found in the cartilage-associated silencers, CSIIS1 and CSIIS2, that were first characterized in the type II collagen promoter sequences, as well as numerous other potential ciselements (13Savagner P. Miyashita T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6669-6674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To continue our analysis of the chick aggrecan promoter and enhancer region, we have conducted DNase I footprinting assays, transient transfections, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with the 420-base pair region previously found to confer repressor activity and with native and mutated sub-sequences drawn from that region. These three complementary methodologies provide an integrated approach to understand better the regulation of the aggrecan gene, allowing us to determine the nature and extent of some actual protein-DNA interactions and clarify which cis elements, of the many predicted, were responsible for our previous findings. By using sequences characterized in these studies, we later assayed for the binding of previously defined transcription factors and characterized novel tissue-specific binding sites that eventually led to the identification of a novel factor that binds to the aggrecan promoter and enhancer region. 2E. W. Pirok III and N. B. Schwartz, unpublished data. Oligonucleotides were made with an Applied Biosystems 3808 DNA Synthesizer. Reagents for biochemical and molecular cloning experiments were of the highest quality available from commercial vendors. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs unless otherwise stated. T4 DNA ligase, T4 kinase, DNase I, and Klenow polymerase were from Promega. Taqpolymerase was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Altered Sites II kit from Promega was employed for oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis strategies, following the manufacturer's protocol. The Ag-1(+) genomic clone was used as a template sequence for the oligonucleotide-mediated alterations ofcis elements (12Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Ag-1(+) clone was denatured and annealed with a mutant oligonucleotide, an ampicillin-repair oligonucleotide, and a tetracycline-knockout oligonucleotide. Subsequent synthesis, ligation, and selection for ampicillin resistance were used to identify mutant constructs. Positive mutants were sequenced to ensure that the correct mutation was made.

(14Cahn R.O. Coon H.C. Cahn M.B. Wilt F.H. Wessels N.K. Methods in Developmental Biology. Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York1967: 493-530Google Scholar) and as modified by Campbell and Schwartz (15Campbell S.C. Schwartz N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2191-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cultures of fibroblasts were established from skin of day-14 chick embryos following trypsinization (15Campbell S.C. Schwartz N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2191-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at an initial density of 1.5 × 106/100-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon) in either F-12 medium (chondrocytes) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (fibroblasts) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml ascorbic acid (chondrocytes). The cells were permitted to attach to the dishes, and subsequent growth (2–3 days) was maintained by a complete change of the medium every 2 days (16Geetha-Habib M. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7300-7310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the day of transfection chondrocyte cultures were trypsinized, and single cells were suspended in F-12 medium, replated, and allowed to attach to the dishes for 3–4 h before treatment as described below. Standard protocols were used to purify nuclear proteins from either chick chondrocytes or fibroblasts. Briefly, cells from confluent monolayer or suspension cultures were scraped and collected into 50-ml conical tubes (Falcon). The cells were pelleted for 10 min in a JS-4.2 rotor at 3000 rpm, resuspended in five times the packed cell volume of phosphate-buffered saline (usually 15 ml), and then pelleted for another 5 min at 3000 rpm. The phosphate-buffered saline was poured off, and the pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) and allowed to swell for 10 min. The cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization, and the lysate was centrifuged at 3300 × g for 15 min. The cytoplasmic supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was suspended in a low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.02 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT); nuclear proteins were then extracted in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.2 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mmDTT). The nuclear extracts were used immediately for DNase I footprinting experiments, gel shift assays, or further purification procedures. Standard methods were followed for calcium phosphate transient transfections (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nohan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.39Google Scholar). Duplicate plates containing ∼5 × 106 cells (either chondrocytes or fibroblasts) received 20 pmol of a given plasmid construct to be assayed, and incubation continued for 36 h. Five μg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid were co-transfected with each experimental construct to correct for cell loss. Duplicate transfection sets were prepared three times, each time yielding similar results. Reagents for the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were purchased from Promega. Since both luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed, Reporter Lysis Buffer from Promega was used (RBL, E3971) to prevent the inhibition of β-galactosidase activity that occurs in buffers containing detergents such as Triton X-100. No deviations were made from the manufacturer's protocols for preparation of extracts from tissue culture cells and the enzyme activity assays. Three sample aliquots from each of the duplicate transfection plates were assayed. The enzymatic activity of luciferase was measured with a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Monolight 1500). The enzymatic activity for β-galactosidase was measured with a microplate reader (Dynatech) at 409 nm. Average luminescence values and standard deviations were determined for the set of six assays performed within each experimental group. Probes used for DNase I footprinting experiments were generated via PCR using the previously described genomic clone Ag-1(+) as template DNA, Fig. 1(12Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For probes 1 and 2, XhoI sites were introduced at the 5′-end of the amplified fragment, whereas BglII sites were introduced via the primers at the 3′-end. The defined 5′–3′ orientation of the cloned PCR fragments corresponds to the native 5′–3′ orientation of the Ag-1(+) clone sequence relative to the aggrecan gene. PCR fragments were purified using Qiaquick PCR Preps (Qiagen). Samples of purified and unlabeled PCR fragments were electrophoresed on agarose gels to determine sizes, and sequencing of the PCR products was done to exclude PCR artifacts in the probes. Approximately 0.3 μg of a given probe was digested overnight at 37 °C with the restriction enzyme BglII and then treated with 0.5 units of alkaline phosphatase. The digested PCR products were again purified using a Qiaquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). The purified double-stranded end-digested probes were end-labeled using [γ−32P]ATP and T4 DNA kinase according to standard protocols. The previously undigested end of each probe was digested for 2 h at 37 °C using the appropriate restriction enzyme (XhoI) to ensure that only one end of the probe contained a radiolabeled phosphate. The probes were then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, precipitated using standard protocols (12Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and then stored at 4 °C in TE8 buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). For each footprinting experiment ∼0.015 μg of end-labeled probe was added to 25 μl of binding buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmDTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 100 mm KCl) with the addition of 25 μg of nuclear protein from either chick chondrocytes or fibroblasts in 25 μl of dialysis buffer. Control samples that had no protein added included only 25 μl of dialysis buffer. Binding mixtures were kept at room temperature for 90 min. Prior to digestion with DNase I, 50 μl of 5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 was added, and the mixture was incubated for 60 s. Control lanes that contained no nuclear protein were digested with 0.06 units of DNase I, and lanes with nuclear protein were digested with 0.12 units of DNase I for 90 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 90 μl of 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml yeast RNA. Reactions were extracted with equal volumes of phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% EtOH. Precipitated DNA was washed once with 70% EtOH, and the pellets were resuspended in gel loading buffer. The products were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing reactions were done simultaneously for each DNA fragment and run next to the control footprinting reactions to match the observed footprints with the published sequence. 100 pmol of each single-stranded oligonucleotide complementary pair was incubated in annealing buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm MgCl2) at 90 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly for ∼1 h. Standard methods were employed to end label the resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides. Briefly, 10 pmol of probe was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in kinase buffer (Promega) containing 20 units of T4 kinase, and [γ−32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To stop the labeling reaction, 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA was added to the reaction, and the labeled probes were purified with a Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen) to remove the excess unincorporated [γ−32P]ATP. For each binding reaction, 20 fmol of the probe were incubated with varying amounts of nuclear protein (between 0.1 and 10 μg) for 30 min at 4 °C in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 1.5 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 375 mm KCl), 2 μg of dI-dC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 3.75 μl of 20% Ficoll, and water. For competition experiments, excess unlabeled double-stranded probes were added to the binding reaction (amounts ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 pmol, or as defined in the figure legend). The DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer. The Wisconsin Package (version 9, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) program FINDPATTERNS was used to scan the protected footprint sequences for cis elements listed in the Transcription Factor Database. Fig. 1 shows a representation of a portion of the 1.8-kb aggrecan gene genomic 5′-flanking sequence. The 420-bp region from −1200 to −780 relative to the most 5′ transcription start site was previously shown to play a negative regulatory role (12Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This sequence was searched against the Transcription Factor Database using the program FINDPATTERNS, and some of the resulting predicted cis elements embedded in that sequence are represented in the diagram. DNase I footprinting experiments were conducted using two PCR-generated, single-end32P-labeled probes (Fig. 1), which span 430 bp of sequence and overlap with each other by 18 bp. Each of these probes was incubated with nuclear proteins extracted from primary cultures of either day-14 chick sternal chondrocytes or day-14 chick fibroblasts. Fig. 2, A and B,shows the results of these experiments using probe 1 and probe 2, respectively. Probe 1 yielded three protected segments with chondrocyte extracts, designated footprints G–I, which spanned the sequences −1054 to −1020, −1015 to −996, and −960 to − 937, respectively (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Footprint G was observed with fibroblast extracts (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4), but the resultant protection was less than in parallel experiments utilizing chondrocyte protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2). Experiments using fibroblast extracts yielded no observable footprint in the chondrocyte-protein-protected sequence H under four different buffer conditions, as well as at other DNase I concentrations (data not shown). Finally, fibroblast extracts produced footprint I, with protection comparable to that obtained with chondrocyte extract. Two major segments of probe 2 were protected by fibroblast extracts, spanning the regions −878 to −831 and −808 to −791 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4); these protected sequences were designated as footprints J and K, respectively. One protected segment, footprint K, had greater DNase I protection in its 5′ portion using fibroblast versus chondrocyte extracts under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). The upper region of footprint J varied slightly; the protected region designated as J observed for fibroblast extracts was replaced by two smaller non-overlapping footprints that spanned the same overall region when chondrocyte nuclear protein was used. Similarly, another footprint, L (Fig. 2 C), was obtained using a third probe from sequence just 3′ of the probe 2, from −730 to −703 (data not shown). This segment was protected by both chondrocyte and fibroblast nuclear protein. Comparison of the protected sequences with the Transcription Factor Database search results determined that a number of previously definedcis element consensus sequences were contained within the observed footprint regions (Fig. 2 C). Footprint G included MalT_CS, H2A, P5, Aldosterone_CAP_box, D4(rev), and D1 sequences. Footprint H had an SP1_CS4 sequence in the reverse orientation. Footprint I contained a Zeste sequence, also in the reverse orientation. The large footprint J is composed of multiple sites, most importantly a CIIS2- (CACCTCC) containing sequence in addition to a MalT_malPp (TCCTCC) and a CK-8-mer sequence. Finally, footprint K contained a second MalT-malPp sequence. Sequence comparison among the protected sequences revealed several common motifs largely composed of various combinations of the bases thymine and cytosine. Both footprints J and K contain the sequence CTCCTCC (which includes the above-mentioned MalT-malPp site), and footprint J had two repeats of the sequence TCCCC, which occurs once in the footprint L sequence. Furthermore, J contained a CTTCAC sequence, whereas L contained the very similar sequence, CTTCAG, and both contained a CACCTCC sequence. The extent to which these protected sequences contribute to the previously reported repressor activity of this promoter segment was addressed by introducing mutations into the native 1.8-kb Ag-1(+) sequence, which preserved the nucleotide spacing but altered the bases putatively involved in nuclear protein binding. Alternating series of either As and Ts (poly(dA)·poly(dT)) or Cs and Gs (poly(dC)·poly(dG)) were substituted for the normal footprint sequences (Table I). Sternal chondrocytes and fibroblasts were transfected with these mutant sequences in reporter plasmid constructs; initial experiments suggested that the simple introduction of either a series of As and Ts or a series of Cs and Gs did not alter activity in itself nor did it matter which substitution sequence was used (data not shown). These experiments included use of either poly(A-T) or poly(G-C) at a given protected sequence mutation site with highly similar results. Use of these sequence blocs to mutate other locations in Ag-1(+) produced either the opposite or no effect on reporter expression. Finally, in the results described below, it was found that a given mutational sequence produced different effects depending on which protected sequence was mutated. In sum, effects of mutations correlated with their location and not with the type of sequence bloc used. Since the single, large protected sequence observed for footprint J with fibroblast extract appeared as two discrete regions when protected by chick chondrocyte protein, two mutations were made in the J sequence, mJ.2 that altered the nucleotides −878 to −86, and mJ.1 that altered the sequence spanning −860 to −830. The mutant construct mJ.2 ablated the CIIS2-containing sequence and the MalT_malPp consensus sequence, whereas the mutant construct mJ.1 removed only the CK-8-mer site. There is a high degree of similarity, and a 3-base overlap, between the CIIS2 and MalT_malPp sequences in footprint J. To evaluate these elements separately, we mutated the sequence that corresponds to footprint K, which also contained a consensus sequence for a MalT_malPp site but not the very similar CACCTCC sequence. A second observed CIIS2 sequence, located in footprint L, was mutated to determine to what extent that sequence alone was affecting activity, thus mK ablated a MalT_malPp site, mL removed a CIIS2 sequence, and mJ.2 mutated the composite sequence CACCTCCTCC. Transient transfections of chondrocytes or fibroblasts with the construct Ag-1(+) (the forward orientation of the 1.8-kb insert in the promoter/enhancer-free pGL-2-Basic reporter vector) were compared with Ag-1(+) constructs bearing the various footprint mutations. Mutations of the sequence described as footprint G had little effect on reporter expression in transfected chondrocytes when compared with the normal Ag-1(+) construct (Fig. 3 A); however, construct mG produced a 30% increase in luciferase activity compared with that for Ag-1(+) in transfected chick fibroblasts (Fig.3 B). Similarly, mutation of protected sequence H, which had an Sp1_CS4 site in the reverse orientation, had little effect in transfected chondrocytes, whereas reporter activity in transfected fibroblasts dropped nearly 25% when construct mH was compared with the normal Ag-1(+) construct. Disruption of the protected sequence I, which contains a Zeste-like sequence, caused a significant increase in reporter activity in both chondrocytes and fibroblasts, to nearly 400 and 175%, respectively. Alteration of the large protected sequence J caused substantial increases in luciferase activity in both transfected chondrocytes and fibroblasts. The construct mJ.2, which mutated the overlapping CIIS2 and MalT-maLPp sites, exhibited the highest increases in relative reporter activity, i.e. transfected chondrocytes showed an increase in luciferase activity of nearly 600%, and luciferase activity in transfected fibroblasts peaked at 230%. Removal of the CK-8-mer site, in construct mJ.1, increased relative reporter activity by nearly 400% in transfected chondrocytes but only 35% in transfected fibroblasts. Interestingly, both constructs mK and mL, which ablated separate MalT-malPp and CIIS2 sites, respectively, produced large reporter activity increases in both cell types, but neithe"
