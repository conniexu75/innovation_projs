https://openalex.org/W2048967691,"To explore the role of mitochondrial activity in the aging process, we have lowered the activity of the electron transport chain and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) synthase with RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans. These perturbations reduced body size and behavioral rates and extended adult life-span. Restoring messenger RNA to near-normal levels during adulthood did not elevate ATP levels and did not correct any of these phenotypes. Conversely, inhibiting respiratory-chain components during adulthood only did not reset behavioral rates and did not affect life-span. Thus, the developing animal appears to contain a regulatory system that monitors mitochondrial activity early in life and, in response, establishes rates of respiration, behavior, and aging that persist during adulthood."

To determine which brain regions support language processing at this young age, we measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging the brain activity evoked by normal and reversed speech in awake and sleeping 3-month-old infants. Left-lateralized brain regions similar to those of adults, including the superior temporal and angular gyri, were already active in infants. Additional activation in right prefrontal cortex was seen only in awake infants processing normal speech. Thus, precursors of adult cortical language areas are already active in infants, well before the onset of speech production."

Elevated carbon dioxide also increased NPP, but only as a single-factor treatment. Across all multifactor manipulations, elevated carbon dioxide suppressed root allocation, decreasing the positive effects of increased temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition on NPP. The NPP responses to interacting global changes differed greatly from simple combinations of single-factor responses. These findings indicate the importance of a multifactor experimental approach to understanding ecosystem responses to global change."

The ability to tune the interactions between the ultracold atoms by an external magnetic field is crucial to obtain the condensate and offers intriguing features for potential applications. We explore various regimes of condensate self-interaction (attractive, repulsive, and null interaction strength) and demonstrate properties of imploding, exploding, and non-interacting quantum matter."

We describe a means of establishing marine reserve networks by using optimization algorithms and multiple levels of information on biodiversity, ecological processes (spawning, recruitment, and larval connectivity), and socioeconomic factors in the Gulf of California. A network covering 40% of rocky reef habitat can fulfill many conservation goals while reducing social conflict. This quantitative approach provides a powerful tool for decision-makers tasked with siting marine reserves."
https://openalex.org/W2001626986,"By binding to agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), β-arrestins mediate homologous receptor desensitization and endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits. Recent data suggest that β-arrestins also contribute to GPCR signaling by acting as scaffolds for components of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Because of these dual functions, we hypothesized that the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction might affect the mechanism and functional consequences of GPCR-stimulated ERK activation. In transfected COS-7 cells, we found that angiotensin AT1a and vasopressin V2 receptors, which form stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes, activated a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK2 more efficiently than α1b and β2 adrenergic receptors, which form transient receptor-β-arrestin complexes. We next studied chimeric receptors in which the pattern of β-arrestin binding was reversed by exchanging the C-terminal tails of the β2 and V2 receptors. The ability of the V2β2 and β2V2 chimeras to activate β-arrestin-bound ERK2 corresponded to the pattern of β-arrestin binding, suggesting that the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex determined the mechanism of ERK2 activation. Analysis of covalently cross-linked detergent lysates and cellular fractionation revealed that wild type V2 receptors generated a larger pool of cytosolic phospho-ERK1/2 and less nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 than the chimeric V2β2 receptor, consistent with the cytosolic retention of β-arrestin-bound ERK. In stably transfected HEK-293 cells, the V2β2 receptor increased ERK1/2-mediated, Elk-1-driven transcription of a luciferase reporter to a greater extent than the wild type V2 receptor. Furthermore, the V2β2, but not the V2 receptor, was capable of eliciting a mitogenic response. These data suggest that the C-terminal tail of a GPCR, by determining the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex, controls the extent of β-arrestin-bound ERK activation, and influences both the subcellular localization of activated ERK and the physiologic consequences of ERK activation.

Agonist-occupied GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated by specialized G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Subsequent high affinity binding of arrestin to the GRK-phosphorylated receptor results in steric inhibition of receptor-G protein coupling. In addition, the two nonvisual arrestins, β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2, function as adapter proteins, binding to clathrin and the β2 adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex, and leading to targeting of GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits where they are internalized (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). Data obtained using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged β-arrestins and epitope-tagged GPCRs to visualize β-arrestin and receptor trafficking in live cells have demonstrated that most GPCRs exhibit one of two characteristic patterns of agonist-induced β-arrestin interaction that allow them to be separated into distinct classes (3Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Google Scholar). One class, represented by the β2 and α1B adrenergic receptors (ARs), and the μ opioid, endothelin A, and dopamine D1A receptors, binds to β-arrestin 2 with higher affinity than β-arrestin 1. For these receptors, the interaction with β-arrestin is transient. β-Arrestin is recruited to the receptor at the plasma membrane and translocates with it to clathrin-coated pits. Upon internalization of the receptor, the receptor-β-arrestin complex dissociates, such that, as the receptor proceeds into an endosomal pool, the β-arrestin recycles to the cytosol. The second class, represented by the angiotensin AT1a receptor (AT1aR), vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), and the neurotensin 1, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and neurokinin NK-1 receptors, binds β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 with equal affinity. These receptors form stable complexes with β-arrestin, such that the receptor-β-arrestin complex internalizes as a unit that is targeted to endosomes. The stability of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction influences the fate of the internalized GPCR. The β2AR, which binds β-arrestin transiently, is rapidly dephosphorylated and recycled to the plasma membrane, whereas the V2R, which binds β-arrestin stably, recycles slowly. Exchanging the C-terminal tails of these two receptors not only reverses the pattern of β-arrestin binding, but also reverses the pattern of receptor dephosphorylation and recycling (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Google Scholar). Recent data from yeast two-hybrid screens and from biochemical characterization of receptor-β-arrestin complexes have indicated that β-arrestins also have the ability to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, suggesting that they may additionally function in the recruitment of signaling proteins to GPCRs (5Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar, 6Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Google Scholar, 7Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Google Scholar). One potentially significant set of interactions is the binding of β-arrestins to components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, which allows them to act as scaffolds for localized mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (8DeFea K.A.

In KNRK cells, stimulation of the protease-activated receptor type 2 (PAR2) induces the assembly of multiprotein complexes that contain the internalized receptor, β-arrestin 1, Raf-1, and activated ERK1/2 (9DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Google Scholar). The formation of these complexes, which are sufficiently stable that they can be isolated by both gel filtration and immunoprecipitation, also affects the cellular distribution of activated ERK. Because β-arrestins are cytosolic proteins, the formation of stable complexes between β-arrestin and ERK leads to cytosolic retention of ERK activated by PAR2 receptors. Qualitatively similar results have been obtained for the AT1aR expressed in HEK-293 and COS-7 cells (11Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Google Scholar, 12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). AT1aR activation causes the formation of complexes containing the receptor, β-arrestin 2, and the component kinases of the ERK cascade: cRaf-1, MEK1, and ERK2. Upon receptor internalization, activated ERK2 appears in the same endosomal vesicles that contain AT1aR-β-arrestin complexes. Thus, the β-arrestins appear to play a dual role in GPCR signaling. They serve both to terminate G protein-dependent signals by precluding receptor-G protein coupling, and to confer novel signaling properties upon the receptor by acting as adapters or scaffolds for signaling proteins. Because of these divergent functions, we hypothesized that the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction might be a significant factor in determining both the mechanism of ERK activation employed by a GPCR and the functional consequences of ERK activation within the cell. To test this hypothesis, we have compared the relative efficiency with which GPCRs that form transient receptor-β-arrestin complexes (α1bAR and β2AR), and GPCRs that form stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes (AT1aR and V2R), activate a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK. We also compared the signaling properties of chimeric receptors, in which the C-terminal tail domains have been exchanged so as to alter the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction (V2β2R and β2V2R). We tested whether these chimeric receptors exhibited altered activation of β-arrestin-bound ERK, and whether changing the receptor-β-arrestin interaction altered the cellular distribution of activated ERK, the ability of ERK to activate transcription of an Elk-1 reporter, and the ability of the receptor to produce a mitogenic response. We find that the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes is associated with enhanced activation of β-arrestin-bound ERK, cytosolic retention of active ERK, and a reduced transcriptional and mitogenic response to GPCR stimulation. Moreover, this phenotype can be reversed by exchange of the C-terminal tail domain. These data suggest that the stability of the GPCR-β-arrestin interaction dictates the predominant mechanism of ERK activation and, thereby, the functional consequences of ERK activation following GPCR stimulation.

The V2β2R chimera contains the first 342 amino acids of the V2R (Met-1 to Cys-342) fused to the last 72 amino acids of the β2AR (Leu-342 to Leu-413), whereas the β2V2R chimera contains the first 341 amino acids of the β2AR (Met-1 to Cys-341) fused to the last 29 amino acids of the V2R (Ala-343 to Ser-371). The pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid encoding FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2 was created in the Lefkowitz laboratory. The pEGFP-N1 expression plasmid encoding GFP-ERK2 (9DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Google Scholar) was provided by K. A. DeFea and N. Bunnett (University of California, San Francisco). The pFR-Luc, GAL4-Elk-1, and pRL-tk-luc reporter plasmids were from Stratagene. HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HEK-293 cells stably expressing 1.5–2 pmol/mg of the HA-V2R or HA-V2β2R were generated by standard procedures using zeocin selection (0.4 mg/ml). HEK-293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturers instructions. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE as previously described (12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated overnight in serum-free growth medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin prior to stimulation. HEK-293 cells were used for confocal microscopy because of their favorable morphology for comparing the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane distribution of proteins. Subconfluent monolayers in 100-mm dishes were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-AT1aR, HA-V2R, HA-α1bAR, HA-β2AR, HA-V2β2R, or HA-β2V2R (8 μg/plate) along with GFP-β-arrestin 2 (2 μg/plate). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were passed onto collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes and serum-starved overnight. For visualization of HA epitope-tagged receptors, cell surface receptors were stained using a 1:500 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA IgG in serum starving medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with serum starving medium, stimulated as described in figure legends, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and again washed prior to examination. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens with dual line switching excitation (488 nm for GFP, 568 nm for rhodamine) and emission (515–540 nm for GFP, 590–610 nm for rhodamine) filter sets. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2 was performed following transient transfection of COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-AT1aR, HA-V2R, HA-α1bAR, HA-β2AR, HA-V2β2AR, or HA-β2V2AR (2 μg/plate) and GFP-ERK2 (1 μg/plate) with or without plasmid encoding FLAG-β-arrestin 2 (3 μg/plate), as indicated. Stimulation was performed as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 0.8 ml of glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin), and clarified by centrifugation. For determination of protein expression and total cellular phospho-ERK1/2, a 50-μl aliquot of each clarified whole cell lysate was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Approximately 50 μg of protein from each lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. To isolate β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2, bovine serum albumin was added to each lysate to a final concentration of 1%, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 20 μl of 50% slurry of monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose, with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with glycerol lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. For experiments involving the visualization of covalently cross-linked receptor-β-arrestin-ERK complexes, COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-V2R or HA-β2V2AR (6 μg/plate). Stimulations were performed at 37 °C in 4.6 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of 25 mmdithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Monolayers were agitated gently for 30 min at room temperature, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, to neutralize unreacted dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), and lysed in 0.5 ml of glycerol lysis buffer. 25-μl aliquots of clarified cross-linked detergent lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol, for electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions, respectively. The remainder of each lysate was agitated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% slurry of monoclonal anti-HA affinity agarose to immunoprecipitate HA-epitope-tagged receptor and any cross-linked proteins. After washing, immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting of FLAG-β-arrestin 2 was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG IgG. Immunoblotting of endogenous β-arrestins was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin. Endogenous ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2, and GFP-ERK2 and phospho-GFP-ERK2 were detected using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 IgG. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG was employed as secondary antibody. Immune complexes on polyvinylidene difluoride filters were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent and immunoblots were quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. For the separation of nuclear and extranuclear pools of endogenous ERK1/2, COS-7 cells on 100-mm plates were transfected with plasmids encoding either the HA-V2R or HA-V2β2R (2 μg/plate) and FLAG-β-arrestin 2 (0.5 μg/plate). Serum-starved cells were stimulated with vasopressin (1 μm) for 5 min. Monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 2 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were incubated on ice for 3 min to allow lysis, and an aliquot of the lysed cell suspension was removed prior to centrifugation for measurement of total phospho-ERK1/2. Lysates were then centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatants, containing a mixture of plasma membrane, microsomal vesicles, cytoskeleton, and cytosol, represented the extranuclear fraction. Pellets containing cell nuclei were washed in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and again pelleted at 500 ×g. Both the extranuclear and nuclear fractions were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and phospho-ERK1/2 was determined by protein immunoblotting. The purity of each fraction was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies to nuclear lamin B, retinoblastoma protein, and actin as described previously (12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). ERK1/2-dependent transcription was measured using an Elk-1 driven luciferase reporter system as described previously (12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells stably expressing either HA-V2R or HA-V2β2R receptors were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with GAL4-Elk-1 (1 ng/plate), pFR-luc (1 μg/plate), and pRL-tk-luc (20 ng/plate). The GAL4-Elk-1 plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the transactivation domain of Elk-1, pFR-luc encodes the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the GAL4 DNA binding element, and pRL-tk-luc encodesRenilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. One day following transfection, the cells were passed into 6-well dishes and serum-starved overnight. Stimulation with vasopressin (1 μm) was carried out for 6 h. Luciferase activities were determined using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Cells were extracted and assayed sequentially for firefly andRenilla luciferase activities. 5-μl aliquots of cell lysate were incubated with 50 μl of luciferin reagent and luminescence was recorded for 5 s. Stop and GloTMreagent (50 μl) was added and the specific luminescence fromRenilla luciferase was recorded for an additional 5 s. Firefly activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. HEK-293 cells stably expressing either V2R or V2β2R in 24-well plates were grown to subconfluence and serum-starved overnight. Subsequently, cells were incubated with either vasopressin (1 μm) or 2–10% fetal calf serum for 24 h at 37 °C. During last 4 h of incubation, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added. Cells were washed, DNA was obtained by solubilization in 2m guanidine in 50% phenol, and incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by scintillation counting. Oakleyet al. (3Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Google Scholar) have shown that most GPCRs exhibit one of two patterns of receptor-β-arrestin interaction. Fig.1 illustrates each of these patterns, using anti-HA rhodamine staining and GFP-β-arrestin 2 to track the cellular localization of an HA epitope-tagged receptor and β-arrestin, respectively. As shown for the HA-β2AR in Fig.1 A, in the absence of agonist, rhodamine-stained receptors (left panel, red) were confined to the plasma membrane, whereas GFP-β-arrestin 2 (middle panel, green) was diffusely cytosolic in distribution. An indistinguishable pattern of receptor and β-arrestin distribution was observed in unstimulated cells expressing the α1bAR, AT1aR, and V2R (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, 15 min of agonist treatment led to the coalescence of both the β2AR and α1bAR (left panels, red) and GFP-β-arrestin 2 (middle panels, green) in small puncta along the plasma membrane. This redistribution reflects the recruitment of β-arrestin to agonist-occupied GPCR and the accumulation of GPCR-β-arrestin complexes in clathrin-coated pits or nascent endosomes. Internalized receptors, represented by the intracellular accumulation of HA-rhodamine, did not colocalize with GFP-β-arrestin 2 (right panels), suggesting that the receptor-β-arrestin complex dissociates at or near the plasma membrane following receptor internalization. As shown in Fig. 1 C, a markedly different pattern was observed for the AT1aR and V2R. With these receptors, 15 min of agonist exposure led to removal of most of the HA-rhodamine-labeled receptors from the plasma membrane and their accumulation in large endosomal vesicles (left panels, red). An overlapping pattern of redistribution of GFP-β-arrestin 2 was observed (middle panels, green; right panels, yellow), indicative of the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes that remain associated throughout receptor endocytosis and sorting. In overexpression studies, we have previously demonstrated that β-arrestins coprecipitate with cRaf-1, MEK1, and ERK2, and that overexpression of cRaf-1 or stimulation of AT1aRs increases the phosphorylation of a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK2 (10McDonald P.H.

Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Google Scholar), suggesting that β-arrestins can function as scaffolds for the component kinases of the ERK1/2 cascade. We have also found that overexpression of β-arrestin promotes the targeting of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2, along with the AT1aR, to endosomal vesicles and away from the nucleus, resulting in a smaller nuclear pool of activated ERK1/2 and a reduction in the Elk-1-driven transcriptional response to angiotensin II stimulation (12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported for the PAR2 (9DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Google Scholar). However, both the AT1aR and PAR2 form stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes that remain associated following internalization of the receptor. Because GPCRs differ in their ability to form stable complexes with β-arrestins, we hypothesized that they might also differ in the extent to which they activated β-arrestin-bound ERK. To determine whether the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction affects the ability of GPCRs to activate a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK, COS-7 cells were transfected with HA epitope-tagged receptor, FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2, and GFP-tagged ERK2, and the phosphorylation state of GFP-ERK2 in FLAG-β-arrestin 2 immunoprecipitates was determined before and after agonist stimulation. GFP-ERK2 was employed in these studies to facilitate quantitation of ERK phosphorylation in the transfected cell pool, because its slower electrophoretic mobility allows it to be easily resolved from endogenous ERK1/2. GFP-ERK2 has previously been shown to undergo agonist-stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in a manner analogous to endogenous ERK (9DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, 5 min stimulation of AT1aR, V2R, and α1bAR expressed in COS-7 cells produced equivalent levels of whole cell GFP-ERK2 phosphorylation (top immunoblot). Under these conditions, FLAG-β-arrestin 2 and GFP-ERK2 were constitutively associated, as shown by their coprecipitation in both the presence and absence of agonist treatment (second and third immunoblots). The β-arrestin-bound pool of GFP-ERK2 was minimally phosphorylated in the absence of agonist. In response to stimulation of AT1aR and V2R, phosphorylation of β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2 increased substantially. In contrast, stimulation of α1bAR had little effect on the phosphorylation of β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2, despite a robust increase in the level of phospho-GFP-ERK2 in the whole cell lysate (bottom immunoblot). Fig. 2 B, provides a quantitative assessment of the relative extent of phosphorylation of β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2 following stimulation of each of the three receptors. While no significant difference was observed between the AT1aR and V2R, the α1bAR was 4–5-fold less efficient at activating the FLAG-β-arrestin-bound pool of GFP-ERK2. The AT1aR and α1bAR couple primarily to Gq/11 family heterotrimeric G proteins to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (13Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Google Scholar), whereas the V2R couples primarily to the Gs-adenylyl cyclase pathway (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the AT1aR and V2R form stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes, whereas the α1bAR interacts with"

The largest impacts produced global blankets of very hot ejecta, ranging in thickness from meters to hundreds of meters. Our simulations indicated that the ejecta warmed the surface, keeping it above the freezing point of water for periods ranging from decades to millennia, depending on impactor size, and caused shallow subsurface or polar ice to evaporate or melt. Large impacts also injected steam into the atmosphere from the craters or from water innate to the impactors. From all sources, a typical 100-, 200-, or 250-kilometers asteroid injected about 2, 9, or 16 meters, respectively, of precipitable water into the atmosphere, which eventually rained out at a rate of about 2 meters per year. The rains from a large impact formed rivers and contributed to recharging aquifers."

We used a chemical proteomic screen with a small-molecule probe to characterize the predominant cysteine proteases throughout the parasite life cycle. Only one protease, falcipain 1, was active during the invasive merozoite stage. Falcipain 1-specific inhibitors, identified by screening of chemical libraries, blocked parasite invasion of host erythrocytes, yet had no effect on normal parasite processes such as hemoglobin degradation. These results demonstrate a specific role for falcipain 1 in host cell invasion and establish a potential new target for antimalarial therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2120316410,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins, which accumulate in vascular tissues in aging and diabetes. Receptors for AGEs include scavenger receptors, which recognize acetylated low density lipoproteins (Ac-LDL) such as scavenger receptor class AI/AII (SR-A), cell surface glycoprotein CD36, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1. The broad ligand repertoire of these receptors as well as the diversity of the receptors for AGEs have prompted us to examine whether AGEs are also recognized by the novel scavenger receptors, which we have recently isolated from a cDNA library prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, such as the scavenger receptor expressed byendothelial cells-I (SREC-I); thefasciclin EGF-like, laminin-typeEGF-like, and link domain-containing scavenger receptor-1 (FEEL-1); and its paralogous protein, FEEL-2. At 4 °C, <sup>125</sup>I-AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA) exhibited high affinity specific binding to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing FEEL-1 (CHO-FEEL-1) and FEEL-2 (CHO-FEEL-2) with<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 2.55 and 1.68 μg/ml, respectively, but not to CHO cells expressing SREC (CHO-SREC) and parent CHO cells. At 37 °C, <sup>125</sup>I-AGE-BSA was taken up and degraded by CHO-FEEL-1 and CHO-FEEL-2 cells but not by CHO-SREC and parent CHO cells. Thus, the ability to bind Ac-LDL is not necessarily a prerequisite to bind AGEs. The <sup>125</sup>I-AGE-BSA binding to CHO-FEEL-1 and CHO-FEEL-2 cells was effectively inhibited by Ac-LDL and polyanionic SR-A inhibitors such as fucoidan, polyinosinic acids, and dextran sulfate but not by native LDL, oxidized LDL, or HDL.

We show that wild-type Rfz2 and a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane portions of the beta2-adrenergic receptor with cytoplasmic domains of Rfz2 also signaled through modulation of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Activation of either receptor led to a decline in the intracellular concentration of cGMP, a process that was inhibited in cells treated with pertussis toxin, reduced by suppression of the expression of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein) transducin, and suppressed through inhibition of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Moreover, PDE inhibitors blocked Rfz2-induced calcium transients in zebrafish embryos. Thus, Frizzled-2 appears to couple to PDEs and calcium transients through G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2036333800,"Sulfonation catalyzed by sulfotransferase enzymes plays an important role in chemical defense mechanisms against various xenobiotics but also bioactivates carcinogens. A major human sulfotransferase, SULT1A1, metabolizes and/or bioactivates many endogenous compounds and is implicated in a range of cancers because of its ability to modify diverse promutagen and procarcinogen xenobiotics. The crystal structure of human SULT1A1 reported here is the first sulfotransferase structure complexed with a xenobiotic substrate. An unexpected finding is that the enzyme accommodates not one but two molecules of the xenobiotic model substrate <i>p-</i>nitrophenol in the active site. This result is supported by kinetic data for SULT1A1 that show substrate inhibition for this small xenobiotic. The extended active site of SULT1A1 is consistent with binding of diiodothyronine but cannot easily accommodate β-estradiol, although both are known substrates. This observation, together with evidence for a disorder-order transition in SULT1A1, suggests that the active site is flexible and can adapt its architecture to accept diverse hydrophobic substrates with varying sizes, shapes and flexibility. Thus the crystal structure of SULT1A1 provides the molecular basis for substrate inhibition and reveals the first clues as to how the enzyme sulfonates a wide variety of lipophilic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2134760521,"APH-1 and PEN-2 genes modulate the function of nicastrin and the presenilins in Caenorhabditis elegans. Preliminary studies in transfected mammalian cells overexpressing tagged APH-1 proteins suggest that this genetic interaction is mediated by a direct physical interaction. Using the APH-1 protein encoded on human chromosome 1 (APH-11L; also known as APH-1a) as an archetype, we report here that endogenous forms of APH-1 are predominantly expressed in intracellular membrane compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum andcis-Golgi. APH-1 proteins directly interact with immature and mature forms of the presenilins and nicastrin within high molecular weight complexes that display γ- and ε-secretase activity. Indeed APH-1 proteins can bind to the nicastrin Δ312–369 loss of function mutant, which does not undergo glycosylation maturation and is not trafficking beyond the endoplasmic reticulum. The levels of expression of endogenous APH-11L can be suppressed by overexpression of any other members of the APH-1 family, suggesting that their abundance is coordinately regulated. Finally, although the absence of APH-1 destabilizes the presenilins, in contrast to nicastrin and PEN-2, APH-1 itself is only modestly destabilized in cells lacking functional expression of presenilin 1 or presenilin 2.

Analysis of Western blots expressing exogenous APH-1 with or without myc tags in HEK293 cells revealed that one antiserum (O2C2) specifically detected the longer isoform of APH-11 but did not detect the shorter isoform of APH-11 or APH-115 (Fig.2, A and B). This antibody also detected significant levels of expression of APH-11 in brain and kidney. This endogenous APH-1, immunoreactive band had an apparent molecular weight that is in good agreement with that predicted from the primary amino acid sequence of APH-11 and that is identical to that of the untagged APH-11L transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells as a positive control. These results indicate that, in contrast to nicastrin (22Arawaka S. Hasegawa H. Tandon A. Janus C. Chen F. Yu G. Kikuchi K. Koyama S. Kato T. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P. J.

To discover the native conformation of the APH-1 proteins and to examine the possibility that APH-1 proteins may form components of the presenilin·nicastrin complexes, we used glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation in cells expressing endogenous APH-11L. These studies revealed that, in digitonin-solubilized lysates, endogenous APH-11L co-fractionated with PS1 and nicastrin (Fig. 3). However, the distribution of APH-11L most closely resembled that of immature forms of nicastrin, although there was substantial overlap with both the distribution of mature nicastrin and PS1-NTF. As expected, solubilization with Triton X-100 causes the nicastrin·PS1·APH-1 complex to be completely disassembled (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the observation that APH-11L can be co-immunoprecipitated with both immature and mature forms of nicastrin (see below). These results also suggest that APH-11 is likely to be a component of both the immature and the higher molecular weight mature (functional) presenilin·nicastrin complexes (15Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.-M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To discern whether endogenous APH-11 interacts directly with presenilin and nicastrin, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in HEK293 cells expressing native presenilin, APH-1, and nicastrin proteins. Immunoprecipitation with pre-immune serum failed to bring down APH-11, PS1, PS2, or nicastrin. However, immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the N terminus of PS1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) brought down endogenous APH-11L and the mature form of nicastrin. Conversely, the reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-APH-11 antibodies (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) brought down stoichiometric quantities of APH-11L, PS1 holoprotein and PS1-NTF, PS2 holoprotein and PS2-NTF, and both mature and immature forms of nicastrin. The interaction of APH-11L with PS1 holoprotein was independently confirmed by analysis of anti-PS1 immunoprecipitation products from cells overexpressing the PS1 D385A loss of function mutant (Fig.4 B, lane 5). The PS1 D385A and PS1 D257A mutations and the equivalent mutations in PS2 were shown previously to generate only the intermediary, ∼180-kDa, immature, non-functional complexes containing holoprotein (25Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D.-M. Milman P. Fraser P. Haass C. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol.

Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D.-M. Milman P. Fraser P. Haass C. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparently larger amount of APH-11L co-immunoprecipitated with PS1 D385A compared with wild type PS1 (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 4 and5), likely reflects the much greater and unregulated abundance of the PS1 D385A holoprotein and does not imply a preferential interaction of APH-11L with presenilin holoproteins. Although it is not clear what the intermolecular binding interactions are within the presenilin complexes, analysis of APH-11L co-immunoprecipitation products in cells expressing mutant nicastrin molecules suggests that APH-11L may preferentially bind directly to immature nicastrin in the ER. Thus, in cells expressing the nicastrin Δ312–369 mutant, APH-11L co-immunoprecipitates the mutant nicastrin molecule but not PS1 (Fig. 4 B,lane 9). Significantly, the nicastrin Δ312–369 mutant blocks trafficking and maturation of nicastrin in the ER, inhibits interaction of nicastrin with PS1, and causes loss of function of the presenilin·nicastrin complex. Because we were unable to generate antibodies of acceptable quality to APH-11S and to APH-115, we examined the interactions of these proteins with PS1 and nicastrin using immunoprecipitation studies in cell lines stably expressingmyc-tagged APH-11S, APH-11L, or APH-115. Anti-PS1 antibodies immunoprecipitated stoichiometric quantities of APH-11S, APH-11L, and APH-115 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 5–7). The reciprocal immunoprecipitations using the anti-mycmonoclonal antibody revealed that APH-11S, APH-11L, and APH-115 all co-immunoprecipitated PS1, PS2, mature nicastrin, and immature nicastrin (Fig. 4 D,lanes 6–8). However, it was also apparent that small quantities of endogenous APH-11L co-immunoprecipitate with the exogenous myc-tagged APH-11S and APH-115 (Fig. 4 D, lane 7). This interaction was confirmed by the reciprocal immunoprecipitation. Thus, the myc-tagged APH-115 could be detected in the immunoprecipitation products when endogenous APH-11L was immunoprecipitated with antibody O2C2 (which does not detect APH-115) (Fig. 4 E, lane 4). Inspection of the levels of endogenous APH-11L in cell lines overexpressing APH-11S, APH-11L, or APH-115 also revealed that endogenous APH-11L expression was suppressed by the overexpression of the exogenous APH-1 (Fig. 4 D, in second panel from the top, compare the signal intensities for the endogenous APH-11Lband in lanes 2–4 with that in vector-transfected cells in lane 1). Several conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, APH-1 isoforms interact with both mature and immature forms of nicastrin and the presenilins, and the overall abundance of APH-1 proteins is tightly regulated (presumably because of competition for binding to the same, limited-abundance components within the presenilin·nicastrin complex). Second, our IP data, at least in cells overexpressing individual APH-1 proteins, suggest that they may directly interact physically with each other, in contrast to PS1 and PS2, which do not physically interact but which are capable of displacing each other from their native complexes, again by competing for the same shared limiting cofactors (20Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The absence of a 1:1 ratio of APH-11L to APH-11S or APH-115 in the immunoprecipitation products of cells overexpressing APH-1 proteins raises the possibility that the co-precipitation may be artifactual. However, the fact that overexpression of any one member of the APH-1 family reduces the level of expression of the other APH-1 protein family members (by a “displacement effect”) provides an equally plausible explanation for the absence of a 1:1 stoichiometry. This issue will be best resolved when antibodies specific to APH-11S or APH-115 become available, allowing analysis of endogenous APH-11S or APH-115. The presenilin proteins and nicastrin are components of high molecular weight, membrane-bound protein complexes that co-purify in cell-free systems with γ-secretase and ε-secretase activity (17Li Y.-M.

These studies reveal that functionally active complexes were recovered and contained APH-1 proteins regardless of whether they were purified by anti-PS1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, lane 1), immunoprecipitation of the endogenous APH-11L (Fig. 5,lanes 6 and 7), or immunoprecipitation of exogenous APH-11l-myc, APH-11S-myc, or APH-115-myc in transfected cell lines (Fig. 5,lanes 2–5). The intracellular distribution of endogenous APH-11L was investigated using both biochemical methods in HEK293 cells and confocal imaging in KNS-42 human glioma cell line (27Takeshita I. Sawa H. Nakamura T. Kuramitsu M. Kitamura K. Fukui M. Acta Neuropathol. 1990; 79: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On iodixanol gradient fractionation of lysates from native HEK293 cells, endogenous APH-11L was broadly co-distributed across the gradient but co-fractionated with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (BiP) andcis-Golgi apparatus (GM130) (Fig.6). The results of these biochemical studies were supported by confocal imaging studies of endogenous APH-11L in KNS-42 glioma cell lines, which showed a diffuse, vesicular, perinuclear distribution of APH-11L immunoreactivity that co-localized best with markers of thecis-Golgi (GM130) (Fig. 7). These data are in agreement with the observed interaction between APH-11L and both immature and mature forms of nicastrin and the presenilins. However, a significant amount of the APH-11L immunoreactivity decorates vesicular intracellular structures that do not contain either secretory pathway markers or presenilin/nicastrin immunoreactivity.Figure 7APH-11L fractionates in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi.KNS-42 glioma cells were investigated by confocal microscopy after being prepared, fixed, and co-stained with anti-APH-11 antibody (O2C2) and anti-BiP (StressGen; a marker of the ER), anti-GM130 antibody (Transduction Laboratories; a marker of the cis-Golgi), anti- TGN38 antibody (Transduction Laboratories; a marker of the trans-Golgi network), or anti-PS1 (NT1) antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” APH-11L staining shows best co-localization with GM130 and BiP, but there is considerable APH-11L immunoreactivity that is independent of any marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The functional role of APH-1 in the nicastrin·presenilin complexes cannot be deduced from its primary amino acid sequence.

The absence of PS1 does reduce the endogenous levels of APH-11L (Fig.8). This reduction is independent of age, being equivalent in 2-month-old (Fig. 8), as well as 6-day-old and 3-month-old, PS1−/− mice. However, unexpectedly, in PS1−/− mouse brain, the degree of reduction in endogenous APH-11L is small compared with the reported reduction in nicastrin levels (28Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D.

Taken together, our results suggest that APH-11L is likely to play an important role in the early maturation of the presenilin·nicastrin complexes, possibly as the initial scaffold molecule. This conclusion is supported by the localization of APH-11L in the early secretory pathway (but also in some as yet uncharacterized perinuclear vesicular structures), its interaction with immature and mature forms of presenilins and nicastrin proteins, its comparative stability in the absence of the presenilins, and the dependence of the presenilins and nicastrin on the prior presence of APH-11L."
https://openalex.org/W2024893022,"Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) is a critical activator of tumor lymphangiogenesis that recently has been strongly implicated in the tumor metastasis process. In this study, we identified that HRG-β1 stimulated up-regulation of VEGF-C mRNA and protein of human breast cancer cells in a dosage- and time-dependent manner and that this up-regulation was <i>de novo</i> RNA synthesis-dependent. The HRG-β1-induced increase in VEGF-C expression was effectively reduced by treatment with Herceptin, an antibody specifically against HER2. Also, when HER2 was overexpressed in MCF-7 cells that resulted in an evident increase in the VEGF-C level, suggesting an essential role of HER2 in mediating VEGF-C up-regulation by HRG-β1. NF-κB has been shown to be probably involved in interleukin-1β- or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced VEGF-C mRNA expression in human fibroblasts. Here we found that HRG-β1 could stimulate NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity via the IκBα phosphorylation-degradation mechanism. Blockage of the NF-κB activation cascade caused a complete inhibition of the HRG-β1-induced elevation of VEGF-C. In promoter-reporter assay, the luciferase activities of the reporter constructs, including the putative NF-κB site deleted and mutated form were significantly reduced after HRG-β1 treatment as compared with the 1.5-kb VEGF-C promoter. Although investigating the upstream kinase pathway(s) involved in HRG-β1-elicited NF-κB activation and VEGF-C up-regulation, we found that HRG-β1 could activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in MCF-7. However, only SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK), not PD98059 nor LY294002, blocked the up-regulation of VEGF-C by HRG-β1. A similar inhibition in VEGF-C expression was obtained by cell transfection with dominant-negative p38 (p38AF). Interestingly, the HRG-β1-induced NF-κB activation cascade was also effectively blocked by SB203580 treatment or p38AF transfection. Our data thus suggests that HRG-β1 stimulated a NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of VEGF-C through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in human breast cancer cells."

Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Because p300 is capable of binding to CREB (21Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montiminy M. Nature. 1994; 70: 226-229Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar), C/EBPβ (22Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB (23Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), it is likely to be a major co-activator for COX-2 transcriptional activation. However, there was little reported data about p300 binding to COX-2 promoter, nor was there information about p300 acetylation of COX-2-bound transactivators. In this study, we determined p300 interaction with transactivators bound to the core COX-2 promoter region and assessed the role of p300 HAT in regulating COX-2 transcriptional activity in human fibroblasts stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Our results show that TNFα up-regulated binding of p50/p65 NF-κB, which correlated with enhanced p300 recruitment to the promoter complex. Deletion mutation of p300 HAT reduced p300 recruitment and severely attenuated its ability to enhance basal and TNFα-induced COX-2 promoter activity. Our results further show that p300 acetylated p50 NF-κB but not p65, C/EBPβ, or CREB-2. These findings indicate that p300 mediates and regulates COX-2 transactivation by multiple mechanisms including a selective acetylation of p50 NF-κB. A promoter region of human COX-2 gene (−891 to +9 from the transcription start site) was constructed into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 as previously described (8Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The expression vectors containing full-length p300 (pCL.p300) and its HAT deletion mutant (CL.p300ΔHAT, Δ1472–1522) (19Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Joan Boyes. The E1A expression vector (24Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Neill S.D. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2702-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Pardip Raychaudhuri. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFb) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of an antibiotic-antimycotic solution. For all experiments, 80–90% confluent cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in fresh medium in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TNFα (Sigma), 100 nmof phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), or 2 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 026:B6, Sigma) at 37 °C for 4 h. After washing with chilled phosphate-buffered saline three times, the cells were harvested and processed to prepare cell lysates or nuclear extracts. All of the tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The transfection procedure was performed as previously described (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and 4 μg of luciferase expression constructs were mixed, and the mixture was slowly added to each well of HFb grown in a 6-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells were washed, incubated in serum-free medium, and treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml). The expressed luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (TD-20/20). To evaluate the effect of p300 or p300 ΔHAT on COX-2 promoter activation, 2 μg of pCL.p300, pCL.p300 ΔHAT, or pCL.vector plus 4 μg of luciferase expression constructs were mixed with 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent, and the mixture was added slowly to cells cultured in a 6-well plate. To evaluate the effect of p300 overexpression on p50 acetylation or binding, 10 μg of pCL constructs were mixed with 25 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent, and the mixture was added to cells cultured in a 10-cm dish. Co-transfection of E1A and p300 was performed by mixing 4 μg of E1A plasmid construct with 6 μg of p300 construct and 25 μl of LipofectAMINE, and the mixture was slowly added to ∼90% confluent cells in serum-free medium in a 10-cm dish and incubated for 3 h. 10% fetal bovine serum was added and incubated for an additional 21 h. The cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to the addition of TNFα or vehicle control. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described with minor modifications (25Deng W.-G. Saunders M.A. Gilroy D.W. He X.-Z. Yeh H. Zhu Y. Shtivelband M.I. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-450, 0.5% sodium deoxycholae, and 0.1% SDS. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and boiled for 5 min. The protein concentration was determined. The lysate proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 4–15% SDS-PAGE minigel (Bio-Rad) and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were probed with a specific rabbit polyclonal anti-p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HFb by a method previously described (26Liou J.-Y. Deng W.-G. Gilroy D.W. Shyue S.-K. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34975-34982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 800 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against p300, c-Jun, CREB-2, C/EBPβ, p50, or p65 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml each overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz) was then added for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaC1, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Control immunoprecipitation was performed with a nonimmune rabbit normal immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz). Binding of p300 to COX-2 promoter DNA sequence was assayed by a technique recently described (12Zhu Y. Saunders M. Yeh H. Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 80–90% confluent HFb were incubated in serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 4 h before the nuclear extracts were prepared. The biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by integrated DNA technologies based on human COX-2 promoter sequence −30 to −453 (8Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A nonrelevant biotinylated sequence 5′-AGAGTGGTCACTACCCCCTCTG-3′ was included as a control. The binding assay was performed by mixing 600 μg of HFb nuclear extract proteins, 6 μg of biotin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides, and 60 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (4%) with 70% slurry. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. The beads were pelleted and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times. The binding proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis probed with specific antibodies. The assay was done as described with minor modifications (27Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). 80–90% confluent HFb were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. 1% formaldehyde was added to the culture medium, and after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were sonicated five times for 10 s each time, and the debris was removed by centrifugation. One-third of the lysate was used as DNA input control. The remaining two-thirds of the lysate were diluted 10-fold with a dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) followed by incubation with antibodies against p300, c-Jun, C/EBPβ, CREB-2, p50, p65 NF-κB, or a nonimmune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by using protein A/G plus agarose beads. The precipitates were extensively washed and incubated in an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 20 min. Cross-linking of protein-DNA complexes was reversed at 65 °C for 5 h, followed by treatment with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 3 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted three times with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using specific COX-2 promoter primers: 5′ primer,−709CTGTTGAAAGCAACTTAGCT−690, and 3′ primer−32AGACTGAAAACCAAGCCCAT−51. The resulting product of 678 bp in length was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. p50, p65, C/EBPβ, or CREB-2 in nuclear extracts was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were collected by using protein A/G plus agarose beads. After extensive washing the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and acetylated transactivators were detected on Western blots using a monoclonal antibody against acetylated lysine (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). To determine whether p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter-transactivator complex was altered by TNFα stimulation, we evaluated p300 binding in unstimulated as well as TNFα-stimulated HFb by ChIP. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a p300 antibody, and a COX-2 promoter-enhancer region (−32 to −709) containing the essential binding sites for promoter activation was amplified by PCR. Vector-transfected HFb, like native HFb, shows trace p300 binding at basal state that was increased by TNFα treatment (Fig. 1). ChIP assays using specific transactivator antibodies also detected binding of c-Jun, CREB-2, C/EBPβ, p50, and p65 NF-κB to the core COX-2 promoter region in chromatin structure in unstimulated cells, and TNFα treatment resulted in a significant increase only in p50 and p65 NF-κB binding (Fig. 1). Binding of p300 and transactivators to COX-2 promoter was specific as immunoprecipitation with a normal rabbit IgG did not show detectable COX-2 promoter fragment (Fig. 1). We next used the streptavidin-agarose pull-down assay, which provides quantitative information of transactivator binding, to evaluate the effect of TNFα on transactivator and p300 binding to a biotinylated COX-2 promoter sequence (−453 to −30). Nuclear extracts from HFb treated with and without TNFα were incubated with the biotinylated probe and streptavidin-agarose beads. Transactivators and p300 present in the complex were analyzed by Western blots. Consistent with the ChIP assays, c-Jun, CREB-2, C/EBPβ, and p50/p65 NF-κB as well as p300 were detected in resting cells, and only p300 and p50/p65 NF-κB binding was increased by TNFα stimulation (Fig. 2). Interaction of p300 with COX-2 promoter-bound transactivators was determined by immunoprecipitation of nuclear extract proteins with antibodies against c-Jun, CREB-2, C/EBPβ, p50, p65, or nonimmune IgG and analysis of p300 in the complex by Western blots. p300 was co-precipitated with each of the transactivators in resting and TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 3 a). p300 complexion with each transactivator tended to be increased by TNFα. However, quantitation of binding is difficult because of large p300 molecular mass and slow mobility in gel electrophoresis. Interaction of p300 with these transactivators was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of nuclear extract proteins with anti-p300 antibodies and identification of transactivators by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 b). Together, these results provide direct evidence for recruitment and binding of p300 to COX-2 promoter in resting cells and an up-regulation of p300 binding as a result of increased p50/p65 binding to the promoter following TNFα stimulation. HFb expressed a low basal level of p300 (Fig. 4). Transient transfection of p300 increased its level, which was accompanied by a large increase in basal COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 5), a result consistent with the reported data (12Zhu Y. Saunders M. Yeh H. Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Subbaramiah K. Lin D.T. Hart J.C. Dannenberg A.-J. J.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2522-2530PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of a p300 HAT deletion mutant by transient transfection to a level similar to that of the overexpressed wild type (WT) protein also increased the basal COX-2 promoter activity, but the increase was only about 30% of that induced by WT p300 (Fig. 5). TNFα did not significantly increase native or transduced p300 levels (Fig. 4). However, p300 overexpression augmented COX-2 promoter activity stimulated with TNFα, and this augmenting effect was greatly attenuated when p300 HAT domain was deleted (Fig. 5). Because the HAT domain of p300 is situated close to transactivator binding domains, its deletion (Δ1472–1522) may influence p300 binding. We therefore compared recruitment of WT and ΔHAT p300 to the biotinylated probe by the streptavidin bead pull-down assay. The ΔHAT mutant did not bind as well as WT p300, and its binding was close to the basal p300 binding (Fig. 6). Together, these results suggest that p300 plays a major role in regulating COX-2 promoter activity, and its HAT activity is crucial for the regulation of COX-2 transactivation and p300 recruitment.Figure 5p300 HAT deletion mutation attenuated COX-2 promoter activity. HFb were transfected with WT p300, ΔHAT, or vector followed by treatment with or without TNFα.

In this study, we investigated whether it acetylates COX-2 promoter-bound transactivators. p50, p65, CREB-2, and C/EBP transactivators were immunoprecipitated with their respective antibodies, and the acetylated proteins were detected by Western blots using an antibody specific for acetylated lysine. A low level of acetylated p50 was detected at basal state and was increased by TNFα stimulation (Fig. 7 a). Neither p65 nor other transactivators were acetylated. Acetylated p50 was increased slightly by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm) for 4 h and was significantly increased by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (2 μg/ml) for 4 h (Fig. 7 b). To determine whether p50 acetylation was mediated by p300, we overexpressed WT or ΔHAT p300 and assayed p50 acetylation. At the basal state, p300 transfection increased p50 acetylation, whereas ΔHAT caused a much less increase (Fig. 8 a). p300 overexpression augmented TNFα-induced p50 acetylation, which was attenuated by HAT deletion mutation (Fig. 8). As expected, p50 protein levels at basal state were low and were increased by TNFα stimulation. Neither p300 nor p300 ΔHAT transfection altered p50 protein levels (Fig. 8 b).Figure 8p300 overexpression increased p50 acetylation. Nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p50 antibody. Acetylated p50 (Ac-p50, a) and total p50 (b) were analyzed by Western blots using an anti-acetylated lysine antibody and an anti-p50 antibody, respectively. The upper panels show a representative Western blot, and thelower panels show densitometric analysis of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether p50 acetylation was correlated with an increased p50 binding to the COX-2 promoter, we measured p50 binding to the biotinylated COX-2 promoter in HFb transduced by WT, ΔHAT, or its control vector. At the basal state, p300 overexpression increased p50 binding by more than 2-fold, whereas ΔHAT overexpression exerted a lesser increase (Fig. 9). TNFα increased p50 binding, which was augmented by WT but not ΔHAT p300 overexpression (Fig. 9). ChIP assays were performed to evaluate the effect of p300 overexpression on p50 binding to chromatin COX-2 promoter region. Corresponding to the results of in vitrobinding experiments shown in Fig. 9, overexpression of wild type p300 augmented p50 binding to COX-2 promoter region in the chromatin structure of resting and TNFα-stimulated cells (Fig. 10). ΔHAT overexpression attenuated the increase in p50 binding (Fig. 10).Figure 10p300 overexpression increased p50 binding to chromatin COX-2 promoter.

Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), we evaluated its effect on p50 acetylation and binding. Its overexpression suppressed COX-2 promoter activities stimulated by TNFα and p300 overexpression (data not shown). Overexpression of E1A by transient transfection abrogated p50 acetylation induced by p300 overexpression in the presence or absence of TNFα without altering the p50 level (Fig. 11). Inhibition of p50 acetylation by E1A was correlated with reduction of p50 binding to a COX-2 promoter probe (Fig. 12 a) and to the chromatin COX-2 promoter region (Fig. 12 b).Figure 12Inhibition of p50 binding to naked COX-2 promoter (a) and chromatin COX-2 promoter (b). The binding assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control probe is a 22-bp biotinylated nonrelevant sequence. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Results from this study show a low level of p300 recruited to the COX-2 promoter-bound transactivators in resting human fibroblasts. p300 recruitment was enhanced in cells treated with TNFα and further augmented by p300 overexpression. Enhanced p300 binding was correlated with an up-regulation of COX-2 promoter activities. These enhancing activities of p300 were abrogated by E1A, an inhibitor of p300. These results indicate that p300 plays a crucial role in regulating COX-2 transcription. Our findings further indicate that p300-mediated COX-2 transcriptional activation depends on HAT. Deletion of the HAT domain resulted in a more than 60% reduction in COX-2 promoter activity induced by p300. p300 HAT is capable of acetylating the N-terminal lysine residues of core histones, thereby modifying the chromatin structure (15Shikama N. Lyon J. LaThange N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 16Ciles R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H.

This property of p300 is likely contributing to accessibility of COX-2 promoter regulatory elements for transactivator binding. In this study, our results shed light on another important property of p300 that enhances NF-κB dependent COX-2 transcription. Our results indicate that p300 HAT is capable of acetylating p50, thereby increasing p50/p65 NF-κB binding to COX-2 promoter. p300 has previously been shown to acetylate p53 (19Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and GATA (20Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of p300-mediated p50 acetylation under physiological conditions. Interestingly, p50 acetylation by p300 was demonstrated as a mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus-1 replicates in host lymphocytes (29Furia B. Deng L. Wu K. Baylor S. Kehn K. Li H. Donnelly R. Coleman T. Kashanchi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4973-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Binding of host p50/p65 NF-κB to a viral long terminal repeat region has been shown to play a key role in viral genome transcription. In the presence of a viral protein Tat, p300 HAT acetylates p50 at several lysine residues, which results in enhanced p50 binding to its cognate sites. Our results show p50 acetylation in TNFα-treated cells in the absence of the viral Tat. It is unclear whether under physiological conditions, p50 acetylation by p300 also depends on a Tat-like co-factor. That p300 HAT acetylates p50 without a concurrent acetylation of C/EBPβ, CREB-2, c-Jun, or p65 suggests a stringent requirement of an appropriate lysine structural environment in p50 and possibly also p53 and GATA-1 for the action of p300 HAT. NF-κB is a heterodimer typically comprising a p50 subunit that binds to promoter and a p65 subunit that interacts with p300. NF-κB is sequestered in cytosol, and upon stimulation, it translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its cognate sites. NF-κB has been shown to play a key role in COX-2 transcriptional activation stimulated by TNFα, lipopolysaccharide, and other pathophysiological stresses. There are two NF-κB sites at the core promoter region of human COX-2, and mutation of either site results in loss of response to TNFα stimulation (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, our results show that TNFα selectively increased NF-κB binding to these sites, which was accompanied by enhanced p300 recruitment and binding to the COX-2 promoter complex. In view of augmented p50/p65 binding and p300 recruitment by p300 overexpression and the requirement of HAT for the p300-induced binding activities, we propose that p300 binding to DNA-bound NF-κB is limited by a low level of p300 in cells and that TNFα is capable of augmenting p300 binding by a positive feedback loop driven by p50 acetylation. p50 acetylation by HAT of p300 bound to the complex leads to an increased p50/p65 binding, which in turn recruits additional p300 to the complex. This autoregulatory loop ensures up-regulation of NF-κB-mediated gene expression. Because NF-κB plays a key role in transcriptional activation of myriad proinflammatory genes, this regulatory mechanism has important implications in inflammation, tissue injury, and tumorigenesis. There is a large body of data supporting the notion that p300 recruitment to DNA-bound transactivators is essential for transcription of many genes. However, there is little information about the role of increased p300 binding in gene transcription under physiological conditions. In this study, our results demonstrate increased p300 binding to chromatin as well as naked COX-2 promoter sequence by TNFα stimulation. Increased p300 binding correlated closely with an enhanced p50/p65 binding. Our results provide further evidence for complex formation between p300, and each involved transactivator and an up-regulation of p300 and p50/p65 in the complex by TNFα. Together with our previously reported results (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Schrör Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Deng W.-G. Xu X.-M. Meyer-Kirchrath J. Wu K.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that at the basal state, p300 is recruited to COX-2 promoter by interacting with constitutively bound CREB and c-Jun at the CRE site, C/EBPβ at CRE and C/EBP sites, and p50/p65 NF-κB at both NF-κB sites. TNFα stimulation increases p50/p65 binding via p50 acetylation, and the increased NF-κB bound to its specific sequence recruits additional p300 leading to amplified transcriptional activation. TNFα stimulation could therefore serve as a model for understanding COX-2 transcriptional stimulation by diverse cytokines, growth factors, angiogenic factors, and environmental stress. These agonists induce COX-2 transcription by up-regulating the binding of distinct groups of transactivators, which in turn recruit p300. p300 binding to transactivators drives the transcriptional initiation complex via interaction with general transcriptional factors. Furthermore, p300 acetylates core histone, notably H3 and H4 lysines, to modify chromatin structure and increase transactivator binding. In addition, p300 acetylates selective classes of transactivators, such as p50, thereby further increasing transactivator binding and amplifying transactivation of genes. Increased transactivator binding results in recruiting additional p300, thus creating a positive regulatory loop for COX-2 transactivation. p300 thus occupies a central position in regulating COX-2 promoter activation through its pleiotropic actions.

Because there are two scissile bonds per enzyme-mediated double-stranded DNA break, it has been assumed that there are two sites for etoposide in every cleavage complex. However, it is not known whether the action of etoposide at only one scissile bond is sufficient to stabilize a double-stranded DNA break or whether both drug sites need to be occupied. An oligonucleotide system was utilized to address this important issue. Results of DNA cleavage and ligation assays support atwo-drug model for the action of etoposide against human topoisomerase IIα. This model postulates that drug interactions at both scissile bonds are required in order to increase enzyme-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. Etoposide actions at either of the two scissile bonds appear to be independent of one another, with each individual drug molecule stabilizing a strand-specific nick rather than a double-stranded DNA break. This finding suggests (at least in the presence of drug) that there is little or no communication between the two promoter active sites of topoisomerase II. The two-drug model has implications for cancer chemotherapy, the cellular processing of etoposide-stabilized enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes, and the catalytic mechanism of eukaryotic topoisomerase II.

In order to maintain the integrity of the genetic material during the double-stranded DNA passage reaction of topoisomerase II, each active site residue forms a covalent phosphotyrosyl bond with one newly generated 5′ terminus (14Sander M.

Despite the physiological importance of topoisomerase II, the cleavage complex is potentially toxic. When DNA-tracking enzymes such as polymerases or helicases attempt to traverse the topoisomerase II roadblock on the genetic material, transient cleavage complexes can be converted to permanent double-stranded DNA breaks (4Burden D.A.

Normally, cleavage complexes are present at very low levels and are tolerated by the cell. However, conditions that increase the cellular concentration of topoisomerase II-associated nucleic acid breaks lead to DNA recombination and mutagenesis (4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys.

When these breaks overwhelm the cell, they trigger programmed death pathways (6Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In contrast to most drugs that target specific enzymes, etoposide and other topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer agents act in an insidious manner. Rather than blocking the activity of this essential enzyme, etoposide kills cells by increasing the concentration of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes (2Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 435-461Google Scholar, 4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim.

This action converts topoisomerase II to a potent cellular toxin that fragments the genome. Consequently, etoposide is referred to as a topoisomerase II poison to distinguish it from drugs that inhibit the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme (2Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F.

It has been known for more than a decade that etoposide stabilizes topoisomerase II-associated double-stranded DNA breaks by inhibiting the ability of the enzyme to ligate cleaved nucleic acid molecules (4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar,5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Perrin D. Hill B.T. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1999; 10: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which it does so is unknown. Topoisomerase II manufactures double-stranded breaks in DNA by generating two staggered nicks (one on each strand) in the sugar-phosphate backbone (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The fact that there are two scissile bonds per double-stranded break implies that there are two available sites for drug action in every cleavage complex. The potential presence of two etoposide molecules raises a fundamental question regarding drug mechanism. Does topoisomerase II require the actions of etoposide at both scissile bonds in order to stimulate the formation of double-stranded DNA breaks, or does the presence of drug at either scissile bond suffice? If enzyme catalysis at both strands is tightly coupled, the presence of etoposide at one scissile bond may inhibit DNA ligation at the other. Conversely, if catalysis is not highly coordinated, the presence of drug molecules at both scissile bonds may be required. An oligonucleotide system was utilized to address this unresolved issue. Results support a two-drug model for the action of etoposide against human topoisomerase IIα. This model postulates that drug interactions at both scissile bonds are required in order to increase enzyme-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. Etoposide actions at either of the two scissile bonds appear to be independent of one another, with each individual drug molecule stabilizing a strand-specific nick rather than a double-stranded break. This finding suggests (at least in the presence of drug) that there is little or no communication between the two protomer active sites of topoisomerase II. The two-drug model has implications for future drug design and the cellular processing of etoposide-stabilized cleavage complexes. Wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and a mutant human enzyme containing an active site Phe in place of Tyr-805 (Y805F) were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand purified as described previously (32Wasserman R.A.

A 47-base oligonucleotide corresponding to residues 80–126 of pBR322 and its complement were prepared on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-CCGTGTATGAAATCTAACAATG↓CGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATG↓AGCGCATTGTTAGATTTCATACACGG-3′, respectively. Points of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are denoted by arrows. Oligonucleotides spanning the 5′ terminus to the point of topoisomerase II scission on each strand also were synthesized. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled on their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]phosphate and purified as described (35Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17727-17731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides extending from the point of scission to the 3′ terminus of each strand were synthesized and 5′-activated withp-nitrophenol according to Bromberg et al. (34Bromberg K.D. Hendricks C. Burgin A.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31201-31206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by incubating at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling to 25 °C. DNA cleavage assays were carried out as described previously (33Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Bromberg K.D. Osheroff N.

Reaction mixtures contained 200 nm wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and 10 nm double-stranded oligonucleotide or 50 nmenzyme and 10 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 135 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol in the absence or presence of etoposide. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. For mixtures containing oligonucleotide substrates, cleavage intermediates were trapped by adding 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1 μl of 375 mmEDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were digested with proteinase K and ethanol-precipitated. To monitor strand-specific single-stranded DNA breaks, cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis in 7m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels in 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA. To monitor double-stranded DNA breaks, products were resolved in 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. In all cases, DNA cleavage products were visualized and quantified on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. For reactions containing pBR322 DNA, cleavage intermediates were trapped and digested as above (except that 5% SDS was used) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 40 mmTris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized by ultraviolet light and quantified using an Alpha Innotech digital imaging system. Relative levels of single- versus double-stranded breaks were determined directly by quantifying the fluorescence of linear and nicked plasmid molecules, respectively (ethidium bromide displays identical binding and fluorescence properties for both topological forms of DNA (37Waring M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar)). These values were converted to absolute cleavage levels by normalizing data to the total percent DNA cleavage, which was calculated from the loss of supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate. DNA ligation reactions were carried out according to Bromberg et al. (34Bromberg K.D. Hendricks C. Burgin A.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31201-31206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays contained 200 nm wild-type or Y805F human topoisomerase IIα and 10 nm activated nicked oligonucleotide in a total of 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 135 mm KCl, 7.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol in the absence or presence of etoposide. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and ligation was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1 μl of 375 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were treated, resolved in denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed as described above for oligonucleotide cleavage reactions.

Chem. 2002; 3: 1349-1364Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which it accomplishes this action remains enigmatic. Because this drug is in wide use for the treatment of human cancers (1Hande K.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L.

Cancer. 1998; 34: 1514-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), it is critical to understand the molecular basis for its effects on the enzyme. Because there are two scissile bonds per topoisomerase II-mediated double-stranded DNA break (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that there are two sites for etoposide in every cleavage complex (38Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the presence of etoposide at only one scissile bond is sufficient to stabilize a double-stranded DNA break or whether both drug sites need to be occupied. This is a fundamental issue that has important implications for topoisomerase II-based cancer chemotherapy, including drug design and the cellular processing of drug-stabilized cleavage complexes. Two potential models for etoposide action can be envisioned. In the first, or one-drug model, the action of etoposide at either of the two scissile bonds is sufficient to produce enzyme-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. This model postulates strong molecular communication between the active site of each topoisomerase II protomer, such that drug-induced inhibition of ligation of one DNA strand also impairs ligation of the other strand. In the second, or two-drug model, the action of etoposide at both of the two scissile bonds is required to generate double-stranded DNA breaks. This model postulates that there is little or no molecular communication between the two protomer active sites of topoisomerase II. Each drug acts independently, inhibits DNA ligation only at a single scissile bond, and therefore induces only a single-stranded DNA break. Although these hypotheses have not been tested for any eukaryotic type II topoisomerase, results of a study that examined drug effects on bacteriophage T4 topoisomerase II (38Freudenreich C.H.

Under all conditions examined in this work, primarily double-stranded DNA breaks were induced by etoposide. However, because treatment of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases with anticancer drugs often produces cleavage complexes containing DNA nicks (29Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 39Nelson E.M. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the one-drug model may not extend to the eukaryotic enzymes. The one-drug model of etoposide action predicts that drug treatment will produce enzyme-associated DNA breaks that are primarily double-stranded. Conversely, the two-drug model predicts that etoposide treatment will generate primarily single-stranded breaks at subsaturating drug concentrations. In addition, the ratio of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA breaks will drop with rising drug concentration, because the probability that both protomer active sites of topoisomerase II are occupied by drug will increase at higher levels of etoposide. The latter two predictions appear to be true for human topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 1). At the lowest drug concentration examined (50 μm), the ratio of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA breaks was ∼2.6:1. 1Because the agarose gel system employed to resolve pBR322 topoisomers cannot distinguish between molecules that contain single or multiple nicks, the ratio of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA breaks probably is underestimated. Furthermore, this ratio dropped to approximate parity at 500 μm etoposide. Although the experiment shown in Fig. 1 was carried out in the absence of a high energy cofactor, similar results were observed when ATP or a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog was included in DNA cleavage assays (not shown). Taken together, these findings are inconsistent with the one-drug model and provide support for the two-drug model discussed above. A postulate of the two-drug model is that the action of etoposide at one scissile bond does not influence the DNA cleavage/ligation equilibrium at the other. This implies that there is little or no communication between the protomer active sites of topoisomerase II, at least in the presence of the drug. This prediction cannot be tested using a plasmid-based DNA cleavage or ligation assay, because it is impossible to control the distribution of sites utilized by the enzyme in large nucleic acid substrates. Consequently, an oligonucleotide system was established that allowed the actions of etoposide at each of the two scissile bonds to be manipulated individually (see Fig. 2). The substrate contained a single, well characterized cleavage site for topoisomerase II that was derived from pBR322 plasmid DNA (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol.

The −1 base (relative to the point of scission for topoisomerase II) on the strand being cleaved/ligated was changed as indicated. For all substrates, the amount of DNA cleavage observed in the absence of etoposide was set to 1 (A and C), and the amount DNA ligation observed in the absence of drug was set to 100% (B andD). All substrates contained a weak drug site (−1 G) on opposite strand.

This study investigated the mechanism of laminin-5 processing by keratinocytes. BI-1 (BMP-1 isoenzyme inhibitor-1), a selective inhibitor of a small group of astacin-like metalloproteinases, which includes bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1), mammalian Tolloid (mTLD), mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL-1), and mammalian Tolloid-like 2 (mTLL-2), inhibited the processing of laminin-5 γ2 and α3 chains in keratinocyte cultures in a dose-dependent manner. In a proteinase survey, all BMP-1 isoenzymes processed human laminin-5 γ2 and α3 chains to 105- and 165-kDa fragments, respectively. In contrast, MT1-MMP and MMP-2 did not cleave the γ2 chain of human laminin-5 but processed the rat laminin γ2 chain to an 80-kDa fragment. An immunoblot and quantitative PCR survey of the BMP-1 isoenzymes revealed expression of mTLD in primary keratinocyte cultures but little or no expression of BMP-1, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2. mTLD was shown to cleave the γ2 chain at the same site as the previously identified BMP-1 cleavage site. In addition, mTLD/BMP-1 null mice were shown to have deficient laminin-5 processing.

Exogenous addition of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2)1 cleaved the γ2 subunit of rat laminin-5 (12Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). A subsequent study suggested that membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) may play a role in cleaving laminin-5 (13Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Cleavage of laminin-5 by plasmin converted the α3 chain into the 165-kDa form observed in human breast and rat epithelial cells and capable of nucleating hemidesmosomes (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) has also been implicated in laminin-5 proteolysis. N-terminal sequencing of the 105-kDa γ2 chain obtained from human keratinocytes revealed a cleavage site that matched the minimal consensus sequence of this metalloprotease (15Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol.

In vitro studies demonstrated that BMP-1 cleaved the recombinant γ2 short arm at the predicted site and that the enzyme cleaved both the α3 and γ2 chains of whole laminin-5 to generate characteristic 165- and 105-kDa fragments, respectively (15Amano S.

Thus, of the proteases reported to cleave laminin-5, only BMP-1 was shown to process both chains, whereas plasmin was reported to process only the α3 chain, and MMP-2 and/or MT1-MMP were reported to process only the γ2 chain of rat laminin-5. BMP-1, first identified in osteogenic extracts of bone (16Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It has substantial homology with proteins involved in morphogenetic patterning such as Tolloid inDrosophila and Xolloid in Xenopus, and the mammalian enzyme may function both in patterning and in modifying components of the extracellular matrix (18Scott I.C.

The first identified activity for BMP-1 was the cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide from procollagen types I–III in the process of collagen deposition in fibrillogenesis (19Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Three additional mammalian enzymes highly homologous to BMP-1 have been reported: mammalian Tolloid, an alternatively spliced variant of the Bmp1 gene (mTLD) (20Takahara K. Lyons G.E. Greenspan D.S.

All of these BMP-1 isoenzymes share a similar domain structure comprising an N-terminal prodomain, an astacin-like metalloprotease domain, and several EGF (epidermal growth factor) and CUB domains (a widespread module found in developmentally regulated proteins), thought to be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (17Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 also have additional C-terminal EGF and CUB domains not found in BMP-1 (18Scott I.C.

In the present study, we have utilized a novel inhibitor of the BMP-1 family to investigate processing of laminin-5 by the BMP-1 isoenzymes expressed in keratinocytes. We demonstrate that treatment of keratinocytes with this inhibitor significantly reduced the cleavage of both the α3 and γ2 chains. A comparison of the enzymatic activities of the four BMP-1 isoenzymes on laminin-5 revealed that all forms are able to cleave both the α3 and γ2 chains. However, only mTLD was present in significant quantities, at both the RNA and protein levels, in cultured keratinocytes under the conditions used in the study of laminin-5 cleavage. In addition, a defect of laminin-5 processing was demonstrated in skin lacking mTLD/BMP-1. Interestingly, neither MMP-2 nor MT1-MMP was able to cleave the γ2 chain of human laminin-5, although they cleaved the rat chain, most likely reflecting sequence differences between the two proteins. Together, these data suggest a novel role for mTLD in processing laminin-5 in keratinocytes and the skin. Plasmin (United States Biological, Swampscott, MA or Calbiochem) and purified MMP-2 and MT1-MMP catalytic domains (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were purchased from commercially available sources. BI-1 (a kind gift of FibroGen, Inc.), a selective hydroxamic acid inhibitor of BMP-1 and its isoenzymes, was dissolved in Me2SO. A fluorogenic peptide containing a consensus BMP-1 cleavage site (49FibroGen, Inc. (September 15, 1998) U. S. Patent 5,807,981 9/15/98.Google Scholar) was used to assess the inhibitory activity of BI-1 on BMP-1. In a similar assay, a fluorogenic peptide with the sequence Mca-P-L-G-L-Dpa(Dnp)-A-R-NH2 (where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetic acid and Dpa is dinitrophenylalanine) (excitation 360 nm, emission 465 nm; Bachem, catalog No. M-1895) was used to measure the inhibitory activity of BI-1 on MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9. The latter enzymes were activated according to the manufacturer's instructions using p-aminophenylmercuric acetate. BMP-1, and activated MMP-1, -2, and -9 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of BI-1 and the appropriate fluorogenic peptide substrate (50 μm); the increase in fluorescence was used to determine initial rates. MMP-2 activity was also verified by examining its ability to digest chicken type I [3H]procollagen at 25 °C as described previously for rat type I collagen (25Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), except that products were detected by autoradiography instead of Coomassie staining. Type 1 [3H]procollagen was a kind gift from FibroGen, Inc. The effect of BI-1 on this reaction was examined. The activity of MT1-MMP and the effect of BI-1 on this enzyme were verified using pro-MMP-2 as a substrate and examining its conversion to the mature form. The digestions were analyzed by Western blot as below using antibody Ab-3 (Calbiochem) against MMP-2, which recognizes both the 66- and 72-kDa forms. All control reactions were run in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using NOVEX gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (26Lunstrum G.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol.

Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were developed using a standard ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) unless indicated otherwise. For the cell-based laminin-5 cleavage assay, human primary keratinocytes (NHEK; BioWhittaker, or Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) were grown in EpiLife medium (Cascade Biologics) containing 0.06 mm CaCl2. When testing BI-1 in cell-based assays, we supplemented the medium with extra CaCl2 to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. The γ2-deficient keratinocytes, LSV5 cells (27Miquel C. Gagnoux-Palacios L.

Primary dermal fibroblasts were obtained from BioWhittaker and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Purified BMP-1 and conditioned media from cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 were the kind gifts of FibroGen, Inc. The mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 proteins were affinity purified over a FLAG-Sepharose column essentially as described (18Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M.

Concentrations of purified enzymes were assessed using BCA assays and by direct comparison of Coomassie-stained band intensity with protein standards of known concentration. The activity of the purified enzymes was assayed by measuring the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide containing a consensus BMP-1 cleavage site (49FibroGen, Inc. (September 15, 1998) U. S.

The reactivity of each antibody against 0.25 μg of BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 was assessed by Western blot. To test the presence of BMP-1 isoenzymes in keratinocyte medium, 90% confluent cultures of keratinocytes were washed three times to remove residual pituitary extract supplements and grown overnight in supplement-free medium (Keratinocyte SFM, Invitrogen). The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 4000 ×g to remove cellular debris, and concentrated 100–200-fold using Centricon Plus 20 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Concentrated conditioned media derived from the culture of 1.5–2.5 × 106 cells were electrophoresed per lane alongside 0.2 μg of the purified BMP-1 isoenzymes as positive controls and analyzed by Western blot with the panel of anti-BMP-1 isoenzyme antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, human primary keratinocytes were grown to 70% confluency in six 225-cm2 flasks, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (BioWhittaker) and Cys/Met-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; BioWhittaker), and then starved in the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled for 24 h in Cys/Met-free KGM supplemented with 0.1 mCi/ml EasyTag EXPRESS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) protein labeling mix. After labeling, cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (5Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until its use in immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation the supernatant was precleared with gelatin-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C using 100 μl of Sepharose/each ml of supernatant. Precleared supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads to which K140 had been preadsorbed. Beads were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 2× digestion buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.04% Brij 35). For digestions, 15 μl of beads were digested in a final volume of 30 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. Soluble, partially processed laminin-5 was purified from the conditioned media of LSV5 cells transfected with the wild-type γ2 chain, as described previously, using antibody affinity chromatography (5Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μg of purified protein was digested in a total volume of 20 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) for 4 h at 37 °C. To produce unprocessed rat laminin-5 for cleavage assays, 804G cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 2 × 105cells/well in the presence of 20 μm BI-1 inhibitor and grown for 16 h. Cells were removed using 20 mmNH4OH and the remaining matrix washed as described previously (34Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin-5 was digested in a total volume of 100 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing proteases for 4 h at 37 °C. Following digestion, the matrix was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized as described previously (34Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The processing state of laminin-5 was analyzed by Western blot using 1:1000 pKal with the signal detected using ECL Plus chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy reagent kit (Qiagen). RNA was subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase using an “on column” DNase digestion kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined with RiboGreen (Molecular Probes). cDNA synthesis was performed on 200 ng of total RNA using Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase (Qiagen), priming with oligo(dT) at a concentration of 1 μm. Placental RNA was obtained from Clontech. Levels of gene expression were determined using a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science) with a final concentration of 4.1 mm MgCl2. The thermal cycling conditions began with polymerase activation at 94 °C for 6 min followed by 42 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. A standard curve comprising the gel-purified and PicoGreen (Molecular Probes)-quantitated amplicon from a previous PCR was run concurrently with each sample.

Extracellular processing of laminin-5 by keratinocytes was shown to be inhibited byortho-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of metalloproteases, and sequence analysis of the cleavage site of the γ2 chain implicated BMP-1 in this activity (15Amano S.

In this study we have utilized BI-1, a hydroxamic acid-based selective inhibitor of BMP-1 isoenzymes, to investigate the role of these metalloproteases in laminin-5 processing. BI-1 has IC50values of 6, 2, and 4 nm for BMP-1, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 respectively compared with IC50 values of greater then 50 μm for MMP-2 and MMP9. 2M. Brenner, personal communication. Under the culture medium calcium concentrations used in this study, keratinocytes produced a mixture of unprocessed and processed forms of both the α3 and γ2 chains of laminin-5 in the extracellular matrix (Fig. 2 A, i). When cells were seeded and grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of BI-1 for 72 h, the appearance of the unprocessed 200-kDa α3 and 155-kDa γ2 bands indicated that the inhibition was dose-dependent (Fig. 2 A, i). The kinetics of cleavage differed for the two chains. Cleavage of the γ2 chain was 85% inhibited at 0.5 μm BI-1 (Fig.2 A, iii). In contrast, processing of the α3 chain appeared more complex. In the absence of the inhibitor, three bands were apparent: the 200-kDa unprocessed form, the 165-kDa form processed at the C-terminal end of the chain, and a 145-kDa form, which had undergone additional processing in domain IIIa of the N-terminal region (Fig. 2 A, ii) (5Marinkovich M.P.

These forms comprise 14, 52, and 34%, respectively, of the total α3 (Fig.2 B). The addition of BI-1 inhibits both of these cleavage events, with the 145-kDa band reduced to 9% of the total at 5 μm BI-1, whereas the 165-kDa band still comprised 28% of the total α3 at 50 μm BI-1 (Fig. 2 B). This may indicate that the cleavage site in the G-domain, which generates the 165-kDa fragment, is particularly labile and sensitive to proteolysis. BMP-1 has been reported to cleave both the α3 and γ2 chains of radiolabeled human laminin-5 immunoprecipitated from keratinocyte cell lysates (15Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M.

To determine whether other BMP-1 isoenzymes were also capable of catalyzing this reaction, we tested the ability of the panel of BMP-1 isoenzymes to cleave unprocessed laminin-5. Purified recombinant BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 used in the digestions were present as single bands on a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel with molecular weights corresponding to those of the mature proteins from which proregions had been proteolytically removed (18Scott I.C.

Their proteolytic activity was assayed using a fluorogenic peptide containing a consensus BMP-1 cleavage sequence, and all enzymes were found to have similar activity (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the ability of BMP-1, mTLD, and mTLL-1 to cleave type I procollagen as reported previously (18Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which the CAZ is organized. Here we report a novel interaction between Piccolo, a core component of the CAZ, and GIT proteins, multidomain signaling integrators with GTPase-activating protein activity for ADP-ribosylation factor small GTPases. A small region (∼150 amino acid residues) in Piccolo, which is not conserved in the closely related CAZ protein Bassoon, mediates a direct interaction with the Spa2 homology domain (SHD) domain of GIT1. Piccolo and GIT1 colocalize at synaptic sites in cultured neurons. In brain, Piccolo forms a complex with GIT1 and various GIT-associated proteins, including βPIX, focal adhesion kinase, liprin-α, and paxillin. Point mutations in the SHD of GIT1 differentially interfere with the association of GIT1 with Piccolo, βPIX, and focal adhesion kinase, suggesting that these proteins bind to the SHD by different mechanisms. Intriguingly, GIT proteins form homo- and heteromultimers through their C-terminal G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-binding domain in a tail-to-tail fashion. This multimerization enables GIT1 to simultaneously interact with multiple SHD-binding proteins including Piccolo and βPIX.

Intriguingly, Piccolo associates with an ∼80-nm dense core granulated vesicle (termed Piccolo transport vesicle) that contains other active zone components, suggesting that Piccolo and related active zone components are transported to nascent synapses as a preassembled package for the rapid and efficient formation of active zones (14Zhai R.G.

For GST fusion protein constructs, the following regions of Piccolo and GIT1 were subcloned intoBamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences): Piccolo (aa 2011–2350); GIT1, GAP-SHD (aa 1–374), CC (aa 405–485), SP (aa 486–645), and PBS (aa 646–770). GIT1 GRKBD (aa 375–770) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1. For H6 fusion protein constructs, GIT1 GAP-SHD (aa 1–374) was subcloned into pRSET A (Invitrogen) digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and GIT1 GRKBD (aa 375–770) and GIT1 full-length (aa 1–770) into the EcoRI site of pRSET B (Invitrogen). EGFP-GIT1 deletion constructs were generated by subcloning the following regions of GIT1 into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech): GAP (aa 1–129), ankyrin repeats (aa 130–254), SHD (aa 255–374), and GAP-SHD (aa 1–374) (EcoRI and BamHI site); GRKBD (aa 375–770) and GIT1 full-length (aa 1–770) (EcoRI site). FLAG-tagged GIT1, GIT2 long, GIT2 short, and PAPα in pBK(Δ) were previously described (15Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Google Scholar, 19Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22373-22380Google Scholar). The GIT-binding domain (GBD, aa 486–566) of βPIX-a was subcloned into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). For pull-down assay, transfected HEK293T cells were extracted with binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the extracts were mixed with GST fusion proteins and incubated for 30 min, followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). H6-GIT1 fusion proteins were pulled down by the same method. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with EGFP and His antibodies. H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD and H6-Piccolo were used as ligand and analyte, respectively. For H6-Piccolo, Piccolo (aa 2011–2350) was subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI site of pRSET A (Invitrogen). 177 resonance units (RU) of H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) by amine coupling. H6-Piccolo at different concentrations was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Surface plasmon resonance was monitored by a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore). HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) was used as running buffer. The surface of the sensor chips was regenerated by 1-min injections of 25 mm NaOH at 10 μl/min. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software 3.1 (BIAcore). EGFP-Piccolo was constructed by subcloning aa 2011–2350 of Piccolo into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested withBamHI and EcoRI, followed by elution of the insert with KpnI and XbaI enzymes and subcloning into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). GIT1 ΔPBS (aa 1–645) was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pBK(Δ). For GIT1 ΔCC-FLAG, GIT1 aa 1–431 and GIT1 aa 484–770 were amplified by PCR, digested with BamHI-KpnI andKpnI-EcoRI, respectively, and subcloned into pBK(Δ) digested with BamHI and EcoRI. Myc-tagged βPIX has been described previously (27Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Google Scholar). Expression constructs of full-length GIT1 (pBK(Δ) GIT1-FLAG) with point mutations in the SHD (F285A, L288A, R298A, and R299A) were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For immunoprecipitation, transfected HEK293T cells were extracted with binding buffer and incubated with M2 FLAG-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h or antibodies against Piccolo (1203, 1:250) or Myc (2 μg/ml) followed by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) precipitation. In vivo coimmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (28Wyszynski M. Valtschanoff J.G. Naisbitt S. Dunah A.W. Kim E. Standaert D.G. Weinberg R. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6528-6537Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain was solubilized with DOC buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 9.0), dialyzed against binding/dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with Piccolo antibodies (1203, 1:250) or boiled antibodies (negative control) at 4 °C for 2 h, with protein A-Sepharose for additional 2 h, followed by immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with GIT1 (du139, 1:2000), Piccolo (1203, 1 μg/ml), βPIX (1:1000), FAK (1:200), paxillin (1:1000), liprin-α (1120, 0.5 μg/ml), GRIP1 (43–8, 1:1000), vinculin (1:1000), and synaptophysin (1:1000) antibodies. H6-GIT1 full-length and H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD fusion proteins were purified and dialyzed against HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). 200 μl of each fusion protein or molecular weight standards were laid on top of 4 ml of 15–30% linear sucrose density gradient prepared in HEPES buffer containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 20 h. Molecular mass standards included bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, Sigma), catalase (232 kDa, Sigma), and thyroglobulin (670 kDa, Sigma). After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by immunoblotting with His antibodies. Molecular weight standards were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Rabbit polyclonal GIT1 antibodies (1176) were raised using H6-GIT1 (aa 375–770) as immunogen.2Polyclonal Piccolo antibodies were generated in guinea pigs (1203) with H6-Piccolo (aa 2011–2350). The following antibodies have been previously described: rabbit polyclonal GIT1 antiserum (du139) (15Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M.

In press and βPIX (27Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Google Scholar). Guinea pig polyclonal Piccolo antibodies (gp-α-44a-GST-affi) were affinity-purified as described (30Dick O. Hack I. Altrock W.D. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Brandstatter J.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 224-234Google Scholar). GRIP1 43–8 antibody was a gift from Dr. Pann-Ghill Suh (Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea). The following antibodies were purchased from commercial sources: FLAG (M2, Sigma), vinculin (Sigma), His (His-probe, H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), paxillin (Transduction Laboratories), FAK (clone 4.47, Upstate Biotechnology), synaptophysin (Sigma), synaptotagmin (Sigma), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and HA (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science). Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from E18 embryonic rat brains as previously described (31Goslin K. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar) and maintained in the neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.5 mmglutamine, and 12.5 μm glutamate. At 21 days in vitro (DIV), hippocampal neurons were fixed and permeabilized with precooled methanol at −20 °C for 20 min and incubated with primary antibodies, Piccolo (gp-α-44a-GST-affi, 1:1000) and GIT1 (1176, 2 μg/ml), followed by Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250 and 1:100, respectively, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images were captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). We identified the interaction between Piccolo and GIT1 by yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library using the full-length GIT1 as bait. One of the positive clones was a fragment of Piccolo (aa 2011–2468). By deletion analysis, a minimal GIT-binding domain in Piccolo was narrowed down to the middle third of the positive clone (aa 2197–2350, ∼150 aa residues), excluding the C-terminal proline-rich region (Fig.1 A). Conversely, a minimal Piccolo-binding region in GIT1 was defined as the SHD (Fig.1 B), a domain known to mediate the association of GIT1 with βPIX and FAK (25Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Google Scholar). In addition to GIT1, Piccolo interacted with GIT2 long (full-length), which shares the same domain structure with GIT1 (19Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22373-22380Google Scholar), as well as GIT2 short, a splice variant of GIT2 that lacks most of the C-terminal GRKBD but contains the SHD (19Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22373-22380Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) (see Fig. 2 D for the structural organization of GIT2 splice variants). In contrast, a region of Bassoon (aa 1730–2237) that corresponds to the Piccolo prey clone (aa 2011–2468) showed no significant homology to the minimal GIT-binding domain of Piccolo (aa 2197–2350), and did not interact with GIT1, GIT2 long, or GIT2 short (data not shown). This indicates that the GIT proteins selectively interact with Piccolo and suggests that Piccolo and Bassoon, two closely related CAZ proteins known to colocalize in synapses (5Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Google Scholar), may have differential functions.Figure 2Characterization of the interaction between Piccolo and GIT proteins by the pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance measurements. A and B, HEK293T cell lysates transiently transfected with EGFP-tagged deletions of GIT1 were pulled down by equal amounts (5 μg) of GST-Piccolo (aa 2011–2350) or GST alone, and analyzed by immunoblotting with EGFP antibodies. GST fusion proteins used in the pull-down assay were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (A).C, H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD (aa 1–374) and H6-GIT1 GRKBD (aa 375–770) fusion proteins (1 μg) were pulled down by GST-Piccolo, or GST alone (2 μg), and analyzed by immunoblotting with His antibodies.IB, immunoblotting.

Responses at the steady state (Req) were plotted against the concentration of H6-Piccolo and analyzed by non-linear curve fitting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As an independent assay to characterize the interaction of Piccolo with GIT proteins, we performed GST pull-down assays using GST-Piccolo (aa 2011–2350) and HEK293T cell lysates transfected with EGFP-tagged GIT1 deletions (Fig. 2, A andB). Consistent with the yeast-two hybrid results (Fig.1 B), GST-Piccolo, but not GST alone, selectively pulled down EGFP-tagged GIT1 deletions containing the SHD (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the SHD of GIT1 mediates its interaction with Piccolo. In addition, GST-Piccolo selectively pulled down H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD (aa 1–374) but not H6-GIT1 GRKBD (aa 375–770) fusion proteins (Fig.2 C), indicating that Piccolo directly interacts with GIT1. We further performed pull-down assays on HEK293T cell lysates transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length GITs (GIT1-FLAG, GIT2 long-FLAG, and GIT2 short-FLAG) and an unrelated protein with the ARF GAP domain, PAPα/PAG3, which lacks the SHD (32Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Google Scholar), as control (Fig.2 D). GST-Piccolo brought down GIT1, GIT2 long, and GIT2 short but not PAPα/PAG3, consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1 A), indicating that Piccolo selectively interacts with the GIT family proteins. The relatively inefficient pull-down of GIT2 short by GST-Piccolo differs from the yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1 A). This could be due to differences in the assay, but both assays (yeast two-hybrid and pull-down) clearly showed that GIT2 short can bind Piccolo. To determine the affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction between Piccolo and GIT1, we performed surface plasmon resonance experiments. H6-Piccolo (analyte) in running buffer specifically bound to the H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD (ligand) immobilized on the sensor chip. The plot ofR eq (response at the steady state) against the concentration of H6-Piccolo gave a dissociation constant of 14.5 μm and an R max (maximum binding capacity of the surface ligand) of 142 RU (Fig. 2 E). Considering that the RU of immobilized H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD is 177, the molar ratio of H6-Piccolo to H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD is ∼0.9, indicating that the GIT1 SHD has one binding site for Piccolo. The relatively low affinity of the Piccolo-GIT interaction in this assay may result from, in contrast to full-length GIT1, the GAP-SHD region of GIT1 showing a relatively low apparent affinity for Piccolo in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B) and pull-down assay (Fig. 2 B). Another explanation may be that immobilization of H6-GIT1 GAP-SHD on the CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling might have modified arginine residues in the GIT1 SHD that appear to be important for binding to Piccolo (see Fig. 5 for further details). To determine whether Piccolo and GIT1 colocalize in subcellular regions of neurons, we performed double-label immunofluorescence staining on cultured hippocampal neurons after 21 days in vitro (DIV) (Fig. 3). Consistent with the reported presynaptic localization of Piccolo (5Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Google Scholar), Piccolo was primarily localized at discrete punctate structures located along neurites (Fig. 3 B). GIT1 displayed a much wider distribution than Piccolo, and the immunoreactivity was found associated with a number of small intracellular structures scattered throughout the neurons (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, however, several of the GIT1-positive structures, presumably representing synaptic GIT1 proteins, colocalized with the Piccolo puncta. The GIT1 puncta that do not overlap with Piccolo appear to be extrasynaptic GIT1 proteins, as evidenced by immunohistochemical and biochemical results.2 These results suggest that GIT1 proteins are widely distributed to both synaptic as well as non-synaptic sites and that presynaptic GIT1 proteins colocalize with Piccolo. We then examined in a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments whether interaction between Piccolo and GIT1 occurs on a cellular level (Fig. 4, A andB). Incubation of HEK293T cell lysates doubly transfected with EGFP-tagged Piccolo (EGFP-Piccolo, aa 2011–2350) and GIT1-FLAG (full-length) with FLAG antibodies immunoprecipitated GIT1-FLAG and coprecipitated EGFP-Piccolo (Fig. 4 A). In control experiments, FLAG antibodies did not bring down EGFP-Piccolo from singly transfected cells. In inversely designed coimmunoprecipitation experiments Piccolo antibodies immunoprecipitated EGFP-Piccolo and coprecipitated GIT1-FLAG (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether Piccolo and GIT1 form a complex in brain, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments on rat brain extracts (Fig.4 C). Immunoprecipitation on detergent lysates of the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain with Piccolo antibodies precipitated Piccolo and coprecipitated GIT1 and various proteins that are known to associate with GIT1, including βPIX (16Bagrodia S.

https://openalex.org/W2137893078,"We report a class of molecules with extremely low ionization enthalpies, one member of which has been determined to have a gas-phase ionization energy (onset, 3.51 electron volts) lower than that of the cesium atom (which has the lowest gas-phase ionization energy of the elements) or of any other known closed-shell molecule or neutral transient species reported. The molecules are dimetal complexes with the general formula M2(hpp)4 (where M is Cr, Mo, or W, and hpp is the anion of 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine), structurally characterized in the solid state, spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase, and modeled with theoretical computations. The low-energy ionization of each molecule corresponds to the removal of an electron from the delta bonding orbital of the quadruple metal-metal bond, and a strong interaction of this orbital with a filled orbital on the hpp ligands largely accounts for the low ionization energies."
https://openalex.org/W2067349307,"A key aspect of neuromuscular synapse formation is the clustering of muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at synaptic sites in response to neurally secreted agrin. Agrin-induced AChR clustering in cultured myotubes proceeds via the initial formation of small microclusters, which then aggregate to form AChR clusters. Here we show that the coupling of agrin signaling to AChR clustering is dependent on the coordinated activities of Rac and Rho GTPases. The addition of agrin induces the sequential activation of Rac and Rho in C2 muscle cells. The activation of Rac is rapid and transient and constitutes a prerequisite for the subsequent activation of Rho. This temporal pattern of agrin-induced Rac and Rho activation reflects their respective roles in AChR cluster formation. Whereas agrin-induced activation of Rac is necessary for the initial phase of AChR cluster formation, which involves the aggregation of diffuse AChR into microclusters, Rho activation is crucial for the subsequent condensation of these microclusters into full-size AChR clusters. Co-expression of constitutively active forms of Rac and Rho is sufficient to induce the formation of mature AChR clusters in the absence of agrin. These results establish that Rac and Rho play distinct but complementary roles in the mechanism of agrin-induced AChR clustering.

During embryonic development, innervation induces the anatomical and biochemical specialization of a defined region of the muscle cell membrane immediately under the motor nerve ending. A prominent aspect of this specialization is the accumulation of high densities of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor(s); MuSK, muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRBD, the Rho-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor(s); MuSK, muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRBD, the Rho-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate at these sites (1Burden S.J.

The clustering of MuSK upon its activation by agrin, the formation of AChR complexes with rapsyn, as well as the aggregation of these complexes and their stabilization upon the formation of dystroglycan-utrophin scaffolds appear to be sequential events that are to some extent independently regulated (9Smith C.L.

Rho exerts the opposite effect by stimulating actin stress fiber appearance and focal adhesion complex formation to promote cell adhesion and contractility (25Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar, 26Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar). As several recent studies have shown, Rac and Rho are mutually inhibitory in several cell types, and the balance between their antagonistic activities is responsible for the dynamic changes in cell morphology, adhesion, and motility (27Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Google Scholar, 28Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Google Scholar). In other systems Rac serves as an upstream activator of Rho (29Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Google Scholar). We have recently shown that agrin triggers the activation of Rac and Cdc42 and that this activation is necessary but not sufficient for formation of full size AChR clusters (14Weston C. Yee B. Hod E. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 205-212Google Scholar). In this study we present evidence that Rho plays a crucial role in agrin-initiated signaling that is complementary to the contribution of Rac/Cdc42 and that together these Rho family GTPases serve to couple signaling initiated by extracellular agrin to the formation of AChR clusters. Expression plasmids encoding T7 epitope-tagged constitutively active Rac (RacV12), dominant negative Rac (RacN17), wild type Rho (RhoWT), constitutively active Rho (RhoV14), and dominant negative Rho (RhoN19), as well as RacV12, RhoV14, and C3 transferase proteins were generously provided by D. Bar-Sagi (Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY). Plasmids encoding GST fused to the Cdc42/Rac (p-21) binding domain of PAK (GST-PBD) as well as to the Rho-binding domain (TRBD) of the Rho effector protein Rhotekin were gifts from S. Moores and J. Brugge (Harvard University, Boston, MA) and M. Schwartz (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), respectively. cDNA encoding a soluble C-terminal fragment of agrin (30Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Google Scholar) was kindly provided by M. Ferns (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). C2 (C2C12) mouse muscle cells were plated on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes for microinjection and microscopy experiments, or in 100-mm culture dishes for affinity precipitation assays. The cells were cultured in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with air/5% CO2. To stimulate muscle differentiation, the growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml each of penicillin/streptomycin 2 days after plating. Under these conditions the major proportion of the C2 myoblasts fused to form multinucleated myotubes during the subsequent 2 days. To induce clustering of AChR, the cultures were treated with 5 nmagrin where specified. For experiments utilizing transient transfections, 1 day post-plating C2 myoblast cultures were transfected with the indicated plasmids at a final concentration of 5 μg of DNA/ml using either calcium phosphate precipitation or LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was replaced with differentiation medium for 3 days prior to addition of 5 nmsoluble recombinant neural agrin prepared from COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding the C-terminal fragment of agrin (30Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Google Scholar). Differentiated C2 cells were treated with either soluble C3 exotransferase from Clostridium botulinum (31Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Google Scholar, 32Sekine A. Fujiwara M.

Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Google Scholar) or Y27632 (34Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Google Scholar, 35Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983Google Scholar) at varying time points and were monitored for clustering ability in response to agrin. C3-transferase was applied to C2 myotubes at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C prior to agrin treatment. The cultures were then incubated for an additional 8 h in the presence of both C3-toxin and agrin. For Y-27632, myotubes were treated with Y-27632 at 20 μm concentration, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h prior to the addition of agrin. 20 μm of Y-27632 was then added every 2 h for 8 h to ensure a continuous presence of Y-27632 at a pharmacologically effective concentration. The effect of Y-27632 on agrin-induced AChR clustering was measured by labeling AChR clusters with the AChR ligand tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes). For experiments involving microinjection, myotube cultures were grown on coverslips and after 3 days in differentiation medium were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The injections were performed with sterile borosilicate microinjection capillaries. The capillary was loaded with a solution containing the indicated plasmid or protein in microinjection buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, for DNA injections, or 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for protein injections) and mounted on the Eppendorf micromanipulator 5171 connected to an Eppendorf microinjector 5242. DNA was at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. For protein injections the buffer included RhoV14 at 3 μg/μl and/or RacV12 at 6 μg/μl. Cytoplasmic injections of plasmid DNA or protein were done at a pressure of 40–50 hPa for 0.3 s under ambient conditions. Subsequently the cultures were shifted back to differentiation medium and incubated at 37 °C for a further 0.5–1 day. Cells plated on glass coverslips and subsequently either transfected or microinjected were labeled for 1 h with 10 nm tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde with PBS for 30 min to visualize the surface distribution of AChR. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 with PBS at room temperature for 5 min, blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with PBS for 3 min, and subsequently incubated with anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed with PBS, and stained by incubating with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (ICN) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cultures that were microinjected with protein were co-injected with FITC goat anti-mouse antibody to identify the injected myotubes. The coverslips were mounted on slides using Immu-Mount (Shandon). The images were acquired using a Nikon PCM 2000 laser scanning immunofluorescence confocal microscope and associated imaging system and processed using Adobe Photoshop. C2 myotubes were treated with 5 nm agrin for 15 min and then rinsed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2. The cells were then lysed by incubation for 5 min on ice with either lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were utilized as cell lysates. To measure Rho activation, an affinity precipitation method was used (36Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Google Scholar, 37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar) in which cell lysates prepared with lysis buffer A were incubated with GST fused to the Rho-binding domain from the effector protein Rhotekin (GST-TRBD) bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound Rho proteins were eluted with sample buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000 dilution) and visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In a similar manner Rac activation was measured by affinity precipitation of cellular GTP-bound forms of Rac (39Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Google Scholar). In this case cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer B and incubated with GST fused to the Cdc42/Rac (p21)-binding domain of PAK (GST-PBD) bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein beads with bound proteins were then washed three times in an excess of lysis buffer, eluted in sample buffer, and then analyzed by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human Rac1 (Transduction Labs) at a 1:1,000 dilution. The blots were developed using sheep anti-mouse coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000 dilution) and visualized with the ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences). For experiments in which Rho and Rac activation was measured in the same cultures, the cells were extracted with lysis buffer B, and the lysates were divided for Rho and Rac determinations as described above. To measure the effect of Rac inactivation on Rho activation, the cells were co-transfected with T7 epitope-tagged wild type Rho (RhoWT) or constitutively activated Rho (RhoV14) and T7 epitope-tagged dominant negative Rac (RacN17). Rho activation was assessed using the TRBD pull-down assay described above, using antibody to the T7 epitope to select for transfected cells. We have recently found that constitutively active Rac and Cdc42 mutants cause the formation of AChR microclusters (2–5 μm in diameter) but are insufficient to induce full- size AChR clusters (15–20 μm in diameter) (14Weston C. Yee B. Hod E. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 205-212Google Scholar), suggesting that other regulatory components might be required. In view of these findings and the observations implicating the actin cytoskeleton in AChR clustering (3Colledge M. Froehner S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3341-3343Google Scholar), we have now investigated the potential contribution of Rho. For this purpose we tested the effect of a dominant negative mutant of Rho, RhoN19, on agrin-induced AChR clustering. T7 epitope-tagged RhoN19 plasmid was microinjected into differentiated myotubes, and after overnight incubation in differentiation medium in the absence or presence of agrin, surface AChR on myotubes were visualized by labeling with the AChR ligand tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin. The microinjected cells expressing the RhoN19 construct were identified using indirect immunofluorescence with anti-T7 antibody and FITC-tagged second antibody. The dominant negative Rho mutant was found to impair the ability of agrin to cluster AChR (Fig.1 A, panel d) compared with myotubes that were co-injected with vector plus FITC-conjugated antibody to identify the injected cells and treated with agrin under identical conditions (Fig. 1 A, panel b). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1 B, the decrease in numbers of agrin-induced full-size AChR clusters is associated with an increase in the number of AChR microclusters present in the myotubes expressing RhoN19. To verify the contribution of Rho to AChR clustering by pharmacological means, we utilized C3 exotransferase from C. botulinum, an inhibitor of Rho activity (31Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Google Scholar, 32Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Google Scholar, 33Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Google Scholar). When added to differentiated muscle cell cultures prior to agrin treatment, C3 transferase was seen to impair the ability of agrin to induce the formation of AChR clusters (Fig. 2, A, panel b, and B). As in the case of RhoN19 expression, the decrease of AChR clusters was accompanied by an increase in the number of microclusters (Fig. 2, A, arrowheads, andB). Together these findings suggest that Rho activation is necessary for the induction by agrin of full-size AChR clusters but not for microcluster formation. Moreover, the increased accumulation of microclusters observed upon impairment of Rho is consistent with the possibility that full-size clusters are formed via the aggregation of microclusters and that this step is blocked by Rho inhibitors. To investigate the effector pathway by which Rho mediates AChR clustering, we utilized a pharmacological inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase p160ROCK, Y-27632 (34Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Google Scholar, 35Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A, panel c, and B), Y-27632 inhibits the agrin-induced aggregation of AChR into clusters while increasing the number of microclusters (arrowheads) per myotube. These results closely resemble those observed with direct inhibition of Rho, consistent with the possibility that the downstream effects that couple Rho activation to the formation of AChR clusters are mediated through p160ROCK. The ability to inhibit AChR clustering by blocking the Rho pathway utilizing three separate methods demonstrates that this pathway is necessary for agrin to induce AChR clusters. To determine the extent to which Rho activation can mimic the stimulation of AChR clustering by agrin, differentiated myotubes were microinjected with RhoV14 protein, and the effects of this constitutively active Rho mutant on AChR surface distribution were measured after overnight incubation without agrin. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, myotubes that express RhoV14 show altered distribution of AChR (panels a and b) into regions of somewhat elevated AChR density. These areas, although clearly larger than the microclusters induced by the constitutively active mutant of Rac (RacV12) (Fig. 3 A, panels c and d), are less dense and more poorly defined than the clusters induced by agrin (Fig. 1 A, panel b). Next, to determine whether these mutant Rho GTPases produce cooperative effects on AChR clustering upon co-expression in muscle cells, we microinjected RacV12 and RhoV14 proteins into the same myotubes and examined the effects on AChR surface distribution after an overnight incubation. We observed that under these conditions, co-expression of RacV12 and RhoV14 significantly increases the amount of full-size clusters above the levels obtained with either alone (Fig.3 A, panels e and f). Quantitative comparison of AChR aggregation into microclusters and clusters induced by RacV12 and RhoV14 in these experiments is shown in Fig.3 B. Together these findings indicate that with regard to the contributions of Rac and Rho to agrin-induced AChR clustering, activation of each is necessary, and co-activation of both is sufficient for the induction of full- size AChR clusters. To determine whether endogenous Rho in muscle cultures is activated upon agrin treatment, we utilized an affinity precipitation assay based on the selective binding of activated (GTP-bound) Rho to the effector Rhotekin (36Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Google Scholar, 37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, agrin activates Rho in C2 myotubes, as monitored by the increased binding of activated Rho to GST-TRBD, a GST fusion protein containing the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin. In contrast, agrin fails to activate Rho in undifferentiated C2 myoblasts, consistent with the finding that MuSK is selectively expressed in differentiated muscle cells (40Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Google Scholar). In view of our findings suggesting that Rac mediates microcluster formation while Rho regulates the subsequent aggregation of microclusters into clusters, it was of interest to compare the time course of activation of Rho with that of Rac upon agrin treatment of C2 myotubes. For this comparison, myotubes were exposed to agrin for various intervals and then extracted, and the lysates were divided into two pools for parallel determinations of Rho and Rac activation. As can be seen in Fig. 4 B, two differences in the time courses of Rho and Rac are apparent. First, Rac activation occurs sooner following agrin treatment than the activation of Rho; a significant increase in Rac activity is evident within 5 min, whereas Rho activation is not appreciable until 15 min after agrin addition. An additional difference is that the activation of Rac is clearly transient, as shown by the return of Rac activity to basal levels by 60 min after agrin exposure. In contrast, Rho activation reaches maximum by 15 min and has not diminished by 90 min after the onset of agrin treatment. The finding that Rac activation occurs earlier than Rho activation in response to agrin led us to test the possibility that Rho activation might be dependent on the prior activation of Rac. We measured the agrin-induced activation of Rho in muscle cells expressing dominant negative Rac (RacN17) to determine whether this mutant would block agrin-induced Rho activation. As shown in Fig. 4 C, RacN17 prevents the activation of Rho by agrin. To control for the possibility that the absence of agrin-induced Rho activation reflected muscle cell toxicity associated with RacN17 expression, we measured the effects of RacN17 expression on the ability of muscle cells to express constitutively activated Rho (RhoV14), using the TRBD pull down assay. As shown in Fig. 4 D, constitutive Rho activation was unaffected by RacN17 expression. These findings support the notion that the pathway to Rho activation by agrin passes through Rac. A crucial feature of synaptogenesis is the establishment at postsynaptic membranes of a well delineated surface region that displays sharply elevated sensitivity to neurotransmitter. In the case of the neuromuscular synapses, this is accomplished by the clustering of AChR initiated by spatial cues originating at the motor nerve ending and acting on the adjacent patch of muscle membrane. The postsynaptic sensor component of this focal signaling mechanism includes the receptor tyrosine kinase, MuSK, which activates a signaling pathway to couple the binding of neurally derived agrin to the assembly of subsynaptic complexes and to the aggregation of diffusely distributed surface AChR into high density clusters. Our recent findings that activation of Rac/Cdc42 is essential for AChR clustering and is sufficient for mediating agrin-induced AChR microclusters but not full-size clusters (14Weston C. Yee B. Hod E. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 205-212Google Scholar) suggests that additional regulatory steps are necessary to bring about the aggregation of microclusters to form full-size clusters. This has led us to examine the contribution of Rho, a monomeric G protein that plays a critical role in the formation of adhesion plaques, well characterized surface structures to which AChR cluster regions bear a resemblance, to agrin-induced AChR clustering. In this study we provide evidence that Rho, acting in conjunction with Rac, plays a critical role in coupling agrin signaling to AChR cluster formation. We show that in differentiated myotubes Rho undergoes activation upon agrin treatment. Inhibition of the Rho pathway impairs agrin-induced AChR clustering. Conversely, stimulation of the Rho pathway with the constitutively active Rho mutant, RhoV14, stimulates the formation of regions of elevated AChR density on the myotube surface, but these areas are more poorly defined with lower staining intensity than the full-size clusters induced by agrin. However, co-expression of RacV12 with RhoV14 results in the induction of full-size high density AChR clusters. These findings lead to the conclusion that Rac and Rho are each necessary but individually insufficient for agrin-induced AChR cluster formation, whereas co-activation of Rac and Rho can serve to mediate AChR clustering, mimicking the effect of agrin. Earlier studies have suggested that microclusters and clusters represent distinct stages of neural factor-induced AChR aggregation, with microclusters serving as the precursors of full-size clusters in cultured muscle cells (41Kunkel D.D. Lee L.K. Stollberg J. BMC Neurosci. 2001; 2: 19Google Scholar, 42Luther P.W. Samuelsson S.J. Pumplin D.W. Bloch R.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1994; 28: 179-193Google Scholar, 43Ross A. Rapuano M. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1139-1145Google Scholar, 44Pumplin D.W. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 97-108Google Scholar), as well as in developing neuromuscular synapses (2Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Google Scholar). The dispersal of clusters in response to pharmacological agents (protein kinase C activators and phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitors) similarly proceeds via microclusters as intermediates (43Ross A. Rapuano M. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1139-1145Google Scholar,45Nimnual A.S. Chang W. Chang N.S. Ross A.F. Gelman M.S. Prives J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14823-14832Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used in the present experiments, exposure of C2 myotubes to agrin results in the appearance of numerous microclusters (2–5 μm diameter) within 2 h and the subsequent accumulation of full-size AChR clusters (15–20 μm diameter) starting after a further 1–2 h. Several of our findings suggest that Rac and Rho act at distinct points but serve cooperative roles in the pathway that couples agrin signaling to AChR cluster formation. Whereas dominant negative Rac (RacN17) abolishes all agrin-induced AChR aggregation, inhibition of Rho-mediated signaling in agrin-treated myotubes is seen to selectively impair AChR aggregation into full-size AChR clusters but does not inhibit the formation of AChR microclusters. On the contrary the number of microclusters increases when Rho or its effector pathway is blocked. Constitutively active Rac induces AChR aggregation exclusively into microclusters but requires the co-activation of Rho to produce clusters. These results support the notion that agrin-induced AChR microclusters are the precursors of full- size clusters. Moreover, Rho activation appears to be unnecessary for agrin-induced microcluster formation but crucial for the subsequent conversion of microclusters into full-size clusters. What is the relationship between Rac and Rho in the signaling pathway that couples agrin stimulation to surface AChR aggregation? Our current finding that upon agrin addition to muscle cells Rac activation precedes and overlaps with Rho activation is consistent with the observed sequence of events in which Rac-mediated formation of microclusters is followed by the Rho directed condensation of microclusters into full-size clusters. Additionally, we find that agrin fails to cause Rho activation in muscle cells expressing dominant negative Rac, suggesting that in these cells Rac activation is necessary for the agrin-induced Rho stimulation that directs cluster formation. A hypothetical scheme that illustrates how the Rho GTPases cooperate to induce high AChR site density membrane domains in response to agrin signaling is presented in Fig.5. The multiprotein cytoskeletal complexes that assemble at postsynaptic membrane sites in the neuromuscular junction and in the AChR cluster regions in cultured muscle cells closely resemble the focal adhesions involved in cell-substrate adhesion and signaling (46Bloch R.J. Geiger B. Cell. 1980; 21: 25-35Google Scholar, 47Bloch R.J. Pumplin D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C345-C364Google Scholar, 48Mittaud P. Marangi P.A. Erb-Vogtli S. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14505-14513Google Scholar). Rho GTPases serve crucial roles in the formation of focal complexes and adhesions (25Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 regulate the formation of small focal complexes, whereas Rho is required for the formation of focal adhesions by the aggregation of focal complexes (26Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar, 28Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Google Scholar, 49Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). Moreover, similar conditions produce dispersal of both AChR clusters and focal adhesions. The dispersal of AChR clusters into microclusters induced by the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in cultured myotubes (43Ross A. Rapuano M. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1139-1145Google Scholar) may be related to actomyosin inactivation in these cultures (50Rapuano M. Ross A.F. Prives J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 271-278Google Scholar) and resembles the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-triggered, Rho inactivation-dependent disassembly of focal adhesions seen in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (51Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Google Scholar, 52Nakano K. Takaishi K. Kodama A. Mammoto A. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Google Scholar). Our present results showing that the block in AChR cluster formation by inhibition of Rho activity is associated with an increase in number of AChR microclusters parallel the recent observation that the Rho inactivation-induced block of focal adhesions is accompanied by the formation of new focal complexes (28Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Google Scholar). A comparison of the time courses for the activation of Rac and Rho in response to agrin provides a potential insight into the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate their activities. Rac is activated shortly after agrin treatment, whereas Rho activity remains at basal levels for a longer duration. The selective early activation of Rac would allow an interval for Rac-induced formation of AChR microclusters. Upon the subsequent activation of Rho, these microclusters would then undergo aggregation into clusters through Rho-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. It is noteworthy that the prolonged activation of Rho by agrin is accompanied by the inactivation of Rac and is concomitant with the accumulation of full-size AChR clusters on the surface of myotubes. In conclusion, these findings show that Rac and Rho play sequential and cooperative roles in the pathway coupling neural agrin signaling to AChR clustering in myotubes. In more general terms our results support the possibility that cellular events responsible for the formation of synapses including axon guidance and postsynaptic membrane assembly utilize similar signaling pathways in which Rho family GTPases play homologous roles.

Here we show that in mice, the absence of a testis-specific, cytoplasmic polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase, TPAP, results in the arrest of spermiogenesis. TPAP-deficient mice display impaired expression of haploid-specific genes that are required for the morphogenesis of germ cells. The TPAP deficiency also causes incomplete elongation of poly(A) tails of particular transcription factor messenger RNAs. Although the overall cellular level of the transcription factor TAF10 is unaffected, TAF10 is insufficiently transported into the nucleus of germ cells. We propose that TPAP governs germ cell morphogenesis by modulating specific transcription factors at posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels."

https://openalex.org/W2047495190,We demonstrated in laboratory experiments that temperature control of marine bacteria action on diatoms strongly influences the coupling of biogenic silica and organic carbon preservation. Low temperature intensified the selective regeneration of organic matter by marine bacteria as the silicon:carbon preservation ratio gradually increased from approximately 1 at 33 degrees C to approximately 6 at -1.8 degrees C. Temperature control of bacteria-mediated selective preservation of silicon versus carbon should help to interpret and model the variable coupling of silicon and carbon sinking fluxes and the spatial patterns of opal accumulation in oceanic systems with different temperature regimes.
https://openalex.org/W2029065341,"LOT1 is a zinc-finger nuclear transcription factor, which possesses anti-proliferative effects and is frequently silenced in ovarian and breast cancer cells. TheLOT1 gene is localized at chromosome 6q24–25, a chromosomal region maternally imprinted and linked to growth retardation in several organs and progression of disease states such as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. Toward understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of LOT1 expression in cancer, we have characterized the genomic structure and analyzed its epigenetic regulation. Genome mapping of LOT1 in comparison with the other splice variants, namely ZAC1 andPLAGL1, revealed that its mRNA (∼4.7 kb; GenBankTM accession number U72621) is potentially spliced using six exons spanning at least 70 kb of the human genome. 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) data indicate the presence of at least two transcription start sites. We found thatin vitro methylation of the LOT1 promoter causes a significant loss in its ability to drive luciferase transcription. To determine the nature of in vivomethylation of LOT1, we used bisulfite-sequencing strategies on genomic DNA. We show that in the ovarian and breast cancer cell lines and/or tumors the 5′-CpG island of LOT1is a differentially methylated region. In these cell lines the ratio of methylated to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in this region ranged from 31 to 99% and the ovarian tumors have relatively higher cytosine methylation than normal tissues. Furthermore, we show that trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, relieves transcriptional silencing of LOT1 mRNA in malignantly transformed cells. It appears that, unlike DNA methylation, histone deacetylation does not target the promoter, and rather it is indirect and may be elicited by a mechanism upstream of the LOT1regulatory pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that expression ofLOT1 is under the control of two epigenetic modifications and that, in the absence of loss of heterozygosity, the biallelic (two-hit) or maximal silencing of LOT1 requires both processes.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar) localized on chromosome 6 at band q24–25, which is a frequent site for loss of heterozygosity in many solid tumors including ovarian cancer (2Abdollahi A.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 555-559Google Scholar). The mouse ortholog of this gene was independently identified by Spengler et al. (4Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffman A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journet L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Google Scholar) and designated as Zac1, which is highly homologous to the hLOT1 and rLot1 genes. A splice variant of LOT1/ZAC1 was identified by Kas et al. (5Kas K. Voz M. Hensen K. Meyen E. Van de ven W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23026-23032Google Scholar) and named as PLAGL1 based on its homology with PLAG1 protein encoded by the genePLAG1 localized on chromosome 8q12 (6Kas K. Voz M. Roijer E. Astrom A.-K. Meyen E. Stenman G. Van de Ven W. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 170-174Google Scholar). The presence of other genes with high homology to LOT1/ZAC1/PLAGL1 indicates that this gene is a member of new family of zinc-finger proteins. Our studies and those of others have shown that LOT1 gene expression is frequently down-regulated in the ovarian and breast carcinoma cells (1Abdollahi A. Godwin A. Miller P. Getts L. Schultz D. Taguchi T. Testa J. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2029-2034Google Scholar, 2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3979-3988Google Scholar). Functional analysis of LOT1 demonstrated that it may play a significant role as a transcription factor modulating growth suppression through mitogenic signaling pathways (8Abdollahi A. Bao R. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6477-6487Google Scholar). It is increasingly evident that epigenetic modification of genomic DNA by methylation and/or histone deacetylation plays an important role in transcriptional silencing and loss of gene function of certain tumor suppressor genes. Methylation of DNA normally occurs at cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides in almost all higher eukaryotic organisms (9Jones P. Baylin S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Google Scholar, 10Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Google Scholar, 11Bird A. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Google Scholar). This type of modification can suppress gene expression directly by interfering with the binding of transcription factors or indirectly by initiating a complex consisting of methyl-CpG-binding proteins (e.g. MeCP2, MBDs) and histone deacetylases (12Jones P. Veenstra G. Wade P. Vermaak D. Kass S. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Google Scholar, 13Nan X. Ng H. Johnson C. Laherty C. Turner B. Eisenman R. Bird A.

These complexes mediate transcriptional repression through chromatin hypoacetylation, which can be partially reversed by TSA. In human cancers, aberrant methylation of CpG islands silencing the promoters of some genes that function in the suppression of malignant phenotype has been found. For example hypermethylation of CpG islands in different cancer cells has been implicated in the transcriptional inactivation of the Rb, p16, estrogen receptor, INK4B/MTS2, VHL, andH19 genes (17Zhang Y.

Similarly, CpG island methylation may play a significant role in the regulation of imprinted genes (25Barlow D. Science. 1995; 270: 1610-1613Google Scholar) and genes located on the inactive X chromosome (26Wolfe S. Jolly D. Lunnen K. Friedmann T. Migeon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2806-2810Google Scholar, 27Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Google Scholar). Recently, the LOT1/ZAC1 locus at chromosome 6q24–25 was identified as a maternally imprinted region (2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar, 4Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffman A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journet L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Google Scholar,28Gardner R. Mackay D.

These studies have established that the paternal duplication or loss of maternal imprinting of the LOT1 locus is associated with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, an imprinted disease characterized by intrauterine fetal growth retardation and insulin dependence. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that down-regulate expression of LOT1 in cancer. In this study, we have characterized the LOT1 gene structure with relation to different splice variants and identified the gene's minimal promoter and a CpG island. Our results indicate thatLOT1 is subject to two epigenetic processes, methylation of CpG islands and histone deacetylation, which may synergistically act to regulate the transcriptional silencing of the gene. The ovarian cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), insulin (10 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (1Abdollahi A. Godwin A. Miller P. Getts L. Schultz D. Taguchi T. Testa J. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2029-2034Google Scholar). Normal rat ovarian surface epithelial (ROSE) cells were obtained from the ovaries of adult Fisher rats by selective trypsinization (31Godwin A. Testa J. Handel L. Liu Z. Vandeveer L. Tracey P. Hamilton T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 592-601Google Scholar, 32Testa J. Getts L. Salazar H. Liu Z. Handel L. Godwin A. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2778-2784Google Scholar). The ROSE cell line NuTu 26 was obtained as described previously (1Abdollahi A. Godwin A. Miller P. Getts L. Schultz D. Taguchi T. Testa J. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2029-2034Google Scholar). The breast cancer cells MDA-MB-453 and -468 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To obtain additional sequence information of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of hLOT1 cDNA, which we previously reported (2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar), a normal human fetal brain cDNA library in λZAPII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. A positive clone, FB2, which hybridized to the hLOT1 probe, gave extended 5′-UTR sequences. Insert sequences of all plasmids were determined by automated ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing with FS AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and run through an Applied Biosystem 373/377 sequencer (ABI/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data were analyzed using FASTA and PILEUP DNA sequence homology searches in the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package (Madison, WI). We predicted the LOT1 transcription start site using GeneRacer cDNA Kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA for 5′-RACE was derived from human ovary and generated based on oligo-capping and RNA ligase-mediated RACE methods (33Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Google Scholar, 34Shaefer B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Google Scholar). The PCR was performed using GeneRacer 5′1 adaptor forward primer (5′-GCACGAGGACACUGA CAUGGACUGA-3′) and gene-specific reverse primer (5′-TTCTAAGTGAGGTACAGATGAGTTTCAGATG-3′). The gene-specific primer was designed from the 3′ end of the LOT1 exon II and at the junction of this exon and exon III. The PCR reaction contained the cDNA, primers, buffer, dNTPs, Me2SO, and Taqpolymerase in a volume of 50 μl. The amplification reaction consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by extending at 72 °C for 7 min. We analyzed the PCR products by cloning into pGEMT vector using the TA cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The clones were sequenced using both T7 and Sp6 primers. All the primers used in this study were synthesized by the Fox Chase Cancer Center DNA synthesis facility. To obtain the human LOT1 promoter, a human placental genomic DNA library (EMBL-3-SP6/T7, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using the following fragments in the hLOT1cDNA (GenBank accession number U72621.3) as probes: a) a fragment containing the complete open reading frame; b) a 271-bp fragment upstream of the LOT1 translation start codon; and c) a fragment containing bases −1547 to −567 with respect to the LOT1translation start codon. Phage inserts were sequenced using both the polylinker-specific and LOT1-specific primers. These primers as well as cDNA-specific primers were used in PCR to amplify regions of the phage insert and to gain additional insight into the genomic structure of LOT1. We also screened a human P1 library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO), which resulted in identification of a new genomic clone designated as clone 17513. This P1 clone was purified by Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and used in subsequent promoter analyses. The forward and reverse primer, p63 (5′-TGGGTGTGAGGAGTGTGGGAAGA-3′) and p69 (5′-GCAGTTTGATTACAGAACACGCG-3′) were used to sequence most of the LOT1 open reading frame using genomic DNA as template. Reporter constructs containing luciferase gene under the control of theLOT1 promoter were created by amplifying and subcloning the 5′-flanking regions of the LOT1 promoter at the nucleotide positions as depicted in Fig. 4, using DNA from the phage or P1 clone 17513 as a template. Primers used to amplify the 5′-flanking region of the LOT1 promoter included: TH1645, 5′-CTAGTGGGGTAGGGATAGCATT-3′; TH1647, 5′-CAGGAGGTAAGTTAGTTTGGCC-3′; and TH1648, 5′-CTGCCCCGTCCGTCCGTCCGT-3′. The primers TH1645 and TH1647 were linked to the XhoI recognition sequence on their 5′ ends, and the primer TH1648 contained a HindIII recognition site at its 5′ end. The plasmids constructed with these PCR products were designated as pGL3–45 and pGL3–47, respectively. Another plasmid designated as PGL3–60 was constructed using a PCR fragment obtained by amplifying human normal ovarian genomic DNA as template with the primers IMP4, 5′-GGCCCGTTGGCGAGGTTAGAGCGC-3′ and IMP5, 5′-ACGGCATCTGCCATTTGTCA-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into pGEMT vector using a TA cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the insert fragments were purified. The DNA fragments obtained by above procedures were ligated into pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega) containing the luciferase gene, which was previously digested with either XhoI alone (pGL3–60) or XhoI andHindIII (pGL3–45, pGL3–47) restriction enzymes. The ligation reactions were used to transform DH5αEscherichia coli competent cells and the clones were confirmed by sequencing their insert. All plasmids used for the transfections were purified using the Qiagen kit. The promoter construct pGL3–45 was in vitro methylated by the bacterial methylase,SssI (New England Biolabs), or mock-treated in the absence of enzyme. The DNA was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C withSssI methylase at 1 unit/μg DNA in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.9) supplemented with 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine. GFP-tagged LOT1 mammalian expression vector was constructed as described previously (8Abdollahi A. Bao R. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6477-6487Google Scholar). Briefly, the GFP coding region was amplified using forward (5′-CGCCATGGCTAGCAAGGGCCAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′) primers. The PCR product was ligated with XbaI linker to the LOT1 coding region, and the resulting fragment (GFL) was introduced downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter into the XhoI site of pcDNA3 plasmid. A2780 cells were cultured in RPMI 1 day before transfection. Transient transfections were performed usingTransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 4 μg/well of pcDNA/GFL vector carrying GFP-LOT1 fusion protein. The cells were then monitored 18 h later and imaged with a Quantix 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper, Inc., Tuscon, AZ). Fluorescent GFP and phase contrast images were generated simultaneously using Isee software (Inovision Corp., Durham, NC) to drive the charge-coupled device, a Ludl filter wheel, and a shutter attached to a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. The cells were observed at near-physiological conditions using a forced-air incubator, which encompasses the microscope. For FACS analysis the transfected cells were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspensions or GFP-transfectants were sorted using a Becton Dickinson FACS VintageSE flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA). 10,000 cells were subjected to FACS analysis. Ovarian cancer cells at a density of 4 × 105/well were cultured in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium 1 day prior to transfection with the reporter plasmid as indicated. Transient transfections were performed using TransIT-LT1 polyamine transfection reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed once with serum-free medium and incubated with the DNA (2 μl)/(6 μl) reagent mixture for 5 h in serum-free medium followed by additional incubation for 17 h (overnight) in fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase enzyme was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The cells were washed with 1× PBS, harvested with the lysis buffer, and centrifuged, and 5–20 μl of the cell lysate (supernatant) was added to 100 μl of the luciferase substrate. The luciferase enzyme activity was measured immediately or within 15 s of adding the substrate, luciferin, using the Monolight (R) 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Total RNA was isolated from the cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) or Trizol (Invitrogen) and was separated on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) by capillary action and hybridized using a procedure described before (1Abdollahi A. Godwin A. Miller P. Getts L. Schultz D. Taguchi T. Testa J. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2029-2034Google Scholar, 2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar). The probes for visualization of rat Lot1 and human LOT1 transcripts were the same as described previously (1Abdollahi A. Godwin A. Miller P. Getts L. Schultz D. Taguchi T. Testa J. Hamilton T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2029-2034Google Scholar, 2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar). The probe for β-actin was from Clontech, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Western blot analysis was performed with lysates obtained from the cells plated on 6-well dishes in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. After incubation with the transfection reagent supplemented with the appropriate DNAs, whole-cell lysates were prepared using 250 μl/well of M-PER Protein Extraction Reagent (PIERCE, Rockford, IL) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dithiothreitol. Equal volumes of protein (15 μl) from each sample were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by transfer to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Life Science, UK) for Western blot analysis. Immunoblots were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in TBST containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were incubated for 1 h with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) diluted with 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The blots were washed with TBST three times, and incubated for 1 h with the second antibody (anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase, Amersham Biosciences). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody was obtained from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). The protein bands were detected by the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray films (Kodak Co, Rochester, NY). Genomic DNA was isolated by digestion with proteinase K (Invitrogen) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction (36Herrmann B. Frischauf A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 180-187Google Scholar). After precipitation by the addition of 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.5 volumes of ammonium acetate (7.5 m), the DNA was washed twice with ethanol (80%, v/v), and dissolved in water. Normal and tumor DNA samples were obtained from Biosample Repository Core Facility (Andrew Godwin and Joellen Dangel) and Tumor Bank Facility (Andre Klein-Szanto and Robert Page) at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Genomic DNA (1 μg) was treated with sodium bisulfite and used for methylation-sensitive PCR as previously described (37Frommer M. McDonald L. Millar D. Collis C. Watt F. Grigg G. Molloy P. Paul C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Google Scholar, 38Herman J. Graff J. Myohanen S. Nelkin B. Baylin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA in a volume of 50 μl was denatured by 0.2 m NaOH and then treated with hydroquinone (Sigma) and sodium bisulfite (Sigma) at 50 °C for 16 h. Bisulfite-modified DNA was purified using Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega). Modification was completed by NaOH (0.3 m) for 5 min at room temperature. The bisulfite-treated DNA was precipitated by glycogen, ammonium acetate, and 3 volumes of ethanol, and the pellets were washed once with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of water. The modified DNA (4 μl) was amplified by PCR under the following reaction conditions: 1× buffer, 125 μm dNTPs, 7.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm of each primer in a 50-μl reaction. The reaction was carried out with the cycling condition of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of 0.5 unit of Gold Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 32 cycles of PCR (95 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) with a final extension of 4 min at 72 °C. Second round of PCR was performed using 2 μl of the first PCR and the same reagents and conditions as above. Primers were designed from the interpolated sequence after bisulfite conversion assuming DNA was either methylated or unmethylated at 14 CpG sites or the imprinting control region (28Gardner R. Mackay D. Mungall A. Polychronakos C. Siebert R. Shield J. Temple I. Robinson D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 589-596Google Scholar, 29Kamiya M. Judson H. Okazaki Y. Kusakabe M. Muramatsu M. Takada S. Takagi N. Arima T. Wake N. Kamimura K. Satomura K. Hermann R. Bonthron D. Hayashizaki Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 453-460Google Scholar). Primers used for first PCR were UM-S1: 5′-GGGGTAGTTGTGTTTATAGTTTAGTA-3′, UM-AS1: 5′-CAAACACCCAAACACCTACCCTA-3′ and M-S1: 5′-GGGGTAGTCGTGTTTATAGTTTAGTA-3′, M-AS1: 5′-CGAACACCCAAACACCTACCCTA-3. Primers used for the second PCR were UM-S2: 5′-ATAGTTTAGTAGTGTGGGGT-3′, UM-AS2: 5′-CCTACCCTACAAAACAACAA-3′, M-S2: 5′-ATAGTTTAGTAGCGCGGGGT-3′, and M-AS2: 5′-CCTACCCTACGAAACGACGA-3. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The resulting amplification pools were cloned into the pGEMT vector using the TA cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Four to 10 individual clones per PCR reaction were isolated and sequenced. The clones were sequenced using both T7 and Sp6 primers. The methylation-sensitive restriction digest-PCR was performed on 200 ng of genomic DNA samples. The DNA was digested overnight at 37 °C with 20 units of HpaII or MspI in a total volume of 20 μl. These restriction enzymes both cleave at CCGG sites. However, HpaII will not cut the DNA when the internal C is methylated. The DNA was purified with Wizard column (Promega) and eluted in 50 μl water, and 5 μl of the product was subjected to PCR using the primers IMP4 and IMP5 (1 μm) and reagents as mentioned above. The PCR condition consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by the addition of 0.5 unit ofTaq polymerase and 29 cycles of PCR (96 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min) with a final extension of 4 min at 72 °C. The reaction contained the same reagents as mentioned above. ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm dish were directly treated with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) to form protein-DNA cross-links. The cells were then collected in ice-cold 1× PBS containing protease inhibitors and subjected to centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were sonicated on ice with an Ultrasonics sonicator at setting 10 for 10-s pulses and then microcentrifuged. The supernatant or chromatin solution from each sample was diluted 10× with ChIP dilution buffer, and an aliquot was removed and used as input after reversing cross-link. The diluted chromatin solution was precleared for 30 min with Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-Agarose-50% slurry and incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without acetyl-histone H4 antibody. The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-Agarose-50% Slurry with rotation and washed with different wash buffers supplied in the kit. The chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted, and cross-links were reversed and treated with proteinase K. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extractions, precipitated, and used in PCR amplification. The primers used for PCR were IMP3: 5′-GCGAGGAGGGTGTGCCTTTG-3′ and IMP4 as shown above. The amplification conditions for the ChIP assay were the same described above for reactions using IMP4 and IMP5 primer set. As a first step toward analysis of the relationship between theLOT1 gene structure, promoter activity, and the presence of differential splicing and regulation of expression, we began to obtain additional sequence information of the gene's 5′-UTR cDNA region, which we previously reported (2Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A. Schultz D. Sonoda G. Testa J. Hamilton T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Google Scholar). A normal human fetal brain cDNA library in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene) was used for screening, and a positive clone, FB2, hybridized to the hLOT1 probe and produced an extension of the 5′-UTR sequence. This newly identified nucleotide sequence of the LOT1 gene was added to the previously published sequence that is stored in GenBankTMwith the accession number U72621. We identified the transcription start site (TSS) of LOT1using 5′-RACE technique. The cDNA for 5′-RACE was derived from human ovary and generated based on oligo-capping and RNA ligase-mediated RACE methods (33Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Google Scholar, 34Shaefer B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Google Scholar) as described in the GeneRacer cDNA Kit (Invitrogen). We detected a strong PCR band corresponding to about 390 nucleotides in size and weaker bands that are smaller or larger (Fig. 1). Two of t"

The required threshold pressure for cavitation could be exceeded at a relatively low acoustic intensity, as the high vapor pressure of CO2 counteracts the hydrostatic pressure. With the use of a dynamic bubble model, the formation of hot spots upon bubble collapse was predicted. Cavitation-induced radical formation was used for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate in CO2, yielding high-molecular-weight polymers. These results show that sonochemical reactions can be performed in dense-phase fluids, which allows the environmentally benign CO2 to replace conventional organic solvents in many reaction systems."
https://openalex.org/W2052871239,"Earth's dynamic oblateness (J2) has been decreasing due to postglacial rebound (PGR). However, J2 began to increase in 1997, indicating a pronounced global-scale mass redistribution within Earth's system. We have determined that the observed increases in J2 are caused primarily by a recent surge in subpolar glacial melting and by mass shifts in the Southern, Pacific, and Indian oceans. When these effects are removed, the residual trend in J2 (-2.9 x 10(-11) year-1) becomes consistent with previous estimates of PGR from satellite and eclipse data. The climatic significance of these rapid shifts in glacial and oceanic mass, however, remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1972849246,"Regulation of integrin affinity and clustering plays a key role in the control of cell adhesion and migration. The protein ICAP-1α (integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1α) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1Aintegrin and controls cell spreading on fibronectin. Here, we demonstrate that, despite its ability to interact with β1A integrin, ICAP-1α is not recruited in focal adhesions, whereas it is colocalized with the integrin at the ruffling edges of the cells. ICAP-1α induced a rapid disruption of focal adhesions, which may result from the ability of ICAP-1α to inhibit the association of β1A integrin with talin, which is crucial for the assembly of these structures. ICAP-1α-mediated dispersion of β1A integrins is not observed with β1D integrins that do not bind ICAP. This strongly suggests that ICAP-1α action depends on a direct interaction between ICAP-1α and the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 chains. Altogether, these results suggest that ICAP-1α plays a key role in cell adhesion by acting as a negative regulator of β1integrin avidity.

Altogether, these results suggest that ICAP-1α plays a key role in cell adhesion by acting as a negative regulator of β1integrin avidity. Interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix are essential for survival, differentiation, and proliferation of cells (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Google Scholar). They are mainly mediated by type I αβ heterodimer transmembrane receptors named integrins (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is a highly controlled process that can be modulated very rapidly by two mechanisms: the modulation of the receptor affinity by a conformational change and the modulation of receptor avidity by lateral diffusion and clustering into highly ordered structures named focal adhesions. As shown for the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, the effects of integrin clustering and affinity modulation are additive and seem to play complementary roles (3Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Google Scholar). The conformational change that modulates the affinity of some integrins is mediated by monomeric G proteins of the Ras family. R-Ras seems to prevent H-Ras-dependent decrease in integrin affinity (4Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Google Scholar, 5Sethi T. Ginsberg M.H. Downward J. Hughes P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Google Scholar, 6Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar). However, proteins involved in this signaling pathway are still largely unknown (6Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar, 7Keely P.J. Rusyn E.V. Cox A.D. Parise L.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1077-1088Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that intracellular calcium plays a key role in cell adhesion (8Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 47-55Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent cycles between high and low affinity states of integrins seem to be crucial for cell migration (9Bilato C. Curto K.A. Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Google Scholar, 10Hendey B. Klee C.B. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1992; 258: 296-299Google Scholar, 11Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R.

More recently, we found that the affinity state of the α5β1 integrin in CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase of type II; ICAP-1α, integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VPM, ventral plasma membrane cells may be switched by the balance between two antagonistic enzymatic activities: calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase of type II (CaMKII) (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar, 14Bouvard D. Molla A. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 657-665Google Scholar). A CaMKII-dependent inside-out signaling was also described as the molecular basis of the cross-talk between αvβ3 and α5β1(15Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Google Scholar). Although this regulatory pathway remains to be unraveled, calcineurin has been shown to control αvβ3and α5β1 integrin affinity in neutrophils and CHO cells, respectively (16Hendey B. Lawson M. Marcantonio E.E. Maxfield F.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 2038-2048Google Scholar, 17Pomies P. Frachet P. Block M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5104-5112Google Scholar). Finally a complex between β1 integrin and CaMKII was observed in breast cancer MCF-7 cells (18Takahashi K. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 23Google Scholar). Although the regulation of integrin function may involve phosphorylation events on the threonine doublet TT788–789 of the β1A chain (19Wennerberg K. Fassler R. Warmegard B. Johansson S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1117-1126Google Scholar) or on the threonine triplet TTT758–760 of the β2 chain (20Valmu L. Hilden T.J. van Willigen G. Gahmberg C.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 119-125Google Scholar), these phosphorylation sites do not seem to be directly linked to the CaMKII-dependent control of integrin affinity. Therefore, it is likely that this latter signaling pathway occurs via an intermediate regulatory protein. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that ectopically expressed β cytoplasmic domains have a dominant negative effect on integrin function, suggesting that some control proteins are titrated by the overexpression of β cytoplasmic tails (21Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Google Scholar, 22Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Google Scholar). Integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1α (ICAP-1α) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a protein specifically associated with the cytoplasmic domain of β1A integrins (23Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Google Scholar). This protein has two isoforms named α and β of 200 and 150 amino acids, respectively. ICAP-1 is expressed throughout development and also in adult tissues (24Faisst A.M. Gruss P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 293-303Google Scholar). ICAP-1α but not ICAP-1β interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the β1A chain in a manner that depends on the conserved NPXY integrin motif (25Chang D.D. Hoang B.Q. Liu J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8140-8145Google Scholar). ICAP-1α contains a number of putative phosphorylation sites, including a phosphorylation motif for the CaMKII around threonine 38. We could show that a point mutation T38D (that mimics the phosphorylated form) or T38A (which cannot be phosphorylated) in ICAP-1α and expression of the corresponding recombinant proteins reduced or increased cell spreading on fibronectin, respectively. These data suggest that phosphorylation of ICAP-1α on threonine 38 by CaMKII modulates α5β1 integrin function (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar). A further involvement of ICAP-1α in the regulation of β1 integrin function was suggested by experiments indicating that its overexpression increases cell motility on a β1-dependent substrate such as fibronectin (26Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Google Scholar). In this report we show that ICAP-1α, despite its ability to interact directly and specifically with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain in vitro, was never observed in focal adhesions. In addition, ICAP-1α could inhibit the interaction between talin and the β1 cytoplasmic tail in vitro. Because talin recruitment is a prerequisite for focal adhesion assembly (27Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Google Scholar, 28Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Google Scholar), we have analyzed the effect of ICAP-1α on the organization of these structures and showed that this protein was able to disorganize focal adhesions in a manner dependent on its direct interaction with the β1 cytoplasmic tail. These results strongly suggest that ICAP-1α is a key regulator of cell adhesion mediated through β1 integrin and focal adhesion dynamic by weakening talin binding to the β1 integrin. The anti-β1 tail serum (anti cyto-β1) was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 chain covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-talin monoclonal antibody (8d4) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The monoclonal antibody 9EG7 directed against the β1 subunit was kindly supplied by Dr. D. Vestweber (Muenster, Germany). The monoclonal antibody 7E2 directed against the hamster β1 subunit was a generous gift of Dr. R. Juliano (Chapel Hill, NC). Polyclonal antibody directed against the human ICAP-1α protein was previously described (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar). Cyanin3-, Alexa-, or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or Immunotech (Marseille, France) were used as secondary antibodies. The murine NIH3T3, the hamster CHO, and the human HeLa cell lines were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The murine GD25, GD25-β1A, and GD25-β1D were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. GD25 cells do not express the β1 integrin chain due to a null mutation in both alleles (29Fassler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.A. Johansson S. Timpl R. Albrecht R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Google Scholar). GD25 cells transfected with either the murine β1A, or the human β1A and β1D full-length cDNA are called GD25-β1A and GD-β1D, respectively, and have been described earlier (30Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Google Scholar, 31Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fassler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Google Scholar). All transfected cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics for the selection of the transfected cells. ICAP-1α and ICAP-1α fragments fused to a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminal position were purified from the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain containing the vector pET19b-ICAP-1α. Briefly, human ICAP-1α cDNA cloned in pBluescript was used as a template in a PCR reaction using primers with an XhoI site in the 5′ position. In the sense primer theXhoI site is in-frame with the first methionine of ICAP-1α. Then the XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into the XhoI site of pET-19b vector (Novagen). Fragments were obtained by insertion of stop codons at different positions using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs used in this study have been sequenced by the Eurogentec direct sequencing department (Belgium). Purification was carried out using the nickel-charged resin nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid from Qiagen. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in urea. Protein refolding was performed directly on the column by progressive removal of the chaotropic agent. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and was greater than 90–95%. All experiments were carried out with freshly purified proteins. Before each experiment, the capacity of each batch of the purified protein to interact with the β1 cytoplasmic domain was estimated in a solid-phase assay. The polypeptide corresponding to the β1integrin cytoplasmic domain was produced from the BLR(DE3)pLysSE. coli strain containing the vector pET19b-cytoβ1. This construct allows the production of the fragment 752–798 of the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain. This peptide was recognized by a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic β1 cytoplasmic peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Talin and α-actinin were purified as previously described (32Vignoud L. Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430Google Scholar), and fibronectin was purified according to a previous study (33Engvall E. Ruoslhati E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Google Scholar). Full-length human ICAP-1α was excised from the pBS-ICAP-1α vector as an EcoRI/XbaI fragment and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, The Netherlands). Stable GD25-β1A cell lines expressing ICAP-1α were obtained by electroporation of 4 × 106cells in 400 μl of PBS at 280 V with 15 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ICAP-1α vector. Transfected cells were selected in complete medium with Zeocin (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. The expression of ICAP-1α was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis using the ICAP-1α polyclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence was carried out using standard procedures. Stained cells were analyzed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus Provis AX70) equipped with a Plan Apo ×63 oil immersion, numerical aperture 1.40 objective lens. For all double-staining experiments, the appropriate controls were performed to ensure that no undesired cross-reactivity occurred between the primary and secondary antibodies. The purification of HeLa, GD25-β1, or NIH3T3 ventral plasma membranes was performed as previously described by Cattelino et al. (34Cattelino A. Longhi R. de Curtis I. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3067-3078Google Scholar). The cells were grown overnight on fibronectin-coated coverslips in complete medium. After two washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with cold water for 2 min and then flushed with a 1000-μl tip. Cell disruption was confirmed by microscopy. Ventral plasma membranes were either immediately fixed with paraformaldehyde or were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with ICAP-1α or ICAP-1α fragments at the concentration of 5 μm in a VPM buffer containing 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 12 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, prior to fixation. The interaction between ICAP-1α and the cyto-β1 peptide or the whole α5β1 integrin was carried out using a solid-phase assay. Briefly, a 96-well tray (MaxiSorp, Nunc) was coated with the whole ICAP-1α protein or ICAP-1α fragments for 16 h at 4 °C and blocked with a 3% BSA/PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. A Triton X-100 CHO cell lysate made in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (w:v) or the cyto-β1 peptide were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.01% Tween-20, detection of the α5β1 integrin from the CHO cell lysate was performed using the 7E2 monoclonal antibody, whereas the detection of the cyto-β1 peptide was achieved with a polyclonal antibody directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the β1 tail. NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips overnight at 37 °C. All injections were carried out with the aid of a micromanipulator 5171 connected to an Eppendorf microinjector unit (Transjector 5246). The cells were microinjected with PBS containing a final concentration of 1 mg/ml of the freshly purified recombinant ICAP-1α protein, or the N-terminal (1–100) or C-terminal (101–200) fragments, in the presence of 100 μm tetramethylrhodamine-dextran amine (M r 3000, Molecular Probes, Interchim, France) to view the injected cells. Three hours (whole ICAP-1α protein) or 30 min (ICAP-1α fragments) after microinjection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and then immunostained for vinculin localization. The protein ICAP-1α was isolated as a β1A-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (23Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Google Scholar) and was shown to modulate CHO cell adhesion (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar) and to promote cell motility (26Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Google Scholar). In epithelial cells or in cell lines derived from epithelial cells such as HeLa, ICAP-1α could be detected in a cell lysate by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length recombinant protein (Fig.1 A). The endogenous human ICAP-1α protein in HeLa cells migrates in SDS-PAGE like the ectopically expressed protein in rodent fibroblast-like GD25 cells (Fig. 1 B). GD25, CHO, and NIH3T3 cells showed no detectable ICAP-1α expression as monitored by Western blot analysis. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction between ICAP-1α and the β1 integrin, we carried out immunomicroscopy experiments of ICAP-1α in different cell lines. In HeLa cells, ICAP-1α showed a diffuse expression pattern and often some nuclear localization (Fig. 1 C, panel a). Surprisingly, no accumulation of ICAP-1α was observed in focal adhesions visualized by vinculin staining (Fig. 1 C,panels a–c). Similarly, we reported previously that in the Hs68 cell line, ICAP-1α and β1 colocalize in ruffles but not in focal adhesions (35Fournier H.N. Dupe-Manet S. Bouvard D. Lacombe M.L. Marie C. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20895-20902Google Scholar). A direct competition of endogenous ICAP-1α with the purified recombinant protein revealed a dramatic decrease in ICAP-1α immunostaining and confirmed the specificity of the immunolabeling (Fig. 1 C, panels d–f). Despite the diffuse ICAP-1α localization, these cells were able to form well-organized focal adhesions connected to stress fibers as judged by double labeling using a monoclonal antibody directed against vinculin and phalloidin-rhodamine-stained stress fibers (not shown). To have direct access to focal adhesion proteins, ventral plasma membranes were obtained from HeLa cells grown overnight on fibronectin. Double immunostaining was performed with an anti-vinculin antibody and anti-ICAP-1α polyclonal antibodies. In these membrane preparations, focal adhesions could be viewed by vinculin staining (Fig.1 D, panel b) or by talin or β1staining (not shown), whereas anti-ICAP-1α antibodies showed a faint background staining that was barely detectable (Fig. 1 D,panel a). Altogether these results suggest that ICAP-1α is not present in focal adhesions. The absence of ICAP-1α in focal adhesions prompted us to study the interaction of ICAP-1α with β1 integrins in more detail. ICAP-1α and the β1 cytoplasmic domains were expressed in bacteria as polyhistidine fusion proteins. Fig.2 A shows that the purified ICAP-1α protein interacted specifically with the purified β1 cytoplasmic domain in a solid-phase assay, which is consistent with previous reports (23Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Google Scholar, 26Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Google Scholar). As a control, we used a β1 cytoplasmic domain bearing the point mutation Y to S in the NPXY membrane distal (cyto3) domain. In full agreement with a previous report (23Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Google Scholar), this mutation abolished the interaction between ICAP-1α and the β1 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2 A). Next, we tested whether ICAP-1α was able to interact with the whole α5β1 integrin from a CHO cell lysate. This was crucial, because beta subunits do not exist in isolation in cells, and therefore, two hybrid experiments with integrins may be prone to artifacts. Increasing amounts of the recombinant ICAP-1α protein were used to coat 96-well trays. The protein concentration during coating was maintained constant by adding BSA. An equal amount of a CHO cell lysate in Triton X-100 was subsequently incubated in each coated well. A dose-dependent and -specific binding of the β1 integrin was detected by a specific antibody (Fig.2 B). These data indicate that ICAP-1α expressed in bacteria is able to interact with the β1Α cytoplasmic domain, and that the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit did not impair the interaction with ICAP-1α. Finally, we expressed ICAP-1α fragments in bacteria and used them in a solid-phase binding assay to map the β1 binding site. Only the C-terminal moiety (amino acids 100–200) of the protein was able to bind to the β1 integrin (Fig. 2 C). But neither the fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–150 nor the fragment corresponding to amino acids 151–200 of ICAP-1α were found to interact strongly with the α5β1 integrin from cell lysate (Fig. 2 C). Despite its specific and direct association with the β1 integrin, ICAP-1α was not localized in focal adhesions. One possible explanation for these contradictory results could be that ICAP-1α might act as a negative regulator of the recruitment of focal adhesion components. To investigate this possibility we microinjected ICAP-1α recombinant protein into the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells and monitored focal adhesion organization by staining for vinculin. Although microinjection of dextran-coupled rhodamine alone had no significant effect on the localization of vinculin (Fig.3, A–C), talin, and α-actinin (not shown), microinjection of the full-length ICAP-1α in the dextran-coupled rhodamine buffer induced a rapid delocalization of vinculin (Fig. 3, D–F) or talin and α-actinin (not shown) observed in 70% of the cells. Microinjection of the C-terminal moiety of ICAP-1α (amino acids 101–200) that encompasses the β1 binding site had similar effects (Fig. 3,J–L) in 77% of the injected cells. Because the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–100) does not bind the β1integrin domain (Fig. 2 C), we made use of this recombinant fragment as a control. Indeed, the microinjection of this part of ICAP-1α did not interfere with vinculin staining (Fig. 3,G–I). Finally, disruption of focal adhesions by ICAP-1α was also investigated in a cellular context after stable transfection into GD25-β1A cells of a vector containing human ICAP-1α cDNA. This cell line expresses functional β1integrins at the cell surface (19Wennerberg K. Fassler R. Warmegard B. Johansson S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1117-1126Google Scholar) that can be monitored by the 9EG7 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a ligand-induced binding site epitope correlating with the occupied conformational state of β1 integrins (36Bazzoni G. Shih D.T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Google Scholar, 37Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Jeno P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, immunofluorescence microscopy did not reveal any detectable staining for endogenous ICAP-1α in GD25-β1A cells (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, these cells exhibited surface expression of β1A integrins confined to focal adhesions that could be monitored by the 9EG7 antibody (Fig. 4 B). In a non-clonal population of GD25-β1A cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the human ICAP-1α, a positive immunofluorescence signal for ICAP-1α was diffusely present within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C). Simultaneously, a diminution of cell spreading and loss of 9EG7 monoclonal antibody staining was observed, suggesting that β1 integrins were no longer occupied and involved in focal adhesions (Fig. 4 D). The action of ICAP-1α on focal adhesions might be indirect, for instance due to the interference with some regulatory pathways. Therefore, the purified recombinant ICAP-1α was also tested for its ability to disassemble focal adhesions in vitro in a cytosol-free ventral plasma membrane preparation (VPM). These preparations are depleted in nucleotide triphosphate and soluble signaling enzymes. The cell membranes were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a solution of purified ICAP-1α in acetate buffer and glucose. Although buffer alone did not interfere with the detection of focal adhesion proteins such as vinculin (Fig. 5 A), the incubation with ICAP-1α efficiently displaced vinculin from focal adhesions (Fig. 5 B). A similar result was also observed for talin and α-actinin (not shown). The same result was obtained by the incubation of the C-terminal part (amino acids 101–200) of ICAP-1α (Fig. 5 D). Finally, incubation of these ventral membranes with the N-terminal purified fragment (amino acids 1–100) had no effect on focal adhesion organization (Fig. 5 C). ICAP-1α was suggested to have a GDP dissociating inhibitor activity for Rac and Cdc42 (38Degani S. Balzac F. Brancaccio M. Guazzone S. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Eva A. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 377-387Google Scholar), two monomeric G proteins of the Rho family involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization. This activity might account for ICAP-1α destabilizing action on focal adhesions of ventral plasma membranes. To assess whether ICAP-1α action on focal adhesions was due to its direct binding on β1 integrin chains or to some interference with Rho signaling pathways, we performed similar experiment on VPM from GD-25β1A and GD-25β1D cells lines. The β1D and β1A isoforms are functionally similar with regard to integrin-mediated signaling (39Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Google Scholar), but the former strongly binds talin (31Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fassler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Google Scholar) and does not bind ICAP-1α (38Degani S. Balzac F. Brancaccio M. Guazzone S. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Eva A. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 377-387Google Scholar). Upon addition of the ICAP-1α fragment 100–200, the dispersion of β1A integrins initially clustered into focal adhesions was observed (Fig. 6, A andC), whereas β1D-containing focal adhesions remained unaffected (Fig. 6, B and D). This result strongly suggests that a direct interaction between ICAP-1α and the β1 chain is a prerequisite for focal adhesion disassembly. Because talin interacts directly with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain and is crucial for focal adhesion assembly, one attractive hypothesis is that ICAP-1α is involved in the control of talin-integrin interaction. Therefore, we tested whether ICAP-1α could modulate the binding of talin to the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain. In anin vitro solid-phase assay, ICAP-1α could inhibit talin binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the β1A chain in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 A). These data suggest that the displacement of talin from its binding site on β1Amay be sufficient for focal adhesion disruption and, consequently, for a decrease in the integrin avidity. Moreover, the competition of ICAP-1α and talin for the binding to β1 was specific, because it could not be observed either with α-actinin, another β1 interacting protein (Fig. 7 B), or with the 1–100 ICAP-1α moiety (Fig. 7 C). We examined the cellular localization of the endogenous ICAP-1α protein. Surprisingly, this protein was never detected in focal adhesions, but instead, exhibited a diffuse pattern within the cell, although a significant amount of the protein was associated within the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (not shown) and often, a nuclear staining was observed. Using purified ventral membrane preparation from HeLa cells, we never observed ICAP-1α colocalized with vinculin or talin, which were used as markers of focal adhesions. Even though ICAP-1α was not detected in focal adhesions, the purified recombinant protein interacted strongly with the cytoplasmic domain of the β1A integrin chain as reported previously (23Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Google Scholar, 26Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Google Scholar). Additionally, this interaction also occurred with the whole integrin receptors purified from a cell lysate. The strong binding of ICAP-1α to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 integrin and its complete absence from focal adhesions suggested that this interaction may disrupt focal adhesion structures. To confirm this hypothesis we microinjected ICAP-1α in NIH3T3 cells, and we indeed observed a rapid disorganization of focal adhesions. In addition, recombinant ICAP-1α was able to disaggregate focal adhesions when added to purified ventral plasma membranes from NIH3T3 and GD-25β1A cells. Conversely, the β1D-containing integrins were resistant to ICAP-1α. This latter experiment strongly suggests that the disassembly of focal adhesions is due to a direct interaction with the β1A integrin subunit and is independent of a cellular signaling pathway. Furthermore, the focal adhesion disruption mediated by ICAP-1α is in good correlation with our previous data, which have shown that ectopic expression of ICAP-1α-regulated CHO cell spreading (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that talin is crucial for the formation of focal adhesions (27Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Google Scholar, 28Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Google Scholar, 40Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Google Scholar). A simple explanation for the negative effect of ICAP-1α on focal adhesion structure could be its ability to disrupt the direct association between the integrin and talin. To investigate this hypothesis we performed an in vitro assay and found that talin and ICAP-1α compete for binding to the β1A cytoplasmic domain. On the other hand, we found that the interaction between α-actinin and the β1 integrin is not inhibited by the presence of ICAP-1α. This shows that ICAP-1α inhibits the interaction between β1A integrins and talin in a specific manner and confirms previous reports showing that the interaction of α-actinin with the β1cytoplasmic domain is not sufficient to stabilize focal adhesion sites (40Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Google Scholar). The lack of effect of ICAP-1α on β1D localization suggests that, under our experimental conditions, this action is direct and not dependent on the GDP dissociating inhibitor activity recently suggested (38Degani S. Balzac F. Brancaccio M. Guazzone S. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Eva A. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 377-387Google Scholar). Based on these findings we propose that ICAP-1α and talin compete for integrin β1A binding and thereby modulate focal adhesion assembly and/or dynamic. How ICAP-1α interferes with talin binding on the β1 integrin needs further investigation. The talin binding site is not unambiguously defined. Recent reports have demonstrated that the talin N-terminal head binds to the β3, β1A, and β1D cytoplasmic domains (41Patil S. Jedsadayanmata A. Wencel-Drake J.D. Wang W. Knezevic I. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28575-28583Google Scholar, 42Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Google Scholar). Some data indicated that the binding site of the talin head could be located on the proximal membrane region of the integrin β chain (41Patil S. Jedsadayanmata A. Wencel-Drake J.D. Wang W. Knezevic I. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28575-28583Google Scholar). Conversely, other reports indicate that a phosphotyrosine binding-like subdomain of the FERM domain of talin head is the major binding site that triggers the activation of the αIIbβ3 integrin (43Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21749-21758Google Scholar). This finding is very interesting, because it offers some molecular basis of ICAP-1α and talin competition. Indeed, sequence homology and molecular modeling favor the view that ICAP-1α is a phosphotyrosine binding domain protein. It was suggested that the interaction specificity with the β1A cytosolic tail was due to the interaction of Val-787 on the integrin and an hydrophobic pocket created by Leu-82 and Tyr-144 of ICAP-1α (25Chang D.D. Hoang B.Q. Liu J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8140-8145Google Scholar). This is fairly consistent with the lack of interaction of ICAP-1α with the β1D isoform that do not have a valine at this position. This latter residue is very close to the tyrosine 783 on the human β1A chain. The tyrosine at this position on the β1 chain or on the homologous position 747 on the β3 chain seems to be crucial for integrin conformational switch and talin head binding. Moreover, talin C-terminal rod domain contains another binding site located within the residues 1984–2541 (44Xing B. Jedsadayanmata A. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44373-44378Google Scholar). Because the talin-active form is an anti-parallel homodimer (32Vignoud L. Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430Google Scholar, 45Goldmann W.H. Bremer A. Haner M. Aebi U. Isenberg G. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 3-10Google Scholar), the head and tail integrin binding sites in the adjacent talin molecules would be in close proximity with each other. Therefore, it is likely that talin and ICAP-1α binding sites on the integrin β1A tail overlap. The distribution of ICAP-1α in ruffles and its absence from focal adhesions suggest that the interaction between ICAP-1α and the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain is regulated. It is possible that ICAP-1α is sequestered inside the cell and that the interaction between a sequestering protein and ICAP-1α may be the regulated event. Alternatively, the interaction of ICAP-1α with the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 integrin may be modulated by post-translational modifications (like phosphorylation). Indeed we have previously shown that a point mutation into the CaMKII putative phosphorylation site dramatically affected cell spreading (13Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Google Scholar). Moreover, pull-down assays showed that only a small fraction of ICAP-1α was able to interact with β1A (26Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Google Scholar). How the interaction of ICAP-1α and the integrin is regulated is not yet understood and requires further investigations. Recently, a 20-kDa protein named TAP-20 (with marked homology with β3-endonexin) was shown to interact specifically with the β5 cytosolic domain of the αvβ5 integrin (46Tang S. Gao Y. Ware J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1073-1084Google Scholar). Overexpression of this protein leads to decreased adhesion and focal adhesion formation, and enhances migration. These properties are quite reminiscent of those of ICAP-1α, suggesting that a family of negative regulators may control specific integrin classes in a similar fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2047019439,"Host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites is accompanied by the rapid, polarized secretion of parasite proteins that are involved in cell attachment. The Toxoplasma gondii micronemal protein MIC2 contains several extracellular adhesive domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Following apical secretion, MIC2 is transiently present on the parasite surface before being translocated backward and released by proteolytic cleavage. Mutations in the extracellular domain of MIC2, directly upstream of the transmembrane domain, prevented processing and release of the soluble protein into the supernatant. A conserved basic residue in MIC2 was essential for cleavage, and basic residues are similarly positioned in other microneme proteins. Following the induction of secretion, MIC2 processing mutants were stably expressed on the surface of the parasite. Surface MIC2-expressing mutants showed increased adhesion to host cells, yet were impaired in their capacity to invade. These data demonstrate that proteolysis is essential for releasing cell surface adhesins prior to cell entry by apicomplexan parasites.

These data demonstrate that proteolysis is essential for releasing cell surface adhesins prior to cell entry by apicomplexan parasites. Toxoplasma gondii is member of the phylum Apicomplexa, a group of medically and economically important obligate intracellular parasites that includes Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. One of the first events in host cell recognition by T. gondii is the polarized release of parasite adhesins from secretory vesicles called micronemes (1Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123Google Scholar). Micronemal proteins contain a variety of conserved adhesive domains, and several have been demonstrated to bind to host cells (2Soldati D. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1293-1302Google Scholar). Despite their important role in cell attachment, microneme proteins only transiently occupy the parasite cell surface during the brief interval of cell invasion before being released into the extracellular medium. MIC2 is composed of a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; MPP1, microneme protein protease 1; M2AP, MIC2-associated protein; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast; HA, hemagglutinin; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; IF, immunofluorescence; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole domain, and an extracellular region composed of an integrin A-domain and six type 1 thrombospondin (TSP-1)-like repeats (3Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Google Scholar). The T. gondii microneme protein MIC2 belongs to the family of thrombospondin-related anonymous proteins (TRAPs) previously shown to be essential for host cell invasion by Plasmodiumsporozoites and ookinetes (4Dessens J.T. Beetsma A. Dimopoulos G. Wengelnik K. Crisanti A. Kafatos F.C. Sinden R.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6221-6227Google Scholar, 5Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V.

MIC2 is normally stored in the micronemes and is rapidly discharged at the apical tip of the parasite when it contacts the host cell (7Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Google Scholar). Following secretion, MIC2 is translocated backward as the parasite enters the cell, occupying the junction that forms between the host and parasite cell membranes. MIC2 is released into the medium by C-terminal processing that is carried out by a parasite protease called MPP1 (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar). The cleavage specificity of this protease is unknown, and it is insensitive to a variety of commonly used protease inhibitors. Throughout the processes of secretion, translocation, and release, MIC2 is complexed with another protein called MIC2-associated protein (M2AP), which is comprised of two extracellular domains but is not predicted to be anchored in the membrane (9Rabenau K.E. Sohrabi A. Tripathy A. Reitter C. Ajioka J.W. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 537-547Google Scholar). The cleavage of micronemal proteins upon secretion is a common feature of this protein family that occurs in MIC2, MIC6, MIC8, MIC12 (10Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Google Scholar), and AMA-1 (11Donahue C.G. Carruthers V.B. Gilk S.D. Ward G.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 15-30Google Scholar). It was recently reported that extensive mutations within the conserved TM domains of MIC2, MIC6, and MIC12 prevented their release into the medium, suggesting that processing of micronemal proteins may occur within the membrane (10Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Google Scholar). Intramembrane processing has been reported for proteins produced by a broad range of organisms from bacteria to humans (12Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar). However, in other examples of intramembrane processing, cleavage within the membrane-spanning domain is always preceded by a separate proteolytic processing step that releases the extracellular domain (12Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar). We show here that mutations in the exodomain of MIC2, directly upstream of the TM domain, prevent the cleavage and release of the protein from the cell surface, revealing that microneme proteins are likely processed in multiple steps. Parasites expressing uncleaved MIC2 on their surface showed increased adherence to host cells but impaired invasion, demonstrating an important role for the processing of MIC2 during cell entry. MIC2 was detected with monoclonal antibody 6D10 as described previously (3Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Google Scholar). The c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and the HA9 epitope was detected using rabbit antisera (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Rabbit anti-SAG1 was provided by Lloyd Kasper (Dartmouth Medical School). M2AP and MIC5 were detected using rabbit antisera provided by Vern Carruthers (Johns Hopkins University). Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH hxgprt −strain (obtained form David Roos, University of Pennsylvania) were maintained by growth in monolayers of human foreskin fibroblast (HFFs), propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20 μg ml−1 gentamicin (referred to as D10). Transformed strains were cultivated in D10 supplemented with 25 μg ml−1 of mycophenolic acid and 50 μg ml−1 of xanthine. Constructs for expression of MIC2 in T. gondiiwere based on the HXGPRT selection plasmids described previously (13Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Google Scholar). The full-length MIC2 cDNA encoding the complete open reading frame and ∼ 1 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking genomic regions was inserted into this vector to create MIC2 expression plasmids for T. gondii. PCR-based cloning was used to add an HA9 tag (consisting of the residues YPYDVPDYAL) after amino acid 769, followed by a stop codon. The c-Myc epitope was inserted in-frame, replacing blocks of 10 amino acids at a time upstream of the TM domain of MIC2 from Ser-659 to Gly-698. PCR amplification was used to create point mutations in a plasmid bearing the MIC2 gene harboring the c-Myc tag from position Glu-679 to Gly-688 and the HA9 tag at position 770. Gene-specific primers were designed to change the residues 692SKKE695 to SAAE, SAKE, SKAE, SRAE, or SKER. The correct sequence of constructs was confirmed by cycle sequencing, and expression of the epitope-tagged forms of MIC2 was verified by transient expression in T. gondii as described previously (13Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Google Scholar). Freshly harvested parasites were purified and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS-Ca2+ containing 1% ethanol and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min), the supernatant containing secreted microneme proteins was used for Western blot experiments and the parasite pellet was used for Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred semi-dry to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were performed as described previously using ECL (Pierce) (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-M2AP or pre-immune rabbit sera were incubated separately with 100 μl of rec-protein A-coated Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 300 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Antibody coated beads were washed three times in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA). Purified parasites (5 × 107) were resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The lysates were added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer, and proteins bound to the beads were dissolved in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The amount of proteins loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels was normalized to the percentage of parasites expressing each epitope-tagged MIC2 protein. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-c-Myc. To detect microneme proteins within the parasite, HFF cell monolayers were infected with parasites and incubated overnight prior to being fixed and processed for IF (14Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc, anti-MIC2, or anti-MIC5 antibodies and then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 494 or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were washed and mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To detect microneme proteins at the cell surface, parasites were stimulated to secrete (see above) and then fixed and processed for IF as described previously (15Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Google Scholar). Non-permeabilized parasites were incubated with anti-c-Myc, rabbit anti-SAG1, or rabbit anti-M2AP primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies, and the cells were mounted in Vectashield. Slides were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) microscope equipped with phase contrast and epifluorescence optics. Images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioCam cooled charge-coupled device camera directed by Zeiss Axiovision software and processed using Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). HFF monolayers were infected with parasites during a 5-min pulse, washed, fixed gently in 3.4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with anti-SAG1 antibodies to reveal extracellular parasites. Following detergent permeabilization, cells were incubated with an anti c-Myc antibody to reveal transfected parasites expressing epitope-tagged forms of MIC2. Monolayers were washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI. To determine the percentage of transfected parasites that were adherent, the proportion of c-Myc-positive parasites in the starting inoculum (c-Myc positive) was compared with the proportion of parasites that were attached to host cells following a brief invasion pulse and staining for the surface protein SAG1 (c-Myc positive and SAG positive). Data are presented as fold increase that was calculated as the percentage of c-Myc-positive parasites bound to host cells per the percentage of c-Myc-positive parasites in the inoculum. Values represent the mean ± S.E. from three experiments. To determine the percentage of transformed parasites that successfully entered the host cells, the number of c-Myc positive parasites that was attached to host cells (SAG1 positive and DAPI positive) was compared with the number that was intracellular (SAG1 negative but DAPI positive). Values are presented as the percentage of invasion based on three similar experiments (mean ± S.E.). The c-Myc epitope was inserted to generate in-frame mutations upstream of the predicted TM domain of MIC2 (Fig.1 A). To detect processing, the proteins were also tagged with the HA9 epitope at the C terminus (Fig.1 A). Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to c-Myc and another microneme protein, MIC5, revealed that all the epitope-tagged proteins were faithfully targeted to micronemes in the parasite (Fig. 1 B). Epitope-tagged genes were transiently transfected into T. gondii, and secretion of the expressed proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis of proteins released into the supernatant. Insertion of the c-Myc epitope at residues 689–698 in the construct referred to as mut4 completely prevented the release of the protein into the supernatant following stimulation of secretion (Fig. 2 A). The region of MIC2 that was removed in creating mut4 contains two lysines located at positions 692 and 693, and this site resembles the substrates for trypsin-like enzymes, including subtilisins. To test the involvement of these residues, the two lysines were replaced by alanines to create mutAA (Fig. 1 A). The mutAA form of MIC2 was not released into the supernatant after induction of secretion (Fig. 2 A). This lack of processing was not a consequence of the c-Myc epitope, as placement of the tag at residues 679–688 in the construct referred to as MIC2-TAG, or at other sites upstream of this, did not prevent secretion (Fig. 2 A, and data not shown). Transient expression of epitope-tagged forms of MIC2 did not discernibly affect secretion of the endogenous wild type MIC2 protein (Fig. 2 A, and data not shown). The HA9 tag was only detected in the full-length form of the protein found in the cell pellet (Fig.2 A), indicating that, when secreted, the C terminus was removed by proteolytic processing as described previously (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar).Figure 2MIC2 processing mutants are stably retained on the cell surface following secretion. A, Western blot analysis of secreted microneme proteins by transiently transfected parasites. Although epitope-tagged MIC2 (MIC2-TAG) was secreted normally and appeared in the supernatant (S), insertion of the c-Myc tag within mut4 or the point mutations in mutAA disrupted secretion and resulted in retention in the pellet (P). The tagged proteins were detected using antibodies against c-Myc (middle panel) or HA9 (bottom panel). As an internal control for secretion of the endogenous form of MIC2, the monoclonal antibody against MIC2 (6D10) was used in the top panel. All three panels contain proteins from the MIC2-TAG, mut4, and mutAA parasites, respectively. B, immunolocalization of epitope-tagged MIC2 proteins at the surface of the parasites following secretion. Although the wild type (MIC2-TAG) protein was turned over rapidly, both mut4 and mutAA forms accumulated on the surface, primarily at the posterior end of the cell. Following stimulation of secretion, cells were fixed and then incubated with anti-c-Myc and anti-SAG1 antibodies in the absence of permeabilization. Epitope-tagged MIC2 proteins and SAG1 were detected using secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 494 (red) and Alexa 488 (green), respectively. Thearrows represent the extruded conoid at the apical end of the parasites. Scale bar = 2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MPP1 is a parasite protease that acts on MIC2 only once it has been released onto the parasite surface (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of secretion of mut4 and mutAA could be due to their failure to be released onto the cell surface following stimulation of secretion. The localization of epitope-tagged forms of MIC2 was examined after stimulation of microneme discharge. Parasites were stained with antibodies in the absence of permeabilization to reveal proteins on the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). Epitope-tagged MIC2 (MIC2-TAG) was not detected on the parasite cell surface (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the fact that this protein is rapidly secreted, processed, and released into the supernatant as described previously (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2 A). In contrast, parasites expressing mut4 or mutAA were strongly labeled with anti c-Myc antibodies on their surface as shown by colocalization with staining for the cell surface protein SAG1 (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, mut4 and mutAA were often concentrated at the posterior end of the parasites, whereas the extruded conoid, located at the apical end, was weakly labeled (Fig.2 B). Absence of staining with antibodies to the HA9 epitope, which is attached to the cytoplasmic domain (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar), was used to verify that the parasites that stained positively for epitope-tagged MIC2 were not permeabilized during the IF procedure (data not shown). During secretion and surface translocation, MIC2 remains associated with the protein M2AP (9Rabenau K.E. Sohrabi A. Tripathy A. Reitter C. Ajioka J.W. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 537-547Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged MIC2 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with M2AP (Fig.3 A), showing that the mutations and/or the insertion of the c-Myc tag do not alter the interaction with M2AP. In parasites expressing the non-processed forms of MIC2, M2AP was retained on the cell surface (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, in parasites expressing wild type epitope-tagged MIC2 (MIC2-TAG), M2AP was not retained on the surface of the cell (Fig.3 B). To examine whether the surface localization of other MIC proteins was affected by the expression of non-processed forms of MIC2, we performed surface IF assay staining as described above. No accumulation of MIC4, MIC5, or MIC6 was observed in parasites expressing non-processed forms of MIC2 (data not shown). Collectively, these data show that, upon secretion, mutAA and mut4 are transferred to the surface of the parasite where they are complexed with M2AP; however, they are not released into the supernatant because of the failure of MIC2 to be proteolytically processed. We analyzed whether the enhanced retention of MIC2 on the surface of parasites expressing processing mutants would result in alterations in binding to host cells. Because the percentage of cells expressing the epitope-tagged MIC2 proteins (c-Myc positive parasites) was different between constructs and in separate experiments (a natural feature of transient expression assays), binding was expressed as a fold change in the proportion of positively expressing cells that were attached to host cellsversus the proportion that was present in the challenge inoculum (varied from 5–35%). Parasites expressing the processing mutant mut4 or mutAA strains showed enhanced binding to HFF cells by 3.8- and 2.8-fold, respectively (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the ratio observed for parasites expressing MIC2-TAG was 0.9, indicating that their capacity to adhere to the cells was not significantly different to that observed in the untransfected population (Fig. 4 A). These data indicate that parasites expressing non-processed forms of MIC2 on their cell surface have an enhanced capacity to adhere to host cells. To determine whether the enhanced attachment to host cells by surface MIC2-expressing parasites also affected invasion, the efficiency of cell entry was evaluated. When parasites transfected with the MIC2-TAG form were used to challenge host cell monolayers, between 50–70% of the parasites that were associated with the monolayer were also able to enter the host cell (Fig. 4 B). Although the efficiency of invasion was reduced in parasites expressing MIC2-TAG, it was not significantly different from that of non-transfected parasites (Fig.4 B). In contrast, only 10% of adherent parasites expressing mut4 or mutAA were able to enter the cells, a result that was significantly different from that observed with MIC2-TAG (p < 0.05, Student's t test). These data indicate that the unusual persistence of MIC2 at the surface of the parasite enhances binding but does not lead to productive cell entry. To analyze the contribution of Lys-692 and Lys-693 to the cleavage of MIC2, we substituted each amino acid independently with an alanine leading to the construction of mutAK and mutKA constructs (Fig.5 A). Additionally, we generated a mutant, mutRA, in which Lys-692 was substituted by arginine (Fig. 5 A). These constructs were transiently expressed inT. gondii, and the capacity of the parasite to secrete the epitope-tagged proteins was analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The supernatants from parasites expressing MIC2-TAG, mutKA, and mutRA contained the secreted form of MIC2, indicating that these forms were properly cleaved by MPP1 (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, epitope-tagged MIC2 was not found in the supernatants of mutAA- and mutAK-expressing parasites (Fig. 5 B). These data demonstrate that Lys-693 is not essential for the cleavage of MIC2, whereas Lys-692, which can be replaced by arginine, is required for processing. The sequence KER, which is found upstream of the TM domain of MIC6, was also inserted in place of the 691SKK693 of MIC2 to create mutKER. When transfected into T. gondii, the mutKER form of MIC2 was properly secreted, processed, and released into the supernatant (Fig. 5 B). The ability of this sequence to be recognized in the context of MIC2 suggests that it may fulfill a similar role in MIC6. Furthermore, analysis of other microneme proteins from T. gondii (TgMIC6, TgMIC12, and TgMIC8), Plasmodium falciparum (PfTRAP) or Neospora caninum(NcMIC2) revealed that a conserved lysine is located within residues −11 and −13 from the putative beginning of their transmembrane domains (Fig. 5 C). Proteolytic processing plays an important role in the maturation and activation of microneme protein apicomplexans (2Soldati D. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1293-1302Google Scholar). Processing of the micronemal protein MIC3 has been shown to be essential to activate its adhesive properties (16Cérede O. Dubremetz J.F. Bout D. Lebrun M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2526-2536Google Scholar). Similarly, processing of the malarial protein MSP1 on the surface of merozoites is important for exposing an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain that is involved in cell recognition (17Uthaipibull C. Aufiero B. Syed A.E. Hansen B. Patiño J.A.G. Angov E. Ling I.T. Fegeding K. Morgan W.D. Ockenhouse C. Birdsall B. Feeney J. Lyon J.A. Holder A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1381-1394Google Scholar). Following the release of full-length MIC2 from the anterior end of the parasite, it is translocated to the posterior end of the cell before being released into the medium (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar, 14Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Google Scholar). MIC2 occurs as a complex with M2AP that is released from the cell surface following cleavage of MIC2 by a surface or secreted protease called MPP1, which is insensitive to a variety of inhibitors (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that mutations in a sequence just upstream of the predicted transmembrane domain of MIC2 disrupt the processing and prevent release of the protein complex into the medium. Importantly, these mutant forms of MIC2 are still normally packaged in the micronemes, secreted upon stimulation, and efficiently delivered to the cell surface. Processing of cell surface MIC2 was critically dependent on a basic amino acid positioned −11 residues upstream of the predicted TM domain, and a mutation of this residue abolished processing. A similar basic residue is found 11–13 residues upstream of the TM domains of a variety of microneme proteins, suggesting a similar requirement in proteolytic processing. Collectively, these results suggest that MPP1 is responsible for cleavage of a variety of MIC proteins from the cell surface and that it may recognize a sequence that includes a basic residue. A more complete characterization of the processing site of MPP1 awaits additional mutational analysis and determination of the specific cleavage site by peptide sequencing or mass spectrometry. Our results lead to a different model from that recently proposed for the release of microneme proteins by intramembrane processing (10Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Google Scholar). Mutations in the conserved TM domains of MIC2 and MIC6 blocked release of chimeric, heterologous proteins into the supernatant (10Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Google Scholar). This result is somewhat unexpected, because in other well studied examples of intramembrane processing there is little sequence specificity to the cleavage site (18Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Google Scholar). Rather, the major determinant of which TM domains are susceptible to intramembrane proteolysis is the lack of a significantly sized lumenal or extracellular domain (18Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Google Scholar). Furthermore, in other examples of intramembrane protein processing, cleavage within the membrane is secondary and is always preceded by a primary cleavage that removes the extracellular or lumenal domain of the protein (12Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar,19Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Google Scholar). Our findings clearly establish that the extracellular domain of MIC2 is essential for proteolytic processing that releases MIC2 into the supernatant. Interestingly, Opitz et al., (10Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Google Scholar) also reported that insertion of c-Myc outside the TM domain disrupted processing of MIC2; however, they did not follow up on the precise residues involved in this effect. Our studies implicate a basic residue just outside the TM domain as being critical for processing of MIC2. Whether this basic residue is involved in the cleavage siteper se or is simply part of an extended recognition domain will require further studies to determine. MIC2 is a homologue of the malaria protein called TRAP, which is essential for gliding motility and cell invasion by malaria sporozoites (5Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Google Scholar, 20Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H. Nussenzweig V. Ménard R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 937-943Google Scholar). TRAP mediates entry into mammalian and insect cells, indicating that it contains recognition motifs for highly conserved receptor molecules (21Matuschewski K. Nunes A.C. Nussenzweig V. Ménard R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1597-1606Google Scholar, 22Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J.H. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Google Scholar). Recognition of host cell receptors by TRAP is likely mediated by an integrin A domain and a single type 1 thrombospondin domain that have been shown to bind to sulfated glycansin vitro (23McCormack C.J. Tuckwell D.S. Crisanti A. Humphries M.J. Hollingdale M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 111-124Google Scholar, 24Muller H.-M. Rechmann I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Google Scholar, 25Robson K.J.H. Frevert U. Reckmann I. Cowan G. Beier J. Scragg I.G. Takehara K. Bishop D.H.L. Pradel G. Sinden R. Saccheo S. Muller H.-M. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3883-3894Google Scholar). MIC2 contains similar adhesive domains for the recognition of glycosaminoglycans and binds to host cellsin vitro, suggesting that it may participate in the recognition of host cell glycosaminoglycans by the parasite (14Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Google Scholar,26Carruthers V.B. Håkansson S. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4005-4011Google Scholar, 27Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1267-1276Google Scholar). Parasites expressing mutant forms of MIC2 on the cell surface exhibited enhanced binding to host cells, suggesting that MIC2 plays a role in cell attachment. Recently, it was shown that disruption of the M2AP gene results in reduced targeting of MIC2 to the micronemes and decreased attachment and entry of host cells. 2V. B. Carruthers, personal communication. Collectively, these findings indicate that the MIC2/M2AP complex plays an important role in cell recognition. Although the stable expression of MIC2 on the parasite surface led to enhance binding to host cells, it had the opposite effect on entry. These findings indicate that the expression of MIC2/M2AP on the cell surface must be carefully regulated and that turnover of the complex is essential for productive entry. Precedent for such a dual role in binding and regulated release has been reported for the vertebrate cell surface hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, which participates in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Proteolytic cleavage of CD44 from the surface of vertebrate cells decreases attachment with the substratum, thus facilitating cell migration, a process important for metastasis of some tumor cells (28Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Google Scholar). Typically, adhesins are stably expressed on the surface of microorganisms, where their ability to bind host cell receptors often facilitates entry by activating host cell endocytosis (29Ireton K. Cossart P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 276-283Google Scholar). Apicomplexan parasites accomplish this process in a fundamentally different manner. Adhesins are stored in apical secretory organelles and discharged at the time of cell contact. The directional translocation of adhesin-receptor complexes from the anterior to the posterior end of the parasite accompanies host cell penetration. TRAP family adhesins participate in this directional attachment and likely facilitate cell entry by interaction with the parasite's actin-myosin cytoskeleton, which provides the essential propulsive force for cell entry (30Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Google Scholar, 31Ménard R. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 63-73Google Scholar, 32Sibley L.D. Håkansson S. Carruthers V.B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R12-R14Google Scholar). Importantly, uncoupling of this process by the prevention of proteolytic processing of MIC2 enhanced binding to host cells but did not lead to productive entry. Our findings underscore the fact that polarized secretion, translocation, and proteolytic processing must be tightly coupled for efficient invasion. Proteolysis is important in controlling a variety of complex processes in parasites, including cell entry and egress by Plasmodium(33Blackman M.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 59-83Google Scholar), tissue migration by Schistosoma (34Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parastiol. 2002; 120: 1-21Google Scholar), and development in Giardia (35Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Lujan H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). Proteolysis is known to activate parasite proteins, enabling them to recognize host cell receptors in a variety of adhesins including MIC3 (16Cérede O. Dubremetz J.F. Bout D. Lebrun M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2526-2536Google Scholar), MSP1 (36Holder A.A. Blackman M.J. Burghaus P.A. Chappel J.A. Ling I.T. McCallum-Deighton N. Shai S. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1992; 87: 37-42Google Scholar), and AMA-1 (37Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that proteolysis is also critically important for releasing parasite adhesins from the cell surface, thus breaking the attachment to host cell receptors prior to the completion of cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites. We thank Antonio Barragan and Dan Goldberg for fruitful discussions and Vern Carruthers for critical review of the manuscript."

DNA replication and transcription are strongly inhibited by cross-links because the two strands of duplex DNA cannot be separated, and thus cross-links are highly cytotoxic (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cross-links are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as melphalan and cisplatin; however, very little is known about how cross-links affect on DNA replication or transcription at molecular level (2McHugh P.J. Spanswick V.J. Hartley J.A. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).Cross-links are also challenging to DNA repair, because most DNA repair systems use the complementary strand to restore the genetic information after removal of DNA lesions from one strand of the duplex (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of cross-link repair in mammalian cells remains to be elucidated. Genetic data implicated the involvement of XPF·ERCC1 complex, Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B, C, and D), and other double strand break (DSB) repair proteins because mutant cells defective in these factors are highly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 4Thompson L.H. Mutation Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). XRCC2 (5Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and XRCC3 (6Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) are involved in DNA double strand break repair by recombination. Recent biochemical data demonstrated that the Rad51 paralogs modulate Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange (7Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Sigurdsson S. van Komen S. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The XPF·ERCC1 complex is a cross-link-specific 3′ to 5′ exonuclease (9Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is required for targeted homologous recombination as well (10Adair G.M. Rolig R.L. Moore-Favor D. Zabelshansky M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5552-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtjens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the cross-link repair reaction dependent on the XPF·ERCC1 complex and recombination machinery, DNA strand breaks may be requisite for XRCC2 and XRCC3 to participate in the cross-link repair reaction, and a 3′ end is needed for the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the XPF·ERCC1 complex. However, how these DNA breaks are generated and what proteins are required for generation of the breaks are not understood. Interestingly, DNA replication-dependent double strand breaks have been detected in mammalian cells after treatment of the cells with DNA cross-linking agents (12de Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus double strand breaks could be an important intermediate in cross-link repair in mammalian cells, because these breaks provide a 3′ end near the cross-linked site for the processing of the cross-link by the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the XPF·ERCC1 complex to generate an appropriate substrate for homologous recombination. It is also reported that DNA replication is required to elicit a cell cycle delay response to cross-link in mammalian cells (13Akkari Y.M.N. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These data strongly implicate a crucial role of DNA replication in cross-link repair in mammalian cells.To study the effect of cross-links on DNA replication, a cell-free SV40 ori-dependent DNA replication system (14Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Stillman B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 522-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used. DNA replication was inhibited by the psoralen cross-links and mediated formation of double strand breaks near the cross-linked sites. These DNA replication-mediated double strand breaks are likely the intermediates in cross-link repair reactions in human cells.DISCUSSIONLittle is known about the molecular mechanism of repair of DNA interstrand cross-links in humans. Based on the genetic data with DNA cross-linking agent-hypersensitive mutant cell lines, it has been proposed that a structure-specific endonuclease XPF·ERCC1 complex (4Thompson L.H.

Grompe and co-workers (13Akkari Y.M.N. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) demonstrated that psoralen cross-links are not repaired in G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle until the subsequent S phase. However, there is no direct evidence that DNA replication mediates formation of DSBs at or near cross-link sites. This report is the first biochemical demonstration of the link between DNA replication and cross-link repair. Based on the data presented here, I propose a molecular mechanism of cross-link repair in humans (Fig. 5). Three major steps will be considered in cross-link repair in humans: (1) generation of a DSB at or near a cross-link site, (2) unhooking of the cross-link, and (3) processing of the DSB and the unhooked gapped DNA. DNA replication is inhibited near the cross-link sites probably for two reasons: one is due to the inability of the two strands to be unwound and another is because of the physical blockage to polymerase progression by the DNA lesions on each of the strands. A stalled DNA polymerase generates a unique DNA structure, which is a substrate for a structure-specific endonuclease to incise one of the template strands. The result is a generation of a double strand break at one side of the growing fork and a gap on the other side. If an incision occurs on a template for leading strand synthesis, a 3′ end to the cross-link will be generated. The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of XPF·ERCC1 complex will unhook the cross-link. After unhooking of the cross-link, the DSB and the gap are repaired by DSB repair. A lesion left on one strand after unhooking of the cross-link will be repaired by nucleotide excision repair.A major role of DNA replication in cross-link repair will be formation of a “Y-shape” DNA structure at a stalled site. The Y-shape structure contains two junctures with different polarity. One in lagging strand synthesis is suitable for the FEN-1 family of nucleases (20Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and another in leading strand synthesis is a good substrate for XPF·ERCC1 complex (21Bessho T. Sancar A. Thompson L.H.

An incision in either juncture results in a formation of a DSB; however, the latter juncture will be preferable because an incision at this juncture will provide a 3′ nick to a cross-link, which is further processed by the cross-link-unhooking exonuclease activity of XPF·ERCC1 complex (9Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Identification of the corresponding nuclease in the generation of DSBs during DNA replication-mediated cross-link repair is under way. It will also be very interesting to examine whether a stalled DNA polymerase plays a direct role in recruiting an endonuclease to a cross-linked site.Using a cell-free system without DNA replication, it has been shown that psoralen cross-links induce an XPF·ERCC1- and XRCC3-dependent DNA synthesis both in damaged and undamaged DNA (homologous or heterologous DNA), and hMutSβ and XPF·ERCC1 complex are required to unhook psoralen cross-links during the DNA synthesis in the absence of DNA replication (26Li L. Peterson A.C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both reports demonstrated “DNA repair synthesis” in damaged DNA in the presence of exogenous DNA; however, it is not clear that the observed DNA synthesis is the complete repaired product or a futile DNA repair synthesis (9Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) because fully repaired fragments were not examined. It is very interesting to examine the effect of DNA replication on cross-link repair using the cell-free DNA replication system reported here. DNA interstrand cross-links (cross-links) 1The abbreviations used are: cross-links, DNA interstrand cross-links; ori, origin of replication; XL, psoralen interstrand cross-link; DSB, double strand break; nt, nucleotide; MA, mono-adduct 1The abbreviations used are: cross-links, DNA interstrand cross-links; ori, origin of replication; XL, psoralen interstrand cross-link; DSB, double strand break; nt, nucleotide; MA, mono-adduct are unique DNA damage because the two complementary strands of duplex DNA are covalently linked through DNA lesions across the strands. DNA replication and transcription are strongly inhibited by cross-links because the two strands of duplex DNA cannot be separated, and thus cross-links are highly cytotoxic (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cross-links are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as melphalan and cisplatin; however, very little is known about how cross-links affect on DNA replication or transcription at molecular level (2McHugh P.J. Spanswick V.J. Hartley J.A. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cross-links are also challenging to DNA repair, because most DNA repair systems use the complementary strand to restore the genetic information after removal of DNA lesions from one strand of the duplex (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of cross-link repair in mammalian cells remains to be elucidated. Genetic data implicated the involvement of XPF·ERCC1 complex, Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B, C, and D), and other double strand break (DSB) repair proteins because mutant cells defective in these factors are highly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 4Thompson L.H. Mutation Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). XRCC2 (5Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and XRCC3 (6Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) are involved in DNA double strand break repair by recombination. Recent biochemical data demonstrated that the Rad51 paralogs modulate Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange (7Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Sigurdsson S. van Komen S. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The XPF·ERCC1 complex is a cross-link-specific 3′ to 5′ exonuclease (9Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is required for targeted homologous recombination as well (10Adair G.M. Rolig R.L. Moore-Favor D. Zabelshansky M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5552-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtjens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the cross-link repair reaction dependent on the XPF·ERCC1 complex and recombination machinery, DNA strand breaks may be requisite for XRCC2 and XRCC3 to participate in the cross-link repair reaction, and a 3′ end is needed for the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the XPF·ERCC1 complex. However, how these DNA breaks are generated and what proteins are required for generation of the breaks are not understood. Interestingly, DNA replication-dependent double strand breaks have been detected in mammalian cells after treatment of the cells with DNA cross-linking agents (12de Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus double strand breaks could be an important intermediate in cross-link repair in mammalian cells, because these breaks provide a 3′ end near the cross-linked site for the processing of the cross-link by the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the XPF·ERCC1 complex to generate an appropriate substrate for homologous recombination. It is also reported that DNA replication is required to elicit a cell cycle delay response to cross-link in mammalian cells (13Akkari Y.M.N. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These data strongly implicate a crucial role of DNA replication in cross-link repair in mammalian cells. To study the effect of cross-links on DNA replication, a cell-free SV40 ori-dependent DNA replication system (14Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Stillman B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 522-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used. DNA replication was inhibited by the psoralen cross-links and mediated formation of double strand breaks near the cross-linked sites. These DNA replication-mediated double strand breaks are likely the intermediates in cross-link repair reactions in human cells. DISCUSSIONLittle is known about the molecular mechanism of repair of DNA interstrand cross-links in humans. Based on the genetic data with DNA cross-linking agent-hypersensitive mutant cell lines, it has been proposed that a structure-specific endonuclease XPF·ERCC1 complex (4Thompson L.H. Mutation Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and DSB repair proteins, Rad51 paralogs (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat.

https://openalex.org/W2074231790,"The formation and patterning of mesoderm during mammalian gastrulation require the activity of Nodal, a secreted mesoderm-inducing factor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family. Here we show that the transcriptional corepressor DRAP1 has a very specific role in regulation of Nodal activity during mouse embryogenesis. We find that loss of Drap1 leads to severe gastrulation defects that are consistent with increased expression of Nodal and can be partially suppressed by Nodal heterozygosity. Biochemical studies indicate that DRAP1 interacts with and inhibits DNA binding by the winged-helix transcription factor FoxH1 (FAST), a critical component of a positive feedback loop for Nodal activity. We propose that DRAP1 limits the spread of a morphogenetic signal by down-modulating the response to the Nodal autoregulatory loop."
https://openalex.org/W2049797765,"Docking of a vesicle at the appropriate target membrane involves an interaction between integral membrane proteins located on the vesicle (v-SNAREs) and those located on the target membrane (t-SNAREs). GATE-16 (Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa) was shown to modulate the activity of SNAREs in the Golgi apparatus and is therefore an essential component of intra-Golgi transport and post-mitotic Golgi re-assembly. GATE-16 contains a ubiquitin fold subdomain, which is terminated at the carboxyl end by an additional amino acid after a conserved glycine residue. In the present study we tested whether the COOH terminus of GATE-16 undergoes post-translational cleavage by a protease which exposes the glycine 116 residue. We describe the isolation and characterization of HsApg4A as a human protease of GATE-16. We show that GATE-16 undergoes COOH-terminal cleavage both in vivo and in vitro, only when the conserved glycine 116 is present. We then utilize an in vitro assay to show that pure HsApg4A is sufficient to cleave GATE-16. The characterization of this protease may give new insights into the mechanism of action of GATE-16 and its other family members."

Flag-tagged EGFRvIII was expressed at the same levels as unmodified EGFRvIII, and showed the same subcellular localization. However, the Flag epitope could only be detected on EGFRvIII present in the endoplasmic reticulum; the epitope was covalently modified during trafficking of the receptor through the Golgi so that it was no longer recognized by anti-Flag antibody. This property was exploited to selectively purify nascent EGFRvIII from glioblastoma cells. Nascent EGFRvIII was found to copurify with a set of other proteins, identified by mass spectrometry as the two endoplasmic reticulum chaperones Grp94 and BiP, and the two cytosolic chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90. The Hsp90-associated chaperone Cdc37 also co-purified with EGFRvIII, suggesting that Hsp90 binds EGFRvIII as a complex with this protein. Geldanamycin and radicicol, two chemically unrelated inhibitors of Hsp90, decreased the expression of EGFRvIII in glioblastoma cells. These studies show that nascent EGFRvIII in the endoplasmic reticulum associates with Hsp90 and Cdc37, and that the Hsp90 association is necessary to maintain expression of EGFRvIII.

Glioblastoma multiforme is an incurable disease with a median survival time that is typically less than 1 year. Surgery and radiation have been shown to increase survival times, but the disease responds poorly to chemotherapy. One of the most common genetic abnormalities found in glioblastoma is amplification of the gene for EGFR. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFRvIII, mutant epidermal growth factor receptor lacking amino acids 6–273 of the extracellular domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MS, mass spectroscopy; cdk4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 Along with amplification, the EGFR gene is frequently mutated. The most common mutation is a deletion of exons 2–7. This deletion is in-frame and results in the expression of a truncated EGFR, known as EGFRvIII, in which amino acids 6–273 of the extracellular domain are replaced by a single glycine residue (1Humphrey P.A.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that its expression is associated with a poorer prognosis (9Feldkamp M.M. Lala P. Lau N. Roncari L. Guha A. Neurosurgery. 1999; 45: 1442-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, EGFRvIII has been shown to greatly enhance the tumorigenicity of human glioblastoma cells grown as xenografts in nude mice (10Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Studies in mouse models of glioblastoma show that EGFRvIII cooperates with mutations at the INK4a/ARF locus to promote the formation of glioblastoma (11Holland E.C. Hively W.P. DePinho R.A. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas EGFRvIII expression in normal mice does not give rise to tumors, expression of EGFRvIII in INK4a/ARF(−/−) mice does give rise to tumors with a high frequency. The INK4a/ARF locus contains genes coding for two different proteins (12Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). One of these is Ink4a, a repressor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4); the other is Arf, which has a role in regulating p53 levels. EGFRvIII will also form tumors in mice if cdk4 is overexpressed at the same time, indicating that these two pathways cooperate in the formation of glioblastoma. It is likely that these two pathways also cooperate in the formation of human glioblastoma, as there is a high concurrence of EGFR overexpression and mutations at the INK4a/ARF locus in these tumors (13Hayashi Y. Ueki K. Waha A. Wiestler O.D. Louis D.N. von Deimling A. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mutation in EGFRvIII has been shown to generate a receptor with many properties that are distinct from those of normal EGFR (reviewed in Refs. 14Pedersen M.W. Meltorn M. Damstrup L. Poulsen H.S.

EGFRvIII is unable to bind epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α (two activating ligands for EGFR) (10Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J.

Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Huang C.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). EGFRvIII appears to preferentially use a different subset of downstream signaling pathways compared with normal EGFR (18Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lorimer I.A. Lavictoire S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and shows differential sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (22Han Y. Caday C.G. Nanda A. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3859-3861PubMed Google Scholar). To better characterize the properties of EGFRvIII, we have generated an epitope-tagged version of the receptor that can be purified rapidly and efficiently. Here we describe the characterization of the epitope-tagged receptor, its purification, and the identification of proteins that co-purify with the receptor. Plasmid containing the cDNA for the Moloney murine leukemia virus ecotropic receptor was from Dr. L. Albritton, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN. The insert was removed by digestion with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the retroviral vector pWZL-Hygro (obtained from Dr. S. Lowe, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). To construct the vector expressing triple Flag-tagged EGFRvIII, the cDNA for EGFRvIII was excised from pLERNL (10Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. W. Cavenee, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA) by SalI digestion and subcloned into the SalI site of a modified version of the vector T7-blue (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) in which the unique SphI site had been removed. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to create a silent SphI restriction site at codons 43–44 of the mutant receptor, using the oligonucleotide SPHV3 (CGCATGCTCGGACGCACGAGCCGTGATC). This plasmid was then used as a template for two PCRs, using two primer pairs: KPNV3 (CGGTACCACGCTGCAGACGCG) and TF1 (GATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTCCAGAGCCCGACTCGCCGGGCA); and TF2 (GATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGCTGGAGGAAAAGAAAGGT) and SPHV3 (see above). The two PCR products were gel-purified and joined in a third PCR using the KPNV3 and SPHV3 primer pair and the two initial PCR products as templates. The final PCR product was subcloned and sequenced. The KpnI/SphI fragment was excised and ligated into T7-blue containing EGFRvIII cDNA with the silentSphI site, which had also been digested with KpnI and SphI. The full-length cDNA for EGFRvIII containing the triple Flag tag sequence was then excised with SalI and ligated into SalI digested pLERNL. Clones showing the correct orientation by restriction digest were designated pLRNLtftΔ. Anti-Flag M2 antibody and anti-Flag M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody was from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). Antibody to the carboxyl terminus of EGFR was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Golgin 97 antibody was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-Sec61α antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-cdk4 (Ab-6) and anti-Cdc37 antibodies were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Anti-Hsp90 and anti-p60/Hop antibodies were from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). To make rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for EGFRvIII, a multiple antigenic peptide containing four copies of the sequence LEEKKGNYVVTDHG (the amino terminus of EGFRvIII plus a glycine spacer) was synthesized and purified on a Superdex peptide column (Amersham Biosciences). This was then used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies were purified from rabbit serum using the peptide LEEKKGNYVVTDH-biotin (23Lorimer I.A. Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Beers R.A. Pegram C.N. Bigner D.D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) bound to Ultralink immobilized streptavidin gel (BioLynx, Inc., Brockville, ON). U87MG and U87MGΔEGFR cell lines were obtained from Dr. W. Cavenee, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA. 293T cells were obtained from Dr. J. Bell, Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Canada. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Replication-incompetent retroviruses were made using the three plasmid transient transfection systems described by Soneoka et al. (24Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Transduction of U87MG glioblastoma cells was done by incubating the cells with virus in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 2 h. U87MGecoR cells, which express the ecotropic receptor for Moloney leukemia virus, were made by transduction with amphotropic retrovirus followed by selection in 75 μg/ml hygromycin B. U87MGtftΔ cells, which express triple Flag-tagged EGFRvIII, were made by transduction of U87MGecoR cells with ecotropic retrovirus followed by selection in 400 μg/ml G418. Cells growing in tissue culture flasks were detached using Cell Dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 4 × 106 cells per ml. 200-μl aliquots of cells were then incubated on ice with the indicated antibodies for 20 min. Cells were pelleted again, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with secondary antibody (either fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, both from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for 20 min on ice. Cells were pelleted again and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were grown on gelatin-subbed coverslips in 35-mm dishes. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. Where indicated, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (either Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody used at 3.75 μg/ml or Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody used at 2.8 μg/ml, both from Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed again, counterstained with Hoechst 33258, and mounted on slides. Immunofluorescence was performed using a Zeiss Axioskop2 fluorescence microscope and images were captured with a CCD camera. Images were deconvolved using Axiovision 3.0 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). For double labeling, immunofluorescence was performed as above using anti-Sec61 rabbit polyclonal antibody as an endoplasmic reticulum marker, or anti-Golgin 97 mouse monoclonal antibody as a Golgi marker. After incubation with first and second antibodies, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Flag M2 antibody that had been labeled with Zenon One Alexa Fluor 488 IgG1 labeling reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were then washed, fixed again with 4% para-formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted. U87MGtftΔ cells or control U87MGecoR cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 in 15-cm tissue culture dishes (five dishes per cell line). After 3 days, media in the dishes was changed to media containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. The following day, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and scraped into the same buffer (50 ml total for each cell line). Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Cells were homogenized by passage once through a 27-gauge needle, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (15,000 × g) in an Eppendorf 5417R centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and assayed for total protein content using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein from the two cell lines were then made up to the same volume with lysis buffer (∼1 ml). 50 μl of the original stock suspension of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel was washed three times with lysis buffer and added to each tube. The tubes were then mixed with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was then pelleted and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the affinity gel by the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer without reducing agent (4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% (v/v) glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) followed by heating at 90 °C for 5 min. The affinity gel was then removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Dithiothreitol was added to the affinity gel eluates to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the eluates were then boiled for 5 min. Acrylamide was then added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and eluates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples (40 μl per lane) were then loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed. Gels were stained with GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Pierce), destained with H2O, and photographed. Stained bands were cut of gels and stored in aqueous 1% acetic acid. For mass spectrometry analysis, bands were then washed extensively with deionized water, shrunk with acetonitrile, re-swollen with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing sequencing grade, modified trypsin (10 ng/μl) from Promega(Madison, WI). Sufficient 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces (typically 30 μl). The tubes were sealed and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digest solutions were removed and the gel pieces were extracted with 50 μl of 5% acetic acid and then with 50 μl of 5% acetic acid in 50% aqueous methanol. The extracts were pooled with the digest solutions and concentrated to ∼10 μl. The extracts were analyzed by rapid LC-MS/MS using a CapLC high performance liquid chromatography pump (Waters Associates, Millford, MA) coupled to a Q-TOF2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The entire samples were injected onto a 0.3 × 5-mm C18 micro precolumn cartridge (Dionex/LC-Packings, San Francisco, CA). The peptides were retained while the sample solution was washed to waste. The trap was then brought online with the mass spectrometer and the peptides were eluted with a rapid gradient supplied by the CapLC pump (5–80% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in 6 min, 1 μl/min flow rate). The mass spectrometer was set to operate in automatic MS/MS acquisition mode and tandem mass spectra were acquired on doubly and triply protonated precursor ions only. These spectra were then searched against the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL and NCBI nr protein sequence data bases using Mascot DaemonTM (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK), an algorithm that uses mass spectrometry data to identify proteins in primary sequence data bases. Small scale immunoprecipitations were carried out using the same basic procedure as described above for immunopurification of EGFRvIII, with the following changes: cells growing in two 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed once with cold PBS and then scraped directly into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer; cleared extracts were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 5 μg of His-tagged MR1dsFv antibody fragment (25Landry R.C. Klimowicz A.C. Lavictoire S.J. Borisova S. Kottachchi D.T. Lorimer I.A. Evans S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); 100 μl of Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was then added and tubes were incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h; pellets were washed 5–7 times with 750 μl of lysis buffer before adding 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Western blotting was performed as described previously (26Lorimer I.A. Lavictoire S.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 237: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer from the gel, blots were stained with Amido Black to check that equal sample loading and transfer was achieved. To allow efficient purification of EGFRvIII, we constructed a version in which a triple Flag tag sequence was inserted between the leader sequence and the start of the mature protein (Fig. 1). The triple Flag tag amino acid sequence has previously been shown to bind with high affinity to the anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (27Hernan R. Heuermann K. Brizzard B. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A codon for a single leucine residue was included at the amino terminus of the triple Flag tag sequence to preserve the same signal peptide cleavage site as in normal EGFRvIII. The sequence for tagged EGFRvIII (hereafter designated tftEGFRvIII) was subcloned into a retroviral vector. Initially expression was tested by transient transfection into 293T cells (Fig. 2 A). Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting, using polyclonal antibody to the carboxyl terminus of EGFR. Unmodified EGFRvIII migrated as a doublet, in agreement with previous results (21Lorimer I.A. Lavictoire S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TftEGFRvIII was expressed at the same levels as unmodified EGFRvIII, and also migrated as a doublet, with both bands migrating at a slightly higher apparent molecular weight, as expected given the additional 23 amino acids added at the amino terminus. From this result it can also be inferred that tftEGFRvIII is glycosylated to the same extent as unmodified EGFRvIII. TftEGFRvIII was also found to be autophosphorylated to the same extent as EGFRvIII, showing that the addition of the epitope tag did not affect its constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. As expected tftEGFRvIII, but not EGFRvIII, was detected by the anti-Flag antibody M2. We also performed a test immunoprecipitation of tftEGFRvIII expressed by transient transfection in 293T cells. TftEGFRvIII could be reduced to undetectable levels in cell lysates by incubation with M2 antibody affinity gel, showing that the binding was very efficient (not shown).Figure 2Expression of tftEGFRvIII in 293T cells and glioblastoma cells. A, 293T cells were transiently transfected with: lane a, no DNA; lanes b andd, pLERNL, which expresses EGFRvIII; lane c, pLRNLtftΔ, which expresses triple Flag-tagged EGFRvIII. Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to EGFR, phosphotyrosine, and Flag epitope. B, U87MGecoR glioblastoma cells (lane a) were transduced with retroviral vectors containing cDNA for either triple Flag-tagged EGFRvIII (lane b) or unmodified EGFRvIII (lane c). Total cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to EGFR and phosphotyrosine. We have shown previously that the upper phosphotyrosine band, seen in lanes b and c, represents autophosphorylated EGFRvIII (21Lorimer I.A. Lavictoire S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next made ecotropic replication-incompetent retrovirus containing tftEGFRvIII, and used these to infect U87MG human glioblastoma cells that had been modified to express the ecotropic receptor for Moloney murine leukemia virus. Infected cells were selected for resistance to G418 and drug-resistant populations of cells (designated U87MGtftΔ cells) were used for further experiments. Western blot analysis showed that these cells also expressed tftEGFRvIII and autophosphorylated tftEGFRvIII at levels similar to those seen in U87MG cells infected with a retrovirus containing the cDNA for unmodified EGFRvIII (Fig. 2 B). Flow cytometry, using an antibody that recognizes the amino terminus of EGFRvIII, showed that these two cell populations also expressed similar amounts of cell-surface EGFRvIII (Fig. 3, panels c and d). However, we were unable to detect the triple Flag epitope on the surface of U87MGtftΔ cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 3, panels e and f). Immunofluorescence on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells using the antibody to the amino terminus of EGFRvIII showed that the subcellular distribution of tftEGFRvIII and EGFRvIII were the same (not shown). As with the flow cytometry, we were unable to detect Flag epitope on the surface of nonpermeabilized U87MGtftΔ cells. Immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells shows that the triple Flag epitope is detectable within the cell (Fig. 4). The pattern of staining suggested that the localization was mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was confirmed by double immunofluorescence with anti-Flag antibody and an antibody to the endoplasmic reticulum protein Sec 61α, which showed a clear overlap in the staining pattern (Fig. 4, panels d–f). Double immunofluorescence with an antibody to the Golgi marker protein Golgin 97 showed that while some of the triple Flag epitope was present in the Golgi, it was not present throughout the Golgi (Fig. 4,a–c); this suggests that Flag epitope immunoreactivity is lost during the passage of tftEGFRvIII through this organelle. Western blot analysis of tftEGFRvIII expressed in either 293T cells or glioblastoma cells showed that antibody to the carboxyl terminus of EGFR recognized two bands (Figs. 2 and5). In contrast, antibody to the Flag epitope only recognized a single band. Careful comparison of blots that were run on the same gel showed that the Flag antibody recognized the lower of the two bands recognized by the EGFR antibody (Fig. 5 A). The different EGFRvIII bands likely represent receptors with different glycosylation status. (EGFRvIII contains eight of the 12 potential N-linked glycosylation sites present in EGFR.) To investigate this further, we treated U87MGtftΔ cells with tunicamycin, which blocks the core N-linked glycosylation of proteins that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot analysis showed that tunicamycin-treated cells contained a low molecular weight form of tftEGFRvIII that is probably nonglycosylated receptor (Fig. 5 B). This form was smaller than the lower band of the tftEGFRvIII doublet, suggesting that the lower doublet band is at least partly glycosylated. The lower band of the tftEGFRvIII doublet was absent after tunicamycin treatment, whereas the upper band was still present. A likely explanation for this was that the lower band represented core-glycosylated tftEGFRvIII, whereas the upper band represented tftEGFRvIII in which the carbohydrate had been converted to complex oligosaccharides, a process that occurs in the Golgi. After tunicamycin treatment, no new core-glycosylated tftEGFRvIII would form, but any that was present at the initiation of tunicamycin treatment would be converted into tftEGFRvIII containing complex oligosaccharide. We also treated U87MGtftΔ cells with the α-mannosidase I inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (28Fuhrmann U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which inhibits the formation of complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 5 C). A 24-h treatment with deoxymannojirimycin resulted in loss of the upper tftEGFRvIII band, whereas levels of the lower band were enhanced. This supports the idea that the lower tftEGFRvIII band, which is recognized by the anti-Flag antibody, is tftEGFRvIII that has not yet undergone conversion of its carbohydrate residues to complex oligosaccharides in the Golgi. The results from flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis show that tftEGFRvIII is expressed at the same levels and in the same localization pattern as nontagged EGFRvIII, but that the triple Flag epitope is covalently modified (by an unknown mechanism) in the Golgi apparatus so that it is no longer recognized by the anti-Flag antibody. This provides a system in which nascent EGFRvIII in the endoplasmic reticulum can be selectively purified for characterization. TftEGFRvIII was purified from ∼5 × 107 U87MGtftΔ cells. As a control, the same purification procedure was performed on the parent glioblastoma cell line that does not express tftEGFRvIII. Immunopurified tftEGFRvIII was analyzed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Fig. 6). A prominent band of the expected molecular weight for tftEGFRvIII was evident. Based on comparison with bovine serum albumin standards run on the same gel, 1–2 μg of tftEGFRvIII were purified from 5 × 107 cells. Seven other bands were also found to reproducibly copurify with tftEGFRvIII. (Additional bands were also detected in some preparations.) Two of these were present in the control lane, and were not studied further. The five other bands were absent in the control lane. Based on comparison with bovine serum albumin standards, these were present at about 1/10th the amount of the tftEGFRvIII band. Bands from the one-dimensional gel lane of purified tftEGFRvIII were"

Under normal conditions keratinocyte apoptosis is a rare event in the epidermis although keratinocytes express the death receptor Fas and its ligand. Here we have investigated why this is so. We show that Fas, FasL, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase-8 mRNA are detectable in the epidermis, primary keratinocyte cultures, and keratinocyte cell line and that Fas protein is expressed in keratinocytes of all subcorneal layers of the epidermis, whereas FasL is only expressed in the basal and first suprabasal layers. Coexpression of Fas and FasL therefore occurs in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. In vitro, keratinocytes are killed by recombinant FasL in a dose-dependent manner, but they are unable to kill Fas-sensitive target cells despite FasL expression. Analysis of keratinocyte culture supernatants and treatment of keratinocytes with metalloproteinase inhibitors excluded cell surface expression of FasL and rapid metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of cell surface FasL. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter, confocal microscopical, and electron microscopical analysis revealed that keratinocyte FasL is localized intracellularly predominantly associated to intermediate filaments. These data suggest that the observed inability of keratinocyte FasL to induce apoptosis under physiological conditions is due to its cellular localization and also indicate that intermediate filaments may be involved in regulating the subcellular localization of FasL.

The Fas system has proven to be essential in contributing to the functional integrity of the epidermis. Recent evidence has shown that Fas-induced keratinocyte apoptosis in response to UV prevents the accumulation of procarcinogenic p53 mutations by deleting UV-mutated keratinocytes (10Hill L.L.

Furthermore, strong evidence exists that dysregulation of Fas expression and/or signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (11Viard I. Wehrli P.

Here we investigated this in the aim of better understanding how the cytolytic activity of keratinocyte FasL is regulated. Interfollicular epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) isolated from human epidermis and outer root sheath keratinocytes (ORS) isolated from human hair follicles (22Limat A. Hunziker T. Boillat C. Bayreuther K. Noser F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 758-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in KGM medium (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland) (basal culture conditions). The Hacat cell line (spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte cell line) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 IU/ml penicillin. Fas-sensitive A20, and Fas-resistant A20R mouse B cell lymphoma cells, were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.01 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 15 mm Hepes. 293 human embryonic kidney cells (293-WT), 293 stably transfected with human FasL (293-FasL) and HpK1a keratinocytes were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 IU/ml penicillin. RNase protection assays were performed using 15 μg of total RNA with the RiboQuant multi-probe RNase protection assay system (Pharmingen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In summary, RNA was hybridized overnight with the in vitro translated 32P-labeled probe (hAPO-3 multiprobe template, Pharmingen), and samples were then treated with RNase A and proteinase K, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. The protected fragments were resolved on a 5% acrylamide/urea gel and further analyzed by autoradiography. Reverse transcription and amplification were performed from total RNA using the Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Ag, Basel, Switzerland). RT-PCR for FasL was carried out using the following forward and reverse primers 5′-CTC TGG AAT GGG AAG ACA CC-3′ and 5′-ACC AGA GAG AGC TCA GAT ACG-3′. For β-actin 5′-TGA TGG ACT CCG GTG ACG G-3′ and 5′-TGT CAC GCA CGA TTT CCC GC-3′. PCR products (40 cycles) of FasL (381 bp, intron spanning) and β-actin (179 bp) were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on cryosection as described (23French L.E. Hahne M. Viard I. Radlgruber G. Zanone R. Becker K. Muller C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) using UB2 anti-Fas antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and isotype-matched control antibody (mouse IgG1). For immunofluorescence, 6-μm-thick cryostat sections were air-dried, fixed for 10 min with ice-cooled acetone/ethanol (1:1), and rehydrated with PBS. Sections were then incubated at room temperature for 60 min with anti FasL rat IgM antibody A-11 (Alexis, San Diego, CA) and with anti-β1-integrin mouse IgG antibody AJ2 (kindly provided by C. E. Klein, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany) (24Kantor R.R. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Old L.J. Albino A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15158-15165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:60 and 1:40 in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, respectively. For negative control, sections were incubated with rat IgM and mouse IgG, respectively. Sections were then revealed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti rat IgM diluted 1:200 or with Texas red-conjugated anti mouse IgG diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PE). Results were routinely analyzed under fluorescence microscope. Some experiments were analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, Zeiss LSM 410 invert, equipped with argon (488 nm) and HeNe (543 nm) lasers. FACS staining was performed on HaCaT cells permeabilized or not by 1% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FCS, plus 1% saponin for permeabilized cells) containing 1 μg of mouse anti-FasL G247-4 antibody (PharMingen) or 1 μg of the isotype-matched control MOPC-21 (PharMingen). After two washings in FACS buffer, cells were stained at 4 °C for 45 min with 1 μg of Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After two washings, cells were directly analyzed on a FACScanTM (BD Biosciences) using Cellquest 3.0 software. For FACS analysis in non-permeabilized cells, PI exclusion was used to eliminate dead cells. For analysis of Fas death signaling function, cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 104 cells per well. After adhesion, serial concentrations of recombinant soluble FLAG-tagged FasL (Alexis, San Diego, CA) plus enhancer (anti-FLAG Ab, Alexis) at 1 μg/ml concentration were added. Viability of cells was determined 24 h later by using the Boehringer cell proliferation reagent WST-1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Percentage of cell viability was determined against control untreated cells. Cytolytic FasL function of cultured keratinocytes was determined using a 20-h 125I-deoxyuridine release assay. A20 and A20R target cells were labeled with 1mCi of 125I-deoxyuridine (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator and then washed three times in medium. Labeled target cells were seeded at 104 cells per well with keratinocytes at the indicated effector/target cells ratios in flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates. After incubation for 20 h at 37 °C, 125I-deoxyuridine-labeled fragmented DNA released in culture medium was pooled with cytoplasmic125I-deoxyuridine-labeled fragmented DNA recovered by cell lysis. Pooled supernatants were assayed for radioactivity using a γ-counter. Percentage of apoptosis was calculated as: 100 × (sample 125I release − spontaneous 125I release)/(maximum 125I release − spontaneous125I release). Cytolytic function of FasL in human epidermis was determined as described previously (11Viard I. Wehrli P. Bullani R. Schneider P. Holler N. Salomon D. Hunziker T. Saurat J.H. Tschopp J. French L.E. Science. 1998; 282: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Briefly, 600,000 Jurkat cells (in 100 μl of medium) were overlaid on human skin cryosections and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Jurkat cell apoptosis was subsequently assessed on 200,000 recovered cells by FACS analysis using an annexin-V assay (PharMingen). Jurkat cells overlaid on 293 and 293-FasL (previously cultured on coverslips) for 6 h were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. To identify soluble FasL in the supernatant of 293-WT, 293-FasL, and HEK cells, cells were cultured in appropriate medium containing 230 μCi/ml of 35S-Cyst/Met (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 24 h, and supernatants were collected. After preclearing for 5 h with protein A, supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of Fas-Fc or CD44-Fc (control) for 2 h. Protein A was then added and the incubation of supernatants was continued overnight at 4 °C. After three washings with buffer (0.5%-Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm-NaCl), material bound to protein A was eluted with electrophoresis sample buffer containing 50 μmdithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For fluorography, the gel was incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 3 days. After informed consent of the patients and authorization of the institutional ethical committee for clinical investigation, keratome samples of control human skin were obtained from specimens of abdominal reduction surgery. Immediately after sampling, fragments were fixed at room temperature in a 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 5 min and then exposed for 55 min to 4% paraformaldehyde. The fragments were then embedded at low temperature in Lowicryl K4M resin and thin-sectioned using a Reichert OM10 ultramicrotome. Sections were first incubated 10 min in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then exposed at room temperature for 2 h to undiluted anti-FasL mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody NOK-1 (PharMingen International). After rinsing, the sections were exposed 1 h at room temperature to a preparation of 15-nm gold particles, coated with protein A, and diluted 1:200. Sections were stained 10 min with 2% uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips CM10 electron microscope. Negative controls included 1) skin sections incubated with undiluted isotype matched control antibody MOPC-21 (PharMingen International), followed by protein A-coated gold particles; 2) skin sections incubated with protein A-gold particles only; 3) wild type 293 cells (not expressing human FasL) incubated with the NOK-1 monoclonal antibody followed by protein A-coated gold particles. None of these controls resulted in a specific staining (not shown). Positive controls were provided by incubations of 293 cells that were stably transfected for human Fas ligand, with the NOK-1 monoclonal antibodies, followed by protein A-coated gold particles. These incubations resulted in a clear cytoplasmic labeling of the transfected cells (not shown). Evaluation of labeling distribution was performed by taking photographs of about 40 keratinocytes, in the suprabasal layers of epidermis of three skin samples, at a constant 60,000-fold magnification. Gold particles were scored in each photograph (representing each a surface of 7.93 μm2) and attributed to one of the following compartments: junctional membrane, non-junctional membrane (desmosomes), cytosol, lysosomes, and other vesicles (Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, whose membranes are unsatisfactorily preserved after K4M embedding, were not scored separately and were included in the “vesicle” counts), intermediate filaments, mitochondria, and nucleus. Values were calculated as number of protein A-coated gold particles per 100 μm2 of cytoplasm and compared between groups by analysis of variance and Student's unpairedt tests, using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago). RNase protection was performed for Fas, FADD, and caspase 8 using total RNA extracted from whole skin, split dermis and epidermis, primary keratinocyte cultures (HEK, interfollicular epidermal keratinocytes and ORS, outer root sheath keratinocytes). As FasL was not detectable by RNase protection (data not shown), we used the more sensitive RT-PCR technique to analyze FasL mRNA expression as indicated in the next result paragraph. As shown in Fig.1 a, specific protected fragments for Fas, FADD, and caspase 8 were detected in each RNA sample, demonstrating that key initial effectors of the Fas signaling pathway are expressed by human keratinocytes, both in vitroand in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining revealed, as reported previously, a membrane pattern of Fas staining in all subcorneal layers of the epidermis (Fig. 1 b). To investigate whether Fas signaling pathway is functional in human keratinocytes, we tested the ability of recombinant soluble FasL (rFasL) to induce apoptosis of immortalized HaCaT and primary HEK cells under basal culture conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 c, under these conditions, recombinant human FasL (rFasL) induced dose-dependent death of Fas-sensitive Jurkat cells and HaCaT and HEK cells, HaCaT and HEK cells being, however, less sensitive (IC50 = 89 and 232 ng/ml, respectively) to rFasL than Jurkat cells (IC50 = 25 ng/ml). FasL mRNA expression was investigated by RT-PCR in the same total RNA samples previously used to analyze Fas expression by RNase protection assay. Indeed, RNase protection that is less sensitive than RT-PCR technique did not allow detection of FasL mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2 a, a 381-bp FasL fragment was amplified in all samples, demonstrating mRNA FasL expression in keratinocytes of normal human skin. To investigate whether FasL mRNA is translated into protein in human skin, we analyzed FasL distribution by immunofluorescence in tissue sections of normal human skin. As shown in Fig. 2 b, strong FasL expression, consistent with RT-PCR results, was detected in epidermal keratinocytes. Keratinocyte FasL protein was confined to basal and first suprabasal layers of the epidermis, homogeneously distributed within the cytoplasm and without plasma membrane enhancement. Specificity of the immunolabeling was established using isotype-matched control antibody (Fig. 2 b, right panel). The above experiments demonstrate that Fas and FasL are coexpressed in the lower epidermis and that keratinocyte Fas death signaling pathway is functional under basal culture conditions. To determine whether keratinocyte FasL is cytolytically active and able to induce apoptosis in Fas-expressing keratinocytes, we analyzed the capacity of primary HEK to induce Fas-mediated cell death. When keratinocytes were incubated with radioactively labeled A20 (Fas-sensitive) or A20R (Fas-resistant) cells at various effector:target cell ratios, no significant level of apoptotic cell death could be detected in A20 cells after coincubation with HEK. Thus under tested conditions keratinocyte FasL is non-cytolytic. This result was confirmed by the inability of human skin samples to induce apoptosis of Fas sensitive Jurkat cells (Fig.3 b). The low percentage of apoptotic cells detected (5–10%) in both experiments could not be decreased by incubation with Fas-Fc fusion protein, demonstrating that keratinocyte FasL is indeed non-lytic in vitro and ex vivo. To investigate whether the lack of keratinocyte cytolytic activity was due to the absence of FasL at keratinocyte membrane, we analyzed FasL expression at the surface of HEK cells by FACS. As shown in Fig.4 a, HEK cells were clearly negative for membrane FasL (upper left). To investigate whether the absence of membrane FasL on keratinocytes could be due to proteolytic cleavage and release of surface FasL into the culture medium, we performed an immunoprecipitation of conditioned culture medium with a Fas-Fc fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 4 b, immunoprecipitation of cell culture supernatant from 293-FasL-transfected cells revealed significant levels of soluble FasL at 25 kDa, whereas culture supernatants from wild type 293 and primary cultures of HEK did not. These data suggest that FasL protein may not be translocated to the membrane of keratinocytes and may be retained within their cytoplasm. This hypothesis was confirmed by FACS analysis performed on permeabilized HEK cells (Fig. 4 a, upper right), showing a marked shift in fluorescence intensity (35% of cells) in comparison to non-permeabilized cells and permeabilized cells incubated with an isotype-matched control antibody. The marked shift between both antibodies correspond to specific binding as it was cancelled by incubation of anti-FasL G247-4 antibody by a 5-fold excess of recombinant FasL protein (data not shown). These data point out that FasL is localized intracellularly in human HEK cells. To establish thein vivo localization of FasL in keratinocytes, normal human skin was immunostained both with anti-FasL and anti-integrin mAbs and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig.5 a). This double labeling revealed that cellular localizations of keratinocyte FasL (green staining) and membrane specific integrin (red staining) were distinct although some little colocalization occurred in suprabasal epidermal layers (Fig.5 a, yellow). The same experiment performed in cultured human keratinocytes HEK (Fig. 5, b andd) confirmed the predominant cytoplasmic localization of FasL. These data show that keratinocyte FasL is predominantly located inside the cytoplasm both in vitro and in vivo. Using anti-FasL antibody (NOK-1) and protein A-coated gold particles for immunoelectron microscopical analysis of human skin, FasL labeling was detected in most living keratinocytes of human interfollicular epidermis in agreement with the previously shown molecular, biochemical, and immunohistochemical data. In the plastic- and low temperature-embedded material, which we used, this labeling was almost exclusively restricted to the cytoplasm of keratinocytes (Fig.6, a and b). The labeling of keratinocytes was considered specific in view of the various controls (see “Experimental Procedures,” including the observation that labeling was absent when using the isotypic irrelevant antibody MOPC-21) (Fig. 6 c). Quantitative evaluation further showed that different organelles of keratinocytes were not similarly labeled under the experimental conditions that elicited a sizeable staining of these cells for FasL. FasL was predominantly observed in the cytosol and intermediate filament compartments (total number of gold particles per 100 μm2 of these compartments was 113.1 ± 15.8, n = 39 and 105.4 ± 14.2,n = 39, respectively) (TableI), irrespective of whether these organelles were located close to (Fig. 6 a) or at distance from the cell membrane (Fig. 6 b) and also to some extent in lysosomes and vesicles (22.9 ± 6.8, n = 39). In contrast, several other organelles, including desmosomal and non-junctional regions of the cell membrane, mitochondria (Fig.6 b), and nucleus failed to show any specific labeling above background levels (Table I).Table IDistribution of FasL immunolabeling in human keratinocytesType of keratinocyteOrganelleFasL immunoreactivity (Nok-1 antibody)Background immunoreactivity (MOPC-21 antibody)Junctional membrane11.6 ± 3.4, n = 393.9 ± 3.9, n = 13SuprabasalNon-junctional membrane2.9 ± 1.6, n = 390, n = 13Cytosol113.1 ± 15.8,1-ap < 0.001. n = 3917.4 ± 4.7 n = 13Intermediate filaments105.4 ± 14.2,1-bp < 0.002. n = 3925.2 ± 5.5, n = 13Mitochondria1.0 ± 0.5, n = 390, n = 13Lysosomes and vesicles22.9 ± 6.8,1-cp < 0.07. n = 391.0 ± 1.0, n = 13Nucleus8.7 ± 4.2, n = 390, n = 13CornifiedAll37.8 ± 23.2, n = 525.2 ± 12.0, n = 5Values are shown as mean ± S.E. number of protein A-coated gold particles per 100 μm2 of cytoplasm.

This is best illustrated by the fact that mice with mutant non-functional FasL are significantly more resistant to UVB-induced keratinocyte apoptosis (“sunburn cells”) and, as a consequence, accumulates UV-induced p53 mutations significantly more rapidly than control mice (10Hill L.L. Ouhtit A. Loughlin S.M. Kripke M.L. Ananthaswamy H.N. Owen-Schaub L.B. Science. 1999; 285: 898-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is therefore very likely that keratinocyte FasL expression and intact Fas signaling pathway in keratinocytes are crucial for the prevention of UV induced skin cancer. Although Fas is known to be expressed in human keratinocytes, and capable of signaling death when triggered in the presence of interferon-γ (17Matsue H. Akitaya T. Kobayashi H. Ohkawara A. Hosokawa T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1995; 287: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), little is known about the expression, cellular localization, and cytolytic function of FasL in resting human keratinocytes in vitro andin vivo. The present report analyzes for the first time the exact cellular localization of keratinocyte FasL, and provides evidence that FasL in resting keratinocytes has no cytolytic activity because of its intracellular localization. Previous studies on human keratinocytes have shown FasL expression at the mRNA and protein levels in vitro (18Gutierrez-Steil C. Wrone-Smith T. Sun X. Krueger J.G. Coven T. Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Arnold R. Seifert M. Asadullah K. Volk H.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7140-7147PubMed Google Scholar, 21Leverkus M. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our data confirm these observations as they show constitutive keratinocyte FasL expression in vitro and additionally show constitutivein vivo expression of FasL at the protein level in lower human epidermis. FasL protein expression therefore colocalizes with Fas expression at this location. In addition, our data demonstrate that the Fas death signaling pathway is functional in resting keratinocytes, even without interferon-γ pretreatment, contrary to what was suggested by a previous report (17Matsue H. Akitaya T. Kobayashi H. Ohkawara A. Hosokawa T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1995; 287: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Coexpression of functional Fas and FasL set the conditions for spontaneous Fas-mediated cell death of keratinocytes in the basal and first suprabasal layers of the epidermis. However, spontaneous keratinocyte apoptosis in these layers is very seldom observed under physiological conditions (26McCall C.A. Cohen J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 111-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the cytolytic capacity of FasL expressed by normal human keratinocytes in vitro and ex vivo. Our data clearly show that keratinocyte FasL does not induce apoptosis of either adjacent keratinocytes in culture or Fas-sensitive cells overlaid on sections of normal human skin. This lacking of cytolytic activity is probably due to the absence of FasL at the surface of keratinocyte cells, as demonstrated by FACS analysis. We cannot exclude that lack of FasL surface expression could be due to the weak expression of FasL. Indeed, we have unpublished data 2I. Viard-Leveugle, R. R. Bullani, J. Schrenzel, J.-H. Saurat, J. Tschopp, and L. E. French, manuscript in preparation. that showed cell surface expression of FasL in cells treated to increase FasL mRNA transcription level. However, previous reports in other cell types, including activated T cells, have shown that the levels of FasL expressed at the cell surface can be regulated by rapid metalloproteinase cleavage of cell surface FasL, despite stable FasL gene expression (27Kayagaki N. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 28Mariani S.M. Matiba B. Bäumler C. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In these cell types, treatment with inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases specifically led to the accumulation of cell surface FasL and to a decrease in soluble FasL in the culture medium. Thus, we investigated whether the lack of membrane FasL in normal human keratinocytes was due to excessive metalloprotease cleavage. This is most likely not the case, since soluble FasL could not be detected in culture supernatants of keratinocytes and furthermore, since treatment of keratinocytes with metalloproteinase inhibitors did not cause an increase in cell surface FasL staining, as evaluated by FACS (data not shown). We provide here first evidence for an intracellular localization of keratinocyte FasL. Indeed, FasL was clearly detected by FACS in permeabilized but not in non-permeabilized keratinocytes and was shown to be essentially localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo, using confocal and electron microscopical analysis. Maintenance of keratinocyte FasL in an intracellular localization may therefore be a physiological means by which to guarantee a rapid availability of cell surface FasL if required, while keeping this protein out of reach of cell surface Fas that is constitutively expressed and functional in keratinocytes. In this way, keratinocytes can protect themselves from spontaneous Fas-mediated apoptosis under physiological situations despite harboring all the proteins necessary to rapidly trigger it. In this way, keratinocytes can also suicide themselves under stress situations. Indeed, one can hypothesize that in a situation such a harmful UVB exposition of skin, intracellular FasL can be translocated to the keratinocyte cell surface where Fas receptor is present and then lead to apoptotic destruction of UVB-damaged keratinocytes and then avoid accumulation of mutated cells in skin. Such an exclusive intracellular localization of FasL has also been shown for cytotoxic T lymphocytes, in which FasL is stored in secretory lysosomes and exocytosed following T cell receptor engagement (29Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Using immunoelectron microscopy we have further analyzed the subcellular localization of FasL and shown that this protein is predominantly associated with intermediate filaments, the remainder being localized to lysosomes and cytoplasmic vesicles. Our observations suggest that FasL may be docking to intermediate filaments, even though the molecular interaction between FasL and intermediate filaments remain to be elucidated. Thus it is possible that intermediate filaments of human keratinocytes are somehow involved in regulating the transport of FasL to the plasma membrane. Intermediate filaments have already been involved in the translocation of proteins to the cell surface in response to certain stimuli. Indeed, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes disruption of intermediate filaments has been shown to induce marked dispersion of the perinuclear GLUT4 sugar transporter to peripheral regions of the cells (30Guilherme A.

Further investigation of the association between FasL and keratins may help explain how keratinocyte FasL can become cytolytic under selected circumstances and contribute to the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (11Viard I.

https://openalex.org/W1993169452,"DOC-2/DAB2 is a potent tumor suppressor in many cancer types including prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, expression of DOC-2/DAB2 can inhibit its growth. Our recent studies demonstrate that DOC-2/DAB2 can suppress both protein kinase C and peptide growth factor-elicited signal pathways via the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this study, we further showed that the proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 could also interact with proteins containing the Src homology 3 domain, such as Src and Fgr. The binding of c-Src to DOC-2/DAB2 was enhanced in cells treated with growth factor, and this interaction resulted in c-Src inactivation. The c-Src inactivation was evidenced by the decreased tyrosine 416 phosphorylation of c-Src and reduced downstream effector activation. It appears that DOC-2/DAB2 can bind to Src homology 3 domain of c-Src and maintain it in an inactive conformation. Thus, this study provides a new mechanism for modulating c-Src in prostatic epithelium and cancer. DOC-2/DAB2 is a potent tumor suppressor in many cancer types including prostate cancer.

The aberrant expression of DOC-2/DAB2 is often in tumors such as ovarian, prostate, choriocarcinoma, and mammary tumors (1Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A.

Increased expression of DOC-2/DAB2 inhibits the growth of these tumors, indicating that DOC-2/DAB2 must play a key role in controlling growth-related signal pathways. The phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 can be induced by several stimuli, such as growth factors and protein kinase C activator-TPA.1 We demonstrate that the serine 24 phosphorylation in the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 is required for its inhibitory effect on TPA-induced gene transcription (5Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid system, we further identify an interactive protein (i.e. DIP1/2 or DAB2IP) associated with the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 protein (7Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnell J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12622-12631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DIP1/2 protein is a new member of the Ras-GAP family, and its activity can be enhanced by interacting with DOC-2/DAB2 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells treated with TPA (7Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnell J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12622-12631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which results in inhibiting TPA-induced gene transcription and cell growth. Therefore, we conclude that DIP1/2 is a key downstream effector in DOC-2/DAB2-mediated signal cascade. In addition, the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 contains unique motifs such as three proline-rich domains (i.e. amino acid 619–627, 663–671, and 714–722). We demonstrated recently (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that one of these proline-rich domains (amino acid 663–671) can interact with Grb2, leading to the inhibition of both epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and neurotropin (NT-3)-induced Erk activation and gene transcription (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, DOC-2/DAB2 acts a negative feedback regulator in the peptide growth factor-mediated Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway. In this study, we further dissected the role of other proline-rich domains in the activity of DOC-2/DAB2. We found that the SH3 domain in c-Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, could interact with the first proline-rich domain (amino acid 619–627) of DOC-2/DAB2, and the amount of DOC-2/DAB2/c-Src complex was accumulated in PCa cells shortly treated with EGF. Our results demonstrated that such interaction could lead to the inhibition of tyrosine 416 phosphorylation of c-Src, a key amino acid modulating its kinase activity, in PCa treated with EGF. This interaction further resulted in the downstream effector-Erk inactivation. Apparently, this is a new regulatory mechanism of Src activity mediated by a potent negative factor, DOC-2/DAB2. LNCaP, NbE, and COS cells were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (3Tseng C.-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The following peptides were synthesized according to amino acid sequence of DOC-2/DAB2: PPQ (amino acid 619–627); LLQ (amino acid 619–627, proline to leucine); PPL (amino acid 663–671); LLL (amino acid 663–671, proline to leucine); and PPK (amino acid 714–722) (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All DOC-2/DAB2 cDNA constructs, pCI-neo-T7-p82 (p82) and pCI-neo-T7-ΔN (ΔN), and GST-Grb2 have been described previously (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). In each experiment, the control plasmid (pCI-neo) was supplemented to make an equal amount of total DNA. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were switched to serum-free T medium for another 24 h prior to the treatment with 50 ng/ml EGF (Upstate Biotechnology). For peptide transfection, cells were plated in a 24-well plate with serum-free medium for 24 h. ChariotTM reagent (Active Motif) was mixed with 100 ng of different oligopeptides according to the manufacturer's protocol. One h after transfection, cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml), and cell lysate was prepared at the indicated time. For GST pull-down assay, cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml of EGF, and cell lysate was collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) at the indicated time. After a low speed spin, 0.4 ml of supernatant was separately incubated with either 30 μl of GST-glutathione-Sepharose or GST fusion protein-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer and dissolved in the sample buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis probed with antibodies against DOC-2/DAB2 (αp96) (Transduction Laboratories) or against T7 tag (αT7) (Novagen). For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. After a low speed spin, 0.4 ml of supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of antibody against Src (Oncogene Research Products) and then 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer and dissolved in sample buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis detected by αT7. For determining phosphorylation status of Src, cells were transfected with Src expression vectors and exposed to 50 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. Cell lysate was collected in 70 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (with 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors). After a low speed spin, 20 μl of supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis. The filter was probed with the antibody against phosphorylated Src antibodies against either tyrosine 416 (αpSrc416) (Upstate Biotechnology) or tyrosine 527 (αpSrc527) (Cell Signaling), and the same filter was stripped and reprobed with the antibody against total Src (αSrc) (Oncogene). For determining phosphorylation status of Erk2 protein, cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-Erk2 and exposed to 50 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. Cell lysate was collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. After a low speed spin, 0.4 ml of supernatant was immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin-Matrix (Covance). After washing twice with lysis buffer, the pellets were added with sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. The filter was probed with the antibody against phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase p44/42 (αpErk) (Cell Signaling), and the same filter was stripped and reprobed with antibody against either total extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (αErk) or p42 (αErk2) (Cell Signaling). DOC-2/DAB2 contains three proline-rich domains indicating that the potential interaction with other proteins containing SH3 domain, in addition to Grb2 (4Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), should be expected. To screen the interaction with proteins containing SH3 domain, we performed pull-down experiment using several GST fusion proteins derived from three groups of proteins containing SH3 domain with different functions. For adapter proteins, Grb2 has been shown to interact with p82 (non-spliced DOC-2/DAB2 protein) previously (4Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); Crk did not show any detectable interaction with p82 (Fig. 1 A). For the non-receptor Src tyrosine kinase family, both c-Src and Fgr could interact with p82 (Fig. 1 A). However, no detectable interaction was shown between p82 and the SH3 domain of spectrin, an actin-binding protein (Fig. 1 A). Apparently, this interaction required the C-terminal of DOC-2/DAB2, because the N-terminal deletion of DOC-2/DAB2 (ΔN) (5Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) had much stronger interaction compared with p82 (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). We further mapped the specific site of proline-rich domain in DOC-2/DAB2 associated with the Src protein; several proline-rich peptides were synthesized according to the three proline-rich domains in DOC-2/DAB2 (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, peptide PPL corresponding to the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 could interrupt the association of Grb2 with DOC-2/DAB2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the control peptide LLL, substitution of all the proline in PPL with leucine did not have any effect (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Also, the first and third proline-rich peptides (PPQ and PPK) did not have any effect on interaction of Grb2 with DOC-2/DAB2. On the other hand, both PPQ and PPL, but not control peptide LLL and LLQ, could interrupt the interaction between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 (Fig.1 B, top panel). Also, PPK did not have any significant inhibitory effect. These data indicated that the first and second proline-rich domains of DOC-2/DAB2 could interact with c-Src with a similar affinity (Fig. 1 C). To further verify the interaction of Src with DOC-2/DAB2 intracellularly, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 2 A, when both c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 were co-expressed in COS cells, the DOC-2/DAB2 was detected in the immunocomplex precipitated with αSrc. The amount of DOC-2/DAB2 in the immunocomplex was substantially increased when the cells were treated with EGF. Similarly, in LNCaP cells, the association of c-Src with DOC-2/DAB2 is promptly elevated in a time-dependent manner after EGF treatment (Fig.2 B). The interaction peaked at 20 min after EGF treatment and remained unchanged for 60 min, indicating that c-Src had a prolonged interaction with DOC-2/DAB2. We further determined whether EGF was able to increase the affinity between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2. We measured the dissociation constant between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 in the presence of PPQ. As shown in Fig. 3, the increasing amount of PPQ caused the dissociation between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2. However, in the presence of EGF, the IC50 of PPQ was 259 μmcompared with the IC50 of PPQ (168 μm) in the absence of EGF. Taken together, these data indicated that EGF could facilitate the interaction between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 because of the increased the affinity between both proteins. It is known that c-Src has two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 416 (Tyr-416) in c-Src represents its activated status; in contrast, the phosphorylation of tyrosine 527 (Tyr-527) in c-Src represents the inactivate form of this protein (11Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 12Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R295-R298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol.

To further determine the effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on the phosphorylation status of c-Src, we examined the phosphorylation status, particularly Tyr-416 and Tyr-527, of c-Src in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, the phosphorylation status of c-Src was determined in LNCaP cells treated with EGF probed with either αpSrc416 or αpSrc527, respectively, and the total protein levels of c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 were also determined. In the presence of EGF (Fig. 4 B), the phosphorylation of Tyr-416 gradually increased and reached the plateau after 20 min. Concurrently, the phosphorylation of Tyr-527 decreased after 10 min and then rebounded after 20 min (Fig.4 C). Forty min after EGF treatment, both Tyr-416 and Tyr-527 phosphorylation returned to the basal levels (Fig. 4, B andC). In contrast, the presence of DOC-2/DAB2 inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of Tyr-416 after EGF treatment (Fig.4 B). On the other hand, DOC-2/DAB2 did not have any effect on Tyr-527 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). To avoid any transfection artifact, we decided to take another approach by interrupting the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and c-Src in NbE cells expressing endogenous DOC-2/DAB2 and c-Src proteins using synthetic peptides. PPQ that inhibits the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and c-Src (Fig. 2 B) was transfected into NbE cells. LLQ with the substitution of proline with leucine was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig.5 A, the phosphorylation of c-Src was determined by using αpSrc416 in NbE cells after EGF treatment. The intensity of Tyr-416 phosphorylation was measured and normalized with the total Src (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of blocking peptide, EGF induced Tyr-416 phosphorylation (∼3-fold). Apparently, PPQ could antagonize the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and c-Src and significantly increased the Tyr-416 phosphorylation (∼4- to 6-fold) in NbE cells without or with EGF treatment. Although LLQ slightly increased Tyr-416 phosphorylation (∼2-fold), maybe because of its partial inhibitory activity (Fig. 1 B), however, no further elevation in Tyr-416 phosphorylation (∼2-fold) was detected in NbE cells after EGF treatment. Taken together, these data indicated that DOC-2/DAB2 could directly suppress the Tyr-416 phosphorylation, but not Tyr-527 phosphorylation, of c-Src via binding to the SH3 domain of c-Src. To understand the effect of the DOC-2/DAB2 on c-Src-mediated signal transduction induced by EGF, the activation of one of the downstream effectors, Erk2, was examined. As shown in Fig.6 A, EGF could stimulate Erk2 phosphorylation in LNCaP cells compared with control. In the presence of c-Src protein, the levels of Erk2 phosphorylation further elevated in LNCaP cells treated with EGF, indicating c-Src elicited an alternative pathway to activate Erk2. Expression of DOC-2/DAB2 suppressed EGF alone induced Erk2 phosphorylation and c-Src-elicited pathway leading to Erk2 phosphorylation. These data indicated that DOC-2/DAB2 was able to inhibit c-Src activity. The effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on the phosphorylation status of Erk induced by c-Src was also studied in NbE cells. As shown in Fig. 6 B, EGF induced an approximately 4-fold elevation of Erk phosphorylation in NbE cells in the absence of peptide. However, PPQ could further enhance the EGF-mediated Erk2 phosphorylation (13-fold). Using the control peptide LLQ, we observed a moderate induction of EGF-mediated Erk2 phosphorylation, because LLQ was a partial antagonist (Fig.1 B). These data provide further evidence that DOC-2/DAB2 is involved in the negative feedback mechanism modulating c-Src activity via the interaction between proline-rich domain and SH3 domain in prostatic epithelia. From our previous studies (5Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol.

To delineate the mechanism of action of DOC-2/DAB2 in more detail, we analyzed its interactive protein in this study. From a pull-down assay (Fig. 1 A), in addition to Grb2, we further found that Src family proteins were able to interact with the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of DOC-2/DAB2. However, it is interesting to notice that the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 contains a disabled motif as in DAB1 phosphorylated by c-Src on its tyrosine residue (15Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated DAB1 protein serves as a binding site for SH2 domain of c-Src (15Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). There is no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in DOC-2/DAB2 by c-Src (data not show). 2Personal communication with Dr. Jonathan A. Cooper. These data suggest a functional difference between DAB1 and DOC-2/DAB2. Src is a member of a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in protein receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways (17Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In human colon cancer, there is a strong correlation between c-Src protein kinase activity and tumor stage (18Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In PCa, c-Src signal transduction is involved in increased migration capacity of these cells (19Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We also noticed that almost all PCa cell lines tested in our laboratory expressed c-Src protein, some with absent DOC-2/DAB2 expression (data not shown). These data prompted us to investigate the role of interaction between c-Src and DOC-2/DAB2 in PCa cells under the stimulation of EGF. Our data demonstrated (Fig. 6 A) that increased expression of c-Src in LNCaP cells enhanced Erk2 phosphorylation, indicating that the involvement of c-Src in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in PCa cells. In the presence of DOC-2/DAB2, EGF-induced Erk2 phosphorylation was suppressed (Fig.6 A). This could be, at least partially, attributed to the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 (6Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, DOC-2/DAB2 could also inhibit c-Src-mediated Erk2 phosphorylation (Fig.6 A), implying that DOC-2/DAB2 had an effect on c-Src activity. Data from co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2 A) clearly indicated the DOC-2/DAB2 complex contained c-Src and the major interactive site located in the first proline-rich domain in DOC-2/DAB2. Using a specific peptide, PPQ, the Erk activation can be further enhanced in a prostatic epithelium, expressing endogenous DOC-2/DAB2, treated with EGF (Fig. 6 B). These data support the multiple inhibitory roles of DOC-2/DAB2 in EGF-mediated signal cascade. It is known that there are two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-416 and Tyr-527) in c-Src protein (Fig.7). However, tyrosine phosphorylation in c-Src has a different impact on its kinase activity (11Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 12Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R295-R298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Tyr-416 phosphorylation, located in the activation loop of Src, is closely correlated with c-Src kinase activity (13Xu W.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tyr-527 phosphorylation, located in the C terminus of c-Src, associates with the inactive form of c-Src (11Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Presumably, changing from a “closed conformation” (inactive) to an “open conformation” (active) signifies c-Src activation. Therefore, deletion or mutation of Tyr-527, often seen in v-Src, leads to constitutive activation of Src kinase activity. Disruption of either intramolecular interaction will lead to activation of c-Src. For example, displacement of SH3 domain with other SH3 binding protein leads to a more profound activation of c-Src activity (26Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, mutations in SH3 domain have been found in some v-Src proteins (28Kato J.Y. Takeya T. Grandori C. Iba H. Levy J.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Potts W.M. Reynolds A.B. Lansing T.J. Parsons J.T. Oncogene Res. 1988; 3: 343-355PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the key role of SH3 domain in modulating c-Src activity. However, in this study, we demonstrated that DOC-2/DAB2 could interact with the SH3 domain of c-Src and perhaps stabilize its closed conformation. This appears to be a novel mechanism in the modulation of c-Src activity. Because DOC-2/DAB2 acts a potent negative regulator for cell growth, the association of DOC-2/DAB2 with c-Src provides an additional mechanism for its action.

NCS-1/frequenin has been shown to enhance synaptic transmission in PC12 cells andDrosophila and Xenopus, respectively. However, the precise molecular mechanism for the enhancement of exocytosis is largely unknown. In PC12 cells, NCS-1 potentiated exocytosis evoked by ATP, an agonist to phospholipase C-linked receptors, but had no effect on depolarization-evoked release. NCS-1 also enhanced exocytosis triggered by ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore that bypasses K+ and Ca2+ channels. Overexpression of NCS-1 caused a shift in the dose-response curve of inhibition of ATP-evoked secretion using phenylarsine oxide, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase (PI4K). Plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate pools were increased upon NCS-1 transfection as visualized using a phospholipase C-δ pleckstrin homology domain-green fluorescent protein construct. NCS-1-transfected cell extracts displayed increased phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate biosynthesis, indicating an increase in PI4K activity. Mutations in NCS-1 equivalent to those that abolish the interaction of recoverin, another EF-hand-containing Ca2+ sensor, with its downstream target rhodopsin kinase, lost their ability to enhance exocytosis. Taken together, the present data indicate that NCS-1 modulates the activity of PI4K, leading to increased levels of phosphoinositides and concomitant enhancement of exocytosis.

Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), 1The abbreviations used are: NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PAO, phenylarsine oxide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; hGH, human growth hormone; PSS, physiological saline solution; NGF, nerve growth factor; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; PH, pleckstrin homology; PtdIns(4, 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(4)P-5-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5-kinase the mammalian homologue of frequenin, belongs to the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins (1Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Google Scholar), which includes recoverin/S-modulin, visinin, visinin-like proteins, neurocalcin, and hippocalcin. Some members of this family, such as recoverin/S-modulin and visinin, are expressed only in photoreceptor cells and are thought to function in the control of visual transduction pathways, whereas the functional roles of the other members are largely unknown. Most family members are solely expressed in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells, but a frequenin homologue has been identified in yeast, suggesting a more general role for this protein in mediating Ca2+responses. All members of the NCS family share four EF-hand motifs and a myristoylated N terminus. For NCS-1, three of the four EF-hands are functional Ca2+-binding motifs, whereas the EF-hand closest to the N terminus (EF1) is non-functional (2Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural analysis of recoverin have led to the calcium/myristoyl switch model in which Ca2+ binding to the NCS proteins may trigger their translocation from the cytosol to intracellular membranes (3Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Google Scholar, 4Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar). This model suggests that Ca2+ binding to the NCS proteins induces a large conformational change, resulting in the exposure of the myristoyl group believed to allow membrane attachment. In addition, the movement of the myristoyl group is thought to expose a hydrophobic pocket within the protein that could then interact with target proteins (4Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that the calcium/myristoyl switch is not a general feature of all members of this family, because the localization of NCS-1 was found to be independent of Ca2+, indicating that the myristoyl group may be freely accessible in the absence of Ca2+ binding to NCS-1 (5O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar). Overexpression of frequenin in Drosophila facilitates evoked neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (6Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Google Scholar), and injection of frequenin into Xenopus spinal neurons enhances both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission (7Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8001-8005Google Scholar). NCS-1 is also present in adrenal chromaffin and PC12 neuroendocrine cells, where its overexpression has been shown to increase Ca2+-regulated exocytosis from dense-core granules (8McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Google Scholar), analogous to the effect reported for Drosophila frequenin in enhancing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, the mechanism(s) by which NCS-1/frequenin regulates vesicular release is not known. A wide array of binding partners has been identified for NCS-1/frequenin, only some of which may be of physiological relevance. NCS-1/frequenin has been shown to activate membrane-bound guanylate cyclase and to inhibit rhodopsin kinase (6Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Google Scholar). However, these in vitro effects on photoreceptor proteins are unlikely to be relevant to the function of NCS-1/frequenin in vivo in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. NCS-1 also seems to activate various calmodulin targets, such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, calcineurin, and nitric-oxide synthase (10Poulain C. Ferrus A. Mallart A. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 427: 71-79Google Scholar, 11Schaad N.C. De Castro E. Nef S. Hegi S. Hinrichsen R. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Sikkink R. Rusnak F. Sygush J. Nef P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ozaita A. Nandi S. Ueda S. Rudy B. Coetzee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12808-12813Google Scholar). Despite these interactions, the binding partners for NCS-1 in vivo are not known for certain, and thus the molecular downstream targets mediating NCS-1 function remain to be determined. Recently, yeast frequenin was demonstrated to genetically and biochemically interact with, and regulate the activity of, the yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase (PI4K) Pik1 (17Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Google Scholar), which itself has been shown to be essential for Golgi-to-cell surface vesicular trafficking (18Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Google Scholar, 19Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Google Scholar). Similarly, the mammalian Pik1 homologue PI4Kβ (20Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Google Scholar) has been shown to interact with NCS-1 in vitro and if immunoprecipitated upon co-expression in non-neuronal cells (21Weisz O. Gibson G.A. Leung S.-M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Google Scholar, 22Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Google Scholar), suggesting that PI4Kβ may be an evolutionarily conserved and functionally important downstream target of NCS-1/frequenin. Inositol phospholipids have recently emerged as important regulators of exo- and endocytosis (23Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Google Scholar, 24Osborne S.L. Meunier F.A. Schiavo G. Neuron. 2001; 32: 9-12Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis of dense core vesicles has been shown to require a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITPα) (25Hay J.C. Martin T.F. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Google Scholar) and a PI(4)P-5-kinase (26Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukammi K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of a dense core vesicle-associated PI4K activity essential for exocytosis (27Wiedemann C. Schaefer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane (28Holz R. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Google Scholar) is an important step in secretion. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a substrate for phospholipase C (PLC) activated by G-protein-coupled receptors, and changes in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels are thus anticipated to lead to changes in secretion evoked by G-protein-coupled receptor agonists. However, in both neuronal and neuroendocrine cells, PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to play an important role in exocytosis independent from its PLC-mediated cleavage (29Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Google Scholar, 30Martin T.F. Loyet K.M. Barry V.A. Kowalchyk J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1137-1141Google Scholar), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 is likely to act directly on a specific target (31Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Chaudhary A. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8337-8343Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that NCS-1 enhances secretion from PC12 cells through regulating the activity of PI4K. Overexpression of NCS-1, but not of its myristoylation mutant, led to an enhancement of ATP- and ionomycin-evoked release. NCS-1 expression also decreased the sensitivity of the cells to phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PI4K, and increased the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane. Finally, three mutations in NCS-1 equivalent to those that interfere with the binding of recoverin to rhodopsin kinase had lost their enhancing effect on exocytosis, suggesting that NCS-1 acts through activating PI4K, leading to enhanced PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels and a downstream enhancement of regulated secretion. The NCS-1 construct was generated as described previously (32Chen X.-L. Zhong Z.-G. Yokoyama S. Bark C. Meister B. Berggren P.-O. Roder J. Higashida H. Jeromin A. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 649-659Google Scholar). The PI4Kβ, PI4Kβ(D656A), and PI4KβN terminus-GFP constructs were kindly provided by Rachel Meyers and have been described previously (33Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Google Scholar). The INP51-GFP and PH-EGFP/PH(R40L)-EGFP constructs were donated by John York and Tamas Balla, respectively. PCMV5-hGH was generated by subcloning the coding region of hGH, amplified by PCR and incorporating 5′ EcoRI and 3′XbaI sites, into the equivalent sites of pCMV5. NCS-1 mutants (G2A, E120Q, F22A, E26A, F55A, T92A) were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of all constructs was verified using automated DNA sequencing. Cell culture, transfection, and secretion experiments were performed as described (34Sugita S. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Google Scholar) with some modifications. PC12 cells (Riken Cell Bank) were cultured on 100-mm dishes coated with collagen (rat tail collagen type I; BD Biosciences). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in full medium (RPMI 1640 with heat-inactivated 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml)). Confluent cells (passage 6 throughout all experiments) were harvested using 0.125% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and plated onto collagen-coated 12-well dishes at 80% confluency. The next day (90–95% confluency), 0.6 μg of pCMV5-hGH and 0.6 μg of plasmid of interest were co-transfected using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specification in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and antibiotics to increase transfection efficiency. Each LipofectAMINE 2000 tube was used only once, as transfection and co-transfection efficiencies decreased when tubes were re-used multiple times. After 4 h, the transfection mixture was replaced by full medium. PC12 cells from two wells transfected with the same plasmids were harvested and pooled the next day to compensate for possible slight differences in transfection and co-transfection efficiencies. Cells were re-plated into 24-well plates at a ratio of two 12-wells for four 24-wells. Two days after replating (90–95% confluency), secretion experiments were performed with all test and control conditions carried out on the same pool of transfected cells. Controls were treated with 0.5 ml of physiological saline solution (PSS; 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). ATP-evoked secretion was stimulated by a 10 min incubation with ATP buffer (PSS containing 300 μm ATP), KCl-triggered secretion was stimulated by a 10-min incubation with high K+ saline solution (PSS containing 95 mm NaCl and 56 mm KCl), and ionomycin-triggered secretion was stimulated by a 10-min incubation with ionomycin (5 μmionomycin (Sigma) in PSS, final Me2SO concentration 0.5% (v/v)). Cells were incubated with α-latrotoxin (final 1.5 nm) in PSS for 10 min. At the end of the experiment, dishes were transferred to ice, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. hGH in the supernatant from this centrifugation was taken as secreted hGH. The cells in the dishes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and added to the pellet of the Eppendorf centrifugation of the medium. Cells were then lysed by five freeze-thaw cycles (in a dry ice/ethanol bath and a 37 °C heating block), and insoluble material was pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge. hGH in the supernatant from this centrifugation was taken as the cellular hGH that was not secreted. hGH levels in the various samples were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed in duplicates or triplicates, and the average percent of total hGH released was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed with the paired Student's t test. PC12 cells were plated onto collagen-coated 6-well tissue culture plates at 80% confluency as described above. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in COS cell medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml)) on 100-mm dishes. The next day (90–95% confluency), cells were transfected with the appropriate vector using 2.4 μg of vector/well of a 6-well plate for PC12 cells and 10 μg of vector/100-mm dish for COS-7 cells, respectively, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described above. One day later, cells were lysed using 500 μl of hot 1% SDS, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature and hybridized with primary antibody (either anti-NCS-1 rabbit polyclonal or anti-PI4Kβ rabbit polyclonal, respectively, at 1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TTBS, blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-tagged anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO A/S) at 1:2000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were co-transfected with either pCMV5-hGH and pcDNA3.1 or with pCMV5-hGH and pcDNA3.1-NCS-1, as described above. Cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing various concentrations of phenylarsine oxide (Sigma) (final Me2SO concentration in all conditions maintained at 0.5% (v/v)) for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, followed by secretion assays as described above. To visualize localization of endogenous NCS-1 and PI4Kβ, non-transfected cells were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (coated for 1 h with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine, M r30,000–70,000 (Sigma)) and grown for 3 days in either full medium (non-differentiated) or in serum-reduced (1%) medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF 2.5 S (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed for 20 min at 37 °C with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 4% (w/v) sucrose. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and preincubated in blocking buffer (10% goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by exposure to primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. To determine the amount of overexpression of NCS-1, as well as the amount of co-expression of NCS-1 and hGH, 50% of cells were processed for secretion assays, whereas the remainder were replated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry 2 days after replating. The amount of overexpressed protein was qualitatively assessed using antibody dilutions that barely visualized endogenous protein levels but easily detected overexpressed proteins. The amount of co-expression was calculated by counting the number of cells expressing both hGH and the protein of interest, as compared with cells expressing either one or the other protein only. Transfection efficiencies were calculated by counting the number of cells expressing either proteins, and 700–1200 cells were counted for each construct. Transfection efficiencies regularly amounted to around 15%, and all NCS-1 constructs reached co-transfection efficiencies of ≥90%. The following antibodies were used: anti-NCS-1 rabbit polyclonal (44162) (35Werle M.J. Roder J. Jeromin A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 284: 33-36Google Scholar) or chicken polyclonal (22Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Google Scholar), anti-PI4Kβ rabbit polyclonal (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-synaptobrevin/VAMP2 mouse monoclonal (Cl 69.1; Synaptic Systems), anti-syntaxin 1 mouse monoclonal (HPC-1; Sigma), and anti-hGH rabbit polyclonal (National Hormone and Peptide Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). The specificities of the polyclonal anti-NCS-1 and anti-PI4Kβ antibodies have been described previously (15Tsujimoto T. Jeromin A. Saitoh N. Roder J.C. Takahashi T. Science. 2002; 295: 2276-2279Google Scholar, 33Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies included horse anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas red (TR), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or TR (all from Vector Laboratories) and rabbit anti-chicken IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma). Cells were either examined on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS NT) under a ×40 oil-immersion objective, and data were acquired using Leica software or on an upright microscope (Leica) under a ×40 or ×100 oil-immersion objective, and data were acquired using IPLab. Cells were co-transfected with NCS-1 or NCS-1(G2A) and either phospholipase C-δ PH domain-GFP construct (PH-EGFP) or PH(R40L)-EGFP, a mutant unable to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 (36Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Google Scholar). Cells were either visualized live or after fixation and permeabilization as described above, 2 days after transfection, with identical results. For experiments measuring PH-EGFP intensities upon PAO treatment, cells were fixed but not permeabilized. To quantify intensities, rectangles of 80 × 110 pixels centered on each GFP-positive, well separated cell were collected from each random field acquired using a ×40 oil-immersion objective. Pixel intensities within each rectangle were calculated in IPLab, and a total of 100 cells were counted for each condition. Cells with the highest PH-EGFP expression levels were excluded, as they often gained a rounded appearance and formed membrane blebs (37Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Google Scholar). Experiments were done three times, and the data were analyzed using the paired Student'st test. PC12 cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (3 × 107 cells/ml). Cells (400 μl) were incubated with 15 μg of pcDCNA3.1-NCS-1, 15 μg of pcDNA3.1, or with 15 μg of pCMV5-GFP for 3 min and electroporated (330 V, 20 ms) using an ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator (BTX; Genetronics Inc., San Diego, CA). Electroporated cells were immediately transferred into 10 ml of full medium, washed once, and counted. Under the indicated electroporation conditions, cell survival usually amounted to around 10–15%, and electroporation efficiency, as measured by counting the fraction of cells expressing GFP 2 days after electroporation, amounted to around 50%. Cells were plated onto collagen-coated 100-mm dishes at 5 × 106 cells/dish. Two days later (95% confluency), attached cells were harvested, washed into PBS, and counted, and 0.5 × 106 cells were pelleted in Eppendorf tubes. Pellets were quick-frozen in liquid N2 until further use. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2) and disrupted by passing five times through a 17-gauge needle syringe. The aliquot of the prepared lysate was used directly in an assay, or the resulting lysate was further fractionated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of this centrifugation was taken as cytosol fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer and taken as membrane fraction. PI4K activity was measured as described previously (61Balla A. Tuymetova G. Barshishat M. Geiszt M. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20041-20050Google Scholar, 62Carpenter C.L. Duckwoth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Google Scholar). Briefly, to initiate phospholipid biosynthesis, cell lysate and membrane fractions were diluted with kinase buffer to 45 μl, and 5 μl of 0.5 mm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 60 μl of 1 n HCl. A two-phase mixture was induced, and the phosphorylated lipids were extracted by adding 160 μl of chloroform:methanol, 1:1 (v/v). The extracted products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (silica gel 60 thin layer plates, using chloroform/methanol/15n ammonium hydroxide/water (90:90:7:22) (v/v/v/v) as the solvent system). Radiolabeled PtdIns(4)P was identified by TLC mobility in comparison with purified PtdIns(4)P standard. To identify the subcellular localization of NCS-1 and PI4Kβ in PC12 cells, antibodies against NCS-1, PI4Kβ, VAMP2, and syntaxin 1 were used to stain non-transfected PC12 cells. In both non-differentiated and NGF-differentiated cells, endogenous NCS-1 was mainly diffuse and cytosolic, with some additional perinuclear staining (Fig.1, A and B). PI4Kβ staining was observed in the cytosol and in a perinuclear area, as described for chromaffin cells (38Pan C.-Y. Jeromin A. Lundstrom K. Yoo S.H. Roder J. Fox A.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 222: 2427-2433Google Scholar), and upon NGF differentiation, PI4Kβ staining was enriched in processes, consistent with its reported localization on secretory vesicles (27Wiedemann C. Schaefer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Google Scholar, 39Wiedemann C. Schaefer T. Burger M.M. Sihra T.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5594-5602Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,C and D). In comparison, VAMP2 staining was primarily observed in a perinuclear area in non-differentiated cells and was significantly enriched in processes in differentiated cells, in accordance with its localization on secretory vesicles of PC12 cells (40Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Google Scholar, 41Papini E. Rossetto O. Cutler D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1332-1336Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, E and F). Syntaxin 1 was localized to the plasma membrane, with more intracellular staining observed upon NGF differentiation, suggesting that under conditions of intense membrane fusion, as occurs during neurite formation, syntaxin 1 undergoes recycling in differentiating PC12 cells (42Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,G and H). In all cases, no immunostaining was observed when incubation with primary antibodies was omitted (not shown). The comparative subcellular localization data suggest similar subcellular distributions for NCS-1 and PI4Kβ, with both proteins being partially cytosolic and partially associated with perinuclear structures. To study the effects of NCS-1 and PI4Kβ on exocytosis, we employed an assay developed by Holz and co-workers (43Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Google Scholar) in which plasmids encoding hGH and a second protein of interest are transiently co-transfected into PC12 cells. In transfected cells, hGH is packaged into vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway and serves as a reporter for exocytosis as a function of stimulation. A high probability of co-transfection of two distinct plasmids into the same cells makes it possible to investigate the effect of the protein of interest on hGH secretion. A change in hGH secretion upon co-transfection of a particular protein is taken as evidence for an involvement of the protein in exocytosis. This assay has been successfully used to implicate a variety of proteins in exocytosis (34Sugita S. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Google Scholar, 44Wang Y. Okamoto M.

Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Google Scholar) and thus serves as a useful model system to study the role of NCS-1 and PI4Kβ in secretion. Extracellular ATP is thought to evoke secretion from PC12 cells by binding to two purinergic receptors: a P2Y receptor, which leads to the activation of PLC and concomitant inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and a P2X non-selective cation channel, which leads to Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (47Barry V.A. Cheek T.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 451-462Google Scholar, 48Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1967931222,"Previous work demonstrated an essential role for the atypical protein kinase C interacting protein, p62, in neurotrophin survival and differentiation signaling. Here we show that p62 interacts not only with TrkA but also with TrkB and TrkC, which are the primary receptors for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3. The interaction of p62 with TrkA requires the kinase activity of TrkA. Mapping analysis indicates that p62 does not compete with Shc for binding to TrkA, and p62 association was confined to the juxtamembrane region of TrkA, amino acids 472-493. By immunofluorescence the colocalization of p62 and TrkA was observed 30 min post-nerve growth factor treatment within overlapping vesicular structures. Upon subcellular fractionation, activated TrkA colocalized to an endosomal compartment and p62 was coassociated with the receptor post-nerve growth factor stimulation. Moreover, an absence of p62 blocked internalization of TrkA without an effect on phosphorylation of either TrkA or MAPK; however, Erk5 signaling was selectively abrogated. We propose that p62 plays a novel role in connecting receptor signals with the endosomal signaling network required for mediating TrkA-induced differentiation."

Here, we report the discovery of a new acute mechanotransduction pathway.

Caveolae are small, flask-shaped, plasmalemmal invaginations that are found on the surface of many cell types.

Caveolae may have a distinct lipid composition consisting of cholesterol, sphingolipids (sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids), and phosphatidylinositols (20Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A.

Biol. 1999; 116: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, caveolae may contain up to 95% of total cell sphingomyelin. In addition, ligand-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis occurs within caveolin-rich membranes (23Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

The sphingomyelin pathway is initiated by activation of sphingomyelinase (SMase), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, a second messenger stimulating multiple signaling cascades (for review, see Refs. 25Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar and 26Levade T. Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Here, we report a novel physiological function for neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), namely the discovery that N-SMase, an enzyme likely to be exposed externally on the plasma membrane and thus directly to fluid stressors, appears to initiate acute mechanotransduction, leading to activation of downstream MAP kinases. Reagents and other supplies were obtained from the following sources: [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (55 mCi/mmol) and Percoll from Amersham Biosciences; imidazole, ceramide, DETAPAC, octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus), glycerophosphate, anti-diphosphorylated ERK1 and 2 monoclonal antibody, and anti-pan ERK antibody from Sigma; cardiolipin from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); diacylglycerol kinase from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit from Pierce; anti-acid sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody (2234) from BD Biosciences; M-450 Dynabeads from Dynal (New Hyde Park, NY); and Optiprep from Invitrogen. Preimmune serum and serum raised against bovine N-SMase were generously provided by Dr. Martin Kroenke (Cologne University, Germany) (27Bernardo K. Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kreder D. Micheli M. Schafer R.

Scyphostatin was a generous gift from Dr. Takeshi Ogita (Sankyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). As described previously (3Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol.

After the perfusion described above, the luminal cell plasma membranes and caveolae of the endothelium were purified using the in situ silica coating procedure as described in our past work (28Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 29Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998: 34-46Google Scholar). Briefly, the luminal surface of the endothelium of the rat lung vasculature was coated with an ice-cold colloidal silica solution in situ. After tissue homogenization, the silica-coated endothelial cell plasma membrane (P) was isolated from the tissue homogenate (H) by density centrifugation. Caveolae were separated from P by homogenization in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C and then isolated by flotation in sucrose gradient (V and V′ fraction, respectively). Bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMVECs) were grown and used to isolate a plasmalemmal (PM) and caveolin-rich membrane fractions (AC) as described (29Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998: 34-46Google Scholar, 30Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. J. Biol.

Briefly, confluent BLMVEC cells (ten 150 mm dishes) were washed, scraped and homogenized before centrifugation (1000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The post nuclear supernatant (PNS) was overlaid on 30% Percoll before centrifugation at 84,000 × g, for 1 h at 4 °C. A membranous band visible about two-thirds from the bottom of the tube was collected (PM). AC was separated from PM by sonication and Optiprep density centrifugation. AC is enriched in caveolin but also contains lipid rafts, nuclear, Golgi, and possibly other membranes (31Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Magnetic immunoisolations were performed as described (31Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, M450 Dynal beads conjugated to the caveolin monoclonal antibody (clone 2234) (2 × 107 M450 beads and 25 μg of IgG) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the starting membrane fraction and then washed and magnetically separated to isolate two fractions,i.e. material bound to the beads and unbound material. The activity of N- and A-SMase was estimated by the method of Wiegmann et al. (32Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Briefly, selected fractions (H, P, V or V′, T or S, and P-V or P-V′; 10 μg protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 3.4 μm[N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (55 mCi/mmol). The reaction was terminated by adding 800 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1; v/v) and 200 μl of H2O. [14C]Phosphorylcholine released from [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin in the aqueous phase was collected and counted by liquid scintillation counting. To measure the activity of A-SMase, perfused rat lungs were homogenized in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and the subcellular fractions (10 μg protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 250 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 3.4 μm[N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin. [14C]Phosphorylcholine was collected and measured as described above. Ceramide was measured by diacylglycerol kinase labeling (22Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar, 33Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat lung P (100 μg) was extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/1 n HCl (100:100:1; v/v), and lipids in organic phase were collected and dried under N2. The reaction was initiated by mixing the lipid film with reaction buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm cardiolipin, and 1.5% octyl-β-d-glucoside, 0.2 mm DETAPAC, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg of diacylglycerol kinase, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by CHCl3/CH3OH/1 n HCl (100:100:1; v/v). Ceramide-1-phosphate was resolved by thin layer chromatography using CHCl3/CH3OH/acetic acid at the ratio 65:15:5 (v/v). The lipid was identified by γ-32P-labeled ceramide standard and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined by Micro BCA (Pierce) and DC (Bio-Rad) protein assays accordingly to each manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western analysis was performed as in past work (3Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine whether elevated hemodynamic stressors in situ could activate SMase activity, we measured the activity of N- and A-SMase in rat lungs under elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The blood was flushed at 37 °C from the lung vasculature at pulmonary artery pressures of 6–8 mm Hg for 5 min. Then the vascular pressure was either maintained at 6–8 mm Hg (basal flow) or elevated to 14–16 mm Hg, which more than doubles the flow rate (high flow). The lungs were subfractionated in order to measure the activity of both N- and A-SMase in the total lung H and in the isolated P. P relative to H is enriched 15–100-fold in endothelial cell surface markers (i.e. caveolin, 5′-nucleotidase (5′-NT), and angiotensin converting enzyme) while being markedly depleted of proteins localized elsewhere in the cell or tissue (i.e. fibroblast surface antigen, ε-COP, ERK1/2) (3Rizzo V.

Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998: 34-46Google Scholar) (Fig 3 D). Our previous studies using this perfusion model and isolation system detected rapid activation of eNOS and tyrosine kinases at the luminal endothelial cell plasma membrane (3Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Rizzo V. McIntosh D.P. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34724-34729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here, N-SMase activity in P increased rapidly with greater vascular pressure/flow rate (Fig. 1). This response was not detected in H, consistent with the small proportion of luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes in the tissue. A-SMase activity was detected, but did not change in either fraction over the 5 min of increased vascular pressure/flow.Figure 1Acute mechanoactivation of N- but not A-SMase in endothelial cell plasma membranes.Rat lung vasculature was perfused in situ first for 5 min at 6–8 mm Hg and then at a higher pressure of 14–15 mm Hg for the time indicated. The activity of either N-SMase (filled symbols) or A-SMase (open symbols) in the rat lung homogenates (H,squares) or the isolated luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes (P, circles) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of the enzyme activity compared with time zero is presented. Data are the average of two experiments (n = 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next focused on the mechanoactivation of N-SMase at the endothelial cell surface in greater detail. Fig. 2 A shows that the increase in the specific activity of N-SMase in P began to occur within 30 s of elevated perfusion pressure/flow. The activity reached a maximum of 2.2-fold over baseline at 2 min (1.53 + 0.1 nmol/mg/h (n = 4) versus 0.680 + 0.017 nmol/mg/h (n = 4)). The N-SMase activity began to decrease after 3 min and had returned to baseline levels by 10 min. The N-SMase activity appeared constant in controls subjected only to the baseline pressure/flow. We also tested whether this transient mechanoresponse could be repetitively induced. Lungs perfused at high pressures for 2 min and then at baseline pressure for 3 min followed by a second high pressure/flow rate perfusion for 2 min showed a second rapid increase in N-SMase activity in the P (data not shown). Thus, the activity of N- but not A-SMase was acutely responsive to, and rapidly activated by, increased hemodynamic stressor in situ. This induction was transient but not refractory after only 3 min. Because SMase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, the activation of this enzyme should result in the transient accumulation of the product in the membranes. We measured ceramide levels in P under similar perfusion conditions and found that ceramide levels closely followed N-SMase activity. Just 1 min of vascular perfusion at the elevated pressure/flow rate increased ceramide level detected in P by 30% over the control (Fig. 2 B). This response reached a maximum of 80% after 3 min of perfusion, maintained a plateau through 5 min, and decreased significantly by 10 min. In the controls where the flow rate/pressure was kept constant over the same time, the ceramide levels did not change. Next, we studied the sensitivity of N-SMase and ceramide formation to different flow rates and vascular pressures. Because maximal activation was observed after 2 min stimulation (Fig. 2 A), we perfused the vasculature for 2 min at pressures varying from 6 to 18 mm Hg, which produced flow rates in this system varying from 4 to 14 ml/min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 C, even a small increase to 8 mm Hg (6 ml/min) from a baseline of 6 mm Hg increased N-SMase activity in P by 30%. A maximum of nearly 2-fold over baseline activity was reached at 12–14 mm Hg (10–12 ml/min). Under the same conditions, ceramide levels in P also increased progressively to an apparent maximum of 1.7-fold over baseline at 12–14 mm Hg (10–12 ml/min) (Fig. 2 D). These cumulative results demonstrated that the acute increase in vascular pressure/flow rapidly stimulates N-SMase activity to induce formation and accumulation of ceramide in the endothelial cell plasma membrane in a time- and flow rate-dependent manner. The mechanosensitive SMase existing at the luminal endothelial cell surface may be associated with caveolae, because endothelial caveolae are primary sites for rapid mechano-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (3Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and may be mechanosensing organelles (3Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P.

Enzyme activities were measured in caveolae isolated from P in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (V and V′ fraction, respectively). With detergent, the major activity was detected in the Triton-soluble fractions at levels nearly 5-fold enriched over P (Fig. 3 A). This is consistent with the known detergent solubility of N-SMase as well as sphingomyelin extractability (34Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Without detergent, substantial N-SMase activity was found in caveolae with nearly 6-fold enrichment over P (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, the major activity of A-SMase was found in lung homogenates with >10-fold depletion in P and even more so in caveolae (Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 D and in past studies (4Rizzo V.

The ion conductance of voltage-dependent ion channels is tightly regulated by the gating mechanism encoded in membrane voltage sensors and cytoplasmic gates of the pore-forming α1 subunit (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). This voltage gating is due to the displacement of membrane charges (2Stühmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) that has been documented as gating current (3Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.

Thus, investigation of the mobility of cytoplasmic regions of Ca2+ channels associated with their gating is important for understanding of the molecular correlates of channel regulation and mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling. Spectral properties of the enhanced cyan (ECFP) and yellow fluorescent proteins (EYFP) (10Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

Here we genetically fused the cytoplasmic N and C termini of the human Cav1.2 channel α1C pore-forming subunits with EYFP and ECFP, respectively. The labeled channels were then functionally expressed in COS1 cells. The rearrangements of the tails due to transition into the distinct functional states of the channel were monitored using FRET (12Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

A regulatory role for the voltage-gated mobility of the C-terminal tail was then characterized.

To prepare the α1C,77-(ECFP)C expression plasmid, the 1029-bp AatII/NotI fragment of 77pcDNA3 (13Kepplinger K.J.F. Kahr H. Förstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schneider H. Schmidt T. Groschner K.

(EYFP)N-α1C,77F-(ECFP)C and (EYFP)N-α1C,IS-IV-(ECFP)Cexpression plasmids were prepared in a similar way using (EYFP)N-α1C,77 and (EYFP)N-α1C,IS-IV expression plasmids.

To prepare (PH-EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)Cexpression plasmid, the 3474-bp NotI/PpuMI fragment of 77CFPpcDNA3 was replaced into the respective sites of (PH-EYFP)N-α1C,77. To prepare the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C expression plasmid, a 927-nucleotide 3′-terminal AatII/XhoI PCR fragment with stop codon replaced by the XhoI linker was ligated with the XhoI/NotI fragment of open reading frame of the PH-CFP plasmid into the AatII, NotI-cut pHLCC77 plasmid. Its 5096-nucleotidePpuMI/NotI fragment was then subcloned into 77pcDNA3 or (EYFP)N-α1C,77pcDNA3 to give the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C and (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)Cexpression plasmids, respectively. COS1 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (MatTek) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vectors coding for α1C, β1 (17Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T.

Effectene was used for transfection to minimize autofluorescence added by many other transfection reagents. EGF receptor was co-expressed in tail-anchoring FRET experiments. To release pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, serum-deprived (24 h) cells were exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml). Ion currents were recorded using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) at 20–22 °C by the whole-cell patch clamp method 48–72 h after transfection of COS1 cells. Voltage protocols were generated, and data were digitized, recorded, and analyzed using pClamp 8.1 software (Axon). The extracellular bath solution contained (in mm) NaCl, 100; BaCl2, 20; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 10, HEPES, 10, pH 7.4. The electrodes had resistance 3–6 megohms and were filled with pipette solution containing (in mm) CsCl, 110; MgATP, 5, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate, 10; tetraethylammonium, 20; cAMP, 0.2; HEPES, 20, pH 7.4. Currents were sampled at 2.5–5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Images were recorded with the Hamamatsu digital camera C4742-95 mounted on a Nikon epifluorescent microscope TE200 equipped with multiple filter sets (Chroma Technology). C-Imaging (Compix) and MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) software were used to obtain and analyze images. The photobleaching experiments were conducted with the 100-watt mercury lamp. For all other experiments, a 75-watt xenon lamp was used. FRET was quantified with three filter sets as follows: for EYFP cube, excitation filter 500/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 515 nm, and emission filter 535/30 nm; for FRET (ECFP/EYFP) cube, excitation 436/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 455 nm, and emission filter 540/30 nm; for ECFP cube, excitation filer 436/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 455 nm, and emission filter 480/40 nm. Regions of interest were selected using the C-Imaging software where intensity (I) from three filter sets was determined after background subtraction. Corrected intensity of FRET (IFRETc) was calculated (20Xia Z. Zhou Q. Lin J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1766-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as (IFRET − IECFP × 58.5% − IEYFP × 11.5%). In the patch clamp experiments, the acquisitions of fluorescence ranging from 50 to 300 ms were obtained with simultaneous recording of the current at the indicated conditioning voltages under steady state. In some cases, the images were adjusted pixel-by-pixel using the reference channel of regions of interest. With the acceptor photobleaching, we used an excitation filter 436/10 nm and an emission filter 470/30 nm for ECFP and an excitation filter 500/10 nm and emission filter 535/20 nm for EYFP. The apparent efficiency of FRET was calculated as (IECFP* − IECFP)/IECFP*, where IECFP and IECFP* − intensities of ECFP fluorescence before and after acceptor (EYFP) photobleaching, respectively. Normalization of the corrected FRET ratios against EYFP or ECFP fluorescence showed very similar values (Table I). Corrected FRET and bleed-through values were obtained by standard approach (20Xia Z.

For the double-labeled channels, we have experimentally determined that a = 58.5% and b = 11.5%. Background subtraction was carried out using the standard approach (e.g. Ref. 22Zal T. Zal M.A. Gascoigne N.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In each image, we determined the average fluorescence from the cell-free regions. Under our experimental conditions, the average fluorescence measured from these specified regions was not different from the fluorescence measured with unused substrate covered with the bath solution only. Variability of the background fluorescence ranged from 9 to 14, whereas those of the experimental cell fluorescence varied from 50 to 250 units of the same arbitrary scale. To obtain ratio of images, 10 was added to each pixel of the image corrected by the background subtraction to avoid division by zero. Plotting of corrected FRET images was carried out according to standard and well established procedures (for example, see Refs. 20Xia Z. Zhou Q. Lin J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1766-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 23Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Because our images were obtained from the same cells with the same level of ECFP expression, there was no need to additionally normalize FRET images against ECFP. Under these conditions, we focused only on the relative changes of fluorescence at different holding potentials. Comparison of the ratios of corrected FRET (+40 mV/−90 mV) with those additionally normalized against EYFP, ECFP, and square root of their product according to Xia and Liu (24Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) (see Table I) clearly demonstrates that additional normalization did not significantly change the results of corrected FRET ratio. This result was obtained probably because the ratio of ECFP to EYFP in experiments with the double-labeled channels was always equal to 1. The plasmids YKIDN and KIXCN coding for KID and KIX domains (25Mayr B.M. Canettieri G. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10936-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), respectively, were co-expressed (1:1) in COS1 cells with other cDNAs at 2.5:1 ratio to cDNA coding for an α1Csubunit. To monitor transcriptional activation under voltage clamp conditions, we used the perforated patch clamp technique (26Fan J.S. Palade P. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). β-Escin (20 μm, Sigma) was added to the pipette solution containing potassium gluconate 120, NaCl 10, MgATP 2.5, HEPES 5, and KCl, 20; pH 7.2. External solution contained (in mm) NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, CaCl22.0, and glucose 5.5, pH 7.4. Depolarization to +20 mV from the holding potential of −90 mV was applied to elicit maximum Ca2+current. To monitor changes of free Ca2+ concentration, cells were loaded with Fluo-4 by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in 5 μm Fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes) added to the external solution. For de-esterification of the probe, cells were incubated for another 20 min before experiment. Ca2+ measurements were performed at 20–22 °C using confocal microscope PCM2000 (Nikon, Inc.) with excitation by an argon laser at 488 nm and recording of the fluorescence emission at >515 nm. Confirming earlier findings (13Kepplinger K.J.F. Kahr H. Förstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schneider H. Schmidt T. Groschner K. Soldatov N.M. Romanin C.

(Lond.). 1999; 517: 353-368Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), fusion of the green fluorescent protein variants to the cytoplasmic N and/or C termini did not compromise channel function. The electrophysiological properties of the (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C channel were similar to those of the wild-type channel (13Kepplinger K.J.F. Kahr H. Förstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schneider H.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except of the acceleration by ∼15% of the Ba2+ current inactivation (Table II). A direct FRET acceptor photobleaching assay provided strong evidence of FRET in the (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)Cchannel (Fig. 1). Illumination of the transfected COS1 cells for 15 min with a mercury lamp caused on average >90% photobleaching of EYFP. The resulting increase in donor fluorescence (shown as yellow-green andyellow-red signals, Fig. 1 A, c ande, respectively) is a direct demonstration of FRET (11Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). As a positive control, under the same conditions, FRET was observed (Fig. 1 A, d and f) with the co-expressed mixture of the EYFP-PH and ECFP-PH domains of phospholipase Cδ1 (28van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In both cases FRET was confined to the plasma membrane region where the functional channel molecules reside. We found that the mixture of co-expressed (1:1) single N- and C-tail-labeled channel isoforms did not show substantial intermolecular FRET (Fig. 1 B) indicating that with the double-labeled α1C channels we recorded predominantly intramolecular FRET.Table IIComparison of electrophysiological properties of the wild-type α1C,77 (A) and fluorescent labeled (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C (B), and (EYFP)N-α1C,IS-IV-(ECFP)C (C) Ca2+ channelsα1CV maxV 0.5actV 0.5inFraction IsustτfastτslowmVmVmVmsA10.5 ± 1.6 (3)−12.5 ± 1.7 (3)−21.0 ± 0.8 (3)0.12 ± 0.02 (3)58.5 ± 7.5 (5)345 ± 84 (5)B12.0 ± 1.8 (6)−11.0 ± 1.6 (6)−18.0 ± 0.8 (5)0.07 ± 0.02 (3)46.6 ± 10.0 (12)364 ± 82 (12)C4.0 ± 2.5 (8)−15.5 ± 1.8 (8)−24.5 ± 1.4 (3)0.50 ± 0.09 (3)12.9 ± 0.8 (12)The α1C subunits were co-expressed with β1 and α2δ accessory subunits.

FRET is the result of long range dipole-dipole interactions between fluorophores. FRET depends on the distance (r 6) between the donor and acceptor fluorophore and, to a lesser extent, the relative orientation (κ2) of the dipoles (12Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). To determine the differences in relative proximity and/or angular orientation of the tagged α1C tails in the functionally distinct resting, conducting, and inactivated states of the channel, we combined FRET imaging with voltage clamp. We used quantitative analysis of reversibly changing FRET in place of acceptor photobleaching as the fluorophores became irreversibly damaged by photobleaching. Simultaneous monitoring of the Ba2+ current provided a direct assessment of the Cav1.2 channel's transition into the resting, conducting, or inactivated state prior to FRET imaging. The images were acquired with a three-filter set system, successfully used elsewhere (20Xia Z. Zhou Q. Lin J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1766-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), for sensitized acceptor emission. The recombinant channel, composed of the wild-type α1C,77and accessory β1 and α2δ subunits, was stabilized in either the resting or inactivated state by whole-cell voltage clamp at −90 or +40 mV, respectively. Depolarization to +40 mV was selected to evoke maximum activation of the channels under conditions when the state of inactivation could be monitored. Thus, the amplitudes of the Ba2+ currents (Fig. 2 d) were less than 50% of the maximum ones. The analysis of FRET images of a cell expressing the (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C channel (Fig. 2 A) showed that the sequential transitions between the resting (−90 mV, Fig. 2 A, c) and the inactivated states of the channel (+40 mV, Fig. 2 A, b) produced a fully reversible increase in FRET: (IFRETc)+40 mV/(IFRETc)−90 mV= 2.9 ± 0.7 (n = 24). The steady state inactivation analysis indicated that ∼7% of the Ba2+-conducting (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C channels remain available (Table II), suggesting that ≥93% of the channels are inactivated and ≤7% remain in the resting closed state at the end of the depolarization pulse shown in Fig. 2 A. Since the resting state is characterized by low FRET, this fraction has only slightly contributed to the measurement of FRET. Taken together, these data indicate that the cytoplasmic tails of the channel in the inactivated state are rearranged into a conformation that gives greater FRET as compared with the closed resting state. The electrophysiological properties of the α1Cchannel are not significantly changed by the deletion of the N-terminal tail (30Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proximal half of the C-terminal tail is essential for channel function (13Kepplinger K.J.F. Kahr H. Förstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schneider H. Schmidt T. Groschner K. Soldatov N.M. Romanin C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fusion of ECFP to the full size, 662-amino acid C-terminal tail of α1C,77 did not alter the electrophysiological properties of the (EYFP)N-α1C,77F-(ECFP)C channel (data not shown), but reduced efficiency of FRET determined in the acceptor photobleaching assay to 0.19 ± 0.02 (n = 29), thus indicating that apparent separation of the fluorophores has increased. However, the intensity of FRET in the inactivated state (+40 mV) of this full-length (EYFP)N-α1C,77F-(ECFP)C channel was not significantly different as compared with the truncated channel. Rapid spontaneous channel inactivation complicates direct FRET imaging of the channel in the transient conducting state. Replacement of the cytoplasmic accessory β1 subunit with β2a (32Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) significantly slowed inactivation (compare Ba2+ current traces ond in Fig. 2, A and B) and thus allowed the channel to be maintained in a predominantly conducting state. Voltage-dependent FRET was measured with the (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C/β2achannel at the end of a 3-s depolarization at +40 mV. Under these conditions, the Ba2+ current activation was almost maximal, whereas inactivation was minimal with respect to the time of FRET acquisition (marked by the red bar above the current traces). The voltage-dependent increase of FRET (3.8 ± 0.8, n = 15, see Fig. 2 B) resulting from the transition of the channels from the resting (−90 mV) to a predominantly conducting state (+40 mV) was found not to be significantly different from that determined for the inactivated state (2.9 ± 0.7, Fig. 2 A). Thus, the folding of the channel tails characterized by FRET in the ensemble of predominantly conducting channels was on average closer to those determined for the inactivated than those determined for the resting state of the same channel. This finding was independently confirmed by the study of the α1C,IS-IV channel that is deprived of slow inactivation by mutations introduced in the pore region (14Shi C. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6813-6821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The (EYFP)N-α1C,IS-IV-(ECFP)C channel expressed in COS1 cells showed the characteristic sustained Ba2+ current (Fig. 2 C, d). The amplitude of the Ba2+ current through the α1C,IS-IV channel was smaller than those through the α1C,77 channel. Similar changes were observed earlier for other isoforms of the Cav1.2 channel with impaired Ca2+-induced inactivation (33Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This was found to be due to a lower open probability and a 10–15% reduction in single channel conductance (13Kepplinger K.J.F. Kahr H. Förstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schneider H. Schmidt T. Groschner K. Soldatov N.M. Romanin C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the stable conducting (+40 mV) state of the α1C,IS-IV channel (Fig. 2 C, b), the corrected FRET increased 7.4 ± 0.9-fold (n = 19; p < 0.0005, compared with Fig. 2 A, b) suggesting further reduction in the apparent distance between the labeled tails and/or dipole reorientation of the fluorophores (12Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar) leading to an increase of FRET as compared with the resting state (−90 mV, see Fig. 2 C, c).

P., Lanéelle, M. A., Yu, K., Quémard, A., Smith, I., and Daffé, M. (2000) Mol. Microbiol. 36, 630–637). Assuming that the mutant would accumulate the putative precursors of the oxygenated mycolates of M. tuberculosis, a detailed structural analysis of mycolates from the hma-inactivated strain was performed using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, proton NMR spectroscopy, and chemical degradation techniques. These consisted most exclusively of α-mycolates, composed of equal amounts of C76-C82 dicyclopropanated (α1) and of C77-C79 monoethylenic monocyclopropanated (α2) mycolates, the double bond being located at the “distal” position. In addition, small amounts ofcis-epoxymycolates, structurally related to α2-mycolates, was produced by the mutant strain. Complementation of the hma-inactivated mutant with the wild-type gene resulted in the disappearance of the newly identified mycolates and the production of keto- and methoxymycolates of M. tuberculosis. Introduction of the hma gene inMycobacterium smegmatis led to the lowering of diethylenic α mycolates of the recipient strain and the production of keto- and hydroxymycolates. These data indicate that long-chain ethylenic compounds may be the precursors of the oxygenated mycolates of M. tuberculosis. Because the lack of production of several methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of mycolates is known to decrease the virulence of the tubercle bacillus, the identification of the substrates of these enzymes should help in the design of inhibitors of the growth of M. tuberculosis.

With the re-emergence of tuberculosis infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains and the need for the development of new tuberculous drugs, deciphering the biosynthesis pathway leading to mycolates still represents a major objective of researchers. However, it remains that, despite the intensive efforts of biochemists over decades (3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Minnikin D.E.

C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar), the biosynthesis pathway leading to mycolic acids is still poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is currently admitted that the two known mycobacterial fatty-acid synthases (FAS)1participate in the formation of all types of mycolates or their precursors. FAS-I, a synthase that has been shown to be a bimodal system, is necessary to produce C16, 18 and C22–26 saturated fatty acids, which may be either directly incorporated in mycolates as the α-branch chain or used as substrates of the elongation system, FAS-II. The finding that isoniazid strongly and specifically inhibits InhA, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase that belongs to FAS-II (13Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S.

Microbiology. 2000; 146: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), is consistent with the proposed biosynthetic pathway leading to the various types of mycolates.Mycolic acids occur usually in mycobacterial species as a mixture of various related molecules that differ from one another by the presence of chemical groups located on well-defined positions of their long methylene (“meromycolic”) chain. In members of the M. tuberculosis complex, three types of mycolates are commonly encountered (15Daffé M. Lanéelle M.-A. Asselineau C. Lévy-Frébault V. David H.L. Ann. Microbiol. Inst. Pasteur. 1983; 134: 367-377Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Magnusson M. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The least polar mycolates, also called α-mycolates, are composed of C76-C82 fatty acids (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain two cis-cyclopropyl groups, at the so-called “proximal” and “distal” (relative to the carboxyl group) positions of the meromycolic chain (see Fig.1 A). The more polar “M” and “K” mycolates consist of C82-C89 substances (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain acis- or a trans (with an adjacent methyl group)-cyclopropyl group at the proximal position, and a methoxy- or a keto- group (with an adjacent methyl group) at the distal position (Fig. 1 A). These discrete structural variations in mycolates may be of crucial biological importance, because it has been shown that mutations resulting in the loss of these chemical functions profoundly modify the permeability of the cell envelope to solutes and severely affect the virulence of the mutant strains in experimental infections (1Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Yuan Y. Zhu Y. Crane D.D.

Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the enzymatic systems that introduce the chemical modifications in the mycolic acid chain merit special attention. Based on C-alkylation mechanisms (20Lederer E. Q. Rev. Chem. Soc. 1969; 23: 453-481Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a biosynthetic pathway that may explain the action of specific S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases on ethylenic precursors leading to methyl branches and cyclopropanes in mycolates has been postulated (11Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Similar C-alkylation mechanisms have been proposed to explain the synthesis of keto- and methoxymycolic acids: the transformation of the distal double bond of a precursor into a secondary hydroxyl group with an adjacent methyl-branch using anS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase coded by the gene mma4 (21Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A gene with the same function in Mycobacterium bovis BCG, first called cmaA(22Dubnau E. Lanéelle M.A. Soares S. Bénichou A. Vaz T. Promé D. Promé J.C. Daffé M. Quémard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), when introduced in Mycobacterium smegmatis has been shown to confer to the latter organism the ability to produce ketomycolic acids. In addition, the transformant produced large amounts of hydroxymycolic acids with an adjacent methyl-branch, structurally related to the ketomycolic acids of M. bovis BCG. Trace amounts of these hydroxymycolic acids have been also detected in mycobacterial species producing keto- and/or methoxymycolates, further supporting the hypothesis that hydroxymycolic acids can be the precursors of both keto- and methoxymycolic acids (23Quémard A. Lanéelle M.A. Marrakchi H. Promé D. Dubnau E. Daffé M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, a mutant strain of M. tuberculosis in which themma4 gene (thereafter called hma forhydroxymycolic acid) has been inactivated and shown to be devoid of both keto- and methoxymycolic acids (1Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although this last experiment clearly established the biosynthetic relationships between the three oxygenated mycolates ofM. tuberculosis, the chemical structures of precursor molecules used by Hma to produce these oxygenated mycolates remain unknown. Interestingly, analysis of the mass spectra of the fatty acids from the mutant strain indicated the accumulation of new substances structurally related to α-mycolates and absent from the parent strain (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify these putative precursors of oxygenated mycolic acids of M. tuberculosis, a detailed analysis of the mycolic acid content of the hma knock-out mutant was performed using the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, and various chemical degradation techniques.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that the introduction of the genecmaA from M. bovis BCG Pasteur into M. smegmatis induced the production by the recipient strain of large amounts of methyl-branched hydroxymycolic acids and small amounts of ketomycolic acids (22Dubnau E. Lanéelle M.A. Soares S. Bénichou A. Vaz T. Promé D. Promé J.C. Daffé M. Quémard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the corresponding gene ofM. tuberculosis H37Rv, hma (or mma4), has resulted in the complete abolishment of the production of all the oxygenated mycolates normally present in M. tuberculosisH37Rv, namely the methoxy-, keto-, and hydroxymycolic acids (1Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It was thus concluded that the hma gene is involved in the synthesis of oxygenated mycolic acids and that hydroxymycolic acids are likely to be precursors of methoxy- and ketomycolates inM. tuberculosis. Interestingly, thehma-disrupted mutant strain was found to produce new types of mycolic acids absent from the parent strain, suggesting that these molecules may represent the precursors of the oxygenated mycolates ofM. tuberculosis (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the present work was undertaken to elucidate the chemical structures of these molecules. Application of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and chemical degradation techniques to the analysis of the various purified subclasses of mycolates produced by the mutant established several facts. First, in the absence of the hmagene, the mutant strain synthesized as much mycolates as the parent strain, suggesting that the overall bacterial content in these molecules is important for the normal physiology of the bacilli. Second, both the mutant and parent strains synthesized similar amounts of dicyclopropanated α-mycolates exhibiting identical structures, indicating that the mutation did not affect the production of this type of mycolates. Third, the mutant produced large amounts of a new type of mycolates, namely a mixture of monoethylenic monocyclopropanated α-mycolates, and a tiny amount of cis-epoxy-containing monocyclopropanated mycolates; the ethylenic α-mycolates were synthesized throughout the various growth phases of the mutant, indicating that they did not arise from secondary reactions. Fourth, complementation of the mutant strain with the wild-type hmagene resulted in the disappearance of the new types of mycolates and the production by the complemented strain of all the types of mycolates of the parent strain. Finally, introduction of the hma gene in M. smegmatis led to the lowering of diethylenic α-mycolates of the recipient strain and the production of keto- and hydroxymycolates. Our results demonstrate that the observed changes in the structure of mycolates of the mutant are specifically due to the inactivation of the hma gene and raise some important questions regarding the biosynthesis of mycolic acids.One of the questions related to the biosynthesis of mycolic acids is the metabolic process that leads to the introduction of the specific oxygenated functions at the distal position of the molecules. Two classes of substrates could lead to oxygenated chemical functions after a C-methylation (20Lederer E. Q. Rev. Chem. Soc. 1969; 23: 453-481Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Asselineau C. Asselineau J. Lanéelle G. Lanéelle M.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), namely a keto group, leading to an α-methylated ketone (Fig.8 A), as known for menaquinones, or an ethylenic group (Fig. 8 B); in this latter case a water molecule should participate in the sulfonium-mediated addition mechanism, as proposed for Mma4 function (21Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because only cis-ethylenic mycolate accumulates significantly in the hma-inactivated mutant, it is more attractive to postulate that the ethylenic distal double bond occurring in the new α-mycolates of the mutant strain is the substrate of Mma4/Hma. In the “ethylenic hypothesis” (Fig.8 B), the hydroxyl group formed after the methylation step of the ethylenic bond could be either transformed into a methoxyl group or oxidized into a ketone. In both cases, an oxidoreduction step would be necessary to obtain either the keto- or the methoxymycolic acids. Importantly, the values of m1 in the new α-mycolates are identical to those found in oxygenated mycolates of the parent strain and shorter than those observed in the α-mycolates of the parent strain (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the difference in chain lengths between α-mycolates and oxygenated mycolates have been previously observed (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Watanabe M. Aoyagi Y. Mitome H. Fujita T. Naoki H. Riddel M. Minnikin D.E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1881-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and shown to be due to the specificity of the methyltransferases mainly with respect to the ω-end of the growing mero acyl chain (37Schroeder B.G. Barry III, C.E. Bioorganic Chem. 2001; 29: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Figure 8Possible reaction mechanisms for the synthesis of oxygenated mycolic acids mediated by the Hma methyltransferase (adapted from Ref. 20Lederer E.

Draper P. Minnikin D.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 823-828PubMed Google Scholar) and other mycobacterial species (39Lacave C. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Montrozier H. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on the one hand, and the chain lengths of these two classes of substances, on the other hand, it has been suggested that these molecules are synthesized by different enzymatic systems. Accordingly, the common precursor, if any, would not be a full “meromycolic” diethylenic compound that would then be modified by different methyltransferases, before or after the Claisen-type condensation step, to yield α- or/and oxygenated-mycolic acids (for a review see Ref. 3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By showing that the hma-disrupted mutant produced dicyclopropanated α-mycolic acids as the parent strain and in comparable amounts, our data are consistent with the existence of one biosynthetic system devoted to the synthesis of α-mycolic acids and another machinery involved in the synthesis of oxygenated mycolic acids; only the latter one would be altered by the disruption of thehma gene. Both systems may contain a mixture of “core” enzymes whose activities are necessary for the synthesis of the meromycolic chain but may differ one from another by the association of additional specific enzymes involved in the introduction of various chemical groups in the meromycolic chain. The accumulation of large amounts of ethylenic α-mycolates in the hma-inactivated mutant, comparable to those of oxygenated mycolates of the parent strain, reinforces the hypothesis that ethylenic long chain fatty acid derivatives may be used for the biosynthesis of oxygenated mycolates in the parent and the hma-complemented strain. In the absence of the hma gene, these putative precursors would be used by the machinery originally devoted to the synthesis of oxygenated mycolates and yield distal-ethylenic compounds. The remaining unsolved question is the discrepancy between the chain lengths of the postulated precursors and those of the final products. Although the mutant produced C75–C83 monoethylenic monocyclopropanated α-mycolates (α2) and cis-epoxy monocyclopropanated mycolates, the parent and complemented strains synthesized C81–C89 methoxy- and ketomycolates, 4–6 carbon atoms longer than the α-mycolates (17Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,26Watanabe M. Aoyagi Y. Riddel M. Minnikin D.E. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1825-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Examination of the detailed structures of mycolic acids, however, pointed to the observation that the additional carbons in oxygenated mycolates are not located between the methyl end and the oxygenated group but distributed in the other parts of the meromycolic chain. Accordingly, one can postulate that the introduction of an oxygenated function at this position induces enough hydrophilicity in the long carbon chain to slightly disturb the specificity toward chain lengths of the system in charge of the synthesis of the methylenic chain. As a consequence, the oxygenated groups should be introduced before completion of the meromycolic chain.Several genes coding for methyltransferases have been identified in the genome of M. tuberculosis (40Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrel B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6445) Google Scholar). These enzymes are assumed to be responsible for the introduction of subtle variations in the mycolic acid structure, variations that may have profound effects on the physiology and virulence of the tubercle bacillus; for instance, the replacement of a cyclopropane ring by a double bond in α-mycolates esterifying trehalose totally abolishes the formation of cords typifying virulent tubercle bacilli and profoundly affects the virulence of the mutant strain (19Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lack of production of keto- and methoxymycolates in M. tuberculosis results in both a change of the permeability and an attenuation of virulence of the mutant strain (1Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These observations, in addition to the fact that the biosynthesis pathway leading to mycolic acids is the target of the most effective antituberculous drug, isoniazid, suggest that methyltranferases may represent good targets for the development of new antituberculous drugs. In this respect, the identification of putative precursors of oxygenated mycolates should help in the design of substrate analogs that would be tested as inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of the Hma protein. The individual methyltransferases are not essential for the bacterial growth, but, because their crystal structures are highly similar (41Huang C.-C. Smith C.V. Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J. C..J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11559-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the inhibitors of one enzyme may also abolish the activities of other methyltransferases, resulting in an additive effect that may be either lethal or bacteriostatic for the micro-organism.

However, it remains that, despite the intensive efforts of biochemists over decades (3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Minnikin D.E.

The activity of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors can be regulated by direct phosphorylation of their subunits, which affects the electrophysiological properties of the receptor, and the receptor association with numerous proteins that modulate membrane traffic and synaptic targeting of the receptor. In the present study we investigated the association of protein kinase C (PKC) γ isoform with the GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit. PKCγ was co-immunoprecipitated with GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit in rat cerebellum and in cultured chick retina cell extracts, and immunocytochemistry experiments showed co-localization of GluR4 and PKCγ in cultured chick retinal neurons. Pull-down assays showed that native PKCγ binds the GluR4 C-terminal membrane-proximal region, and recombinant PKCγ was retained by GST-GluR4 C-terminal fusion protein, suggesting that the kinase binds directly to GluR4. Furthermore, GST-GluR4 C-terminal protein was phosphorylated on GluR4 Ser-482 by bound kinases, retained by the fusion protein, including PKCγ. The GluR4 C-terminal segment that interacts with PKCγ, which lacks the PKC phosphorylation sites, inhibited histone H1 phosphorylation by PKC, to the same extent as the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide 19–31, indicating that PKCγ bound to GluR4 preferentially phosphorylates GluR4 to the detriment of other substrates. Additionally, PKCγ expression in GluR4 transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells increased the amount of plasma membrane-associated GluR4. Our results suggest that PKCγ binds directly to GluR4, thereby modulating the function of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three groups according to their pharmacological and electrophysiological characteristics: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; PKC, protein kinase C; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GRIP, glutamate receptor-interacting protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase receptors, kainate receptors, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (reviewed in Ref. 1Hollmann M. Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 1999; 141: 4-98Google Scholar). AMPA-type glutamate receptors are oligomeric structures, formed by the assembly of four subunits (GluR1–4; Refs.2Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y.

Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 1999; 141: 4-98Google Scholar). GluR4-containing AMPA receptors are specifically expressed in neurons and glia in several regions of the central nervous system (5Ghosh K.K. Haverkamp S. Wassle H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8636-8647Google Scholar, 6Grunder T. Kohler K. Guenther E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3600-3606Google Scholar, 7Ravindranathan A.

Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Google Scholar), where they are responsible for signal transmission at high rates (11Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1059-1062Google Scholar). In the rat hippocampus, GluR4 subunits are expressed early in development, and specifically mediate synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors at early stages (10Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Google Scholar). GluR4-containing AMPA receptors are delivered to hippocampal synapses by spontaneous activity, a mechanism that seems to be subunit specific (10Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Google Scholar). In fact, targeting of AMPA receptors to the post-synaptic membrane was described to be specifically mediated by the subunit composition of the receptors (12Shi S. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Google Scholar). Targeting of AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses is thought to be mediated through interaction of the C termini of AMPA receptor subunits with scaffolding proteins. The AMPA receptor-interacting proteins include PDZ (for PSD-95,Disc Large, and Z0–1) domain-containing proteins, like glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) or AMPA-binding protein, protein interacting with protein kinase C 1 (PICK1), syntenin and synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), and proteins lacking a PDZ domain, like stargazin and neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp; reviewed in Ref. 13Song I. Huganir R.L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 578-588Google Scholar). GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit was reported to associate with stargazin, GRIP, and syntenin (14Chen L. Chetkovitch D. Petralia R. Sweeney N. Kawazaki Y. Wenthold R. Bredt D. Nicoll R. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Google Scholar, 15Hirbec H. Perestenko O. Nishimune A. Meyer G. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. Dev K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15221-15224Google Scholar). The plasma membrane protein stargazin is believed to mediate AMPA receptor targeting to the membrane surface (14Chen L. Chetkovitch D. Petralia R. Sweeney N. Kawazaki Y. Wenthold R. Bredt D. Nicoll R. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Google Scholar), whereas GRIP was proposed to play a role in receptor stabilization at synapses (16Osten P. Khatri L. Perez J.L. Kohr G. Giese G. Daly C. Schulz T.W. Wensky A. Lee L.M. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2000; 27: 313-325Google Scholar). The role of syntenin, which was also described to interact with syndecans (17Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Google Scholar), in addition to GluR1–3 and GluR2c, is not known. None of the interactions described for GluR4 so far can account for its specific delivery to hippocampal synapses following spontaneous synaptic activity. AMPA receptors are known to be regulated by protein phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 18Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1245-1255Google Scholar). AMPA receptor phosphorylation modulates channel conductance (19Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Google Scholar), peak open probability of the receptor (20Banke T.G. Bowie D. Lee H.-K. Huganir R.L. Schousboe A. Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Google Scholar), interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins (21Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Google Scholar, 22Matsuda S. Mikawa S. Hirai H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1765-1768Google Scholar), clustering (23Matsuda S. Launey T. Mikawa S. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2765-2774Google Scholar), and synaptic delivery of the receptors (24Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Google Scholar). Several phosphorylation sites have been mapped in the C termini of AMPA receptor subunits, including GluR4. GluR4 can be phosphorylated on Ser-482 by PKA, PKC, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and on Thr-830 by PKC (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar). In hippocampal slices, PKA activation by spontaneous activity is necessary and sufficient for delivery of GluR4-containing receptors to postsynaptic sites (26.Esteban, J. A., and Malinow, R. (2001) Society for Neuroscience 31st Annual Meeting, November 10–15, San Diego, CA, Society for Neuroscience Abstract (A Molecular Mechanism for the Regulated Synaptic Delivery of GluR-containing AMPA Receptors), Program no. 15.3.Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC activation increases Ca2+ influx through activated AMPA receptor channels in cultured chick retinal neurons (27Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Faro C.J. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.V. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2112-2119Google Scholar), where GluR4 is the main AMPA receptor subunit expressed (28Carvalho A.L. Correia S. Faro C.J. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 465-474Google Scholar). PKC has been implicated in a variety of neuronal functions, including modulation of ion channel activity and synaptic transmission (reviewed in Ref. 29Chakravarthy B. Morley P. Whitfield J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 12-16Google Scholar). PKCγ expression is developmentally regulated, and PKCγ is expressed postnatally in the rat brain (30Hashimoto T. Ase K. Sawamura S. kikkawa U. Saito N. Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1678-1693Google Scholar), playing a role in both long term potentiation and in learning and memory (31Van der Zee E.A. Compaan J.C. de Boer M. Luiten P.G.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4808-4815Google Scholar, 32Abeliovich A. Chen C. Goda Y. Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1253-1262Google Scholar, 33Abeliovich A. Paylor R. Chen C. Kim J.J. Eehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1263-1271Google Scholar). Because GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit is phosphorylated and its phosphorylation may mediate synaptic delivery (26.Esteban, J. A., and Malinow, R. (2001) Society for Neuroscience 31st Annual Meeting, November 10–15, San Diego, CA, Society for Neuroscience Abstract (A Molecular Mechanism for the Regulated Synaptic Delivery of GluR-containing AMPA Receptors), Program no. 15.3.Google Scholar), early in development, we studied the biochemical interaction of GluR4 with PKCγ. Our work shows that PKCγ interacts with GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit, both in rat brain and in chick retina cultured neurons, and that bound PKCγ is able to preferentially phosphorylate GluR4 on Ser-482, relatively to other substrates. Furthermore, co-transfection of PKCγ with GluR4 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells increases GluR4 subunit surface expression. Together these results indicate that the association between PKCγ and GluR4 plays a role in regulating the function of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors. Trypsin was purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland), and basal Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). PGEX4T-2 and pGEX-1λT vectors, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, anti-GST antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and [γ-32P]ATP, were all obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Rabbit anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Fetal calf serum was from Biochrom KG (Berlin, Germany), the pET23b vector was from Novagen (Madison, WI), the pBK-CMV vector was from Stratagene (Amsterdam, Netherlands), and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was from Promega (Madison, WI). Histone H1, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide 19–31 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture and microporous polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Switzerland, Basel). UltraLinkTM Plus immobilized streptavidin gel and EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin were from Pierce. The rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR4 antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and the mouse monoclonal anti-PKCγ, anti-PKCε, and anti-PKAcα antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 and the Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Monolayer primary cultures of chick retina amacrine-like cells were prepared from 8-day-old chick embryos as previously described (34Duarte C.B. Ferreira I.L. Santos P.F. Oliveira C.R. Carvalho A.P. Brain Res. 1992; 591: 27-32Google Scholar, 35Santos P.F. Carvalho A.L. Carvalho A.P. Duarte C.B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2723-2730Google Scholar). After treatment with trypsin (0.1%, 15 min, 37 °C) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, the cells were plated on tissue culture dishes (at a density of 1.35 × 106 cells/cm2) for cell extract preparation, or on glass coverslips (at a density of 0.75 × 106cells/cm2) for immunocytochemistry. Chick retina amacrine-like neurons were maintained in basal Eagle's medium, buffered with 25 mm HEPES and 10 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, and supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2 and 95% air, for 5 days. cDNA fragments coding for the intracellular C-terminal domain of GluR4, or fractions of the C-terminal domain, were amplified by PCR, using GluR4 cDNA as a template. PCR products were subcloned into the pGEX4T-2 vector (viaBamHI and EcoRI sites for the whole C-terminal length; via BamHI and SalI sites for the truncated constructs) or into the pGEX-1λT vector (BamHI and EcoRI sites, for the constructs coding amino acids 815–828 and amino acids 829–882 of GluR4). The entire coding sequence of PKCγ was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from rat brain cortex, using the specific primers 5′-agcagctagcatggcgggtct-3′ and 5′-ccgctcgagcatgacgggcacag-3′, which include the restriction sites for NheI and XhoI, respectively. PKCγ cDNA was subcloned into pBK-CMV vector restriction endonuclease sites NheI and XhoI (for HEK 293T cell transfection) or a His tag was added to the C terminus of PKCγ by subcloning PKCγ cDNA in frame into restriction endonuclease sites NheI and XhoI in the pET23b vector. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli transformed with the constructs described above. Bacteria grown to A 600 = 0.8 were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (100 μm) for 2 h, and then lysed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were sonicated and shaken for 30 min at 4 °C, and the insoluble fraction was then removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g, for 10 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and His-tagged PKCγ was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the protocol of the manufacturers. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Chick retinal cells were kept in culture for 5 days and were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS after fixation, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C, and blocked in 0.2% bovine gelatin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR4 antibody (10 μg/ml) and a mouse monoclonal anti-PKCγ (5 μg/ml) antibody for 1 h, at room temperature. Neurons were washed with 0.1% bovine gelatin in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Images were obtained with a Zeiss confocal microscope. Cultured chick retinal neurons were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture) containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged at 1000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants containing soluble proteins were used to immunoprecipitate the GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit. Rat cerebellum membranes were prepared according to the procedure described by Luo and colleagues (36Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were then diluted 1:1 with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (for Triton X-100 extracts), or with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2% SDS, and boiled for 30 s (for SDS extracts), to disassemble oligomeric receptor complexes. These samples were diluted 7 times with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 before immunoprecipitation. GluR4 and GluR1 immunoprecipitates were obtained by incubation of 2.5 μg of anti-GluR4 polyclonal antibody with chick retina extracts, or membranes obtained from rat cerebellum, and by incubation of 1 μl of GluR1 polyclonal antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Richard Huganir) with rat cerebellum membranes, overnight at 4 °C. These samples were then incubated for 90 min with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50%) and extensively washed (twice with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, twice with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, and twice more with TBS). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE. Extracts of cultured chick retina cells were prepared as described above. Whole rat brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was re-centrifuged at 1000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C, and the soluble brain proteins were used for binding studies. Ten μg of fusion protein was incubated with chick retinal extracts, rat brain homogenates, or recombinant His-tagged PKCγ overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was incubated with 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, and binding proteins were eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gels. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting (40 V, overnight, at 10 °C). The membranes were blocked for 45 min with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS, and probed during 1 h at room temperature with anti-PKCγ (0.05 μg/ml), anti-PKCε (0.05 μg/ml), anti-GluR4 (0.5 μg/ml), anti-GluR1 (1:5000), anti-GST (1:2000), or anti-PKAcα (0.25 μg/ml) antibodies. Following several washes, the membranes were incubated for 1 h, at room temperature, with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for anti-PKCγ, anti-PKCε, and anti-PKAc staining, with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for anti-GluR1 and anti-GluR4 antibodies, or with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody for anti-GST staining. The blots were washed again, and immunostaining was visualized by the enhanced chemifluorescence method on a Storm 860 gel and blot imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). GST pull-down assays were performed using GluR4 C-terminal fragments fused to GST and whole rat brain extracts. GST fusion proteins and interacting proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were washed extensively with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, and incubated in a phosphorylation buffer containing 100 mmHepes, 20 mm MgCl2, 250 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μmCaCl2, and phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol (50 μg/ml/5 μg/ml) for 30 min, at 30 °C. The bound proteins were eluted from beads with 1× Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gels. Polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R, destained, and then extensively washed with ultrapure H2O and 10% glycerol. Gels were then dried for 45 min, at 80 °C, exposed to a storage Phosphor Screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) and analyzed on a Storm 860 gel and blot imaging system. Histone H1 (20 μg) was incubated with purified protein kinase C from rat brain, in a phosphorylation buffer containing 100 mm Hepes, 20 mm MgCl2, 250 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μm CaCl2, and phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol (50 μg/ml/5 μg/ml), in the presence of equimolar amounts of GST (8.0 μg), GST fused to GluR4 C-terminal fragments corresponding to amino acids 815–828 (8.6 μg) or to amino acids 815–838 (9.0 μg), or in the presence of the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide 19–31 (RFARKGALRQKNV; 0.62 μg), for 30 min, at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (as described above). Histone H1 phosphorylated bands were quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) software and plotted. HEK 293T cells maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2, 95% air were transiently transfected with 10 μg of cDNA (pBK-CMV- PKCγ and/or pGW1-GluR4), using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as previously described (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar). Cultured HEK 293T cells were stimulated with 200 nm PMA, for 10 min, 48 h after transfection. After stimulation the cells were washed with culture medium and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2, 95% air for 3 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ (PBS supplemented with 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmCaCl2) and incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-LinkTMSulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and once with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and scraped with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 1000 ×g, for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants containing soluble proteins (4% of total) were used to determine expression of total GluR4 and the remaining samples incubated with UltraLinkTM Plus immobilized streptavidin gel for 2 h at 4 °C (according to the protocol of the manufacturers). Streptavidin beads were extensively washed, twice with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, once with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5m NaCl, and once more with TBS. The biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and were analyzed by immunoblotting. The digital images were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Surface receptor expression was determined from the surface biotinylated/total receptor ratio. To examine whether PKCγ is associated with GluR4 in vivo, the interaction of PKCγ with GluR4 was tested in rat cerebellum and in primary chick retina cultures, where GluR4 is highly expressed (11Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1059-1062Google Scholar, 28Carvalho A.L. Correia S. Faro C.J. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.M. Eur. J.

Immunoprecipitation of GluR4 from rat cerebellum membrane extracts or from cultured chick retina cells resulted in specific co-immunoprecipitation of PKCγ (Fig.1). Pre-absorption of the GluR4 antibody with its antigen blocked the co-immunoprecipitation of PKCγ in the retina cell extracts (Fig. 1 B), confirming the specificity of the association. In contrast, PKCε, which is also expressed in this preparation (28Carvalho A.L. Correia S. Faro C.J. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 465-474Google Scholar), did not co-immunoprecipitate with GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit (Fig. 1 B). Rat cerebellum membrane extracts prepared in 1% SDS and boiled, to ensure disassembly of tetrameric AMPA receptor complexes (2Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F.

Immunoprecipitation of either GluR4 or GluR1 from rat cerebellum membranes, solubilized in SDS, also specifically co-immunoprecipitated PKCγ (Fig.1 A). Immunocytochemistry experiments using an antibody that specifically recognizes GluR4 showed a punctuate distribution of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors, along the dendrites, in cultured chick retina cells (Fig. 2). Double labeling with anti-GluR4 and anti-PKCγ antibodies revealed that some of the GluR4 punctuate distribution is co-localized with PKCγ (Fig.2).Figure 2Co-localization of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors with PKC γ in cultured neurons.Cultured chick retina cells were double-labeled with rabbit anti-GluR4 and mouse anti-PKCγ antibodies, followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.

Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 1999; 141: 4-98Google Scholar,38Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M. VanDongen A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Google Scholar, and 39Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 4: 373-384Google Scholar). GST fused to full-length GluR4 C terminus or to partial segments of GluR4 C terminus were used to pull down interacting proteins, present either in Triton X-100 solubilized rat brain homogenates (Fig. 3 A) or cultured chick embryo retinal amacrine-like neurons (Fig. 3 B). We found that PKCγ present both in the rat brain (Fig. 3 A) and in the chick retina culture extracts (Fig. 3 B) binds full-length GluR4 C terminus and the C-terminal fragments corresponding to amino acids 815–852 and 815–838. GST fused to the protein segment corresponding to amino acids 815–828 of GluR4 also bound PKCγ in GST pull-down assays using rat brain homogenates (Fig. 3 A). However, the fusion protein lacking amino acids 815–828 was unable to bind PKCγ (Fig. 3 A). This result suggests that the membrane-proximal region between amino acids 815 and 828 in the C terminus of GluR4 is important for the interaction with PKCγ. Because there are several scaffolding proteins described to interact with glutamate receptors (reviewed in Ref. 40Braithwaite S.P. Meyer G. Henley J.M. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 919-930Google Scholar) and, in some cases, known to mediate the interaction of AMPA receptors with kinases and phosphatases (41Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Google Scholar), we investigated whether PKCγ can directly bind to the C terminus of GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit or whether an adaptor protein is required. Purified recombinant PKCγ with a C-terminal His tag was incubated with GST fused to the GluR4 C-terminal segment containing amino acids 815–838. Again, glutathione-Sepharose was used to pull down GST fusion proteins and the presence of PKCγ in these samples was analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-PKCγ antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C, recombinant PKCγ was detected in pull-down samples, indicating that it directly binds the C-terminal domain of GluR4. Previous work (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar) showed that the GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit is phosphorylated by PKC at the C-terminal domain, mainly on Ser-482. Our results demonstrating that PKCγ binds directly to the GluR4 AMPA receptor subunit suggest that bound PKCγ may facilitate GluR4 AMPA receptor phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we performed GST pull-down assays from rat brain extracts and, after extensively washing beads, incubated immobilized GST fused to GluR4 C-terminal segments and interacting proteins, including bound PKCγ (Fig.4 A, middle blot), in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Eluted samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. GluR4 C-terminal fusion protein was phosphorylated by bound kinases (Fig.4 A, upper panel). The S842A GluR4 C-terminal fusion protein, which lacks the major GluR4 phosphorylation site, was not phosphorylated by bound kinases, but binds PKCγ (Fig.4 A). T830A GluR4-GST protein, lacking a minor PKC phosphorylation site on GluR4, was still phosphorylated in pull-down samples. Deletion of GluR4 C terminus after amino acid 828 did not disrupt its binding to PKCγ, but eliminated the phosphorylation sites (Thr-830 and Ser-482) on GluR4 and therefore prevented its phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). Our results suggest that PKCγ bound to GluR4 phosphorylates Ser-482 in GluR4. PKA was previously described to phosphorylate GluR4 on Ser-482 (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar), and it has been reported to interact with GluR1, through A kinase anchor protein, via SAP97 (41Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Google Scholar). Therefore, to exclude the hypothesis of GluR4 phosphorylation by PKA eventually present in GluR4 complexes, we looked for the presence of PKA in pull-down samples. As shown in Fig. 4 A, no PKA immunoreactivity was detected in GluR4 C-terminal complexes using an antibody against the catalytic fragment of PKAα (an ubiquitously expressed PKA isoform). The GluR4 C-terminal segment that interacts with PKCγ is homologous to PKCγ pseudosubstrate sequence (Fig. 4 B), and its interaction with PKCγ may mimic the pseudosubstrate interaction. In the activated state of the kinase, the pseudosubstrate is displaced from the catalytic groove that enables it to interact with substrates. GluR4, through its C-terminal membrane-proximal segment, which presents homology to the pseudosubstrate, might preferentially occupy the vacated catalytic site. To test this hypothesis, we tested the effect of PKC interaction with GluR4 C terminus on the kinase activity on another substrate. GluR4 C-terminal amino acids 815–828 and 815–838, which were shown to bind PKCγ, inhibited histone H1 phosphorylation by purified protein kinase C from rat brain to the same extent as the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide (Fig. 4 C). This result supports the hypothesis that PKCγ bound to GluR4 C terminus preferentially phosphorylates GluR4, to the detriment of other substrates. It was recently shown that, early in development, rat hippocampal GluR4 Ser-482 phosphorylation by PKA is necessary and sufficient for GluR4-containing AMPA receptors delivery to synapses (26.Esteban, J. A., and Malinow, R. (2001) Society for Neuroscience 31st Annual Meeting, November 10–15, San Diego, CA, Society for Neuroscience Abstract (A Molecular Mechanism for the Regulated Synaptic Delivery of GluR-containing AMPA Receptors), Program no. 15.3.Google Scholar). Additionally, stimulation of GluR4-expressing HEK cells with PMA resulted in Ser-482 phosphorylation (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of GluR4 Ser-482 phosphorylation by PKCγ to the expression of GluR4-containing AMPA receptor at the plasma membrane, we transfected HEK 293T cells with GluR4, or co-transfected cells with GluR4 and PKCγ. Cells were then stimulated with 200 nm PMA for 10 min. Three hours after the stimulus, cells were incubated with a biotinylation reagent that reacts with the extracellular domains of membrane proteins. Proteins extracted from HEK 293T cells were then incubated with streptavidin gel, which allowed the purification of biotinylated proteins. Surface and total GluR4 were compared using quantitative immunoblotting. Co-transfection of PKCγ with GluR4 resulted in increased GluR4 subunit surface expression following stimulation with PMA (Fig. 5), indicating that phosphorylation by PKC targets GluR4 to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors is critical in the control of synaptic function and plasticity (reviewed in Ref. 18Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1245-1255Google Scholar). In this study we found that PKCγ associates with GluR4 AMPA receptor subunitin vivo and in vitro. Our results further suggest that this interaction localizes the kinase in close proximity to GluR4, facilitating receptor phosphorylation, and that phosphorylation by PKC targets the receptor to the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the AMPA receptor subunit GluR4 associates with the γ conventional isoform of PKC, both in rat cerebellum and in chick retinal cultures (Fig. 1, Aand B). Additionally, PKCγ and GluR4 showed partial overlapping distributions in chick embryo retina cultures (Fig. 2). Recombinant and native PKCγ were retained by GST-GluR4 C terminus, and deletion analysis showed that the membrane-proximal region of GluR4 C terminus (conserved among AMPA receptor subunits), from amino acids 815–828, is crucial for the binding of GluR4 to PKCγ (Fig. 3,A–C). The corresponding sequence in GluR1 was described to interact with the protein 4.1N, the neuronal homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1 (42Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7932-7940Google Scholar). PKCγ binding to the GluR4 C-terminal sequence may bring close together the kinase and its substrate, thereby influencing receptor phosphorylation. In contrast to the direct interaction between GluR4 and PKCγ, reported here, AMPA receptors have been shown to associate with protein kinases mainly through adaptor proteins (reviewed in Ref. 18Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1245-1255Google Scholar). PICK1, which interacts with PKCα, is now known to associate with GluR2/3 and GluR4c (43Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 635-644Google Scholar). PICK1 is co-localized with PKCα and AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses and was described to homo-oligomerize through its PDZ domain. In an heterologous expression system, PICK1 was shown to induce AMPA receptor clustering (44Xia J. Zangh X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Google Scholar). PICK1 dimers may target PKCα to AMPA receptors, thus providing a mechanism for selective phosphorylation of AMPA receptors. GluR2 was determined to be phosphorylated on Ser-880 by PKC (22Matsuda S. Mikawa S. Hirai H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1765-1768Google Scholar), and activation of this kinase increases phosphorylation of GluR2 Ser-880 and induces long term depression in the cerebellum (21Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Google Scholar, 45Xia J. Chung H.J. Wihler C. Huganir R.L. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 499-510Google Scholar). Moreover, long term depression induction in cultured Purkinje cells resulted in Ser-880 phosphorylation and in a long lasting disruption of GluR2 clusters (23Matsuda S. Launey T. Mikawa S. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2765-2774Google Scholar). PICK1 was also reported to form a complex with the mGluR7a metabotropic glutamate receptors and PKCα. In this case, PICK1 was shown to play an inhibitory role on PKCα phosphorylation of mGluR7a (46Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Google Scholar). SAP97 binds GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit and was reported to be important for recruitment of PKA, PKC, and protein phosphatase PP2B through AKAP79/150. This protein forms a complex with SAP97 that directs PKA (41Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Google Scholar) or protein phosphatase PP2B (47Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Google Scholar) to GluR1, facilitating GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. However, it has recently been reported that the interaction between GluR1 and SAP97 occurs predominantly in the biosynthetic and secretory pathway (48Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Google Scholar), raising the question of whether the kinase and phosphatase in the complex can regulate receptor activity at synapses. Having established that GluR4 directly assembles with PKCγ, we searched for functional consequences of this interaction. Previous work showed that GluR4 is phosphorylated on Ser-482 by PKA, PKC, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar). Our results showed that GST fused to GluR4 C terminus pulled down PKCγ, and that there was phosphorylation of GluR4 Ser-482 within those complexes (Fig. 4 A). In addition, incubation of the GluR4 C-terminal domain, which binds PKCγ, with histone H1 (1:3 molar ratio) and purified PKC inhibited histone phosphorylation (Fig.4 C). Sequence alignment of PKCγ pseudosubstrate domain and GluR4 C-terminal amino acids 815–828, the crucial peptide for PKCγ binding, shows sequence homology (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that interaction of PKC with the GluR4 C-terminal region, through the catalytic domain of the kinase, may prevent histone H1 phosphorylation. PKC pseudosubstrate domain contains several basic residues, and it was suggested that this domain binds to an acidic sequence of the PKC catalytic domain (49Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Google Scholar, 50House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Google Scholar), distinct from the ATP-binding core and the phosphate transfer region. GluR4 may bind this region in PKC through its membrane-proximal segment, analogous to the pseudosubstrate, thereby positioning the phosphorylation site for preferential phosphorylation by PKC. We have previously found that PKC up-regulates AMPA receptor activity in chick embryo retinal cultures, where GluR4 is the main AMPA receptor subunit expressed (27Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Faro C.J. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.V. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2112-2119Google Scholar, 28Carvalho A.L. Correia S. Faro C.J. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Pires E.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 465-474Google Scholar). Recent work showed that in the rat hippocampus GluR4 Ser-482 phosphorylation by PKA, activated by spontaneous activity early in development, is necessary and sufficient for GluR4-containing AMPA receptors delivery to synapses (26.Esteban, J. A., and Malinow, R. (2001) Society for Neuroscience 31st Annual Meeting, November 10–15, San Diego, CA, Society for Neuroscience Abstract (A Molecular Mechanism for the Regulated Synaptic Delivery of GluR-containing AMPA Receptors), Program no. 15.3.Google Scholar). PKC also phosphorylates GluR4 Ser-482 in transfected HEK 293T (25Carvalho A.L. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4748-4754Google Scholar). Our results show that PKCγ expression in GluR4 transfected HEK 293T cells increase GluR4 surface expression upon stimulation with PMA, when compared with PKCγ-deficient cells (Fig. 5). Our results argue for a role for anchored PKCγ in GluR4 receptor subunit phosphorylation and targeting to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2005106729,"The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori activates epithelial cell signaling pathways, and its infection induces changes in the expression of several genes in infected human gastric tissues. Recent studies have indicated that the ability of H. pylori to regulate epithelial cell responses depends on the presence of an intact cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). We investigated altered mRNA expression of gastric epithelial cells after infection with H. pylori, both cagPAI-positive and cagPAI-negative strains, by cDNA microarray, reverse transcription PCR, and Northern blot analysis. Our results indicated that cagPAI-positive H. pylori strains (ATCC 43504 and clinical isolated strains) significantly activated Smad5 mRNA expression of human gastric epithelial cells (AGS, KATOIII, MKN28, and MKN45). We further examined whether the up-regulated Smad5 was related to apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells induced byH. pylori. Smad5 RNA interference completely inhibitedH. pylori-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that Smad5 is up-regulated in gastric epithelial cells through the presence of cagPAI of H. pylori and that Smad5 mediates apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells induced by H. pyloriinfection."
https://openalex.org/W2048475709,"Despite a pro-atherogenic profile, individuals carrying the molecular variant (R173C) of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, named apoA-IMilano (apoA-IM), appear to be at reduced risk for cardiovascular disease.

As in human carriers, mice expressing apoA-IM (A-IM k-in) are characterized by low concentrations of the human apolipoprotein and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, compared with A-I k-in animals. The aim of the present study was to investigate the basic mechanisms of hypoalphalipoproteinemia associated with the apoA-IM mutation. ApoA-I and apoA-IM mRNA expression, as assessed by Northern blot analysis and quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR, did not exhibit significant differences in either liver or intestine. Moreover, human apolipoprotein synthesis rates were similar in the k-in lines. When the secretion rate of the human apolipoproteins was assessed in cultured hepatocytes from the mouse lines, secretion from apoA-IM-expressing cells was markedly reduced (42% for A-IM k-in and 36% for A-I/A-IM k-in mice) as compared with that of A-I k-in hepatocytes.

Funke H. Circulation. 1993; 87: 28-34Google Scholar, 23Franceschini G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the major protein constituent of HDL. Although some of these hypoalphalipoproteinemic states are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease, others do not seem to predispose to accelerated premature disease (24Rader D.J. Ikewaki K. Duverger N. Feuerstein I. Zech L. Connor W. Brewer Jr., H.B. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1455-1458Abstract PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One example is the apoA-IMilano (A-IM) mutant; evaluation of the cardiovascular status in apoA-IMcarriers, compared with control subjects from the same kindred, did not reveal any evidence of increased vascular disease at the preclinical level (25Gualandri V. Franceschini G. Sirtori C.R. Gianfranceschi G. Orsini G.B. Cerrone A. Menotti A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1083-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sirtori C.R. Calabresi L. Franceschini G.

ApoA-IM is the result of a point mutation, with an arginine to cysteine substitution at position 173 (27Weisgraber K.H. Bersot T.P. Mahley R.W. Franceschini G. Sirtori C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The carriers of this mutation are all heterozygotes that exhibit hypertriglyceridemia with markedly reduced HDL and apoA-I levels. The presence of a cysteine residue results in the formation of homodimers and heterodimers with apoA-II. The kinetic etiology of hypoalphalipoproteinemias associated with apoA-I mutations have been generally related to accelerated catabolism rather than to lower synthesis of apoA-I (28Rader D.J.

However, a recent study has shown a reduced secretion rate for the apoA-I variant known as apoA-IFIN, in addition to its enhanced clearance from plasma (30McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ApoA-I turnover in apoA-IM carriers was investigated in two different studies (31Roma P. Gregg R.E. Meng M.S. Ronan R. Zech L.A. Franceschini G. Sirtori C.R. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin.

Both studies showed that low apoA-I levels are consequent to the rapid catabolism of apoA-I and apoA-IM, whereas results on the production rate of both the normal and mutant forms of apoA-I have remained controversial. Although mice expressing an A-IM transgene were previously generated and studied (33Bielicki J.K. Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Stoltzfus L.J. Chiesa G. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Rubin E.M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2314-2321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chiesa G. Stoltzfus L.J. Michelagnoli S. Bielicki J.K. Santi M. Forte T.M. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Rubin E.M.

In the present study, a gene targeting replacement strategy (gene knock-in (k-in)) was used to obtain comparable mouse lines expressing either human apoA-I (A-I k-in) or human apoA-IM (A-IMk-in). Using these mouse models we present evidence that the dominant negative effects on HDL-C concentrations resulting from the apoA-IM mutation can, in part, be explained by reduced apoA-IM production. The expression of this mutation does not appear to affect transcription or mRNA stability but causes impaired hepatic secretion of the human apolipoprotein by primary hepatocytes. A 3-kbNotI-KpnI strain 129 mouse genomic fragment containing sequences upstream of the mouse apoA-I gene (2,633 bp) and including exon 1 and the 5′ part of intron 1 (104 bp) (see Fig. 1 B) was generated by PCR using a pV-90 plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. N. Maeda (35Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), as a template. A 4.8-kbEcoRI strain 129 mouse genomic fragment, containing the 3′ half of exon 4 (419 bp) and 3′-flanking sequences (4,381 bp) of the mouse apoA-I gene was also derived from pV-90 (see Fig. 1 B). Human genomic fragments, containing the 3′ part of intron 1 (116 bp) and exons 2–4 of the human apoA-I gene or the human apoA-IM gene were isolated by sequential digestion withKpnI and SalI from pApoA-Ig (36Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pBSM plasmids (34Chiesa G. Stoltzfus L.J. Michelagnoli S. Bielicki J.K. Santi M. Forte T.M. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Rubin E.M. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), respectively. To obtain the targeting constructs, the 3-kb mouse genomic fragment and the human genomic fragments were inserted into a pPN2T vector (37Paszty C. Mohandas N. Stevens M.E. Loring J.F. Liebhaber S.A. Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) upstream of the neomycin-resistant gene, whereas the 4.8-kb genomic fragment was inserted downstream of the neomycin-resistant gene (see Fig. 1 B). The targeting constructs were linearized byNotI digestion, purified, and redissolved in TE (10mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA), pH 7.4, for electroporation. A subclone of mouse strain 129 embryonic stem cell line, ESVJ (Go Germline, GenomeSystems, Inc.), was cultured on neomycin-resistant mouse fibroblast feeder layers and electroporated with 20 μg of the linearized human apoA-I or apoA-IMtargeting vectors as described previously (38Koller B.H. Kim H.S. Latour A.M. Brigman K. Boucher Jr., R.C. Scambler P. Wainwright B. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10730-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stable integrants were selected by positive-negative selection, using neomycin (G418-Geneticin; Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml and gancyclovir (FIAU, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) at a final concentration of 2 μm. After 10–12 days, the colonies were transferred into 96-well plates and tested for successful targeting by Southern blotting using conventional procedures. Approximately 10–15 embryonic stem-targeted cells were injected into the blastocele cavity of C57BL/6J embryos. Surviving blastocysts were transferred into the pseudopregnant CD-1 females. Animals chimeric by coat color were bred to C57BL/6J animals to determine their germ line competency. Heterozygous mutants were identified by Southern blotting of DNA isolated from the tail, and brother-sister mating was carried out to generate homozygous k-in mutant mouse lines expressing human apoA-I (A-I k-in) or human apoA-IM (A-IM k-in). Homozygous A-I k-in and A-IM k-in mice were then crossed to create the heterozygous human apoA-I/A-IM mouse line (A-I/A-IM k-in). Lipid and apolipoprotein analyses were performed on A-I k-in, A-IMk-in, A-I/A-IM k-in, and C57BL/6J/129 control mice of both sexes, aged 12–16 weeks. Blood was collected after an overnight fast from the retro-orbital plexus into tubes containing 0.1% (w/v) EDTA and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 8000 rpm at 4 °C. Serum total and unesterified cholesterol were measured by enzymatic methods (Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland and Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (39Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7307) Google Scholar). Triglyceride concentrations were corrected for the free glycerol present in serum as described (Sigma-Aldrich) (40Schultz J.R. Gong E.L. McCall M.R. Nichols A.V. Clift S.M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21630-21636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL cholesterol levels were measured after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins with PEG 8000 (20% w/v) in 0.2 m glycine, pH 10 (40). Human apolipoprotein concentrations were determined by immunoturbidimetric assays, using a sheep antiserum specific for human apoA-I (Hoffmann La Roche) that also recognizes apoA-IM (34Chiesa G. Stoltzfus L.J. Michelagnoli S. Bielicki J.K. Santi M. Forte T.M. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Rubin E.M. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine HDL particle size distribution, total lipoproteins (d < 1.215 g/ml) were isolated by salt gradient ultracentrifugation (41Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Plasma from five fasting mice of each genotype was pooled and adjusted to a density of 1.215 g/ml with solid KBr and centrifuged for 6 h at 4 °C at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge equipped with a Beckman TL100.3 rotor. HDL particle size distribution was determined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) essentially as described by Nichols et al. (42Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) of the total lipoprotein fraction were loaded onto a nondenaturing 4–30% polyacrylamide gradient gel and electrophoresed for 25 h at 125 V at 4 °C. The proteins were stained with Coomassie R-250, and HDL particle size was determined by densitometry, as previously described (42Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoretic maps of mouse sera were obtained by immobilized pH gradient gel-Da (43Gianazza E. Wlaker J.M. The Protein Protocol Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 169-180Google Scholar). Serum was prepared by low speed centrifugation of blood collected from six fasting mice for each line. The sample load was 15 μl of serum diluted to 50 μl with either double distilled water for nonreducing conditions or with 2% β mercaptoethanol for reducing conditions. The proteins were first resolved according to charge on a nonlinear pH 4–10 immobilized pH gradient gel-Da (44Gianazza E. Giacon P. Sahlin B. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 53-56Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in the presence of 8 m urea and 0.5% carrier ampholytes. The focused proteins were then fractionated according to size by SDS-PAGE on 7.5–17.5% polyacrylamide gradients in the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Interfacing between the first and second dimension occurred after equilibration with 2% SDS for nonreducing conditions or after protein carboxymethylation in the presence of 2% SDS (46Görg A. Postel W. Weser J. Günther S. Strahel S.R. Hanash S.M. Somerlit L. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 122-124Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for reducing conditions. The anode to cathode distance was 11 cm in the immobilized pH gradient gel-Da gel; the anodal 8 cm were mounted head to tail on 16 × 14-cm2 SDS-PAGE slabs. The proteins were stained with Coomassie R-250. Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (47Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar), using UltraPureTM Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of denatured RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with a human apoA-I probe that spans the majority of human exon 4; β-actin mRNA (Ambion) was used as an internal standard for normalizing total RNA loads. Total RNA was extracted from the liver and intestine of 6 mice from each transgenic line using UltraPureTM Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). About 2 μg of total RNA from each sample was treated with Promega RQ1 RNase-free DNase. About 0.5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents from Applied Biosystems. PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. The selected primers used for amplification of human apoA-I cDNA were AGCTTGCTGAAGGTGGAGGT (in exon 4) and ATCGAGTGAAGGACCTGGC (in exon 3). The primers amplify a 154-bp product. The 18 S internal standard control was from Ambion (315 bp product). A ratio of 1:1.5 of 18 S primer pair:18 S competimers was used. All of the procedures and calculation of the results were carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations. Apolipoprotein synthesis rate was determined in primary hepatocytes isolated from A-IM k-in, A-I/A-IM k-in, and A-I k-in mice. The animals were fasted for 5 h and anesthetized with 5% sodium pentobarbital, and the hepatocytes were prepared with slight modifications of a method described previously (48Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining, and 500,000 live cells were plated on 35-mm plates. The culture medium (Williams' medium; Sigma) was changed after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. The next day, to assess the human apolipoprotein synthesis rates, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, preincubated for 1 h in leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and then incubated for different time points up to 10 min with 1 ml of the same medium containing 200 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.005% aprotinin). As a control, the incorporation of radioactivity into total protein was determined after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of cell lysates and was found to be similar among the k-in lines (data not shown). Radiolabeled human apolipoproteins were quantitatively isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) that recognizes both human apoA-I and apoA-IM. The immunoprecipitate was further purified by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. A band corresponding to human apoA-I was excised from the gel; the label was extracted with Solvable (Packard Instruments Co., Inc., Meriden, CI) and counted (49Azrolan N. Odaka H. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19833-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results were normalized to cellular protein content of each plate determined by the method of Bradford (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar). The data presented are the means of triplicate measurements and are representative of three independent experiments. To determine apoA-I secretion rate, the cells were isolated, plated, and incubated essentially as described above except that conditioned medium was collected after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The medium was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove cell debris. The human apolipoproteins were quantitatively isolated from the medium by immunoprecipitation and then purified by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. A band corresponding to human apoA-I was excised from the gel and counted (49Azrolan N. Odaka H. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19833-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results were normalized to the cellular protein content of each plate determined by the method of Bradford (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar). The data presented are the means of triplicate measurements and are representative of three independent experiments. Differences among groups were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Differences in the synthesis and secretion rate of human apolipoproteins were evaluated by linear regression. The targeting strategy used to replace the mouse apoA-I coding exons 2–4 with the human counterpart is illustrated in Fig. 1. Homologous recombination between the endogenous mouse apoA-I locus (Fig. 1 A) and the targeting construct (Fig. 1 B) results in a chimeric gene (Fig. 1 C) where all of the mouse coding sequences have been replaced with sequences coding for human apoA-I or apoA-IM. This chimeric locus retains all of the normal mouse regulatory elements in addition to the noncoding mouse exon 1. Embryonic stem cell DNA, digested with HindIII and hybridized with probe 1 (Fig. 1), revealed a 12-kb endogenous band and a 9.1-kb targeted band, resulting from the novel restriction site, demonstrating the correct location of the targeted gene in the 3′ region (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, hybridization with probe 2 (Fig. 1) confirmed correct modification of the 5′ region (data not shown). The modified locus (apoA-I or apoA-IM) was transmitted to the F1 generation from chimeras that were made from one of the targeted cell lines. Genotypes of F2 animals were determined using Southern blotting analysis of tail DNA digested with HindIII and hybridized with probe 2, revealing a 12-kb endogenous band and a 3.8-kb targeted band (Fig. 2 B). The expression of human apoA-I or apoA-IM was assessed by two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis on mouse serum (Fig. 3). A 28-kDa spot was observed in each serum analyzed, corresponding either to murine apoA-I (only in control serum), human apoA-I, or the monomeric form of apoA-IM. From their sequence, the pI of murine apoA-I is computed at 5.42, the pI of human apoA-I at 5.27, and the pI of human apoA-IM at 5.19, as indicated in the Fig. 3. The spots marked with superscript−1 correspond to a post-translationally modified form that differs from the 0 superscript form for a Asn → Asp deamidation event (51Ghiselli G. Rohde M.F. Tanenbaum S. Krishnan S. Gotto Jr., A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the charge difference at pH = pI is 1 unit both between apoA-I and apoA-IM and between A-I0 and A-I−1, A-IM0and A-I−1 do overlap (see in Fig. 3 the spot indicated asA-I −1 +A-I M0). As expected, in A-IM k-in and A-I/A-IM k-in serum, an additional spot (see circles in Fig. 3, upper panel) corresponding to the dimeric form of apoA-IM(56 kDa), is visible and disappears upon sample reduction (Fig. 3,lower panel). Mouse plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations are shown in Table I. The apoA-IM concentrations in A-IM k-in mice was ∼50% of apoA-I in A-I k-in mice; the concentration of the human apolipoproteins in the apoA-I/A-IM k-in mice was the same as in A-IMk-in. Total cholesterol in A-IM k-in mice was significantly lower than that measured in every other group. The heterozygotes (A-I/A-IM k-in) had total cholesterol values intermediate to A-IM and A-I k-in mice. Plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations in A-IM k-in mice were substantially lower than those observed in A-I k-in and A-I/A-IM k-in mice (−63% and −50%, respectively). In addition, a significant increase in plasma unesterified to esterified cholesterol ratio was observed in A-IM k-in compared with A-I k-in mice (0.69 ± 0.13 versus 0.41 ± 0.02;p < 0.001), suggesting impaired cholesterol esterification in the former. In contrast to changes in cholesterol concentrations, plasma triglyceride levels were similar in all of the mouse lines analyzed.Table IPlasma lipid profiles and human apolipoprotein concentration in k-in and control miceMicenTCFCHDL-CTGapoA-I or apoA-IMmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlA-IMk-in952.89 ± 5.871-ap < 0.001 versus A-I k-in, and control mice.,1-bp < 0.05 versus A-I/A-IMk-in mice.21.21 ± 2.321-cp < 0.001 versus A-Ik-in mice.,1-dp < 0.05 versus control mice.28.08 ± 5.001-ep < 0.001 versus A-I k-in, A-I/A-IM k-in, and control mice.33.08 ± 24.12100.68 ± 19.431-cp < 0.001 versus A-Ik-in mice.A-I/A-IMk-in878.07 ± 5.4619.29 ± 1.4556.68 ± 1.9629.41 ± 14.34107.78 ± 30.181-cp < 0.001 versus A-Ik-in mice.A-I k-in8132.04 ± 34.5838.26 ± 9.0975.46 ± 14.8531.78 ± 21.75213.70 ± 41."
https://openalex.org/W2040279171,"Human RNase H1 is active only under reduced conditions. Oxidation as well as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) treatment of human RNase H1 ablates the cleavage activity. The oxidized and NEM alkylated forms of human RNase H1 exhibited binding affinities for the heteroduplex substrate comparable with the reduced form of the enzyme. Mutants of human RNase H1 in which the cysteines were either deleted or substituted with alanine exhibited cleavage rates comparable with the reduced form of the enzyme, suggesting that the cysteine residues were not required for catalysis. The cysteine residues responsible for the observed redox-dependent activity of human RNase H1 were determined by site-directed mutagenesis to involve Cys(147) and Cys(148). The redox states of the Cys(147) and Cys(148) residues were determined by digesting the reduced, oxidized, and NEM-treated forms of human RNase H1 with trypsin and analyzing the cysteine containing tryptic fragments by micro high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry. The tryptic fragment Asp(131)-Arg(153) containing Cys(147) and Cys(148) was identified. The mass spectra for the Asp(131)-Arg(153) peptides from the oxidized and reduced forms of human RNase H1 in the presence and absence of NEM showed peptide masses consistent with the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys(147) and Cys(148). These data show that the formation of a disulfide bond between adjacent Cys(147) and Cys(148) residues results in an inactive enzyme conformation and provides further insights into the interaction between human RNase H1 and the heteroduplex substrate."

Many such studies often found weak to very strong silencer activities to be associated with specific parts of the basal promoter or further upstream regions. In this study, we carried out a systematic study on human blood coagulation factor IX (hFIX) and anti-coagulant protein C (hPC) genes, previously shown to have silencer activities associated with their 5′-flanking regions containing promoter sequences. With newly constructed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vectors carrying hFIXor hPC gene promoter sequences, we confirmed the strong silencer activities associated with the regions nt −1895 through nt −416 of the hFIX gene or with the region nt −802 through nt −82 of the hPC gene. However, no such silencer activities associated with the specific regions were found when autologous hFIX cDNA, hFIX minigenes, orhPC minigenes were used as reporters in the expression vector system. Relative levels of CAT, hFIX, and hPC proteins produced in the transient assays correlated well with their mRNA levels. Human FIX minigene constructs containing a simian virus 40 (SV40) 3′-untranslated region (UTR) taken from the CAT reporter gene showed no silencer activity, indicating that SV40 3′-UTR sequence of the CAT reporter gene does not contribute to the silencer activity. Expression vectors constructed with the β-galactosidase gene under the control of hFIX gene promoter sequences also showed no silencer activity associated with the region nt −1895 through nt −416. These findings indicate that silencer activities associated with specific regions of promoter sequences as analyzed with CAT reporter genes may represent artifacts specific to the CAT reporter genes. Our findings strongly suggest a need for re-examination of promoter characterizations of many eukaryotic genes, which have been studied to date with CAT reporter genes.

Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Such complexity and diversity of gene expression are obviously needed for maintaining intricate balances among biological reactions and systems in response to various internal and external stimulations and stress. For characterization of promoter functions of various genes, heterologous reporter genes, such as CAT, β-galactosidase, luciferase, and green fluorescent protein genes, have often been utilized (3Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.56-16.57Google Scholar, 4Lewis J.C. Feltus A. Ensor C.M. Ramanathan S. Daunert S. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 579A-585ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jain V.K. Methods in Enzymology. 273. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 319-330Google Scholar). Use of such heterologous reporter genes often gives convenience in both qualitative and quantitative analyses of promoter activities. At the same time, however, use of such heterologous reporter genes may result in significant biases in assessing subtle structure-function relationships of promoters and irrelevant observations, which are primarily due to the introduction of foreign elements or due to the elimination of intrinsic elements of test genes in the assay system. Any regulatory machinery including those in the promoter regions must have evolved in the context of the rest of gene structures, neighboring genomic elements as well as of higher order structures of chromatin and chromosome. Therefore, use of a heterologous reporter gene in studying regulatory mechanisms of an unrelated gene may have a risk of resulting in irrelevant observations and conclusions. To date, a large number of mammalian genes have been analyzed for their promoter functions with various heterologous reporter genes. However, literally no systematic studies have been conducted addressing the issue concerning the relevancy and limitation of commonly used heterologous reporter genes. Many functional analyses of promoters of eukaryotic genes to date by using CAT 1The abbreviations used are: CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; hFIX, human factor IX; hPC, human protein C; SV40, simian virus 40; HepG2 cell, human hepatic carcinoma cell line; HTC cell, rat hepatoma cell line; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; nt, nucleotide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reporter genes have shown weak to strong negative regulatory activities or silencer activities, which are associated with specific 5′-flanking regions containing promoter sequences (6Goodbourn S.

Human genes for FIX and PC, important factors involved in blood coagulation and anti-coagulation pathways, respectively (8Dahlback B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 5′-upstream region of the hFIX gene promoter beyond approximately nt −800 up to at least nt −1900 showed a very strong silencer activity in the CAT vector context (10Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hPC gene promoter was also shown to have a substantial silencer activity associated with the 5′-upstream region beyond nt −82 up to nt −802 (11Miao C.H. Ho W.-T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Literally nothing was known about the mechanisms by which these silencer activities are generated and what roles they play in the natural regulation of hFIX and hPC gene expression. In this report, using transient expression assay system with HepG2 cell or HTC cell lines, we first demonstrate that CAT reporter gene constructs reproducibly show silencer activities associated withhFIX and hPC gene promoters. We then present experimental evidence that such silencer activities are irrelevant artifacts specifically associated with the CAT reporter gene, but not with other reporter genes including autologous hFIX or hPC gene as well as the β-galactosidase gene, another commonly used heterologous reporter gene. Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs. Radioactive nucleotides, [α-32P]dCTP, were obtained from AmershamBiosciences. Mouse anti-hPC monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-hPC antibodies were purchased from Celsus Laboratory. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-hFIX polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc and Enzyme Research Laboratory, respectively, as previously described (12Kurachi S. Hitomi Y. Furukawa M. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5276-5281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

Human PC vector pUC119-hPC was kindly provided by Dr. Francis Castelino at the University of Notre Dame.o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside for the β-gal assay was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Plasmids pCH110 and pSV2CAT contain β-gal and CAT genes under the control of the SV40 early promoter, respectively (10Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUMSVOCAT, a promoter-less CAT vector with virtually no background CAT expression activity, was used as a control CAT expression vector (14Salier J.-P. Kurachi K. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 30PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of CAT expression vectors under controls of thehFIX or hPC promoters are as follows: expression vectors with hFIX 5′-flanking sequences, −1895FIX/CAT and −416FIX/CAT, were constructed by inserting hFIX gene fragments spanning nt −1895 through nt +29 or nt −416 through nt +29, which were PCR-amplified from minigene −2231FIXm1 (15Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), into pUMSVOCAT at the SmaI site, respectively (Table I). Expression vectors, −802PC/CAT and −82PC/CAT, were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified fragments withSmaI linkers, which span the region nt −802 through nt +66 or nt −82 through nt +66 of the hPC gene, into pUMSVOCAT, at the SmaI site, respectively (11Miao C.H.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.56-16.57Google Scholar), thus generating pOGAL. A PCR-amplified fragment of 1924 bp (nt −1895 through nt +29 of the hFIX gene) or 445 bp (nt −416 through nt +29) withHindIII sticky end was then inserted into pOGAL atHindIII site, thus generating −1895FIX/βGAL or −416FIX/βGAL. All the PCR-amplified sequences and ligation site sequences of expression vectors were subjected to automated dideoxy sequencing to confirm their accuracy.Table IPCR primers used for CAT, hFIX, and hPC constructsConstructsPrimers1-aThe locations of primers are shown by nucleotide residue numbers in the parentheses.Primer sequences−1895FIX/CAT5′ Forward (nt −1895 to −1875)5′-TCCCCCGGGAGAAAAAAACAAACAACCCC-3′3′ Reverse (nt +51 to +70)5′-TCCCCCGGGAGGCCTGGTGATTCTGCCAT-3′−416FIX/CAT5′ Forward (nt −416 to −396)5′-TCCCCCGGGCTAGAATATATAAACAACCT-3′3′ Reverse (nt +51 to +70)Same as −1895FIX/CAT 3′ reverse primer−1895FIXm15′ Forward (nt −1895 to −1875)5′-CGATGCATGCAGAAAAAAACAAACAACCCC-3′3′ Reverse (nt +51 to +72)5′-TGAGGCCTGGTGATTCTGCCAT-3′−802PC/CAT5′ Forward (nt −802 to −783)5′-TCCCCCGGGTGCAGGACACAGGCAAAGGT-3′3′ Reverse (nt +47 to +66)5′-TCCCCCGGGAGGGGCGGGTCGTGGAGAGA-3′−82PC/CAT5′ Forward (nt −82 to −63)5′-TCCCCCGGGCAGGAGTGCTAGTGCCACTG-3′3′ Reverse (nt +47 to +66)Same as −802PC/CAT 3′ reverse primer−802PCm15′ Forward (nt −802 to −783)5′-CGATGCATGCTGCAGGACACAGGCAAAGGT-3′3′ Reverse (nt +1541 to +1560)5′-ATTCCCCAGGTGGCCACGAA-3′−802PC/FIXc5′ Forward (nt −802 to −783)5′-CGATGCATGCTGCAGGACACAGGCAAAGGT-3′3′ Reverse (nt +47 to +66)5′-CTAGCTAGCAGGGGCGGGTCGTGGAGAGA-3′a The locations of primers are shown by nucleotide residue numbers in the parentheses. Open table in a new tab Human FIX minigene (hFIXm1) and cDNA (hFIXc) expression vectors, −1895FIXm1, −416FIXm1, −1895FIXc, and −416FIXc, were constructed with plasmid pUC19. These vectors contained 5′-end regulatory regions of thehFIX gene identical to those used in the CAT vectors. Constructs −416FIXm1 and −416FIXc were prepared as previously described (12Kurachi S. Hitomi Y. Furukawa M. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5276-5281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Constructs −416FIXm1 or −416FIXc were digested withSphI and StuI, removing a 483-bp fragment encompassing a region nt −416 through nt +67 of the hFIXgene (the unique StuI site at nt +67 in exon I). A PCR-amplified 1967-bp fragment (nt −1895 through nt +72 of thehFIX gene) with SphI and StuI sticky ends at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively (Table I), was then inserted at the sites, thus producing −1895FIXm1 and −1895FIXc, respectively. Minigenes −1895FIXm1 and −416FIXm1 were digested by BamHI and KpnI, removing the 3′-UTR and poly(A) signal sequence of the hFIX gene, followed by treatment with Klenow enzyme. A fragment containing the SV40 early region and poly(A) signal sequence (135 bp in size) was released by HpaI and BamHI double digestion of pUMSVOCAT, followed by treatment with Klenow enzyme, and then inserted into the above fragment vectors, generating −1895FIX/SV40 and −416FIX/SV40, respectively. Minigene −416FIXm1 was digested by SphI/NheI to remove itshFIX promoter region, followed by Klenow enzyme treatment and self-ligation, thus generating pFIXm1, a promoter-less hFIX minigene control vector for hFIX expression assays. A promoter-less hFIX cDNA control vector, pFIXc, was similarly generated bySphI/NheI double digestion of −416FIXc, removing the promoter region. Human PC minigene (hPCm1) expression vectors, −802PCm1 and −82PCm1, were constructed as follows: a fragment spanning nt −802 through nt +1560 of the hPC gene (2362 bp in size) with SphI and MscI linkers at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was PCR-amplified by using human genomic DNA as a template (11Miao C.H. Ho W.-T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) (Table I), and inserted into pUC119-hPC between SphI andMscI sites to replace its 5′-end portion. The 3′-end portion of the resultant construct containing the internal Sse8387I site in the 3′-UTR through an EcoRI site present at the 3′-end immediately outside of the poly(A) attachment site, was released by Sse8387I/EcoRI double digestion. A PCR-amplified fragment (615 bp in size, spanning nt +10494 through nt +11108 of the hPC gene) with Sse8387I andEcoRI sticky ends (17Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), was then inserted to fill the gap, thus generating −802PCm1. Construct −82PCm1 was similarly generated by replacing the 5′ portion of −802PCm1 (nt −802 to nt +1560) with a fragment spanning nt −82 to nt +1560. The 5′-end region, non-coding exon 1 and partial intron 1 of the hPC gene were removed from −802PCm1 by complete and partial digestion with SphI and MscI, respectively. The remaining fragment from −802PCm1 was treated by Klenow fragment, and then self-ligated, generating promoter-less control vector, pPCm1. Expression vectors, −802PC/FIXc and −82PC/FIXc, were constructed as follows: a fragment spanning nt −802 through nt +66 of thehPC gene with SphI and NheI linkers at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was PCR-amplified from −802PCm1 (Table I). After digestion with SphI/NheI, this fragment was inserted into −416FIXc, which was digested in advance with SphI/NheI, removing the hFIXpromoter sequence, thus generating −802PC/FIXc. Construct −82PC/FIXc was similarly generated by replacing the 5′-end fragment (nt −802 through nt +66) of −802PC/FIXc with a 148-bp hPC fragment spanning nt −82 through nt +66 of the hPC gene. All the PCR-amplified sequences and ligation site sequences of newly constructed expression vectors were confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing for their accuracy. HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented withl-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES buffer, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin), and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HTC cells were cultured under similar conditions except 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented. Cell transfection was carried out with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as previously described (18Kurachi S. Sze L. Kurachi K. Biochemica. 1998; 3: 43-44Google Scholar). Plasmid pCH110 was used as a transfection internal control for CAT, hFIX and hPC expression vectors, while pSV2CAT was similarly used for β-gal expression vectors. 4–5 independent assays were carried out, and average activities were shown with S.D. The CAT protein assay was carried out by using a CAT ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. β-gal activity was assayed as previously reported (19Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Cell extracts obtained from cells co-transfected with pCH110 or pSV2CAT were first assayed for β-gal or CAT activities, respectively. These activities were used for normalizing transfection efficiencies among culture dishes. Amounts of cell extracts taken for activity assays were adjusted for the optimal assay range of CAT or β-gal activity. Human FIX produced into the conditioned culture medium was quantified by hFIX-specific ELISA as previously described (15Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This ELISA system reproducibly detected hFIX antigen as low as 1 ng/ml. Human PC produced was assayed by ELISA as previously described (20Zhang K. Kurachi S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4532-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the detection antibody. For each expression vector, minimally three independent ELISA were carried out with duplicated assays for each diluted culture medium sample, and average values were calculated to determine the amounts of protein produced. Northern blot analysis of HepG2 cells transfected with hFIX, hPC, or CAT constructs was carried out as previously described (15Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Zhang K. Kurachi S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4532-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples prepared from the transfected HepG2 cells were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (15 μg per lane). For CAT mRNA detection, a coding region fragment of CAT gene (624 bp in size) was PCR-amplified with 5′ and 3′ primers (5′-ACCACCGTTGATATATCC-3′ and 5′-CTGCCACTCATCGCAGTA-3′, respectively) by using pUMSVOCAT as a template, and was used as a hybridization probe. A fragment (588 bp in size) prepared by SspI/BamHI digestion of −416FIXm1 was used for hFIX hybridization. Human PC hybridization probe (365 bp in size, from nt +8385 to +8749 in genomic nucleotide numbering) was prepared as previously described (20Zhang K. Kurachi S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4532-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (AmershamBiosciences) to a specific activity of ∼1 × 109cpm/μg. To confirm the presence of equal amount of RNAs, blotted filters were washed twice at 75 °C, each for 30 min, in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and hybridized with labeled RNR 18 probe. Transient expression activities of newly generated CAT reporter gene constructs with differenthFIX 5′ promoter sequences, −1895FIX/CAT and −416FIX/CAT, in HepG2 cells are shown in Fig. 1 A. Construct pUMSVOCAT, a promoter-less control, gave no detectable CAT activities. Construct −1895FIX/CAT containing the hFIX promoter region nt −1895 through nt +29 showed only 15.9% CAT activity of that of the −416FIX/CAT containing the region nt −416 through nt +29. In agreement, Northern blot analyses showed a similarly lowered mRNA level in HepG2 cells transfected with −1895FIX/CAT, ∼20% of that of cells transfected with −416FIX/CAT (Fig. 1 D). These results indicated the existence of a strong silencer activity associated with the 5′-upstream region of the hFIX gene, confirming our previous observation (10Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative expression activities of hFIXm1 constructs containing thehFIX promoter sequences identical to those used in CAT constructs, −1895FIXm1, −416FIXm1, −1895FIXc, and −416FIXc, are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Construct −416FIXm1 expressed hFIX at a level of ∼40 ng/106 cells per 24 h and was defined to be at 100% activity. HepG2 cells expressed non-detectable levels of hFIX as previously reported (15Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As expected, the promoter-less control vector, pFIXm1, showed only minimal hFIX expression activity. Both −1895FIXm1 and −416FIXm1 showed equivalent transient expression activities, which were correlated well with similar hFIX mRNA levels in HepG2 cells transfected either with −1895FIXm1 or with −416FIXm1 (Fig. 1 E). These results indicated no appreciable silencer activities associated with the region nt −1895 through nt −416 of the hFIX gene. Similar to thehFIX minigene constructs, expression vectors with hFIX cDNA sequence, −416FIXc and −1895FIXc, showed equivalent hFIX expression activities in HepG2 cells, confirming no silencer activities associated with the region nt −1895 through nt −416 (Fig. 1C). This result also suggested that there is no specific contribution of the functional hFIX intron 1 sequence to the silencer activity shown by CAT reporter analysis. Transient expression activities of newly constructed CAT reporter gene vectors with hPC promoter sequences, −802PC/CAT and −82PC/CAT, are shown in Fig. 2 A. The average CAT transient expression activity of −802PC/CAT was only 21.6% of that of −82PC/CAT, and in agreement, the CAT mRNA level of HepG2 cells transfected with −802PC/CAT was also lowered to ∼25% of −82PC/CAT (Fig. 2 C). These results indicated the presence of substantial silencer activity associated with the 5′-upstream region (nt −82 to nt −802) of the hPC gene, which is consistent with the previous report by Miao et al. (11Miao C.H. Ho W.-T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transient expression activities of hPC minigenes expression vectors were assayed with both HepG2 cells and HTC cells, respectively. Relative expression activities of hPC miningene constructs with that of −82PCm1 defined as 100% are shown in Fig. 2 B. HepG2 cells showed a low, but significant level of endogenous hPC expression (∼12 ng/106 cells per 24 h, data not shown), which correlated with the significant background expression activity of pPCm1, a promoter-less construct (average 12.8 ng/106 cells per 24 h). Construct −82hPCm1 produced 101 ng/106 cells per 24 h into the culture medium. Constructs −82PCm1 and −802PCm1 gave equivalent hPC expression activities in HepG2 cells, correlating well with the similar levels of hPC mRNA in the transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 D). Relative expression activities of hPC expression vectors assayed with HTC cells, a rat hepatoma cell line with no endogenous hPC expression, agreed well with those obtained in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B). These results obtained with native gene constructs contradict the observation with CAT reporter gene (Fig. 2 A). Relative expression activities of chimeric pFIXm1/SV40, −1895FIXm1/SV40 and −416FIXm1/SV40 vectors, in which SV40 3′-UTR including poly(A) signal sequence replaced the counterpart of the hFIXm1 gene, are shown in Fig. 3 A. Both constructs showed similar hFIX expression activities, indicating no contribution by the SV40 sequences in the CAT constructs to the silencer activity observed with −1895FIX/CAT. Transient expression of β-gal reporter gene constructs under the control of the hFIX gene promoter sequences, −1895FIX/βGAL and −416FIX/βGAL, were assayed with HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 B). Construct pOβGal, a promoter-less control, gave no appreciable β-gal expression in HepG2 cells. No silencer activity was found to be associated with the region nt −1895 through nt −419 of the hFIX gene in the β-gal reporter gene context. Constructs composed of hPC promoter sequences and hFIX cDNA reporter, −802PC/FIXc or −82PC/FIXc, also showed no silencer activity associated with the 5′-flanking region nt −802 through nt −82 of the hPC gene (Fig. 3 C). Heterologous reporter genes have been widely used for functional characterization of many eukaryotic gene promoters. Use of such reporter genes, however, may have a risk of generating irrelevant results and conclusions on gene regulation. This is the issue that we systematically addressed in the present study. Such irrelevant results may be generated due to the absence of structural elements in the heterologous reporter gene, which are present in the native test gene and required for its regulation in the context of its own promoter. Alternatively, structural elements in the heterologous genes, which are absent in the test genes, may critically affect the transcriptional regulation of test genes. In the present studies, we first demonstrated that CAT reporter gene expression vectors reproducibly showed strong silencer activities associated with the 5′-flanking regions of the hFIX gene (Fig. 1 A), confirming the previous findings (10Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such silencer activities, apparently due to transcriptional suppression as demonstrated by the similarly reduced mRNA levels (Fig. 1 D), however, were not found when hFIX minigene or cDNA were used as a reporter in place of the CAT gene (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicated that the silencer activities found to be associated with the 5′-specific upstream region of the hFIX gene may be irrelevant to thehFIX gene, and were generated through a specific combination of the hFIX promoter and the CAT reporter gene. This hypothesis was further supported by the similar findings obtained withhPC gene expression vectors (Fig. 2). Use of the CAT reporter gene in combination with the hPC promoter region gave substantial silencer activity associated with the 5′-flanking region nt −802 through nt −82 (Fig. 2 A), whereas no such silencer activity was observed when the hPC minigenes were used as a reporter (Fig. 2 B). It is possible that some elements present in the hFIXminigene, such as the functional intron sequence which grossly elevates mRNA levels (12Kurachi S. Hitomi Y. Furukawa M. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5276-5281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Jallat S. Perraud F. Dalemans W. Balland A. Dieterle A. Faure T. Muelien P. Pavirani A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3295-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), might eliminate the silencer activity observed with CAT reporter. However, this possibility was not supported, since hFIX cDNA constructs without the intron sequence did not show any silencer activities (Fig. 1 C). The SV40 3′-UTR sequence used in the CAT reporter gene was also shown to be not responsible for generating the silencer activity (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the observed correlation between levels of produced CAT, hFIX, or hPC protein and their mRNA levels eliminates the possibility of reporter gene-dependent differences in translational efficiency, intracellular protein trafficking or secretion process as a possible cause for generating CAT reporter gene-specific silencer activities (Figs. 1, D andE and 2, C and D). Examinations with another series of chimera constructs composed of promoter sequences of the hPC gene connected with the hFIX cDNA sequence also showed no silencer activity associated with the hPC promoter region nt −802 through nt −82 (Fig. 3 C). It is important to emphasize that hFIX and hPC genes share a significant similarity in their coding regions (22Plutzky J. Hoskins J.A. Long G.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, their promoter regions are grossly different from each other, suggesting that these promoter regions took different evolutional pathways (20Zhang K. Kurachi S. Kurachi K. J. Biol.

Expression vectors with the β-gal gene, another common reporter gene, also do not show any silencer activity withhFIX promoter sequences, further supporting our conclusion that the silencer activities observed with the 5′-flanking upstream-specific regions of hFIX as well as thehPC gene are unique artifacts generated by use of CAT reporter genes (Fig. 3 B). The detailed mechanisms responsible for generating such silencer activities associated with the CAT reporter genes in combination with the promoters of genes of interest remain to be determined. Particularly, identification of any specific parts of the CAT gene structure involved in cross-talk with the specific regions of test promoter sequences would be critical. Other heterologous reporter genes, which are not included in the present study, may also exert unusual effects including silencer activities on various gene promoters. Furthermore, specific combinations of a tested gene promoter and a heterologous reporter gene may even generate pseudo-high activity for the promoter although to our knowledge no systematic studies are reported to date. These possibilities are yet to be tested. Our findings indicate that observations on the promoter structure-function relationship analyzed with the commonly usedCAT reporter gene may not necessarily represent the true promoter regulatory mechanisms of many genes of interest, and strongly suggest a need for their systematic re-examination. Analysis of a specific promoter may be best done, if possible, with its autologous coding and subsequent downstream structure sequences as a reporter gene.

GA¶del9s result showed that the axiomatic method, while extremely powerful-it continues to play a central role in mathematics-has inherent limitations. As described in an Essay by
 Keith Devlin, the Incompleteness Theorem did not lead to any major changes within mathematics, but it changed forever the way mathematicians view the subject."
