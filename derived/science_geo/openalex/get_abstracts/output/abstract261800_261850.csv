https://openalex.org/W2072155079,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are produced through a set of cleavages within a longer RNA, one of the nucleases involved in this process is Drosha. A subset of miRNAs (mirtrons) are matured through an alternative pathway that is Drosha-independent. These mirtrons may be the early ancestors of the majority of miRNAs that were expressed once Drosha function emerged. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22-nucleotide endogenous RNAs that often repress the expression of complementary messenger RNAs1. In animals, miRNAs derive from characteristic hairpins in primary transcripts through two sequential RNase III-mediated cleavages; Drosha cleaves near the base of the stem to liberate a ∼60-nucleotide pre-miRNA hairpin, then Dicer cleaves near the loop to generate a miRNA:miRNA* duplex2,3. From that duplex, the mature miRNA is incorporated into the silencing complex. Here we identify an alternative pathway for miRNA biogenesis, in which certain debranched introns mimic the structural features of pre-miRNAs to enter the miRNA-processing pathway without Drosha-mediated cleavage. We call these pre-miRNAs/introns ‘mirtrons’, and have identified 14 mirtrons in Drosophila melanogaster and another four in Caenorhabditis elegans (including the reclassification of mir-62). Some of these have been selectively maintained during evolution with patterns of sequence conservation suggesting important regulatory functions in the animal. The abundance of introns comparable in size to pre-miRNAs appears to have created a context favourable for the emergence of mirtrons in flies and nematodes. This suggests that other lineages with many similarly sized introns probably also have mirtrons, and that the mirtron pathway could have provided an early avenue for the emergence of miRNAs before the advent of Drosha."
https://openalex.org/W2056663185,"Autophagy is a self-degradative process involved both in basal turnover of cellular components and in response to nutrient starvation or organelle damage in a wide range of eukaryotes. During autophagy, portions of the cytoplasm are sequestered by double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, and are degraded after fusion with lysosomes for subsequent recycling. In vertebrates, this process acts as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism in different physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer; however, the roles of autophagy during embryonic development are still largely uncharacterized. Beclin1 (Becn1; coiled-coil, myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein) is a principal regulator in autophagosome formation, and its deficiency results in early embryonic lethality. Here we show that Ambra1 (activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy), a large, previously unknown protein bearing a WD40 domain at its amino terminus, regulates autophagy and has a crucial role in embryogenesis. We found that Ambra1 is a positive regulator of the Becn1-dependent programme of autophagy, as revealed by its overexpression and by RNA interference experiments in vitro. Notably, Ambra1 functional deficiency in mouse embryos leads to severe neural tube defects associated with autophagy impairment, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, unbalanced cell proliferation and excessive apoptotic cell death. In addition to identifying a new and essential element regulating the autophagy programme, our results provide in vivo evidence supporting the existence of a complex interplay between autophagy, cell growth and cell death required for neural development in mammals."

These diseases include retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy, leading causes of blindness in childhood and middle age affecting over 4 million people in the United States. We studied the influence of omega-3- and omega-6-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on vascular loss, vascular regrowth after injury, and hypoxia-induced pathological neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. We show that increasing omega-3-PUFA tissue levels by dietary or genetic means decreased the avascular area of the retina by increasing vessel regrowth after injury, thereby reducing the hypoxic stimulus for neovascularization. The bioactive omega-3-PUFA-derived mediators neuroprotectinD1, resolvinD1 and resolvinE1 also potently protected against neovascularization. The protective effect of omega-3-PUFAs and their bioactive metabolites was mediated, in part, through suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This inflammatory cytokine was found in a subset of microglia that was closely associated with retinal vessels. These findings indicate that increasing the sources of omega-3-PUFA or their bioactive products reduces pathological angiogenesis. Western diets are often deficient in omega-3-PUFA, and premature infants lack the important transfer from the mother to the infant of omega-3-PUFA that normally occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. Supplementing omega-3-PUFA intake may be of benefit in preventing retinopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2019169633,"Mycobacterium avium is a major opportunistic pathogen in HIV-positive individuals and is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients. M. avium express glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) as a major cell wall constituent, and recent studies suggest that GPLs play an important role in M. avium pathogenesis. In the present study we show that M. avium-infected macrophages release GPLs, which are trafficked from the phagosome through the endocytic network to multivesicular bodies. Prior studies have shown that multivesicular bodies can fuse with the plasma membrane releasing small 50 to 100 nm vesicles known as exosomes. We found that M. avium-infected macrophages release exosomes containing GPLs leading to the transfer of GPLs from infected to uninfected macrophages. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from M. avium-infected but not from uninfected macrophages can stimulate a proinflammatory response in resting macrophages. This proinflammatory response is dependent on Toll like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, and MyD88 suggesting that released exosomes contain M. avium-expressed TLR ligands. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that exosomes isolated from mycobacteria-infected macrophages can induce a proinflammatory response, and we hypothesize that exosomes play an important role in immune surveillance during intracellular bacteria infections."

https://openalex.org/W2011816180,"Background Understanding the mechanisms underlying generation of neuronal variability and complexity remains the central challenge for neuroscience. Structural variation in the neuronal genome is likely to be one important mechanism for neuronal diversity and brain diseases. Large-scale genomic variations due to loss or gain of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy) have been described in cells of the normal and diseased human brain, which are generated from neural stem cells during intrauterine period of life. However, the incidence of aneuploidy in the developing human brain and its impact on the brain development and function are obscure. Methodology/Principal Findings To address genomic variation during development we surveyed aneuploidy/polyploidy in the human fetal tissues by advanced molecular-cytogenetic techniques at the single-cell level. Here we show that the human developing brain has mosaic nature, being composed of euploid and aneuploid neural cells. Studying over 600,000 neural cells, we have determined the average aneuploidy frequency as 1.25–1.45% per chromosome, with the overall percentage of aneuploidy tending to approach 30–35%. Furthermore, we found that mosaic aneuploidy can be exclusively confined to the brain. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicates aneuploidization to be an additional pathological mechanism for neuronal genome diversification. These findings highlight the involvement of aneuploidy in the human brain development and suggest an unexpected link between developmental chromosomal instability, intercellural/intertissular genome diversity and human brain diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1965874164,"We report here the complete genome sequence of the virulent strain JIP02/86 (ATCC 49511) of Flavobacterium psychrophilum, a widely distributed pathogen of wild and cultured salmonid fish. The genome consists of a 2,861,988-base pair (bp) circular chromosome with 2,432 predicted protein-coding genes. Among these predicted proteins, stress response mediators, gliding motility proteins, adhesins and many putative secreted proteases are probably involved in colonization, invasion and destruction of the host tissues. The genome sequence provides the basis for explaining the relationships of the pathogen to the host and opens new perspectives for the development of more efficient disease control strategies. It also allows for a better understanding of the physiology and evolution of a significant representative of the family Flavobacteriaceae, whose members are associated with an interesting diversity of lifestyles and habitats."

https://openalex.org/W2011843627,"A computational model of mitochondrial metabolism and electrophysiology is introduced and applied to analysis of data from isolated cardiac mitochondria and data on phosphate metabolites in striated muscle in vivo. This model is constructed based on detailed kinetics and thermodynamically balanced reaction mechanisms and a strict accounting of rapidly equilibrating biochemical species. Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic parameters, a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function.

Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function. Mitochondrial energy metabolism centers on the tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions, oxidative phosphorylation, and associated transport reactions. It is a system in which biochemical reactions are coupled to membrane electrophysiology, nearly every intermediate acts as an allosteric regulator of several enzymes in the system, and nearly all intermediates are transported into and out of the mitochondria via a host of electroneutral and electrogenic exchangers and cotransporters. Thus, it is a system with a level of complexity that begs for computational modeling to aid in analysis of experimental data and development and testing of quantitative hypotheses. In addition, as is demonstrated in this work, computer modeling of mitochondrial function facilitates the translation of observations made in one experimental regime (isolated ex vivo mitochondria) to another (in vivo cellular energy metabolism). In addition, the developed model provides the basis for examining how mitochondrial energetics is controlled in vivo. The model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP on regulating tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. The mitochondrial redox state in turn is affected by cytoplasmic Pi concentration, since inorganic phosphate is a co-factor for transport of tricarboxylic acid cycle substrates a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Since ADP and Pi are the biochemical substrates for oxidative phosphorylation, the primary mechanism of control of mitochondrial energy metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) in striated muscle is feedback of the products of ATP hydrolysis. In a series of works, Kohn et al. (1Kohn M.C. Garfinkel D. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1983; 11: 511-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Kohn M.C. Achs M.J. Garfinkel D. Am. J.

Physiol. 1979; 237: R167-R173PubMed Google Scholar) presented a detailed model of tricarboxylic acid cycle kinetics. However, the available information regarding the Kohn et al. model is incomplete, ambiguous, and sometimes self-contradictory. In addition, Kohn et al. lacked the computational resources for relatively identifying such a large scale model. Nevertheless, the work of Kohn et al. provides a useful repository of kinetic mechanisms for tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions. Intact functional mitochondrial isolated from tissue provides a powerful tool for developing a mechanistic model of mitochondrial function. Suspensions of isolated mitochondria are readily subjected to state perturbations by introducing different substrates; mitochondrial state variables (membrane potential, redox state of cofactors, respiration rate, and intermediate concentrations) are available to measurement by a variety of methods. Therefore, a tremendous amount of valuable data shedding light on mitochondrial function is available. The challenge in making use of the available data is in building and validating a single model that is comprehensive enough to simulate a number of different experimental protocols and measurements. This challenge is met here by building a detailed model for all of the processes illustrated in Fig. 1. This model accounts for detailed biochemical thermodynamics using a simulation approach for biochemical kinetics adapted from Vinnakota et al. (4Vinnakota K. Kemp M.L. Kushmerick M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1264-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The electrophysiology of the mitochondrial inner membrane is based on previous models of Beard (5Beard D.A. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (6Wu F. Jeneson J.A. Beard D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C115-C124Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), accounting for ionic species that are transported across the membrane (such as H+, ATP4–, H2PO4−) as variables. Although carefully estimated values for a great number of model parameters, including basic thermodynamic data of metal ion-biochemical species dissociation constants, are available from existing data bases, a large number of kinetic constants in the model have to be estimated from comparing model simulations with experimental data. In fact, the current work is unprecedented in terms of the complexity of the model and large amount of data used to build it. A total of 31 parameters values are estimated based on comparison with 25 data curves measured in isolated cardiac mitochondria from two different laboratories. Following parameterization, the developed model is validated based on comparison with additional data from both ex vivo isolated mitochondria and in vivo 31P NMR data from skeletal muscle. The validated model is then used to investigate the major factors controlling in vivo tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and striated muscle energy metabolism. Here the basic approach to computer simulation and parameterization of the system illustrated in Fig. 1 is outlined. The complete model equations and corresponding explanations are given in the supplemental materials. Below, subscripts x, i, and c on variable names denote matrix, intermembrane, and cytoplasmic (extramitochondrial) spaces, respectively. For example [ATP]x denotes matrix ATP concentration, whereas [ATP]c denotes ATP concentration in the cytoplasm or buffer space for an isolated mitochondria experiment. Model Components—The basic mitochondrial model, applied initially to simulate the behavior of isolated mitochondria, includes reactions occurring in three compartments: mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial intermembrane space, and buffer space. The model incorporates tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation fluxes, substrate and cation transport fluxes, passive permeation fluxes, and buffer reaction fluxes. Reaction fluxes are modeled based on detailed kinetic mechanisms provided in the work of Kohn et al. (1Kohn M.C. Garfinkel D. Ann. Biomed.

These state variables include 59 biochemical reactant concentrations, matrix-free Mg2+ and K+, matrix pH, and inner membrane electrostatic potential. The 59 biochemical concentration variables represent 34 biochemical reactants, some of which are distributed in multiple compartments. Each of the 34 biochemical reactants is made up of several rapidly interconverting species. For example the reactant ATP is considered to be made up of the four ionic species, ATP4–, HATP3–, MgATP2–, and KATP3–. For all reactants, binding of H+, K+, and Mg2+ is explicitly accounted for where such binding is significant. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle and Related Reactions—The matrix biochemical reactions considered include the tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions plus pyruvate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1, reaction 1), nucleoside diphosphokinase (reaction 10), and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (reaction 11). The reference chemical reactions for these biochemical reactions are tabulated in Table 1. Inhibitors and activators for the enzyme catalyzing these reactions that are considered in the model are listed in Table 2.

Garfinkel D. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: R167-R173PubMed Google Scholar) and original experimentally based publications. In each case, our particular choice of parameter values is justified, as described in the supplemental materials. However, for many parameters, a wide range of possible values are available. We use the supplementary materials to tabulate and document alternative parameter values of kinetic constants for the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Enzyme activity values are treated as adjustable parameters, which are estimated as described below. Enzyme regulation by metabolic intermediates is incorporated into the modeled enzyme mechanisms. Major sites of regulation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reactions that tend to be maintained far from equilibrium (12Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Fundamentals of Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Google Scholar, 13Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York2005: 601-630Google Scholar). These three enzymes are strongly inhibited by product accumulation. For example, citrate acts as a competitive inhibitor against oxaloacetate, and CoA-SH acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor against acetyl-CoA for citrate synthase. Both the isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are regulated by ATP and ADP, which act as an inhibitor and an activator, respectively, at regulatory sites on these enzymes. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an allosteric enzyme and inhibited by NADH competing against NAD; α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is inhibited by succinyl-CoA and NADH.

In previous applications using this model, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not explicitly simulated. Instead, a phenomenological driving function is used to generate NADH and drive the electron transport system. Here, in replacing the phenomenological driving function with the biochemical model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the oxidative phosphorylation model parameter values are adjusted to ensure that the integrated model simultaneously matches the original data set used to identify the oxidative phosphorylation component and the kinetic data used to identify the tricarboxylic acid cycle model. Substrate and Cation Transport Fluxes—Since the mitochondrial inner membrane is permeable to few metabolites or ions, almost all substrate and ion transport is catalyzed by specific transporters. An exception is the proton leak, which is driven by electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane and is modeled here as coupled diffusion and drift using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (16Lakshminarayanaiah N. Transport Phenomena in Membranes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 58-128Google Scholar, 17Fall C.P. Wagner J. Marland E. Computational Cell Biology. Springer, New York2002: 171-197Google Scholar). In contrast to the inner membrane, the outer member is permeable to almost all small molecules and ions (13Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York2005: 601-630Google Scholar, 18Anderson C.M. Norquist B.A. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G. Soine W.H. Duan S. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9203-9209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All fluxes across the outer membrane are modeled as passive permeation driven by concentration gradients. The 10 substrate transporters included in the model are the pyruvate-hydrogen (PYR–/H+) co-transporter, the glutamate-hydrogen ion (GLU–/H+) co-transporter, the citrate/malate (HCIT2–/MAL2–), α-ketoglutarate/malate (AKG2–/MAL2–), succinate/malate (SUC2–/MAL2–), malate/phosphate (MAL2–/P2–i), and aspartate/glutamate (ASP–/HGLU0) exchangers, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), 2The abbreviation used is: ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase. the phosphate-hydrogen (H2PO–4/H+) co-transporter, and the potassium/hydrogen (K+/H+) exchanger. The ASP–/HGLU0 and ANT exchangers involve translocations of charge and are therefore electrogenic (19LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). All other modeled substrate transporters catalyze electroneutral exchange. The AKG2–/MAL2– transport flux is modeled to be competitively inhibited by the tricarboxylic acid intermediates citrate, succinate, glutamate, and aspartate (20Palmieri F. Quagliariello E. Klingenberger M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As electrogenic transporters, the ASP–/HGLU0 and ANT antiporters are modeled to be driven by both membrane electrical potential and concentration gradients (19LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 21Dierks T. Riemer E. Kramer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Williamson J.R. Safer B. LaNoue K.F. Smith C.M. Walajtys E. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 241-281PubMed Google Scholar). Other transporters are modeled using simple mass action kinetics. Both the AKG2–/MAL2– and ASP–/HGLU0 antiporters are components of the malate-aspartate shuttle indirectly transporting cytosolic NADH into the mitochondrial matrix (12Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Fundamentals of Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Google Scholar, 13Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York2005: 601-630Google Scholar). External Space Fluxes—Analysis of available data requires simulation of a variety of conditions and experimental protocols. These protocols require simulation of biochemical reactions in the external space. For the experiments of LaNoue et al. (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (described under “Results”), hexokinase and glucose are added in the buffer medium to consume ATP and maintain mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Thus for these experiments, the hexokinase reaction is simulated. For simulations of in vivo mitochondrial energetics, creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm are simulated as described under “Validation.” Simulation Method—The system is simulated using an approach that formally treats biochemical reactants as sums of distinct species formed by different hydrogen and metal ion binding states (4Vinnakota K. Kemp M.L. Kushmerick M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1264-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Alberty R.A. Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). The method accounts for pH and ionic dependence on enzyme kinetics and apparent equilibrium and thermodynamic driving forces for biochemical reactions. Analytical expressions for enzyme and transporter fluxes are derived based on their detailed kinetic mechanisms. Enzyme kinetics parameters, such as Michaelis-Menten constants, inhibition constants, and activation constants, are mined from a variety of sources. The detailed model equations are developed in the supplemental materials. Parameterization Approach—All enzyme and transporter activities are treated as adjustable parameters, with values estimated based on comparison with experimental data. In total, 35 parameter values are estimated. This large number of parameters requires a large amount of relevant data for effective identification. Here, we make use of independent data sets published by LaNoue et al. (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bose et al. (25Bose S. French S. Evans F.J. Joubert F. Balaban R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) data were measured from isolated rat heart mitochondria in both resting state (state 2) and the active state (state 3), with pyruvate and malate or only pyruvate as substrates. The Bose et al. (25Bose S. French S. Evans F.J. Joubert F. Balaban R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39155-39165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) data were measured from isolated pig heart mitochondria in state 2 and state 3, with glutamate and malate as substrates. The different substrates and protocols used in these experiments ensure that the model is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The total experimental data used for model identification provide 25 data curves, including 15 time courses (measure of a variable as a function of time) and 10 steady-state data sets (measure of one steady-state variable as a function of another). Based on these 25 data curves, a reasonable identification of the model is possible. Parameter values are estimated based on a Monte Carlo algorithm used to minimize the difference between model simulations and experimental data. Experiments 1 and 2: LaNoue et al. (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) State-2 and State-3 Time Courses with Pyruvate and Malate as Substrates—LaNoue et al. (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used rapid quenching to measure the time courses of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates following the addition of malate and/or pyruvate to suspensions of isolated rat cardiac mitochondria (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were reported for state 2 (with no ADP available for ATP synthesis; experiments 1 and 3) and for state 3 (with active ATP synthesis; experiments 2 and 4). State 3 was maintained in experiments 2 and 4 by including glucose and hexokinase in the buffer medium. To simulate these experiments, our mitochondrial model is initially incubated with no carbon substrate, to generate a fully oxidized initial state. At time t = 0, pyruvate and malate or only pyruvate are added to the buffer, and the system is simulated for 500 or 250 s for comparison with the data of LaNoue et al. (23LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A–E, illustrates the state-2 time courses of pyruvate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, following the addition of 2 mm pyruvate and 5 mm malate to a suspension containing 3.4 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml of buffer. In addition, the buffer initially contains 20 mm inorganic phosphate, 5 mm magnesium ion, and 150 mm potassium ion at pH 7.2. Model simulations of the experiments are illustrated as solid lines in Fig. 2. For most reactants, the total concentration (in buffer plus mitochondria) in the suspension is provided. For citrate, time courses of both total and extramitochondrial concentrations are provided. In this experiment, pyruvate is consumed at a steady rate, and its overall concentration decreases linearly. As substrates are consumed, other intermediates build up in the system.

Here we studied the processing of the toxins. Dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol induced auto-cleavage of purified native toxin A and toxin B into ∼250/210- and ∼63-kDa fragments. The 63-kDa fragment was identified by mass spectrometric analysis as the N-terminal glucosyltransferase domain. This cleavage was blocked by N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide. Exchange of cysteine 698, histidine 653, or aspartate 587 of toxin B prevented cleavage of full-length recombinant toxin B and of an N-terminal fragment covering residues 1–955 and inhibited cytotoxicity of full-length toxin B. Dithiothreitol synergistically increased the effect of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, which has been reported to facilitate auto-cleavage of toxin B (Reineke, J., Tenzer, S., Rupnik, M., Koschinski, A., Hasselmayer, O., Schrattenholz, A., Schild, H., and Von Eichel-Streiber, C. (2007) Nature 446, 415–419). N-Ethylmaleimide blocked auto-cleavage induced by the addition of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, suggesting that cysteine residues are essential for the processing of clostridial glucosylating toxins.

Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis occurring in the course of antibiotic treatment. Nosocomial infections with the pathogen are a dramatically increasing medical problem. Recently, endemic outbreaks of infections with a hypervirulent C. difficile strain have been reported that caused cumulative death rates of up to 16% (1McDonald L.C. Killgore G.E. Thompson A.

Assoc. J. 2005; 173: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Responsible for the diseases induced by C. difficile are two exotoxins, toxin A and B, that are produced by the pathogen (3Rifkin G.D. Fekety F.R. Silva J. Sack R.B. Lancet. 1977; II: 1103-1106Abstract Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Bartlett J.G. Onderdonk A.B. Cisneros R.L. Kasper D.L. J. Infect.

The toxins have masses of 269 to 308 kDa and are suggested to be structured in a tripartite manner (6Just I. Gerhard R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The N terminus has glucosyltransferase activity and represents the biologically active part of the protein (8Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, upper panel). The crystal structure of the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B was solved recently and revealed a folding typical for GT-A family glycosyltransferases (9Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Jank T. Giesemann T. Aktories K. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 15R-22RCrossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The middle part of the toxins has been suggested to be involved in translocation of the toxins into the cytosol. At the C terminus the toxin consists of polypeptide repeats that appear to be involved in receptor binding (11Von Eichel-Streiber C. Sauerborn M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Dove C.H. Wang S.Z. Price S.B. Phelps C.J. Lyerly D.M. Wilkins T.D. Johnson J.L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 480-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that this part of toxin A has a β-solenoid-like structure that binds to carbohydrate structures (13Greco A. Ho J.G. Lin S.J. Palcic M.M. Rupnik M. Ng K.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 460-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Ho J.G. Greco A. Rupnik M. Ng K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18373-18378Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the precise nature of the membrane receptors is not known at present. After binding of the toxins to their specific receptors, the toxin-receptor complex is endocytosed and ends up in the early endosomes. The acidic compartment causes conformational changes of the toxin molecules and allows insertion into vesicle membrane, a process that is accompanied by pore formation (15Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Then the toxin is translocated into the cytosol, where Rho GTPases, the eukaryotic targets of the toxins, are glucosylated and inactivated. How this translocation occurs is not well understood. Apparently, only the N-terminal catalytic domain is able to reach the cytosol, whereas the rest of the molecule remains in the vesicle membrane (16Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44535-44541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H. Soling H.D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the toxin has to be processed by proteolytic cleavage. Recently it was reported that the toxin is auto-catalytically activated by a protease activity harbored to the C-terminal side of the translocation domain (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, upper panel). The authors reported that myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) 3The abbreviations used are:InsP6myo-inositol hexakisphosphateDTTdithiothreitolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. 3The abbreviations used are:InsP6myo-inositol hexakisphosphateDTTdithiothreitolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. is involved in the processing of the toxin. Because the aspartate protease inhibitor 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxypropane) blocked the processing of toxin B and labeled a motif, which is also found in aspartate proteases, it has been suggested that an inherent aspartate protease is responsible for the auto-catalytic process. We present evidence that not or not only an aspartate protease domain but rather a cysteine protease domain, which is located downstream of the glucosyltransferase domain (Fig. 1, upper panel), is required for processing of the toxins. myo-inositol hexakisphosphate dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. myo-inositol hexakisphosphate dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.

Cloning of Toxin B Fragment CDB1–955—Primers CDB-1-BamHI-sense and CDB-955-NotI-antisense (stop) were used accordingly to amplify a fragment of C. difficile toxin B (amino acid 1–955) with flanking BamHI and NotI restriction sites from genomic DNA of C. difficile VPI 10463 by PCR with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany).

Following PCR, the methylated DNA was digested by the addition of 1 μl of DpnI (10 units/μl) for 1 h at 37°Cand transformed into chemical competent E. coli TG1 cells. Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard procedures and sequenced with the ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and an ABI 310 cycle sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm gene sequences. Expression and Purification of Native and Recombinant Proteins—Native toxins A and B from C. difficile VPI 10463 were purified as described (20Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. ed. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 159-168Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Toxin A was additionally purified by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography (21Krivan H.C. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins holotoxin B (ToxB rec wt) and holotoxin B mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described (16Pfeifer G.

Glutathione S-transferase was cleaved off by thrombin followed by inactivation of thrombin utilizing benzamidine beads. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant Rac1 was expressed and purified as described (22Pop M. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35840-35848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Vitro Cleavage Assay—Cleavage assays were performed in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at a final volume of 20 μl with 3 μgof toxin A (for Coomassie staining) and 1 μg of toxin B (for Western blotting), respectively. The reactions were initiated by addition of DTT, β-mercaptoethanol, or InsP6 at indicated final concentrations. Following incubation for indicated times (at room temperature or at 37 °C as indicated), the reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer, and the probes were separated by SDS-PAGE (3–12% gradient gel). MALDI-TOF Analysis—3 μg of native toxin A isolated from culture supernatant of C. difficile strain VPI 10463 were treated with 2 mm DTT at 37 °C overnight. The resulting fragments were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. The gel fragment was discolored for 2 h at 50°Cin stripping buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3:acetonitrile (4:6), pH 7.8). Dried gel fragments were treated with 2 μl of trypsin (1 μg/μl) in 18 μl of trypsin digestion buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, 1% acetonitrile, pH 7.8) for 3 h at 37 °C. The obtained peptide solution was mixed with a saturated matrix solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid according to the dried droplet method for matrix crystallization, resulting in a fine granular matrix layer. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ, 337 nm). The mass spectra were recorded in the reflector-positive mode in combination with delayed extraction. For calibration an external two-point calibration with 5 pmol of a fragment of human adrenocorticotropic hormone (amino acids 18–39, (M+H)+ 2,465.20 Da) and 5 pmol of human angiotensin II ((M+H)+ 1,046.54 Da) was used. The data base program ProFound (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) was used for protein identification and assignment of the measured peptides (peptide mapping). The measured peptides were compared with peptides of the theoretically trypsin-digested protein fragments. Western Blotting—The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). The catalytic domain of toxin B was detected using a monoclonal anti-CDB1–546 at a dilution of 1:100,000 followed by the anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:5000; Biotrend, Cologne, Germany). The corresponding bands were detected using enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL). In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Toxin B Fragments— The in vitro transcription/translation was performed with TnT ® coupled reticulocyte lysate systems from Promega (Madison WI) using radioactive labeled [35S]l-methionine (specific activity, 37 TBq/mmol; Hartmann Analytic GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and DNA (pET28a constructs) purified with a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following 90 min of incubation at 30 °C, 10 μl of the lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried. The signals were visualized by autoradiography (phosphorimaging; GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Intoxication of HeLa and Swiss 3T3 Cells—The cells were seeded in 12-well dishes for microscopic studies or 10-cm dishes for Rac glucosylation assays and cultivated in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium. For intoxication the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was changed to fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml recombinant toxin B (ToxB rec wt) and toxin B point mutants (ToxB rec D587N/H653A/C698A) for 4–6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Pictures of Swiss 3T3 cells were taken with an AxioCam HRC camera and Axio Vision software (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). For the detection of the glucosylation status of Rac1 after intoxication, HeLa cells from one 10-cm dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off, and resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). After 2 h of shaking at 4 °C, the cell solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Bradford, and 20 μg of each cytoplasma extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibodies as indicated. Glucosylation Assay—2 μg of recombinant Rac1 were incubated with 5 ng of native toxin B or 50 ng of recombinant holo-toxin B and holotoxin B mutants, respectively, in the presence of 10 μm UDP-[14C]glucose in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 30 °C. The total volume was 20 μl. The labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. Inhibitor Assay with N-Ethylmaleimide and Iodoacetamide— For InsP6-activated cleavage, N-ethylmaleimide was added simultaneously at the indicated concentrations and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In the case of DTT-activated cleavage, toxin A (3 μg) was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.5 mm DTT. After the addition of 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide, 20 mm DTT were added either simultaneously or after 10 min of incubation with N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide at 37 °C, respectively. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. All of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Attempting to increase the stability of C. difficile toxin A, we observed that addition of 2 mm DTT did not increase the stability of the toxin but rather caused cleavage of the protein. Analysis of the resulting fragments, which were generated in the presence of 2 mm DTT by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, revealed that the toxin was split into the N-terminal catalytic domain of ∼60 kDa and a C-terminal part of ∼250 kDa (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Closer analysis of the concentration dependence of the effect of DTT showed that 0.01–0.1 mm DTT was necessary for cleavage of toxin A (Fig. 2B). β-Mercaptoethanol also caused cleavage of the toxin, but higher concentrations compared with DTT were necessary (Fig. 2C). The process of cleavage was rather slow with a very slight effect after 30 min, which increased with incubation of the toxin for several hours (Fig. 2D). Next we tested the effects of N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide (Fig. 2E). When N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide was added, DTT-induced cleavage of toxin A was blocked. Further addition of DTT could not restore the inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide. These findings are in line with the notion that cysteine residues are essential for cleavage. A similar effect of DTT was observed for the in vitro processing of toxin B. Here we used for detection of the catalytic fragment an anti-toxin B antibody. As shown in Fig. 2F, DTT caused cleavage of the toxin with release of the catalytic domain. The concentration dependence of DTT and the time course (Fig. 2G) of the cleavage reaction of toxin B were very similar to toxin A. It has been reported that toxin A and toxin B have sequence similarity with a part of the RTX toxin of Vibrio cholerae (23Sheahan K-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The region of similarity starts shortly after the catalytic domain of toxin B and covers at least residues 546–767 (Fig. 1, upper panel). Recently, this similar part of the RTX toxin was identified as a potential cysteine protease (23Sheahan K-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Among the identical amino acids in RTX and toxin B, cysteine 698, histidine 653, and aspartate 587 are conserved in RTX toxins and in all clostridial glucosylating toxins (Fig. 1, lower panel) resembling a putative catalytic triad of cysteine proteases. We changed these residues in toxin B and expressed the mutant proteins in E. coli. During purification, the recombinant wild-type toxin B was partially cleaved in a ∼210-kDa fragment and the catalytic domain (Fig. 3, A and B). By contrast, the C698A, H653A, and D587N mutants showed much less cleavage of the toxin, and the observed bands are consistent with normal breakdown of the purified toxin (Fig. 3, A and B). We also tested the glucosyltransferase activity of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 3C). All of the recombinant toxin proteins, including wild type and mutants, glucosylated Rac protein in vitro. Moreover, we tested the cytotoxicity of the recombinant toxins in cell culture. Although high concentrations were necessary, the recombinant wild-type toxin caused rounding up of cells like the native toxin B, which was purified from C. difficile (Fig. 3E). By contrast, the recombinant toxin mutants D587N, H653A, and C698A were without any cytotoxic effects. Accordingly, only native toxin B and recombinant wild-type toxin B caused glucosylation of Rac in intact cells, which was studied by means of an anti-Rac antibody (19Genth H. Huelsenbeck J. Hartmann B. Hofmann F. Just I. Gerhard R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3565-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which does not recognize glucosylated Rac protein (Fig. 3D). To gain more insights into the role of the putative cysteine protease domain of toxin B, we generated mutants of fragments of toxin B, covering residues 1–955 (Fig. 1) and expressed the protein by in vitro transcription and translation. We observed that a wild-type fragment of toxin B was always recovered as a cleaved product (with fragments of 63 and 47 kDa, according to a specific cleavage at position 543/544 (17Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H. Soling H.D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), whereas the mutant with change in His653 or Cys698 were expressed in full length (Fig. 4). Also the change of Asp587 to alanine largely increased the stability of the toxin fragment, although its stability was less than that of the other mutants (not shown). Therefore, we suggested that in wild-type fragment 1–955 of toxin B, processing within the reticulocyte lysate occurred immediately after production of the protein by auto-cleavage, whereas the mutant fragments were not cleaved, because the inherent protease activity was blocked. To corroborate this hypothesis two controls were made. First, we changed Cys595 in toxin B, which is not strictly conserved in all clostridial glucosylating toxins and also not present in RTX toxin. Like the wild-type fragment, this mutant was cleaved during in vitro expression. Second, we changed the putative autocatalytic cleavage site and studied the expression of the double mutant L543A/G544A in fragment 1–955 of toxin B. As shown in Fig. 4, this mutant was fully expressed in vitro. Recently it was reported that InsP6 is an essential cytosolic factor (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that facilitates cleavages of clostridial glucosylating toxins. We tested the effect of InsP6 and confirmed the increase in proteolytic processing of toxin B by this factor. The efficiency of InsP6 was much higher with toxin B than with toxin A. Cleavage facilitated by InsP6 was much more rapid than with DTT. However, DTT and InsP6 displayed synergistic effects (Fig. 5, A and B). Whereas after short term incubation (30 min) in the presence of 1 μm InsP6 only minor cleavage of toxin B was observed, DTT (2 mm) largely increased cleavage at corresponding InsP6 concentrations (Fig. 5B). When we studied the processing of toxin B in the presence of InsP6 and DTT, we observed a slightly different migration behavior of the corresponding cleavage products. We asked whether the cleavage caused by InsP6 may be independent of the effects induced by DTT. To clarify this, we used N-ethylmaleimide. As shown in Fig. 5B and C, co-treatment of toxin B with N-ethylmaleimide blocked the processing induced by InsP6. This finding indicates that InsP6-dependent processing of toxin B depends on cysteine residues. Recently it was shown that not the holotoxin of clostridial glucosylating cytotoxins but only the catalytic domain is translocated into the cytosol of target cells, indicating a processing of the toxins during toxin uptake (16Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44535-44541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H. Soling H.D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently the auto-catalytic cleavage of toxin B has been proposed on the basis of a putative inherent aspartate protease activity, which is increased in the presence of InsP6 (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We observed that DTT induced cleavage of toxin A and B. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis (see supplemental material) revealed that cleavage occurred at the N-terminal region of the toxins where the toxin is suggested to be processed (16Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44535-44541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H. Soling H.D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Toxin cleavage was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, indicating the essential role of cysteine residues. These findings are in line with a recent report showing that clostridial glucosylating toxins share sequence similarity with the auto-catalytic cysteine protease domain of RTX toxin from V. cholerae (23Sheahan K-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). According to this report, clostridial glucosylating toxins belong to a new family of cysteine proteases. Therefore, we suggest that the active center of the cysteine protease domain is blocked by a disulfide bridge. DTT causes activation of the cysteine protease activity. Accordingly, also β-mercaptoethanol facilitated the cleavage, and N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide blocked the processing of the toxins. For RTX toxin from V. cholerae, a catalytic dyad has been suggested (23Sheahan K-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cysteine and histidine residues have been identified in RTX toxin, which correspond with cysteine 698 and histidine 653 in toxin B. Interestingly, it has been shown earlier that these residues are important for the activity of toxin B (24Barroso L.A. Moncrief J.S. Lyerly D.M. Wilkins T.D. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 16: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, we assume that aspartate 587 of toxin B is the third residue of a catalytic triad. We expressed wild-type toxin B and mutants of the putative protease catalytic triad in E. coli and observed cleavage of the wild-type toxin and significantly reduced cleavage of the mutants. Although the mutant toxin B proteins were able to glucosylate Rac in vitro, indicating intact expression of the glucosyltransferase domain, they were not able to intoxicate cells. These observations are in line with the hypothesis that a cysteine protease catalytic triad is involved in processing of the toxin and auto-cleavage is essential for toxin activity. How can these results fit into the model of the recently proposed aspartate protease-dependent auto-cleavage (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)? The putative aspartate protease domain was identified by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxypropane), which is an aspartate protease inhibitor known to bind covalently to the active site. Thus, the hypothesis of the aspartate protease is mainly based on the presence of a short DXG motif observed in many aspartate proteases. Although Reineke et al. (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have shown that aspartate 1665 is a residue important for toxin activity, their data do not necessarily suggest that aspartate 1665 is the catalytic residue for processing of toxins downstream of the glucosyltransferase domain. Indeed, this residue is located >1000 amino acids away from the processing site and to the C-terminal side of the translocation domain (Fig. 1), suggesting that the DXG motif is not translocated but remains within the endosome. By contrast, the cysteine protease domain identified in this work is located adjacent to the processing site to the N-terminal side of the translocation region, indicating that it would be transferred to the cytosol along with the glycosyltransferase domain and thereby accesses intracellular InsP6. Consistent with this hypothesis, our recombinant protein, comprising only the portion of toxin B to the N-terminal side of the translocation domain (amino acids 1–955), is processed after in vitro translation to the 63-kDa glycosyltransferase domain dependent upon histidine 653, cysteine 698, and aspartate 587. Moreover, we show that the change of the amino acids leucine 543/glycine 544 at the proposed cleavage site to alanine prevents cleavage of the toxin fragment. These findings show that leucine 543 is the relevant cleavage site in the toxin fragment and strongly indicate that contamination by nonspecific proteases is not responsible for the observed processing. Further evidence against the aspartic protease model is that the DXG motif is not present in the α-toxin of Clostridium novyi, even though α-toxin undergoes auto-cleavage by the addition of InsP6 similar to other clostridial toxins (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By contrast, α-toxin of C. novyi shares identical amino acid residues in the putative cysteine protease domain, indicating a common mechanism for cleavage of all large clostridial toxins. Therefore, we would like to offer the following explanations for these discrepancies. First, identification of the aspartate protease activity may not be correct, and the aspartate protease inhibitor, which is not totally specific, has additional effects on the toxin that disrupt function of the cysteine protease. Alternatively, protease activity of the toxins could depend on two catalytic domains. It is well known that some proteases have more than one catalytic domain in the same translation product. Examples are the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (25Wei L. henc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and carboxypeptidase D (26Novikova E.G. Eng F.J. Yan L. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28887-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which are metalloproteases. Other proteases form a catalytic active site by dimerization. Recently a cysteine protease from hepatitis C virus NS2-3 has been described, which has two protease subdomains, and the proteolytically active center is formed by dimerization of the polypeptides (27Lorenz I.C. Marcotrigiano J. Dentzer T.G. Rice C.M. Nature. 2006; 442: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cysteine protease from hepatitis C virus exhibits sequence similarity with toxin B and RTX cysteine proteases (23Sheahan K-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further examples are tandem proteases like polyserases 1–3, which are serine proteases with several distinct protease domains. However, in all these cases, the same family type of proteases is combined (e.g. a cysteine protease domain dimerizes in the case of NS2-3 and serine proteases form polyserases). To our knowledge a combination of different types of proteases domains in one molecule has not been reported. We confirmed that InsP6 is a potent activator of toxin B cleavage (18Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature. 2007; 446: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). What is the function of InsP6? InsP6 is a highly charged molecule and appears to have diverse functions. It might be involved in stabilization of a toxin protein conformation, which is essential for protease activity and/or proper cleavage. Many structural effects of InsP6 have been reported. Recently InsP6 was shown to be essential for assembly for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Gag molecules (28Datta S.A. Zhao Z. Clark P.K. Tarasov S. Alexandratos J.N. Campbell S.J. Kvaratskhelia M. Lebowitz J. Rein A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We show that the effect of InsP6 is synergistically enhanced by DTT. Even more important, we found that the effect of InsP6 is blocked by N-ethylmaleimide treatment, showing that a cysteine residue is absolutely essential for auto-cleavage activity. This is again in line with the hypothesis that the cysteine protease is essential for cleavage. We thank Otilia Wunderlich for excellent technical assistance.

We show that the blind (bl) mutant of Petunia hybrida3 and the fistulata (fis) mutant of Antirrhinum majus4,5, which have similar homeotic phenotypes, are recessive alleles of two homologous miRNA-encoding genes. The BL and FIS genes control the spatial restriction of homeotic class C genes6,7 to the inner floral whorls, but their ubiquitous early floral expression patterns are in contradiction with a potential role in patterning C gene expression. We provide genetic evidence for the unexpected function of the MIRFIS and MIRBL genes in the center of the flower and propose a dynamic mechanism underlying their regulatory role. Notably, Arabidopsis thaliana, a more distantly related species, also contains this miRNA module but does not seem to use it to confine early C gene expression to the center of the flower."

Modification of proteins by SUMO is a dynamic and reversible process. The SUMO cycle begins when SUMO precursors are processed to remove short C-terminal extensions, thereby uncapping the C-terminal Gly-Gly motif that is essential for conjugation. SUMO ligases conjugate the protein, via its C-terminal carboxylate, to the side-chain lysine of target proteins to generate an isopeptide linkage. Eventually, SUMO is removed intact from its substrate SUMOylated proteins, and so the SUMOylation/deSUMOylation cycle regulates SUMO function. A group of proteases known as SENPs are involved in both the maturation of SUMO precursors (endopeptidase cleavage) and deconjugation of the targets (isopeptidase cleavage) (4Melchior F. Schergaut M.

Not all SENPs are SUMO-specific, indeed SENP8 is not a SUMO protease but functions on another small ubiquitin-related protein known as Nedd8 (6Gan-Erdene T. Nagamalleswari K. Yin L. Wu K. Pan Z.Q.

The defining characteristic of SENPs is their predicted conserved molecular scaffold, defined as members of peptidase clan CE (8Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), conserved catalytic mechanism, and their reported activity on SUMO or Nedd8 conjugated proteins (or the respective precursors). Humans contain seven SENPs (SENPs -1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, and -8), and several of these have been characterized as SUMO (or Nedd8) endopeptidases or isopeptidases. However, there exists almost no information on SENP6 and -7, and there is considerable diversity in the literature regarding the specificity of individual SENPs for distinct SUMOs. In the effort to define the relative selectivities within the family, we have expressed and purified the catalytic domains corresponding to human SENP1, -2, and -5, -6, -7, and -8 and systematically analyzed their endopeptidase and isopeptidase activity on SUMO -1, -2, and -3 and Nedd8. This study also presents for the first time a fluorogenic assay based on simple peptides developed for SENPs that allow us to determine the influence of the SUMO targets on SENP activity and activation. Plasmid Constructs—Catalytic domains of SENP2, SENP7, and SENP8 were amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library, and the catalytic domains of SENP1, SENP3, SENP5, and SENP6 were amplified from a human keratinocyte library. The PCR products were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen) engineered to contain an N-terminal His tag. The plasmids expressing SUMO precursor proteins His-tagged at the C terminus were generated using NcoI-XhoI restriction sites in pET28a. The NcoI restriction site incorporated a change from Ser at position 2 to Ala in SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 proteins, but SUMO-2 already contains Ala at this position. Because of some inconsistency in the literature regarding SUMO nomenclature (9Xu Z. Au S.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Reverter D. Lima C.D.

C-terminally truncated SUMO constructs were generated from full-length constructs and inserted into the pET28a vector in-frame with an N-terminal His tag. The cDNA coding for human RanGAP1ΔN (amino acids 418–588) was amplified by PCR from human fetal brain library and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 in-frame with an N-terminal FLAG sequence. A cDNA coding for Ubc-9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme was obtained by PCR from a human fetal brain library and inserted into pGEX-2T vector (GE Healthcare). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.

Production of SUMO proteins and Nedd8 was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Expression of SENPs was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h (for the expression of catalytic domains of SENP1, SENP2, SENP5, and SENP8) or at 25 °C for 5 h when expressing SENP6 and SENP7 catalytic domains.

Protein purity was examined by SDS-PAGE, and concentrations of the purified proteins were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm based on the molar absorption coefficients determined from the Edelhoch relationship (13Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Protein Purification—HEK293A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. The cDNA constructs FLAG-RanGAP1ΔN was used to transfect HEK293A cells using GeneJuice (Novagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. 36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed on ice in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with the protease inhibitors 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (100 μm) and E-64 (50 μm) (14Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. 1989: 83-102Google Scholar). FLAG-RanGAP1ΔN was absorbed to anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, and beads were washed five times in Tris-buffered saline and eluted with two bead volumes of 150 μg/ml 3XFLAG peptide (Sigma). In Vitro SUMOylation—To generate mature SUMO proteins ending with a Gly-Gly motif, the corresponding precursor proteins were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT with SENP1 enzyme for 2 h at 37 °C. Uncleaved precursor, cleaved C-terminal extension, and enzyme all contain His tags and were thus removed from the digest mixture using Ni-NTA-agarose. The remaining supernatant contained mature SUMO proteins used for in vitro SUMOylation assays. In vitro SUMOylation reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μl of GST-Ubc9 at 50 μg/ml (SUMO-conjugating enzyme), 40 μl of RanGAP1ΔN, 10 μl of the respective mature SUMO at 50 μg/ml, 10 μl of 20 mm ATP, and 3 μl of Sae1/Sae2 (SUMO-activating enzyme; Boston Biochem) (15Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). After 2 h at 37 °C the SUMOylation mixture was depleted of Ubc-9 enzyme by using glutathione-agarose beads. The remaining supernatant (150 μl) was used as a source of SUMOylated RanGAP1ΔN. SENP Endopeptidase and Isopeptidase Assays—We routinely used an ammediol/HCl, 8–18% SDS-PAGE linear gradient gel system for protein analysis (16Bury A. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). But in the case of pro-SUMO and pro-Nedd8 processing, we found that Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide 15% uniform gels gave better separation (17Laemmli U.K. Quittner S.F. Virology. 1974; 62: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To measure the ability of SENPs to cleave SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, or Nedd8 precursors, substrate (5 μm) was incubated with purified recombinant enzymes at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and the reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to Laemmli SDS-PAGE (15% gel) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The fraction of remaining precursor protein was calculated from the densitometric intensity of bands, and this was plotted against enzyme concentration to calculate the concentration of enzyme required to decrease 50% of precursor (EC50). To monitor isopeptidase activity of SENPs, 5 μl of SUMOylated RanGap1ΔN was incubated with various concentrations of enzyme in total 10-μl reactions for 1 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by Western blotting. The removal of SUMO from RanGAP1ΔN was determined by M2 primary antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated mouse secondary antibody and Super Signal detection (Pierce). For quantification, nonsaturated chemiluminescence signal was captured directly from the membrane by a CDD camera using ChemImager 4000 software (Alpha Innotech), or by quantitative densitometry through scanning bands on films, and EC50-calculated. The values are either the average of three experiments ± S.D. SENP Activity on Peptide Substrates—Synthetic tetrapeptide substrates corresponding to the cleavage site in the natural SUMO and Nedd8 protein substrates were synthesized as follows. Based on the results from scanning a combinatorial substrate library, 4M. Drag, J. Mikolajczyk, K. Menon, Z. Huang, and G. S. Salvesen, submitted for publication. we used Ac-QTGG-AFC for SENP1, -2, and -5 and Ac-LRGG-AFC for SENP -6, -7, and -8. The synthesis of these substrates will be described elsewhere. 4M. Drag, J. Mikolajczyk, K. Menon, Z. Huang, and G. S. Salvesen, submitted for publication. Activity of recombinant SENPs was assayed in low salt buffer (Tris buffer): 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT and in sodium citrate buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.8 m sodium citrate, 5 mm DTT). Standard enzyme assay studies (100-μl reaction) were performed at 37 °C in the indicated buffer conditions, 100 μm substrate concentration, and enzyme concentrations between 0.5 and 6 μm. Release of fluorophore was monitored continuously using an f-max Molecular Devices microplate spectrofluorometer. To determine the catalytic efficiency of enzyme, the initial velocities (vi) were measured as a function of substrate [S0]. Eight different substrate concentrations ranging from 20 to 1.2 μm were used. When [S0] << Km, the plot of V versus [S0] yields a straight line with slope representing Vmax/Km. The kcat/Km values were calculated using Equation 1. kcat/Km=slope/[E](Eq. 1) Enzyme concentrations [E] were calculated as described above. Effect of pH and Salt on SENP Activity—The following buffer salts at 50 mm concentration were used: MES for the pH range 6.0–6.5; PIPES for the pH range pH 6.5–7.0; HEPES for the pH range pH 7.0–8.0; Tris for the pH range pH 7.5–8.5; Bistris propane for the pH range pH 8.5–9.0; CHES for the pH range pH 9.0–10.0; and CAPS at pH 11. The reactions also contained 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT. To investigate the effect of NaCl or Na2citrate on SENP activity, reaction solutions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, and the indicated amount of salt. Expression of Recombinant Enzymes—Our engineered limits for the catalytic domains of SENP1, SENP2, and SENP5 were based on the previously published expression of these proteins in E. coli (10Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure. 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Shen L. Dong C. Liu H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 26: 4489-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with slight modifications (see Fig. 1A). The length of SENP3, SENP6, and SENP7 catalytic domains (Fig. 1A) was selected based on a secondary structure prediction using Jpred (19Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 1999; 34: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), following alignment to the SENP2 catalytic domain, which represents one of the best characterized members of the family from a structural perspective (10Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure. 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Reverter D. Lima C.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SENP8 does not have an N-terminal extension, and thus we encoded the full-length protein. The domains were expressed in E. coli as N-terminal His-tagged proteins and purified using Ni-NTA-agarose. Recombinant proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE with sizes corresponding to the predicted molecular weight (Fig. 1B). SENP1, -2, and -8 yielded about 10–20 mg of protein per liter of E. coli culture, and purified material was substantially homogeneous. SENP -5, -6, and -7 were expressed at lower yield, about 0.5–1 mg per liter of E. coli culture, and the lower yield resulted in some E. coli proteins contaminating the final preparations of SENP6 and -7 (Fig. 1B). The initial SENP3 construct (353TPSR) and SENP5 construct (536DFSN) yielded insoluble proteins, but additional truncation of the N termini produced a soluble recombinant SENP5 (Fig. 1). However, similar truncation for SENP3 resulted in accumulation of an insoluble protein, and we were thus unable to further characterize SENP3. All soluble recombinant SENPs used in this study elute as uniform peaks with the expected monomeric size in gel filtration, indicating that the chosen constructs are correctly folded (data not shown). Endopeptidase Versus Isopeptidase Activity—SENPs have two types of activity. They can process the precursors of SUMOs by removing C-terminal extensions, described here as endopeptidase activity. In addition they can deconjugate SUMO attached to target proteins, described here as isopeptidase activity. SENP1, -2, -3, -5, and -6 have each been previously demonstrated to possess endopeptidase activity on at least one of the human SUMO precursors (18Di Bacco A. Ouyang J. Lee H.Y. Catic A. Ploegh H.

O'Hare P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 692-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and on this basis we can predict that pro-SUMO is a substrate for SENP7, although this had not been demonstrated previously. We determined the EC50 of each SENP in terms of its endopeptidase and isopeptidase activities by examining the concentration dependence of enzyme at a fixed substrate concentration. We used pro-SUMOs as endopeptidase substrates and the in vitro SUMOylated RanGAP1ΔN as an isopeptidase substrate. By comparing the efficiency of SENPs on the distinct substrates, we were able to demonstrate substantial differences in specificity within the family (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1). SENP1 stood out as by far the most efficient endopeptidase of the family, and SENP2 and -5 had very similar but far less endopeptidase activity. In contrast, SENP2 and -5 were almost as efficient isopeptidases as SENP1. SENP6 and -7 were almost without endopeptidase activity. They also had low isopeptidase activity, although this was higher than their endopeptidase activity (compare supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Interestingly, pro-SUMO-3 was an extremely bad endopeptidase substrate but was deconjugated as efficiently as SUMO-2 and was better than SUMO-1 for all SENPs (Fig. 2). As expected, SENP8 showed no activity on any pro-SUMOs, but excellent cleavage of pro-Nedd8 (supplemental Table 1). The sequences of mature SUMO-2 and -3 are 96% identical but with totally different extensions (Fig. 3A), leading to the possibility that the marked difference in the activity of SENP2, -5, -6, and -7 for pro-SUMO-2 over pro-SUMO-3 may be directed mainly by the sequence variation in the C-terminal tails. Indeed, it had been illustrated for SENP1 and SENP2 that the efficiency of pro-SUMO cleavage may depend on the sequences corresponding to these regions (9Xu Z. Au S.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure. 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We tested the importance of the tails by swapping regions between pro-SUMO-2 and pro-SUMO-3 to create SUMO-3 with the SUMO-2 tail and designated this hybrid pro-SUMO-3/2. In each SENP studied, the pro-SUMO-3/2 hybrid was a better substrate than pro-SUMO-3 (see Fig. 3B for examples), importantly almost recapitulating the activity on the preferred substrate pro-SUMO-2 (supplemental Table 1). This result strongly indicates that, although SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 share a high degree of identity, endopeptidase cleavage studies using either one should be extended with caution to the other. We conclude that the C-terminal tails play a pivotal role in defining endopeptidase specificity of SENPs in the discrimination of pro-SUMO-2 and pro-SUMO-3. Activity of SENPs on Short Synthetic Substrates—Until this study, all published measurements and characterizations of SENP activity had been defined using full-length SUMO proteins. However, there is no a priori reason to expect that short synthetic reporter substrates, commonly used to define other protease families, could not be used with SENPs. Despite extensive interactions between SUMO and SENPs, the catalytic apparatus is arranged in a similar manner to proteases from other families that are very active on short substrates, and the structures of SENP1, -2, and -8, as well as the structure of the yeast homolog Ulp1, have defined active site clefts (10Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure. 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Shen L. Dong C. Liu H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Biochem.

Biol. 2005; 345: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed peptidyl substrates to define the relative contribution of the active site interactions and the extended (often called exosite) interactions, between substrate and enzyme. Importantly, the use of tetra-peptide fluorogenic substrates allows us to define critical catalytic properties of the enzymes. We designed the substrates based on the last four residues of SUMOs and Nedd8, with an AFC fluorogenic reporter replacing the C-terminal tails (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this way we were able to assay enzyme activity of SENP1 and -2 on Ac-QTGG-AFC, and SENP8 on Ac-LRGG-AFC. Using the same buffer conditions, no measurable activity was detected for SENP5, -6, and -7 on either of the substrates. To determine the optimal conditions in which SENPs exhibit the highest level of amidolytic activity, a series of assays was conducted over a range of pH values and salt concentrations (Fig. 4). The activity of SENP1, -2, and -8 rose steadily from pH 6.0 reaching a maximum at about pH 8.5, after which there was a gradual decrease (Fig. 4A). The midpoint of the ascending limb was around pH 8, which is consistent with ionization of the catalytic His-Cys dyad in the active site, typical of other cysteine proteases (29Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, 1985: 155-174Google Scholar). Elevated concentrations of the Hofmeister-effect salt Na2citrate had a marked effect on activity of SENP1 and SENP2 (Fig. 4C), much more than could be accounted for by simple ionic issues, as evidenced by the minimal effect of NaCl (Fig. 4B). Substrate-induced Activation of SUMO-cleaving SENPs—The observation that a Hofmeister-effect salt can enhance the activity of SENPs has several possible explanations, one of which is that the active site of the enzyme is not in an optimal orientation for catalysis. For example, the Hofmeister-effect salts can order the active site, as demonstrated for the protease prostate-specific antigen (30Huang X. Knoell C.T. Frey G. Hazegh-Azam M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Hedstrom L. Abeles R.H. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11734-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), possibly because of general desolvation effect on the protein. Thus, Na2citrate may optimize loops surrounding the active site and promote catalysis in a manner similar to the binding of the natural SUMO substrates. Crystal structures of SENP1 (11Shen L. Dong C. Liu H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and SENP2 (10Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure. 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with or without SUMO substrates bound indicate that the enzymes undergo small structural rearrangements upon substrate binding. The availability of synthetic substrates enabled us to explore whether these conformational changes had any measurable impact on enzyme activity. Mature SUMO did not enhance enzyme activity, which is probably because of spatial clashes between the C terminus of SUMO and the synthetic substrate that would overlap in the enzyme active site. To avoid this steric clash, yet retain the basic fold of SUMO, we deleted six amino acids from the C terminus of mature SUMO-1, 2, and -3 (we call the respective derivatives SUMO-ΔC to signify this deletion) to accommodate the tetrapeptide substrate at the active site (Fig. 5, A and B). Activity of all SENPs was greatly enhanced by at least one of the truncated SUMOs (Fig. 5C and supplemental Table 3). Activity of SENPs was assayed at various molar ratios of truncated SUMO, and the lowest amount that gave maximal enzyme activity was considered optimal. We used the ratio (SENP:SUMO-ΔC) 1:5 for SENP1 and -2 and 1:10 for SENP5, -6, and -7. SENP1 and SENP5 did not distinguish between SUMOs, and enzyme activity was induced almost equally by truncated SUMO-1–3 (Fig. 5C). SENP2, -6, and -7, on the other hand, showed strong preferences toward SUMO-2ΔC and SUMO-3ΔC (Fig. 5C). Experiments investigating the effect of SUMO-ΔC on enzyme activity were carried out at low ionic strength (20 mm NaCl). Increasing the salt concentration decreased the effect of truncated SUMO (data not shown), indicating that polar interactions revealed in crystal structures are important in SUMO binding and SUMO-induced activation. In contrast to the SUMO-specific SENPs, the Nedd8-specific SENP8 was minimally activated by Na2citrate, and truncated Nedd8 had no effect (Fig. 5C). In this study we report the comparison of members of the human SENP family in terms of their endopeptidase and isopeptidase specificity. We present for the first time their activity on small synthetic substrates, which allowed us to discover substrate-induced activation for some members of the family, as well as a definition of their optimal biochemical parameters for activity. There are two main caveats to our study. First, we lack data on SENP3 because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient soluble material from expression in E. coli. SENP4 was not included in our study because, although it is annotated in some data bases, we could find no ESTs in Gen/EMBL encoding the protein, suggesting it is likely a pseudogene. Second, we expressed only the C-terminal catalytic domains and not full-length proteins, with the exception of the deNEDDylating enzyme SENP8, which does not contain an N-terminal extension. The N-terminal regions of SENPs presumably influence the biological properties of the enzymes in vivo and may even influence their inherent biochemical properties as enzymes. However, there is currently no way to predict how they"

We have utilized both orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical Family A GPCR, to probe possible E2 loop binding dynamics. We developed a homology model based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and predicted novel cysteine substitutions that should dramatically reduce E2 loop flexibility via disulfide bond formation and significantly inhibit the binding of both types of ligands. This prediction was validated experimentally using radioligand binding, dissociation kinetics, and cell-based functional assays. The results argue for a flexible gatekeeper role of the E2 loop in the binding of both allosteric and orthosteric GPCR ligands."

Here we show that the yeast ortholog of RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C1) Asc1 functions as the Gβ for Gpa2. As with other known Gβ proteins, Asc1 has a 7-WD domain structure, interacts directly with the Gα in a guanine nucleotide-dependent manner, and inhibits Gα guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In addition, Asc1 binds to the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1), and diminishes the production of cAMP in response to glucose stimulation. Thus, whereas Gpa2 promotes glucose signaling through elevated production of cAMP, Asc1 has opposing effects on these same processes.

Upon binding of agonist to the receptor, a conformational change in the Gα subunit promotes the release of GDP and binding to GTP. Guanine nucleotide exchange triggers Gβγ disassociation from the Gα subunit, after which both components are free to activate or inhibit downstream effectors. The Gα subunit eventually hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, resulting in re-association of the heterotrimer complex and termination of signaling (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The Gβγ complex functions on many levels to promote, and restrict, signaling at the plasma membrane. Most Gβγ complexes help to recruit Gα subunits to the plasma membrane and promote coupling of the G protein to the receptor. The Gβγ also functions as a guanine nucleotide disassociation inhibitor to prevent spontaneous exchange of GTP for GDP by the Gα. Finally, many Gβγ subunits regulate downstream effector enzymes. Gβγ subunits regulate a wide variety of effector enzymes including adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP to the second messenger cAMP (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev.

The first is the pheromone response pathway, which is among the best characterized stimulus-response pathways of any system. In this example, signaling is activated by secreted peptide pheromones. Cell surface pheromone receptors activate a G-protein heterotrimer, in which the Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18) is released and activates a downstream MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase cascade at the plasma membrane (6Dohlman H.G.

These signaling events cooperate to promote mating or fusion of haploid a and α cells to form the a/α diploid. A second G-protein signaling pathway mediates pseudohyphal differentiation in diploids and invasive growth in haploids. Both of these responses are mediated by changes in the nutrient status of the growth medium. In diploids, cells transition to pseudohyphal differentiation upon limitation of nitrogen (10Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar); whereas in haploids, the cells transition to invasive growth upon limitation of glucose (11Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13619-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) or other signals that cause an increase in cAMP (12Stanhill A. Schick N. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7529-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both differentiation behaviors are characterized by altered budding, formation of long branching filaments, as well as increased adherence and invasion of the substratum. Collectively, such filamentous growth may help to direct new cells to sites of improved growth conditions. The same cellular machinery is used for invasive growth in both haploids and diploids, and is minimally comprised of a cell surface receptor (Gpr1), a Gα protein (Gpa2), and the adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1). All of these proteins are required for glucose-induced cAMP signaling (13Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M.F. Colavizza D.

Cyr1 is also directly activated by the small G protein Ras2 (28Uno I. Mitsuzawa H. Matsumoto K. Tanaka K. Oshima T. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A second glucose-response pathway requires Ras2, but leads to activation of a MAP kinase cascade comprised of Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and Kss1 (30Mosch H.U. Kubler E. Krappmann S. Fink G.R. Braus G.H.

Based upon sequence and structural comparison of typical G protein subunits within the yeast genome, there appears to be only one canonical Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18). Early research revealed that Ste4 and Ste18 function exclusively in conjunction with Gpa1 in the pheromone-response pathway (32Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Two kelchrepeat proteins, Gpb1 and Gbp2 (also known as Krh1 and Krh2), were proposed to function as the Gβ subunits for Gpa2 (34Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, further investigation has shown that these proteins are not Gβ-mimics but instead function to inhibit signaling downstream of Gpa2 (21Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D.

Using bioinformatic, genomic, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches we have identified Asc1 as the Gβ for Gpa2, and demonstrate a critical role for Asc1 in the glucose signaling pathway mediated by adenylyl cyclase. Strains and Plasmids—Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of bacteria and yeast and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ his3Δ ura3Δ) and BY4741-derived gene deletion mutants (Invitrogen), and Σ1278-based invasive strain (MATa leu2Δ ura3Δ, from Joseph Heitman, Duke University) and Σ1278-derived gene deletion mutants. Yeast shuttle plasmids pRS315-ADH (CEN, ampR, LEU2, ADH1 promoter/terminator) and pRS316-ADH (CEN, ampR, URA3, ADH1 promoter/terminator) (38Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were modified by PCR amplification of the gene of interest and subcloned such that a FLAG (GATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAG) or Myc (GAACAAAAATTGATTTCTGAAGAAGATTTG) epitope could be added to the 5′ coding sequence of any gene with a SacI site engineered inframe with the open reading frame. Previously described yeast shuttle plasmids used in this study are pAD4M-GST (38Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and pAD4M-GPA2-GST (39Chasse S.A. Flanary P. Parnell S.C. Hao N. Cha J.Y. Siderovski D.P. Dohlman H.G.

Science. 1997; 275: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli expression plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of the ASC1 (also known as CPC2) and GPA2 coding regions and annealed into gapped ligation-independent cloning (LIC) vectors pLIC-HIS and/or pLIC-GST (from John Sondek, University of North Carolina). Purification of Proteins from Yeast—Transformed strains were grown to A600 nm ∼ 1.0, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in FLAG Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1% Triton-X100, protease inhibitor mixture pellets (Roche, 1 pellet/25 ml of buffer)). Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads 10 times, 30 s each, with cooling on ice for 1 min in between. Lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min to solubilize membrane proteins, and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 1 min and again for 30 min to remove insoluble matter. Protein content of the supernatant was determined by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), equalized, and mixed with 20 μl of M2 FLAG Affinity Resin (Sigma) equilibrated with FLAG Lysis Buffer. After 2 h of gentle rocking at 4 °C, the resin was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min. Resin was washed 4 times with 1.5 ml of FLAG Lysis Buffer and bound proteins were eluted with 75 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. For experiments comparing binding between GDP or GDP-AlF4− loaded Gα proteins, 10 μm GDP or 10 μm GDP with 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF, respectively, was added to the lysis and wash buffers. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with 9E10 anti-Myc (41Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), in conjunction with enhanced chemiluminescence detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Expression and Purification of Proteins from E. coli—pLIC-HIS-ASC1, pLIC-GST-ASC1, and pLIC-HIS-GPA2 were transformed into E. coli strain BL21. Overnight cultures grown at 37 °C from single colonies in Luria Broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin were diluted into fresh medium to A590 nm ∼ 0.1 at 37 °C. Once the cultures reached A590 nm ∼ 0.6 they were transferred to 25 °C and grown to A590 nm ∼ 0.9. Protein expression was induced by addition of 25 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 × g. Cells expressing GST fusion proteins were resuspended in GST Lysis Buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture pellets). Cells expressing His fusion proteins were resuspended in His Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 15 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture pellets) at 4 °C and the cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex-C5 Homogenizer (Avestin Inc.). 50 μg/ml of DNase I was added to the lysates and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. GST lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with GST Lysis Buffer; His lysates were mixed with nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in His Lysis Buffer. Lysates were incubated with beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then loaded into a chromatography column and washed with appropriate buffer until the flow through contained no protein as detectable by the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). GST fusion proteins were eluted with GST Lysis Buffer supplemented with 10 mm reduced glutathione, and then exchanged into Storage Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol); His fusion proteins were eluted with His Lysis Buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole and then exchanged into Storage Buffer. Elution and Storage Buffers for the purification of His-Asc1 included 25% glycerol, whereas all other buffers contained 5% glycerol. All buffers for the purification of Gpa2 included 10 μm GDP. Purified proteins were concentrated using a Vivaspin (Vivascience) concentrator. In Vitro Binding Assay—Purified His-Gpa2 (final concentration 200 nm) was reconstituted with 10-fold molar excess GST-Asc1 in 1.0 ml of Binding Buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP) with or without 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 (AlF4−) and gently mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of Glutathione-Sepharose 4 was equilibrated with Binding Buffer and then mixed with the protein samples for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min and washed 4 times with Binding Buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GST (from Joan Steitz, Yale University) or anti-His6 (Qiagen) antibodies. Invasive Growth Assay—5 μl of an overnight saturated culture of the indicated strains from the Σ1278 background were spotted onto a YPD plate and grown at 30 °C for 3 days. Total growth of strains was imaged, and then the plate was gently washed under a stream of water to remove non-invasive cells from the surface of the agar. The plates were allowed to dry briefly before re-imaging to document invasive growth. GTPγS Binding Assay—200 nm His-Gpa2 was preincubated alone or with either 200 nm or 1 μm His-Asc1 in BODIPY Buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 27 °C. Measurement of BODIPY FL-GTPγS (Molecular Probes, Inc.) binding to His-Gpa2 was determined as described previously (42Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I. Morris R.A. Gist Farquhar M.

Steady-state GTP Hydrolysis Assay—200 nm His-Gpa2 was preincubated alone or with 200 nm, 1 μm, or 4 μm His-Asc1 in Hydrolysis Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Lubrol) for 30 min. The rate of GTP hydrolysis was determined as described previously (43Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transcription Reporter Assay—Strains were transformed with the FRE-lacZ reporter plasmid, grown in selective SCD-LEU medium overnight, and then diluted to A600 nm = 0.2 in fresh medium and grown for an additional 20 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile water and once with MES Buffer (10 mm MES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA) and finally resuspended in MES Buffer and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with shaking. Cultures were diluted to equalize density, and 90 μl of cells were mixed with 10 μl of d- or l-glucose at 0–100 mm final concentration, and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (44Chasse S.A. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). cAMP Production Assay—cAMP was measured using a cAMP Biotrak EIA kit (GE Healthcare) as described previously (15Lorenz M.C. Pan X. Harashima T. Cardenas M.E. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. Heitman J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 609-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAP Kinase Phosphorylation Assay—Overnight cultures grown in YPD-rich medium were diluted to A600 nm = 0.2 in fresh YPD and grown for an additional 20 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile water and once with MES Buffer and finally resuspended in MES Buffer and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with shaking. After 2 h the cultures were treated with 100 mm d- or l-glucose and 750 μl of culture was collected at the indicated times by rapidly mixing with 750 μl of 2× trichloroacetic acid Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% trichloroacetic acid, 50 mm NH4OAc, 2 mm Na2EDTA) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein was extracted as described previously (45Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and quantified using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 50 μg of protein extracts was resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with p44/42 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) (46Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The 7-WD Repeat Protein Asc1 Interacts Directly with the Inactive Form of Gα Gpa2—Our objective in this study was to identify the Gβ protein for Gpa2. The crystal structures of the mammalian Gβγ subunits of transducin revealed that the Gβ protein folds into a seven-bladed propeller structure (β-propeller) based around 7-WD repeat motifs (47Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The WD repeat is a conserved domain, 40–60 amino acids in length that begins with glycine-histidine and ends with tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD). Because all previously identified Gβ subunits have the characteristic 7-WD domain structure, we began by searching for any gene product bearing this signature motif. We did not limit our search to proteins of unknown function, because WD repeat-containing proteins often have broad or even multiple functions, including roles in signal transduction, cell cycle control, mRNA splicing, and transcriptional repression (48Li D. Roberts R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In yeast alone, there are an estimated 104 proteins that contain WD repeats (49Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). By searching the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) data base (49Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar) we identified 21 proteins predicted to have either seven WD repeats, or in some cases six repeats with an additional segment large enough to contain a seventh (less-conserved) WD domain. We then considered which of the 21 candidate proteins could function in the manner of known Gβ proteins. In addition to their characteristic 7-WD structure, Gβ proteins (i) bind directly to Gα subunits; (ii) bind preferentially to the inactive GDP-bound form of the Gα protein; (iii) function as guanine nucleotide disassociation inhibitors; and, in most cases (iv) regulate downstream signaling events (3Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). We initially searched for proteins able to bind to Gpa2 in vivo. All 21 candidates were fused to the FLAG epitope and individually expressed in yeast together with Gpa2 fused to GST. Each of the FLAG fusion proteins was then immunoprecipitated. The presence of Gpa2 in the resulting immunoprecipitates was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-GST antibodies. This analysis identified two proteins capable of co-precipitating Gpa2: Asc1 and Prp4 (data not shown). We next sought to determine whether either Asc1 or Prp4 binds preferentially to the inactive (GDP bound) form of Gpa2. Asc1 and Prp4 were again immunoprecipitated, this time in the absence or presence of AlF4−. GDP-AlF4− mimics the transition state for GTP hydrolysis, and induces a conformation resembling that of the activated Gα protein (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In this comparison, Prp4 bound equally to both the active and inactive forms of Gpa2, and was eliminated from further consideration. In contrast, Asc1 bound almost 4-fold more Gpa2-GDP than GDP-AlF4− (Fig. 1A). Thus Asc1 binds preferentially to the inactive form of Gpa2, in the manner of known Gβ-Gα interactions. Having shown that Asc1 binds preferentially to inactive Gpa2, we sought to determine whether the interaction is direct. To this end we purified GST-Asc1 and His6-Gpa2 from E. coli, and reconstituted the proteins in the presence of GDP or GDP-AlF4−. Asc1 was then re-purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, and any co-purifying Gpa2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, Asc1 binds directly to Gpa2, and binds preferentially to the inactive (GDP-bound) form of the protein. Disruption of Gpr1 or Gpa2 activity has been reported to impair specific growth behavior phenotypes, including diploid pseudohyphal and haploid invasive growth (14Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lorenz M.C. Pan X. Harashima T. Cardenas M.E. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. Heitman J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 609-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown that Asc1 interacts directly with Gpa2 we sought to establish whether ASC1-deficient strains have a phenotype in a Gpa2 signaling pathway, and to rule out the possibility of functional redundancy with another Gβ-like protein. Therefore, we examined the ability of asc1Δ cells to sustain the invasive growth response. Fig. 1C shows that ASC1 is required for invasive growth. As has been shown previously, GPR1 (15Lorenz M.C. Pan X. Harashima T. Cardenas M.E. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. Heitman J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 609-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GPA2 (37Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and STE12 (50Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) are likewise required for invasive growth. In contrast, the wild-type and rgs2Δ strains are invasive. These results show that Asc1 both interacts with Gpa2 and is important in Gpa2-mediated signaling. Asc1 Functions as a Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor—Having shown that Asc1 binds, in the manner of known Gβ subunits, to Gpa2, we next sought to characterize Asc1 biochemically. Gβ proteins inhibit the spontaneous exchange of GTP for GDP on their cognate Gα. To determine whether Asc1 has the same function toward Gpa2, we measured the rates of GTP binding and hydrolysis. In the absence of receptors, the rate-limiting step in the GTPase cycle is the release of GDP (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 51Versele M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5577-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); thus if Asc1 reduces the spontaneous rate of GDP release, the rates of GTP binding and hydrolysis should be correspondingly diminished. We first determined if Asc1 affects the rate of spontaneous GTP binding to Gpa2. For these experiments we used a fluorescent non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP (BODIPY-GTPγS). The fluorescence of this ligand is quenched in solution but increases dramatically upon binding to Gα. Therefore, the rate of GTP binding can be easily quantified by fluorometry (52McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant His6-Gpa2, either alone or in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of purified recombinant His6-Asc1, was mixed with BODIPY-GTPγS and the resulting increase in fluorescence was monitored over time.

Homes were visited weekly.Primary outcome was percentage of days of diarrhea per child by study arm within each of the three cohorts. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms and percentage of children who ever had pneumonia by maternal report, or confirmed by the field worker.Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, median percentage of days with diarrhea was 2.3% for 49 children allocated to vitamin A; 2.5% in 47 children allocated to receive vitamin A and zinc; and 2.2% for 46 children allocated to multiple micronutrients (P = 0.852). Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, median percentage of days of diarrhea was 2.4% in 56 children in the vitamin A group; 1.8% in 57 children in the vitamin A and zinc group; and 2.7% in 52 children in the multiple micronutrient group (P = 0.857). Only 32 HIV-infected children were enrolled, and there were no differences between treatment arms in the prevalence of diarrhea. The prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms or incidence of pneumonia did not differ by treatment arms in any of the cohorts.When compared with vitamin A alone, supplementation with zinc, or with zinc and multiple micronutrients, did not reduce diarrhea and respiratory morbidity in rural South African children.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00156832."
https://openalex.org/W2156628074,"We identified and characterized Vnx1p, a novel vacuolar monovalent cation/H+ antiporter encoded by the open reading frame YNL321w from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the homology of Vnx1p with other members of the CAX (calcium exchanger) family of transporters, Vnx1p is unable to mediate Ca2+ transport but is a low affinity Na+/H+ and K+/H+ anti-porter with a Km of 22.4 and 82.2 mm for Na+ and K+, respectively. Sequence analyses of Vnx1p revealed the absence of key amino acids shown to be essential for Ca2+/H+ exchange. vnx1Δ cells displayed growth inhibition when grown in the presence of hygromycin B or NaCl. Vnx1p activity was found in the vacuoles and shown to be dependent on the electrochemical potential gradient of H+ generated by the action of the V-type H+-ATPase. The presence of Vnx1p at the vacuolar membrane was further confirmed with cells expressing a VNX1::GFP chimeric gene. Similar to Nhx1p, the prevacuolar compartment-bound Na+/H+ antiporter, the vacuole-bound Vnx1p appears to play roles in the regulation of ion homeostasis and cellular pH. We identified and characterized Vnx1p, a novel vacuolar monovalent cation/H+ antiporter encoded by the open reading frame YNL321w from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the homology of Vnx1p with other members of the CAX (calcium exchanger) family of transporters, Vnx1p is unable to mediate Ca2+ transport but is a low affinity Na+/H+ and K+/H+ anti-porter with a Km of 22.4 and 82.2 mm for Na+ and K+, respectively.

Similar to Nhx1p, the prevacuolar compartment-bound Na+/H+ antiporter, the vacuole-bound Vnx1p appears to play roles in the regulation of ion homeostasis and cellular pH. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes, K+ is the most abundant cation and plays key roles in cellular ionic homeostasis and osmotic regulation. Potassium uptake is mediated mainly by the plasma membrane bond Trk1p and Trk2p. Trk1p, the high affinity K+ transporter, seems to be predominant over Trk2p, since trk1 mutants lose the ability to grow in low K+ media (1Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Ko C.H. Buckley A.M. Gaber R.F. Genetics. 1990; 125: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trk2p, the low affinity K+ transporter, is able to substitute Trk1p activity only under K+ limiting conditions or at low pH (3Michel B. Lozano C. Rodriguez M. Coria R. Ramirez J. Pena A. Yeast. 2006; 23: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Na+ and other alkali cations enter the cell through K+ uptake systems, and steady-state cytosolic Na+ concentrations are established by the balance between Na+ inward and Na+ outward fluxes among the cytosol and the external medium or the vacuole. In S. cerevisiae four Ena genes in tandem encode Na+-ATPases that are the primary pathway for Na+ exclusion (4Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Several fungal Ena-type ATPases have been also described as K+ efflux enzymes. S. cerevisiae ena1-ena4 null mutants display lower Na+ tolerance at alkaline pH than at acidic pH due to the presence of Nha1p, a plasma membrane-bound Na+/H+ antiporter (4Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Sychrova H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nha1p plays a role in pH regulation and also cell cycle regulation (6Simon E. Clotet J. Calero F. Ramos J. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29740-29747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the transport of Na+ and K+ with similar affinity (Km ≈ 12 mm). Similar to the 1Na+/2H+ bacterial antiporters (7Ohgaki R. Nakamura N. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1712: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Nha1p activity is electrogenic and induces a net charge movement across the membrane, whereas other eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters are electroneutral (8Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 9Banuelos M.A. Rodriguez-Navarro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1640-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two other Nha1p homologues, Kha1p and Nhx1p, have been identified in S. cerevisiae. Kha1p has been described as a putative K+/H+ antiporter, and its deletion induced a growth defect at high external pH and hygromycin (10Maresova L. Sychrova H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Kha1p co-localized with Mntp1p, a Golgi-specific marker (11Flis K. Hinzpeter A. Edelman A. Kurlandzka A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although Kha1p displays high amino acid sequence similarity to other Na+/H+ antiporters, its ability to mediate K+/H+ exchange has not been yet demonstrated. Nhx1p localizes to the pre-vacuolar compartment and function in the sequestration of sodium ions (Km = 16 mm) by using the electrochemical proton gradient generated by the V-type H+-ATPase in an electroneutral manner (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Nass R. Rao R. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nhx1p can be also localized to discrete patches at the vacuolar membrane (13Nass R. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Nass R. Rao R.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cells harboring nhx1Δ mutations displayed a decrease in Na+ tolerance only under specific conditions, such as acidic pH (pH 4.0) and low K+ concentrations (1 mm) (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Darley C.P. van Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van der Woude K. Mager W.H. de Boer A.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These data suggested the predominance of Na+-ATPase and Nha1p over Nhx1p in Na+ and K+ tolerance and suggested other roles for Nhx1p. Nhx1p, also known as Vps44, act at the same step in trafficking to the vacuole as other class E vacuolar protein sorting proteins that are thought to control protein trafficking out of the pre-vacuolar compartment (17Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Disruption of vacuolar the H+-ATPase gene induced an increase of pH in the vacuolar lumen leading to a phenotype similar to that observed in nhx1Δ null mutants. This phenotype displayed changes in intravesicular activities and missorting of carboxypeptidase Y (17Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nhx1p might play a role in regulating pH to control trafficking out of the endosome, inducing a H+-leak that counterbalanced the action of the V-ATPase (16Brett C.L. Tukaye D.N. Mukherjee S. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Contrary to a previous report (14Darley C.P. van Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van der Woude K. Mager W.H. de Boer A.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), two independent studies showed that nhx1 null mutants did not display reduced vacuolar Na+ transport (18Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Martinez-Munoz G.A. Pena A. Yeast. 2005; 22: 689-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and that vacuolar preparations from different Na+/H+ antiporter yeast strain mutants, including KTA 40-2 (ena1-ena4Δ, nha1Δ, nhx1Δ, kha1Δ), did not display any reduction of Na+ or K+ transport. 2O. Cagnac, unpublished data. These observations supported the notion that a vacuolar transporter, not encoded by the NHX1 gene, could be responsible for the vacuolar cation/H+ exchange activity seen in the yeast vacuoles (19Martinez-Munoz G.A. Pena A. Yeast. 2005; 22: 689-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because no other monovalent cation/H+ homologues could be found in the databases, we decided to functionally screen a wide range of yeast cation/H+ antiporter-like mutants from the Euroscarf collection to isolate the gene(s) coding the transporter responsible for the vacuolar cation/H+ exchange activity. This reversed genetic approach allowed us to identify a single ORF 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. YNL321w, coding for a vacuolar Na+ exchanger (Vnx1p). vnx1Δ mutants displayed a total loss of Na+ and K+/H+ antiporter activity on vacuolar-enriched fraction. Here we demonstrate that despite the high similarity of Vnx1p to the Ca2+/H+ antiporter Vcx1p, Vnx1p mediates vacuolar Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange and not Ca2+ transport. Expression of the Arabidopsis gene AtNHX1 in vnx1Δ cells restored the monovalent cation/H+ exchange in isolated vacuoles, indicating that vnx1Δ mutants can provide a new tool for the heterologous expression and functional characterization of endosomal cation/H+ antiporters. Yeast Strains and Media—The vnx1Δ yeast strain (Table 1) was generated by replacing the YNL321w ORF with the kanMX6 gene by PCR-based gene deletion method (20Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar) using the following primers: YNL31w-F1 (5′-AAGTGAAATAACTGCTAGCTAGAAGAGCGGTAAGCAGCACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and YNL31w-R1 (5′-AAAATTGGTAGGTATCCAGGTGAAAAGCGGGGAC AGTTGCGAATCGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′). The deletion constructs contain 40 bp of homology (underlined) to the beginning and to the end of the YNL321w ORF. Yeast strains were transformed by the deletion cassette using the standard lithium acetate method (21Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from Geneticin-resistant strains was isolated as described by Sambrook and Russell (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York)Google Scholar). Insertion of the disruption cassette into the correct locus was verified by PCR. Then, for each mutant strain three independent colonies were tested for their lack of vacuolar Na+/H+ and K+/H+ transport activity. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown in yeast 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose or SD media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) with appropriate amino acid supplements as indicated.TABLE 1List of strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceW303-1BMatα, ura3-1, leu2-3, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, can1-100KTA 40-2Matα, ura3-1, leu2-3, trp1-1, his3-11,15,ade2-1,can1-100, mal10, ena1-4Δ::HIS3, nhal ΔLEU2, nhx1Δ::TRP1, tok1-khal Δ::KanMXRef. 10Maresova L.

Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intact vacuoles were collected at the top of the gradient and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.5). For vesicle preparation, 10% of glycerol and 1% of protease inhibitor mixture were added to resuspended vacuoles using a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g, the vesicles were resuspended in 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.5). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transport Assays—The fluorescence quenching of acridine orange was used to monitor the establishment and dissipation of vacuolar-inside acidic pH gradients as described before (24Blumwald E. Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 115-123Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Intact vacuoles or vesicles (25 μg of protein) were used for each assay. Vacuoles were added to a buffer containing 50 mm tetramethyl ammonium chloride, 5 μm acridine orange, 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.5), and 3.125 mm MgSO4. The vacuolar ATPase was activated by the addition of 5 mm Tris-ATP, and time-dependent fluorescence changes were monitored using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 540 nm, respectively, and a slit width of 5 nm with a 1% transmittance filter. When a steady-state pH gradient was established, the vacuolar ATPase was partially inhibited with the addition of 5-10 nm bafilomycin to obtain no net H+ movements (i.e. equal rates of H+ pump and H+ leak (≈3 min) (see below); chloride salts were added as indicated. Initial rates were measured as the slope of the relaxation of the quench over a period of 30s. Rates were reported as % quench/min/mg of protein. All curves were normalized to 100% quench before quantification. Curves were fitted to the mean values of rates at each concentration measured by using KALEIDEGRAPH (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Plasmid Construction and Yeast Transformation—The yeast expression vector, pYOC003, used in this study is a modification of the pDR196 (26Wipf D. Benjdia M. Rikirsch E. Zimmermann S. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Genome. 2003; 46: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 3 × Myc tag was amplified by PCR (Myc-For: 5′-CGCTCTGAGCAAAAGCTCA-3′ and Myc-Rev 5′-TCAGCGGCCGCTACTATT-3′) and then inserted in EcoRV of the pDR196 polylinker. The Gateway® cassette was amplified from the commercial vector pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen) (attR1, 5′-ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCTG-3′; attR2, 5′-ACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGC-3′) and then inserted in SmaI restriction site. The Vnx1 coding sequence (ORF: YNL321w) was cloned by PCR as describe in the Gateway® manual (Invitrogen) using the Expand high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR were performed on genomic DNA with primers attB1-Vnx1 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAGCAGGCTATGGCCAAAAATAACCACAT-3′) and attB2-Vnx1 (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTACTCCGAAAGAGCTCCCT-3′). Homology to Gateway® recombination sites is underlined. For Vnx1-3xMyc fusion construct, attB1-Vnx1 primer was used in combination with attB2-Vnx1-Myc (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTCCGAAAGAGCTCCCTGGA-3′) primer. The resulting PCR product is a VNX1 DNA sequence lacking the last four nucleotides, which allowed maintaining the same open reading frame between Vnx1 and 3 × Myc. The PCR products were cloned into the pDONR221 and pYOC003 using BP- and LR-Clonase MixII, respectively, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Vnx1-GFP Localization—The GFP gene was inserted into the YNL321w ORF between the predicted transmembrane domain 7 and 8 by a PCR fusion-based method (27Hobert O. Biotechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). GFP6 without the stop codon was amplified by primers GFP-For (5′-ACGGTGCTAACGACCGTGACATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACT-3′) and GFP-Rev (5′-GGAGGATGCGAGAAAGTACAAGATCTTTTGTATAGTTCAT-3′). The underlined portion of the primers represents the homology to VNX1. The first part of YNL321w ORF (+1to +1998) was amplified using primers attB1-Vnx1 (see above) and Vnx1-Rev (reverse complement of GFP-For), and the second part (+1999 to +2727) amplified using primers with attB2-Vnx1 (see above) and Vnx1-For (reverse complement of GFP-Rev) primers. All PCR products were combined and used as template for a nested PCR using attB1 and attB2 adaptors (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′;5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGATGGGT-3′). Vnx1-GFP fused was cloned in a pYOC003 as previously described. Growth Tests—Yeasts were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium to saturation and washed twice in sterile water. All cell suspensions were adjusted to an optical density of 0.2, 0.02, and 0.002 in sterile water. 10 μl of each dilution were spotted onto yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media supplemented with 300 mm NaCl or 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. Growth was assessed at 30 °C after 2 days and 5 days for hygromycin B and NaCl, respectively. Total Protein Extract and Western Blots—Yeast cells (A600 = 1) were washed and resuspended in water. To break the cells, the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min after the addition of 185 mm NaOH and 0.35% β-mercaptoethanol (0.35%). Total proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation trichloroacetic acid-precipitated pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 1 m Tris. Samples were denatured by adding an equivalent volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples (20 μl) were subjected to a 6% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Anti-C-Myc-epitope monoclonal antibody (GeneTex, Inc. San Antonio, TX) and anti-mouse IgG antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Molecular Probes) were used at a dilution of 1:3,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy—A Leica DMR series fluorescent microscope equipped with a Chroma 86013 filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and CoolSNAP-HQ (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) was used to visualize the transformed cells. GFP was visualized by using filters S484/15 for excitation and S517/30 for emission. All images were taken at ×100 magnification. Images were pseudocolored with METAMORPH software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated from yeasts with an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). Samples where then treated by DNase RNase-free (Roche Applied Science) to degrade the potential DNA contamination. Five micrograms of the total RNA were reverse then transcribed with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR-specific primers to Nhx1 (forward, 5′-ACATGTCAAGAAGATCACAG 3′; reverse, 5′-TCGGCGTTGAGTAAGAGAGAATG-3′), to Vnx1 (forward, 5′-ATGGCCAAAAATAACCACAT-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTGGAACAAGTCACCTCCC-3′), and Kha1 (forward, 5′-ATGGCAAACACTGTAGGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAAATCGACATTTAATCCTGC-3′). One microliter of each cDNA sample was used to perform the gene specific PCR (35 cycles). The specificity of the PCR product was checked by sequencing. Identification of YNL321w—A functional screening of yeast antiporter mutants from the Euroscarf collection was performed (Table 1). To select for putative vacuolar cation/H+ antiporter-like proteins, we used the yeast transport protein data base (YTPdb) to choose only proteins that were predicted to be localized at the vacuole or at endosomes. Vacuoles were isolated from each of the Euroscarf knock-out mutants of putative cation/H+ antiporters and knock-out mutants of the KHA1 encoding a putative K+/H+ antiporter and NHX1 encoding a pre-vacuolar-bound Na+/H+ antiporter (Table 1). The measurement of Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange activity in vacuoles isolated from each of the above-mentioned antiporters revealed insignificant changes to the transport (Na+/H+, K+/H+) seen in vacuoles isolated from wild-type yeast (Fig. 1, A-C), with exception of ynl321Δ (Fig. 2B). Vacuoles isolated from the YNL321w ORF knock-out showed the absence of a cation/H+ exchange activity (Fig. 2B). To further confirm YNL321 function(s), the transport activity of ynl321Δ knockouts that were complemented with the YNL321 gene was studied. VNX1 was cloned into a high expression vector down-stream of the PMA1 promoter. Transformation of the ynl321Δ disruptants with this construct restored Na+/H+, K+/H+, and Li+/H+ transport of the vacuoles (Fig. 2C), confirming YNL321 as a monovalent cation/H+ antiporter.FIGURE 2Vacuolar cation-dependent H+ transport. Cation-dependent proton movements were monitored by following the fluorescence quenching of acridine orange as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the indicated times vesicle acidification was initiated by the addition of ATP. After a steady-state acidic-inside pH gradient was attained, the activity of the H+-ATPase was partially inhibited by the addition of 10 nm bafilomycin (Baf). At the indicated times (white arrows) 50 mm NaCl (—–), 50 mm KCl (——), or 50 mm LiC (.........) were added, resulting in a cation-dependent H+ movement and the alkalinization of the vesicular lumen (recovery of the fluorescence). At the indicated times (black arrows) 5 μm nigericin (for K+) or 5 μm monensin (for Na+ or Li+) were added to collapse the ΔpH across the tonoplast.

Bafilomycin A 10 nm (—–), 30 nm (—·—·—·), or 100 nm (—··—··—··) was added where indicated (Baf). One μm bafilomycin A (———) was added before ATPase activation. (after a steady-state pH gradient was obtained of specific inhibitor bafilomycin A (D). Traces are representative of at least 5 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cation/H+ transport activity of YNL321 was dependent on the pH gradient generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase. It should be noted that a steady-state ΔpH gradient without net H+ movements was established after the addition of a relatively low bafilomycin A concentration (10 nm) that partially inhibited the H+-ATPase. Further inhibition of the H+-ATPase with increasing concentrations of bafilomycin A increased the H+ conductance of the vacuoles, thus impinging on the measurements of cation-dependent H+ movements mediated by YNL321 (Fig. 2D). The addition of 1 μm bafilomycin before the addition of ATP totally abolished the formation pH gradient. Noteworthy, from the members of the yeast Vcx family (comprising YDL128w, YDL206w, YJL106w, and YNL321w), only YDL128w, encoding Vcx1p, has been shown to mediate vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchange antiporters (28Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Vacuoles of YNL321w displayed Ca2+/H+ exchange activity that was comparable with that of vacuoles isolated from wild-type yeast (strain W303-1B). Nevertheless, the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchange activity was completely abolished in vacuoles isolated from vcx1Δ cells (Fig. 3), indicating that the Ca2+/H+ exchange was mediated exclusively by Vcx1p, as demonstrated by Pozos et al.

Our results show that despite its inclusion in the VCX family by the YTP data base, YNL321w transports monovalent and not divalent cations. Sequence Analysis of YNL321W—The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the YNL321 encodes a 908-amino acid polypeptide with a pI of 7.13 and a predicted molecular mass of 102.498 kDa that is very similar to the 106 kDa revealed by immunodetection of the Myc-tagged YNL321w (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the hydropathy profile suggests the presence of 13 putative transmembrane domains and a 242-amino-acid-long hydrophilic N terminus (Fig. 4A). YNL321w belongs to the CAX (calcium exchanger) family, that together with YRBG, NCX, NCKX, and CCX families form the cation/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily (29Cai X.J. Lytton J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1692-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We compared the protein sequence of YNL321w with other members of this superfamily (Fig. 5). The closest homolog to YNL321W is ScVCX1, a S. cerevisiae vacuolar Ca2+/H+ anti-porter (30Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Despite their similarity, ScVCX1 and YNL321W belong to two distinct groups of the CAX family (31Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ScVCX1 and the Arabidopsis thaliana AtCAX1-6 form the type I of CAX antiporters, whereas YNL321W belongs to the type II of CAXs that are only present in fungi, Dictyostelium, and lower vertebrates. YNL321W contains some of the special structural features characteristic of the type II CAXs (31Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); (i) the first half of its protein sequence (amino acids 1-524) contains a conserved domain of unknown function, DUF307, and two predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 4A); (ii) the second half of the protein (amino acids 525-908) is highly similar to the type I CAXs with 11 predicted transmembrane domains and the conserved domain Na_Ca exchanger (pfam PF01699) repeated twice, as in all the members of the cation/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily. However, YNL321W has some unique features. First, the acidic motif, a stretch of negatively charged amino acids in the loop between the two Na_Ca_Ex conserved domains (32Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is absent in YNL321W (Fig. 4B). This acidic motif, found in several Ca2+-binding proteins such as calsequestrin, calreticulin, and the cation/Ca2+ exchangers, is believed to be indicative of Ca2+ transport activity (32Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several amino acid residues (marked with the asterisk in Fig. 4B) that were identified as crucial for calcium transport in CAXs from Arabidopsis (i.e. Leu-87, Gly-137, Asn-138, and His-338) and rice are different in YNL321W. These residues in regions named c-1 and c-2 in the CAX family are highly conserved (33Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and mutations at some of these specific sites induced loss of Ca2+ transport activity (34Shigaki T.

Monocyte migration through endothelial cells expressing ICAM-1 alone was comparable to that of tumor necrosis factor-α-treated cells. Transmigration was reduced in ICAM-1 lacking the cytoplasmic tail and in tyrosine to alanine substitutions at Tyr-485 and Tyr-474. Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) −2 and −3 blocked transmigration, whereas TIMP-1 was ineffective. This profile suggested a role for membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) in transmigration. Inhibitory antibodies and small interference RNA directed against MT1-MMP blocked transmigration, whereas overexpression of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells or monocytes promoted transmigration. MT1-MMP mediated the ectodomain cleavage of ICAM-1 that was blocked by TIMP-2 and −3. Overexpression of MT1-MMP rescued function in ICAM-1Y485A, and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasmic tail-deleted ICAM-1. In a binding assay, wild-type ICAM-1 bound to purified MT1-MMP while ICAM-1 mutants bound poorly. MT1-MMP co-localized with ICAM-1 at distinct structures in endothelial cells. MT1-MMP localization with cells expressing ICAM-1 mutations was reduced and diffused. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-1 regulates leukocyte transmigration through MT1-MMP interaction.

The migration of leukocytes through the endothelium to sites of infection or inflammation is a key process for the maintenance of physiological defense mechanisms. When this process is dis-regulated and becomes chronic, inflammatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis and arthritis manifest.

The selectins initiate the rolling and tethering of leukocytes to the endothelium. This step permits the engagement between β2 and β1 integrins with intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) to allow firm adhesion and spreading of leukocytes. ECs express low levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, but cytokine stimulation elevates the expression of these receptors on ECs. The migration of leukocytes through the EC barrier involves platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and junctional adhesion molecules. Finally, proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane extracellular matrix by metalloproteinases (MPs) in particular is required to promote extravasation (reviewed in Refs. 1van Buul J.D.

Hypertens. 2001; 14: 44S-54SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is little data on the mechanistic role of the individual adhesion molecules. ICAM-1 comprises of five immunoglobulin-like motifs on the extracellular surface, followed by a stem, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (5Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail contains three tyrosine residues, two of which become phosphorylated at positions 485 and 474 upon ligation to modulate ICAM-1 function (6Pluskota E. Chen Y. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30029-30036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Pluskota E. D'Souza S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4693-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The role of these residues in leukocyte-endothelial migration has not yet been defined. Proteolysis is an important step during and after transmigration (8Lessner S.M. Galis Z.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Yadav R. Larbi K.Y. Young R.E. Nourshargh S. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as degradation of the basement membrane and matrix of the media (of larger vessels) or stroma is required. The zinc-dependent MPs belonging to the metzincin family possess a highly conserved catalytic domain, yet have an enormous range of functions and substrates. MPs can be divided into major families: matrix MPs (MMPs) and the family called A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases (ADAMs). The majority of the MMPs are secreted proteins, but there are six membrane-bound members belonging to a subclass of membrane-type MMP (MT-MMPs). These proteinases degrade extracellular matrices and promote the shedding of cell surface proteins (10Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dello Sbarba P. Rovida E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar). The MT-MMPs also promote cell migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis (12Sato H. Takino T. Miyamori H. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In particular, the shedding of adhesion molecules CD44 and syndecan by MT1-MMP has been linked to cell migration (13Endo K. Takino T. Miyamori H. Kinsen H. Yoshizaki T. Furukawa M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40764-40770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 14Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The ADAMs are primarily involved in ectodomain shedding of wide variety of cell surface molecules (10Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dello Sbarba P. Rovida E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar). ADAMs regulate adhesion via interaction with integrins through their Disintegrin/Cysteine-Rich domains (15Bridges L.C. Bowditch R.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and are increasingly being associated with aspects of vascular pathology (16Horiuchi K. Weskamp G. Lum L. Hammes H.P. Cai H.

Ross R.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our previous study identified ADAM-17 (or TACE, TNF-α converting enzyme) as the protease responsible for mediating the regulated cleavage of ICAM-1 in 293 cells induced through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (18Tsakadze N.L.

The secreted MMPs are regulated and effectively inhibited by each of the four known endogenous tissue inhibitors of MPs (TIMPs). TIMP-2 and −3 are very effective against MT-1, −2, −3, and −5 MMPs, whereas TIMP-1 is a very weak inhibitor of these MT-MMPs (19English W.R. Velasco G. Stracke J.O. Knauper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored members MT4 and 6-MMP are inhibited by all four TIMPs. TIMPs are also selective against ADAMs, for example, ADAM-10 is inhibited by TIMP-1 and −3, whereas ADAM-17 is inhibited by TIMP-3 only. To date, TIMP-2 has not been shown to inhibit any of the ADAMs (20Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J.

Ager A. Blood. 2001; 98: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Matias-Roman S. Galvez B.G. Genis L. Yanez-Mo M. de la Rosa G. Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. Blood. 2005; 105: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the role of ICAM-1cytoplasmic sequence and the proteolytic mechanism regulating leukocyte TM has been unclear. Our results for the first time indicate a clear role for the cytoplasmic sequence of ICAM-1 in regulating TM. The studies indicate that MT1-MMP mediates TM and interacts with ICAM-1. MT1-MMP and ICAM-1 co-localize at the membrane ruffles of ECs. This interaction also results in the ectodomain cleavage of ICAM-1. Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD11a, −11b, and −18 were from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of active MT1-MMP, used for inhibition of transmigration, was obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). TIMP−1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 polyclonal antibodies were from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA).

A 3′-GFP-blasticidin fusion gene was amplified using the template pTracer-CMV/Bsd (Invitrogen) to create Age1 and Pml1 restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Amplified ICAM-1 was cloned into the retroviral vector pUC-MMP-IC-eGFP (26Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA sequencing verified the sequence of the full-length ICAM-1. A pUC-MMP-IC-eGFP plasmid clone coding for the full-length open reading frame of ICAM-1WT was used as a template to generate the ICAM-1 mutants to replace tyrosine residues at positions 474, 476, and 485 with alanine or to delete a cytoplasmic region (ICAM-1TR) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (7Pluskota E.

The MT1-MMP cDNA isolated from human ECs was cloned into the vector pDC516 and sequenced. MT1-MMP cDNA was PCR-amplified to create HindIII and Sal1 restriction sites at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The vector, pDC516, and the MT1-MMP inserts were double digested separately with HindIII and Sal1 and ligated together. The Ad5 ΔE1/E3 adenoviral genome vector pBHGfrt(ΔE1,E3)FLP and MT1-MMP-pDC515 were co-transfected into NautCell™ 293s at a ratio of 5:1 using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) in suspension in serum-free medium for 10 min prior to seeding in T25 flasks.

The absence of replication-competent virus was established by infection of HeLa and monitoring for cytopathic effect. High titer stocks were prepared by infecting 12 T175 flasks of NautCell™ 293s and purifying recombinant adenovirus from cell lysates by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Titer was estimated by end-point dilution in 293 cells, and consistency of virus quality was determined by comparison with the titer estimated by BCA assay. The cDNA encoding E240A MT1-MMP in pCDNA3.1 zeo+ was provided by Christian Roghi (Cambridge Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, Cambridge, UK). The cDNA, subcloned by standard PCR methods incorporating SalI and NheI sites at the 3′- and 5′-ends of the primers, was ligated in pDC515 and then sequenced to check for errors before co-transfection with the adenoviral genome vector in Naut™ 293 cells as described for wild-type MT1-MMP. Transmigration Assay—ECICAM-1 (4 × 104) were seeded on polycarbonate microporous membranes of 6.5-mm diameter and 5-μm pore size in Transwell chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA) precoated with human fibronectin (10 μg ml−1)at37°C for 2 h. 100 μl of EC medium was added to the top chamber, and 0.6 ml was added to the lower chamber. After 3–4 days of culture, the integrity of the EC monolayer was assessed by microscopic observation and by measuring the permeability of the monolayer using fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin or horseradish peroxidase. Monocytes were freshly isolated using a Percoll gradient. Prior to the TM assay, the media in the Transwell was replaced with 100 μl of monocytes (2 × 105 cells) on the EC monolayer. The inserts were transferred to a new 24-well plate (lower chambers) containing 0.6 ml of fresh RPMI plus supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and Ca2+/Mg2+ (1 mm)at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 2 h the media in the lower chamber, containing migrated monocytes, were collected. Monocytes attached to the bottom of the Transwells were detached using 5 mm EDTA in DMEM (15 min at 4 °C) and then counted under a light microscope. In select experiments, the ECICAM-1 monolayer or the monocytes were pretreated with the test or the control antibodies (20 μg ml−1) for 30 min. The antibodies were maintained throughout the assay. Also, ECICAM-1 cells were preincubated at 37 °C with the pharmacological inhibitors for 1 h prior to the addition of monocytes. siRNA Transfection—MT1-MMP siRNA, Oligo-2, was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and was transfected into ECICAM-1 using GenePorter Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). ECICAM-1 cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated Transwells for 48 h. For transfection, 100 nm siRNA was allowed to complex with 4 μl of transfection reagent in DMEM for 45 min. The complex was overlaid on the EC monolayer in 100 μl at 37 °C. After 15 min, 0.6 ml of serum containing growth media was added to the bottom chamber for 18 h (18Tsakadze N.L. Sithu S.D. Sen U. English W.R. Murphy G. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3157-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). EC mRNA were analyzed using TaqMan QT-reverse transcription-PCR 48 h after transfection with commercially available primer-probe sets (Applied Biosystems Inc., UK) for MT1, −2, −3, and −4-MMP to demonstrate specificity. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot to confirm depletion of MT1-MMP at the protein level. Adenoviral Infection—High titer adenovirus expressing TIMPs, MT1-MMP, and the RAd60 control virus were produced as described (32, 33 and “Experimental Procedures”). ECICAM-1, seeded on Transwells, was infected at the required multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in 100 μl of media. TM assay was performed 18 h later, and then fresh media was added. In Vitro Collagenase Assay—HeLa were seeded overnight at a density of 3 × 105 cells well−1 of a 6-well dish in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, 37 °C, and 5% CO2. The medium was changed for a 1-ml volume containing no adenovirus or control adenovirus (RAd60), wild-type MT1-MMP, or E240A MT1-MMP expressing virus for 2 h and at an m.o.i. of 100 pfu cell−1 before the medium was replaced with 3 ml fresh medium and cultured for 48 h. Cells were then scraped into 150 μl of collagenase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35 (v/v), 0.025% sodium azide (w/v), Complete™ EDTA-free mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed by passing through a 20-gauge needle three times. Cell lysates were then incubated on ice with 20 μg ml−1 of the anti-MT1-MMP antibody (directed against a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of active MT1-MMP) or nonspecific rabbit IgG for 1 h. The lysates were then mixed with DQ-collagen (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 100 μg ml−1 in wells of a 96-well plate and incubated overnight in the dark at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured on a TECAN spectrafluor plus microtiter plate reader at an excitation of 485 nm and emission of 595 nm. Infections were performed in duplicate, lysates were pooled, and samples were then read in duplicate on the 96-well plate. Expression of His-tagged MT1-MMP—A His6 tag was added to MT1-MMP using the template MT1-MMP cDNA. MT1-MMP(His) cDNA was PCR-amplified with high fidelity DNA polymerase Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) using designed primers. The resulting PCR product created HindIII at the 5′-end and EcoR1 and His6 at the 3′-end for inserting into pcDNA3.1. HEK 293 cells were transfected with MT1-MMP(His)-pcDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine (18Tsakadze N.L. Sithu S.D. Sen U. English W.R. Murphy G. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3157-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and MT1-MMP(His) was purified using the MagneHis™ Protein Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer's instructions. ICAM-1: MT1-MMP Binding Assay—50 μg ml−1 of purified His-tagged MT1-MMP was diluted 1:1 with PBS. 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of His-tagged MT1-MMP at 4 °C for 16 h. Wells coated with bovine serum albumin served as negative control. The wells were washed twice with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.2) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin was removed, and the plates were dried for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 100 μl of 293ICAM-1 cell lysate (1 × 106 cell ml−1 lysate) for 2 h at room temperature. The plates, washed three times, were incubated with a biotinylated ICAM-1 polyclonal antibody for 2 h. The plates were then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 20 min and washed. The tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added for color development. The reaction was stopped with 1 n H2SO4, and the plates were read at 450 nm using a plate reader. Immunolocalization of MT1-MMP and ICAM-1—Human aortic endothelial cells stably infected with ICAM-1WT, ICAM-1Y485A, or ICAM-1TR were seeded on 10-mm coverslips and 12-well plates in EGM-2 medium for 48 h prior to fixing in 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated in PBS, 100 mm glycine, pH 7.5, for 5 min before incubation in PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The coverslips were then incubated with mouse anti-ICAM-1 (LB-2) and sheep anti-MT1-MMP (N-175/6) at 10 μg ml−1 each in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibodies the coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in PBS before incubating with anti-mouse Texas Red (Jackson Laboratories) and anti-sheep Alexa488 secondary (Molecular Probes) antibodies at 1:200 and 1:500 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for three times 5 min in PBS and briefly in Milli-Q water, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vecta Laboratories). Images were taken on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope using a 63× oil objective and sequential scans to detect each fluorochrome. To evaluate the selective role of ICAM-1 in leukocyte TM, ECs were transfected to express ICAM-1 using a viral vector. ICAM-1 expression was controlled to mimic levels that are achieved by TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 1A). VCAM-1 levels were negligible in ICAM-1-transfected ECs. However, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were highly expressed when non-transfected ECs were treated with TNF-α (Fig. 1A). Surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. To examine the capacity of the transfected ICAM-1-expressing ECs (ECICAM-1) to regulate monocyte TM, the cells were grown on Transwells for 2 days to develop a monolayer and secrete extracellular matrix proteins. The integrity of the monolayer was monitored using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled albumin or horseradish peroxidase. A negligible amount of albumin (<1%) passed through the EC monolayer (data not shown). Human blood monocytes (2 × 105) were layered on EC, and 2 h later the cells that transmigrated through the ECs into the lower chamber were counted. An average of 6.6 × 104 monocytes transmigrated through ECICAM-1, whereas only 1.5 × 104 monocytes mi"

CaRs extensively co-localized with the two subunits of the GABA-B-R (R1 and R2) in HEK-293 cell membranes and intracellular organelles.

In contrast, coexpressing CaRs and GABA-B-R2s enhanced CaR expression and signaling responses to raising [Ca2+]e. The latter effects of the GABA-B-R2 on the CaR were blunted by coexpressing the GABA-B-R1. Coexpressing the CaR with GABA-B-R1 or R2 enhanced the total cellular and cell surface expression of the GABA-B-R1 or R2, respectively.

In cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, CaRs co-localized with the GABA-B-R1 and R2. CaRs and GABA-B-R1s also co-immunoprecipitated from brain lysates. The expression of the CaR was increased in lysates from GABA-B-R1 knock-out mouse brains and in cultured hippocampal neurons with their GABA-B-R1 genes deleted in vitro. Thus, CaRs and GABA-B-R subunits can form heteromeric complexes in cells, and their interactions affect cell surface expression and signaling of CaR, which may contribute to extracellular Ca2+-dependent receptor activation in target tissues.

CaRs control systemic Ca2+ balance via the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion and renal Ca2+ excretion (15Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). CaRs are also expressed in many other tissues like the brain, where their functions are uncertain. In neurons, astrocytes, and neuroglia, CaRs modulate the activity of K+ and nonselective cation channels and cell growth (16Yano S. Brown E.M. Chattopadhyay N. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In osteoblasts and chondrocytes, CaRs activate signaling responses and mediate high extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]e)-induced changes in cell differentiation (17Dvorak M.M. Riccardi D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Chang W. Tu C. Chen T.H. Komuves L. Oda Y. Pratt S.A. Miller S. Shoback D.

It has been difficult to determine specific functions for CaRs in vivo in tissues like the brain, bone, or cartilage. Both human and murine models of CaR inactivation lack phenotypic features that can be clearly assigned to tissues beyond the parathyroid gland and kidney. One reason is that there may be redundancy in Ca2+-sensing molecules in vivo. Other receptors or signaling mechanisms may assume Ca2+-sensing in vivo when the wild-type (WT) CaR is partially inactivated (20Rodriguez L. Tu C. Cheng Z. Chen T.H. Bikle D. Shoback D. Chang W. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5294-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Molecules that are reasonable candidates for Ca2+ sensors are other members of family C. Increasing evidence supports the idea that family C receptors like the GABA-B-R can form multimeric complexes (21Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 22Pin J.P. Kniazeff J. Liu J. Binet V. Goudet C. Rondard P. Prezeau L. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2947-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The GABA-B-R1 and R2 are two distinct gene products that heterodimerize to form fully functional GABA-B-Rs capable of ligand binding and signal transduction (23White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies with the R1 and R2 suggest that their dimerization is essential for trafficking to the cell membrane and stable cell surface expression of functional receptors (24Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 25Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CaRs are also thought to function as homodimers in target tissues, such as the parathyroid gland and kidney. This idea is largely based on studies with mutant CaRs whose ability to alter the signaling of WT CaRs is best explained by the presence of heteromeric WT-mutant CaR signaling complexes at the membrane (26Jiang Y. Minet E. Zhang Z. Silver P.A. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14147-14156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Bai M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). CaRs also heterodimerize with mGluRs (28Gama L. Wilt S.G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39053-39059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Gama et al. (28Gama L. Wilt S.G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39053-39059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that the CaR co-immunoprecipitated with the mGluR1 and R5 in HEK-293 cells, co-localized with mGluRs in specific populations of neurons in brain sections, and could be co-immunoprecipitated with mGluR1 from whole brain lysates. Although CaRs and GABA-B-Rs are present in many of the same tissues (e.g. brain, kidney, parathyroid, bone, and cartilage), it is an open question whether these receptors can physically associate endogenously and, if so, whether such associations produce changes in cell function. These studies tested whether GABA-B-Rs associated with CaRs in brain lysates and in HEK-293 cells transfected with receptor cDNAs and whether their putative interactions impacted on the function of the CaR. We found that GABA-B-Rs physically interacted with CaRs in HEK-293 cells but more importantly also in the brain. Both receptors are strongly coexpressed throughout the brain, and their ability to interact to influence levels of CaR expression and thereby modulate cellular sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ and other CaR ligands could begin to explain the significant effects of Ca2+ on key central nervous system functions. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Atlanta, GA). The human GABA (hGABA)-B-R1a, GABA-B-R1b, and GABA-B-R2 cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3.1/hygro or pcDNA3.1/neo plasmids were gifts from Drs. Edward Nemeth and Karen Krapcho (NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). The hGABA-B-R1a and R1b are two alternatively spliced forms of the hGABA-B-R1, which bind the same ligands and activate the same signaling responses (2Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mosbacher J. Gassmann M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 835-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the rat GABA-B-R1a and R2 fused with an HA epitope at their N termini (HA-GABA-B-R1a and HA-GABA-B-R2) were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 as previously described (24Margeta-Mitrovic M.

The pcDNA3.1/V5-His expression vector and rat anti-HA and mouse anti-V5 antisera were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-CaR (21825A) antiserum was raised against an extracellular epitope of the bovine parathyroid CaR (29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Guinea pig anti-GABA-B-R1 antiserum was raised against a peptide (CPSEPPDRLSSDGSRVHLLYK) in the C-terminal tail of both GABA-B-R1a and R1b. Guinea pig anti-GABA-B-R2 antiserum was obtained from U. S. Biological, Inc. (Swampscott, MA). Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat or mouse IgG for immunocytochemistry were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase- and Texas Red-conjugated goat antiguinea pig IgG antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A/G-conjugated beads for immunoprecipitation and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate were from Pierce. The cDNA for a human CaR fused to the V5 epitope at its C terminus (hCaR-V5) was constructed by in-frame ligation of a XbaI-HindIII cDNA fragment encoding residues 1-1071 of the receptor with the pcDNA3.1/V5-His expression vector. cDNA encoding a truncated bovine parathyroid CaR (T866-CaR), lacking the entire C-terminal tail of the receptor, was subcloned into pcDNA1/Amp as described (30Chang W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44129-44136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD, residues 1-579) of the hCaR was ligated in frame with the 5′-end of the cDNA encoding the firefly green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a pcDNA3.1 vector to generate the ECD-GFP construct (ECD-GFP/pcDNA3.1). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) + fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and transfected with cDNAs using the Ca2+ phosphate method (29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures at ∼50-70% confluence were incubated with a mixture of cDNAs encoding CaRs and GABA-B-Rs (10 μg/construct) as specified for 24 h. For controls, vector (pcDNA3.1/hygro, pcDNA3.1/neo, or pcDNA1/Amp) DNA was added to standardize the total amount of DNA in each transfection. Transfected cells were replated and cultured for an additional 48 h. Mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured from WT Black Swiss mice and mice carrying GABA-B-R1 genes flanked with LoxP sequences (floxed GABA-B-R1) according to published protocols (31Brewer G.J.

Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Boston, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampus was dissected and digested with protease XXIII (3 mg/ml; Sigma) in a neuron maintenance medium (neural basal medium (Invitrogen) plus serum-free B27 supplement (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (0.5 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)) at 37 °C for 15 min. After two washes with neuron maintenance medium, cells were dissociated by passing the digested tissues through Pasteur pipettes with gradually reduced, fire-polished tip openings (200-500 μm in diameter). Cells were cultured in poly-d-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml) plastic dishes and/or glass coverslips in neuron maintenance medium for 3 days and supplemented with cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (3 μm; Sigma) for an additional 3-4 days before immunocytochemical staining or viral infections. To assess the effects of blocking the expression of the GABA-B-R1 on the expression of the CaR in neurons, hippocampal neurons from floxed GABA-B-R1 mice (33Haller C. Casanova E. Muller M.

The titer for infection (8 plaque-forming units/cell) had been validated in pilot experiments and found not to alter neuron survival or gross morphology (data not shown). Controls included infection of hippocampal neurons from WT mice with Ad-Cre or Ad-Cont as shown. The following steps were performed in the presence of a Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) without reducing agents, unless specified. HEK-293 Cells—Total protein lysates were extracted from transfected cells with nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (1%) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Nonidet P-40-PBS). Protein lysates (500 μg) were incubated with anti-HA or anti-V5 antisera (3 μg) in Nonidet P-40-PBS (500 μl) for 1 h and then with Protein A/G-conjugated beads (20 μl) overnight. Beads with immunoprecipitates were washed with ice-cold Nonidet P-40-PBS (1 ml) five times, collected by centrifugation, and eluted by incubating with a sample buffer (Tris-HCl (300 mm, pH 6.8), SDS (10%), bromphenol blue (0.01%), glycerol (50%), and dithiothreitol (100 μm)) at 37 °C for 30 min. Mouse Brain and Hippocampal Neurons—Crude membranes were prepared from the brains of WT Black Swiss mice and from hippocampal neurons infected with adenoviruses from floxed GABA-B-R1 mice as described (18Chang W. Tu C. Chen T.H. Komuves L. Oda Y. Pratt S.A. Miller S. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from these membrane preparations with Nonidet P-40-PBS and immunoprecipitated (1 mg of protein, 500 μl of Nonidet P-40-PBS) with anti-GABA-B-R1 antibodies (5 μg) as described above. Immunoprecipitates, crude membranes, and protein lysates that were previously incubated with sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (100 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (18Chang W. Tu C. Chen T.H. Komuves L. Oda Y. Pratt S.A. Miller S. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blotted with anti-HA (2 nm), anti-V5 (2 nm), anti-GABA-B-R1 (10 nm), anti-GABA-B-R2 (10 nm), or anti-CaR (50 nm) plus corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (18Chang W.

HEK-293 cells transfected with different combinations of hCaR-V5 and HA-GABA-B-R1a and R2 were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and incubated with an EZ-Link biotin reagent (sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate; Pierce) in PBS (1 mg/ml) on ice for 90 min. Labeled cells were washed with a glycine reagent (50 mm in PBS) for 10 min three times to remove unbound biotin reagent and with PBS twice, and protein lysates were extracted as described above. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated beads (50 μl/500 μg of protein in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40-PBS) and immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-V5 as described above. Total InsP accumulation was assessed in triplicate as described (29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled the with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) for 18-24 h and then exposed to different [Ca2+]e in the presence of LiCl (10 mm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Total [3H]InsPs were analyzed by anion exchange chromatography and presented as the -fold increase over the basal levels at 0.5 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+. For dual fluorescence immunocytochemistry, transfected HEK-293 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 20 min and permeabilized with methanol (80%) (34Chang W. Chen T.-H. Pratt S.A. Shoback D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19955-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rat anti-HA (10 nm) and mouse anti-V5 antisera (10 nm), cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein and Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies for 60 min at room temperature (18Chang W. Tu C. Chen T.H. Komuves L. Oda Y. Pratt S.A. Miller S. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After washing, coverslips with cells were mounted on glass slides using Gel Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined with a Leica TCS confocal microscope (Laboratory for Cell Imaging, San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center). Fluorescent images were obtained sequentially, and their overlays are presented. For cultured hippocampal neurons, immunocytochemical detection was performed with rabbit anti-CaR (500 nm), guinea pig anti-GABA-B-R1 (100 nm) antisera, and guinea pig anti-GABA-B-R2 (100 nm) antisera, respectively, and corresponding fluorescein- and Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies as described above. Parathyroid glands from newborn calves and kidneys, growth plate cartilage, and bones from 2-4-week-old mice were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, decalcified in 10% EDTA in PBS (for cartilage and bones only), and cut into 4-μm sections. Immunoreactivity in sections was detected with anti-GABA-B-R1 (100 nm) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG antisera after the sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with trypsin (0.01%) at 37 °C for 10 min. Statistical differences were tested by analysis of variance with the t test using Excel 98 (Microsoft, Seattle, WA). Immunoprecipitation, Co-localization, and Membrane Expression of the CaR and GABA-B-R1 in HEK-293 Cells—To test whether CaRs physically interact with GABA-B-Rs, we transfected HEK-293 cells with cDNAs encoding hCaR-V5, HA-GABA-B-R1a, or both. The CaR and GABA-B-R1 and their associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-V5 (Figs. 1, a and d) or anti-HA antisera (Figs. 1b, 1e), respectively. Immunoblots of the proteins pulled down by anti-V5 antisera demonstrated co-precipitation of hCaR-V5 and HA-GABA-B-R1a from lysates of cells expressing both receptor cDNAs (Fig. 1, a and d, lane 2). Conversely, anti-HA antisera pulled down the HA-GABA-B-R1a together with hCaR-V5 from the same cell lysates (Figs. 1, b and e, lane 2). These immunoprecipitations were judged to be specific according to the following criteria (1Chang W. Shoback D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Lysates from cells transfected with hCaR-V5 cDNA alone, immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibodies, did not contain any proteins immunoreactive with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1d, lane 1) (2Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mosbacher J. Gassmann M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 835-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations from lysates of cells transfected only with HA-GABA-B-R1a and performed with anti-HA antibodies likewise did not contain proteins immunoreactive with anti-V5 or anti-CaR antisera (data not shown) (3Benes F.M. Berretta S. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2001; 25: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Lysates from mock-transfected HEK-293 cells, subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-V5 or anti-HA antibodies, did not bring down proteins capable of cross-reacting with anti-V5, anti-HA, anti-GABA-B-R1, or anti-CaR antibodies (data not shown) (4Castelli M.P. Ingianni A. Stefanini E. Gessa G.L. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When lysates from HEK-293 cells separately transfected with HA-GABA-B-R1a or hCaR-V5 cDNAs were mixed and then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antiserum, we pulled down only the HA-GABA-B-R1a but not the hCaR-V5 (data not shown). This indicates that complex formation occurs only when both receptors are synthesized and processed in the same cells and does not occur nonspecifically in the lysate. On the basis of these controls, we judged the physical interaction between GABA-B-R1a and CaR to be specific and cell-dependent. On denaturing gels, hCaR-V5s appeared as the expected ∼140, 160, and >205 kDa bands in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1a) or in the input lysates prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1c) (29Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These bands represent different glycosylated variants of a core protein with an estimated molecular mass of ∼120 kDa and their aggregates (35Bai M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 115-125PubMed Google Scholar). The GABA-B-R1 migrated as an ∼110-kDa monomer and as larger aggregates of ∼250 kDa (Fig. 1, d-f, lane 2), comparable with previous reports (24Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The identities of these bands were confirmed by immunoblotting with antisera against the epitope tags as shown and also by antisera raised against endogenous epitopes in the CaR and GABA-B-R1 (data not shown). We consistently noted that the 140-kDa form but not the 160-kDa form of the CaR was preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with HA-GABA-B-R1a using anti-HA antisera (Fig. 1b, lane 2). This further supports a specific interaction between the 140-kDa CaR and GABA-B-R1. Dual fluorescence immunocytochemistry with anti-V5 and anti-HA antisera revealed extensive co-localization of the hCaR-V5 and the HA-GABA-B-R1a in the cell membranes (Fig. 1g, arrowheads), perinuclear regions (double arrowheads), and intracellular organelles (arrows) in transfected HEK-293 cells, further supporting the biochemical association of these receptors that we noted in immunoprecipitations. Co-expressing the GABA-B-R1 altered the cell surface expression of the hCaR-V5. We demonstrated this by immunoblotting surface proteins from HEK-293 cells, previously labeled with biotin reagent, and precipitated with avidin-conjugated beads (Fig. 1, h and i). In lysates from cells expressing both hCaR-V5 and HA-GABA-B-R-1a cDNAs, the levels of biotin-labeled CaRs were decreased by ∼70% (Fig. 1i, lane 2) compared with levels in cells expressing hCaR-V5 alone (Fig. 1i, lane 1). This change was accompanied by a reduction in total hCaR-V5 protein expression averaging ∼70% (for the 140- and 160-kDa forms) in cells co-expressing HA-GABA-B-R1a (Fig. 1, c and h, lane 2 versus lane 1), demonstrating a regulation of CaR expression by the GABA-B-R1. Effects of Co-expression of CaRs and GABA-B-Rs on Signal Transduction—We next addressed whether co-expressing GABA-B-R1s and CaRs affected signal transduction by CaRs. We tested the effects of raising [Ca2+]e on the accumulation of total InsPs as an index of phospholipase C activation in HEK-293 cells. Cells expressing cDNAs encoding either the hGABA-B-R1a or the hGABA-B-R1b showed no InsP response to raising [Ca2+]e from 0.5 to 10 mm in the presence or absence of the GABA-B-R agonists baclofen (10-4 m) or GABA (3 × 10-4 m) (data not shown). Similar negative results were also obtained in cells co-expressing cDNAs for both the hGABA-B-R1 (Fig. 1, a or b) and R2 (data not shown). In contrast, raising [Ca2+]e increased total InsP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in cells expressing the hCaR-V5 alone (Fig. 1j). Interestingly, high [Ca2+]e-induced InsP accumulation was significantly blunted in cells co-expressing both the CaR and the HA-GABA-B-R1a cDNA (Fig. 1j). Maximal responses to ≥10 mm Ca2+ were decreased by ∼40% (p < 0.001), and there was a modest but statistically significant shift to the right in the ED50 for Ca2+ from ∼3.6 to 5.1 mm (p < 0.01; n = 10 transfections) (Fig. 1j). Co-expression of cDNAs for the two human GABA-B-R1 splice forms (hGABA-B-R1a and hGABA-B-R1b) had the same effects on the signaling responses of the hCaR-V5 (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation, Co-localization, and Membrane Expression of the CaR and GABA-B-R2 in HEK-293 Cells—We next sought to test whether the GABA-B-R2, a partner of the GABA-B-R1 in vivo, also associated with the CaR in HEK-293 cells. Antiserum to the hCaR-V5 co-immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged rat GABA-B-R2 (HA-GABA-B-R2) from lysates of HEK-293"
https://openalex.org/W1986827117,"It has been shown that ultrasound (US) stimulation accelerates fracture healing in the animal models and clinical studies. Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial early mediator in mechanically induced bone formation. Here we found that US stimulation increased NO formation and the protein level of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). US-mediated iNOS expression was attenuated by anti-integrin α5β1 or β1 antibodies but not anti-integrin αvβ3 or β3 antibodies or focal adhesion kinase mutant. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) inhibitor (KP-392), Akt inhibitor (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-[(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate]) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (rapamycin) also inhibited the potentiating action of US. US stimulation increased the kinase activity of ILK and phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Furthermore, US stimulation also increased the stability and activity of HIF-1 protein. The binding of HIF-1α to the HRE elements on the iNOS promoter was enhanced by US stimulation. Moreover, the use of pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibition revealed that both ILK/Akt and mTOR signaling pathway were potentially required for US-induced HIF-1α activation and subsequent iNOS up-regulation. Taken together, our results provide evidence that US stimulation up-regulates iNOS expression in osteoblasts by an HIF-1α-dependent mechanism involving the activation of ILK/Akt and mTOR pathways via integrin receptor.

However, the mechanisms involved in osteoblasts to detect US stress and transduce the signal across the membrane for activating signaling pathways in metabolism, such as the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and release of NO, remain poorly understood. ultrasound inducible nitric-oxide synthase endothelial nitric-oxide synthase focal adhesion kinase integrin-linked kinase mammalian target of rapamycin hypoxia-inducible factor glycogen synthase kinase 3β interference RNA chromatin immunoprecipitation ultrasound inducible nitric-oxide synthase endothelial nitric-oxide synthase focal adhesion kinase integrin-linked kinase mammalian target of rapamycin hypoxia-inducible factor glycogen synthase kinase 3β interference RNA chromatin immunoprecipitation Integrins are cell-surface adhesion receptors that regulate cell viability in response to cues derived from the extracellular matrix (8Ruoslahti E.

In the case of mesenchymal cells, encompassed by the extracellular matrix, matrix-derived mechanical stimuli can regulate their viability. In this latter scenario, integrins function as mechanoreceptors that detect mechanical stimuli originating from the extracellular matrix and convert them to chemical signaling pathways that regulate cell viability (10Dimmler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 11Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol.

Mechanical stimuli can be transmitted through the direct or indirect interaction of integrins with associated lipid or protein-signaling molecules in the focal adhesion complex (12Plopper G.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Integrinlinked kinase (ILK), a potential candidate signaling molecule, has been shown to be capable of regulating integrin-mediated signaling (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). ILK can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β-integrin subunits and is activated by both integrin activation as well as growth factors and is an upstream regulator of Akt (15Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of the basic helix-loop-helix-PerArnt-Sim-domain, containing the proteins HIF-1α and arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (HIF-1β) (16Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The availability of HIF-1 is determined primarily by HIF-1α, which is regulated at the protein level in an oxygen-sensitive manner, in contrast to HIF-1β, which is stably expressed (17Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4118) Google Scholar, 18Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). During normoxia, HIF-1α is efficiently degraded through the von Hippel-Lindau-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Under hypoxia, HIF-1α protein is markedly stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, and heterodimerizes with HIF-1β. The HIF-1α HIF-1β complex can then bind to hypoxia response elements (HREs) located in gene promoters to regulate transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, iNOS, and glycolytic enzymes that enhance cellular adaptation to hypoxia (19Sharp F.R. Bernaudin M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Intracellular signals that promote osteoblast differentiation, including those mediated by bioactive radicals such us NO, prostaglandin, and calcium, may occur in response to cellular homeostatic disturbance induced by US (5Reher P.

Commun. 2001; 286: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been reported that US exposure increased NO and prostaglandin E2 release via up-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 in osteoblasts (5Reher P. Harris M. Whiteman M. Hai H.K. Meghji S. Bone. 2002; 31: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, NO may play an important role in the maturation of osteoblast and differentiation of osteoclast (21van't Hof R.J. Ralston S.H. Immunology. 2001; 103: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways for US stimulation on iNOS expression and bone formation are mostly unknown. Here we found that US stimulation increased iNOS expression and promoted NO production in MC3T3-E1 cells in a HIF-dependent manner involving the activation ILK/Akt/mTOR through the β1 integrin receptor.

A UV-sterilized unfocused circular transducer (Exogen, Smith & Nephew Inc., Memphis, TN) was immersed vertically into each culture well and placed to just contact the surface of the culture medium. The transducer generated a low intensity-pulsed ultrasound signal that has been clinically proven to enhance fracture healing (3Heckman J.D. Ryaby J.P. McCabe J. Freym J.J. Kilcoyne R.F. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1994; 76: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The driving signal consists of a 1.5-MHz sinusoidal ultrasound carrier wave, amplitude modulated with a 1-kHz pulse, and a pulse width of 200 μs (20% duty cycle). The spatial average time average intensity was 30 milliwatts/cm2 with a temporal average power of 117 milliwatts and an effective radiating area of 3.88 cm2. Exposure time was 20 min for all cultures, which is the FDA-approved treatment time for bone healing. The distance between the transducer and the cells was ∼5 mm (supplemental Fig. S1). Control samples were prepared in the same manner without US exposure. Cells were harvested at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after US stimulation (6Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For examination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in US treatment, osteoblasts were pretreated with various antibodies (control IgG antibody for comparison) or inhibitors (Me2SO as vehicle) for 30 min before US stimulation. Assay of NO—MC3T3-E1 cells (3 × 105 cells in 1 ml/well) were exposed to US in 6-well plates. Production of NO was assayed by measuring the stable metabolite of nitrite levels in the culture medium. Sample aliquots (100 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide/0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride/2% phosphoric acid) in 96-well plate and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured on a microplate reader. Western Blot Analysis—The cellular lysates were prepared as described previously (23Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Fu W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22907-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies against iNOS, HIF-1α, HIF-1β, p-Akt, or p-mTOR (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the blots were subsequently incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using X-OMAT LS film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Quantitative data were obtained using a computing densitometer and ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). For the study of HIF-1α translocation, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice and vortexed for 10 s. The lysates were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants containing cytosolic proteins were collected. A pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, and 0.4 m NaCl) for 30 min on ice. The supernatants containing nuclei proteins were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and stored at–70 °C. All protein concentration was determined by colorimetric assay using Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts (50 μg) of each protein from cytosolic or nuclei fractions were separated by 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blocked membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with mouse anti-HIF-1α antibody. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody. ILK Kinase Assay—ILK enzymatic activity was assayed in MC3T3-E1 cells lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) as previously reported (22Tan C. Cruet-Hennequart S. Troussard A. Fazli L. Costello P. Sutton K. Wheeler J. Gleave M. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, ILK was immunoprecipitated with ILK antibody overnight at 4 °C from 250 μg of lysate. After immunoprecipitation, beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of recombinant substrate (GSK3β fusion protein) and 200 μm cold ATP, and the reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylated substrate was visualized by Western blot with phospho-GSK3β antibody. Total GSK3β was detected with the appropriate antibody. mRNA Analysis by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from osteoblasts using a TRIzol kit (MDBio Inc., Taipei, Taiwan). The reverse transcription reaction was performed using 2 μg of total RNA that was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primer, then amplified for 33 cycles using two oligonucleotide primers: mouse HIF-1α, ATGGAGGGCGCCGGC and GATGATGATATCGCCGCGCT; mouse HIF-1β, TGGGTCATCTTCTCGCGGTT and TGTCCTATCTGAGCATCGTG. Each PCR cycle was carried out for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C. PCR products were then separated electrophoretically in a 2% agarose DNA gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—Osteoblasts were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of iNOS promoter plasmid and 0.5 μgof β-galactosidase expression vector. Osteoblasts were grown to 70% confluent in 6-well plates and were transfected on the following day by Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000), premix DNA with Opti-MEM, and LF2000 with Opti-MEM, respectively, for 5 min. The mixture was then incubated for 25 min at room temperature and added to each well. After 24-h incubation, transfection was complete, and cells were incubated with the indicated agents. The media were removed 24 h after US stimulation, and cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. To prepare lysates, 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) was added to each well, and cells were scraped from dishes. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. Aliquots of cell lysates (10 μl) containing equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were placed into wells of an opaque black 96-well microplate. An equal volume of luciferase substrate was added to all samples, and luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer. The value of luciferase activity was normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the co-transfected β-galactosidase expression vector. In experiments using dominant-negative mutants, cells were co-transfected with reporter (0.5 μg) and β-galactosidase (0.25 μg) and either the Akt or HIF-1α mutant or the empty vector (0.5 μg). DNA Affinity Protein-binding Assay—The biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the HRE sequences (5′-GTGACTACGTGCTGCCTAG-biotin-3′) of mouse iNOS promoter were synthesized and annealed (24Melillo G. Taylor L.S. Brooks A. Musso T. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12236-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Binding of transcription factors to the iNOS promoter DNA sequences was assayed, as described (25Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6592-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Following exposure to US, nuclear extracts were prepared. Biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (2 μg) were mixed at room temperature for 1 h by shaking with 200 μg of nuclear extract proteins, and 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads in a 70% slurry. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then the bound proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed as described previously (6Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA immunoprecipitated by anti-HIF-1α antibody was purified. The DNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform. The purified DNA pellet was subjected to PCR. PCR products were then resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV. The primers, 5′-CTGCCCAAGCTGACTTACTAC-3′ and 5′-GACCCTGGCAGCAGCCATCAG-3′, were utilized to amplify across the iNOS promoter region (26Deng W.G. Tang S.T. Tseng H.P. Wu K.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Statistics—The values given are means ± S.E. The significance of difference between the experimental groups and controls was assessed by Student's t test. The difference is significant if the p value is <0.05. Effect of Ultrasound Stimulation on iNOS Expression in Osteoblasts—It has been demonstrated that pulse application of low intensity US increased NO release via up-regulation of iNOS (5Reher P. Harris M. Whiteman M. Hai H.K. Meghji S. Bone. 2002; 31: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is important for mechanically induced bone formation (27Saito M. Soshi S. Tanaka T. Fujii K. Bone. 2004; 35: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We then investigated the effect of US stimulation on the iNOS expression in osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to US for 20 min, and the cell lysates were collected at different time intervals. The results from Western blot analysis indicated that US time-dependently increased protein levels of iNOS (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that upon mechanical stimulation (shear stress) the eNOS is responsible for NO production in bone cells (38Klein-Nulend J. Helfrich M.H. Sterck J.G. MacPherson H. Joldersma M. Ralston S.H. Semeins C.M. Burger E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, ultrasound also slightly enhanced eNOS expression in osteoblasts. In addition, exposure of MC3T3-E1 to US for different time intervals also led to a time-dependent increase in NO production (Fig. 1C). Exposure to US for 20 min was most efficient to induce NO release in osteoblasts (Fig. 1C). The US effect on iNOS expression was much more prominent than that on eNOS expression. We thus examined the signaling pathways involved in the up-regulation of iNOS after US stimulation in the following sections. It has been reported that integrins function as mechanoreceptors that detect mechanical stimuli originating from the extracellular matrix and convert them to chemical signaling pathways that regulate cell functions (6Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We then examined whether α5β1 and αvβ3 integrin act as mechanoreceptors detecting mechanical stimuli from the US stimulation and lead to the increase of iNOS expression in osteoblasts. Pretreatment of osteoblasts for 30 min with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against α5β1 or β1 integrin but not αvβ3 (Clone H9.2B) or β3 integrin (Clone 2C9.2G2, HMβ3-1) antagonized the US-induced iNOS expression (Fig. 1, D and E). The cyclic RGD peptide (cyclo-RGDfV) has been reported to bind αvβ3 at high affinity and block its function effectively at low concentrations (42Pfaff M. Tangemann K. Muller B. Gurrath M. Muller G. Kessler H. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20233-20238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brooks P. Stromblad S. Sanders L. Von Schalscha T. Aimes R. Stetler-Stevenson W. Ouigley J. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with cyclic RGD peptide (30 μm) or cyclic RAD (30 μm, negative control) also did not affect the US-increased iNOS expression (Fig. 1E). FAK has been shown to be capable of regulating US-induced increase COX-2 expression in osteoblasts (6Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Transfection with FAK(Y397F) mutant for 24 h did not affect the US-induced iNOS expression in osteoblasts (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results indicate that the β1 integrin but not β3 integrin or FAK pathway is involved in US-induced iNOS expression. The Signaling Pathways of ILK, Akt, and mTOR Are Involved in the Potentiating Action of US Stimulation—ILK, a 59-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase that interacts with cytoplasmic domain of both β1- and β3-integrins, is activated by cell-extracellular matrix interactions (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). To explore whether ILK is involved in US-induced iNOS expression, ILK inhibitor KP-392 or ILK siRNA were used. As shown in Fig. 2A, pretreatment of osteoblasts with KP-392 inhibited US-induced iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Transfection of osteoblasts with ILK siRNA also antagonized the potentiating effect of US (Fig. 2B). We thus directly measured the ILK kinase activity in response to US stimulation by the immunoprecipitation of ILK from lysates. Fig. 2C shows that US exposure in osteoblasts time-dependently increased ILK kinase activity, assessing the phosphorylation of the recombinant GSK3β on Ser9. It has been reported that ILK is an upstream regulator of the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 (28Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St. Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22374-22378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we then examined whether US stimulation also enhances the association of ILK with Akt. Pretreatment of cells for 30 min with Akt inhibitor (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-[(R)-2-O-methyl-3-Ooctadecylcarbonate], 1–10 μm) inhibited the US-induced iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). US-induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 markedly decreased if osteoblasts were pretreated for 30 min with KP-392 or transfected for 24 h with ILK siRNA (Fig. 3B). To examine whether mTOR activation is involved in the elevation of iNOS expression caused by US stimulation, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were used. Pretreatment with rapamycin (10–100 nm) antagonized the US-induced increase of iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). After exposure to US mTOR, phosphorylation on Ser2448 increased at 5 min, reaching maximum between 15 and 120 min (Fig. 4B). US-induced mTOR phosphorylation was markedly inhibited by the pretreatment of cells for 30 min with mAb against β1 integrin, KP-392, and Akt inhibitor or transfection with ILK siRNA for 24 h. Taken together, these results indicated that the β1 integrin/ILK/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in US-induced iNOS expression.FIGURE 3Akt is involved in the US-mediated increase of iNOS expression. A, osteoblasts were pretreated with Akt inhibitor (1–10 μm) for 30 min followed by stimulation with US for 20 min, and the iNOS expression was determined by immunoblotting at 12 h following US. The quantitative data are shown in the lower panels (n = 4). B, cells were pretreated with KP-392 (30 μm) for 30 min or transfected with ILK siRNA for 24 h followed by exposure to US for 20 min, and Akt phosphorylation was then determined 15 min after US stimulation.

Design A randomized, open-label, active control trial with two parallel arms. Setting Emergency Room and Outpatient Clinics in Patan Hospital, Lagankhel, Lalitpur, Nepal. Participants Patients with clinically diagnosed uncomplicated enteric fever meeting the inclusion criteria. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive one of two drugs, Gatifloxacin or Cefixime. The dosages used were Gatifloxacin 10 mg/kg, given once daily for 7 days, or Cefixime 20 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses for 7 days. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was fever clearance time. The secondary outcome measure was overall treatment failure (acute treatment failure and relapse). Results Randomization was carried out in 390 patients before enrollment was suspended on the advice of the independent data safety monitoring board due to significant differences in both primary and secondary outcome measures in the two arms and the attainment of a priori defined endpoints. Median (95% confidence interval) fever clearance times were 92 hours (84–114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105–164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (Hazard Ratio[95%CI] = 2.171 [1.545–3.051], p<0.0001). 19 out of 70 (27%) patients who completed the 7 day trial had acute clinical failure in the cefixime group as compared to 1 out of 88 patients (1%) in gatifloxacin group(Odds Ratio [95%CI] = 0.031 [0.004 – 0.237], p<0.001). Overall treatment failure patients (relapsed patients plus acute treatment failure patients plus death) numbered 29. They were determined to be (95% confidence interval) 37.6 % (27.14%–50.2%) in the cefixime group and 3.5% (2.2%–11.5%) in the gatifloxacin group (HR[95%CI] = 0.084 [0.025–0.280], p<0.0001). There was one death in the cefixime group. Conclusions Based on this study, gatifloxacin is a better treatment for uncomplicated enteric fever as compared to cefixime.

Citrin knock-out mice fail to display features of human citrin deficiency. Based on the hypothesis that an enhanced glycerol phosphate shuttle activity may be compensating for the loss of citrin function in the mouse, we have generated mice with a combined disruption of the genes for citrin and mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The resulting double knock-out mice demonstrated citrullinemia, hyperammonemia that was further elevated by oral sucrose administration, hypoglycemia, and a fatty liver, all features of human citrin deficiency. An increased hepatic lactate/pyruvate ratio in the double knock-out mice compared with controls was also further elevated by the oral sucrose administration, suggesting that an altered cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio is closely associated with the hyperammonemia observed. Microarray analyses identified over 100 genes that were differentially expressed in the double knock-out mice compared with wild-type controls, revealing genes potentially involved in compensatory or downstream effects of the combined mutations.

The causal link between citrin deficiency and the hepatic loss of argininosuccinate synthetase in CTLN2 patients still remains to be clarified (16Yasuda T. Yamaguchi N. Kobayashi K. Nishi I.

Patients with CTLN2 suffer from recurring neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with hyperammonemia, including disorientation, delirium, seizures, and coma that can lead to death from brain edema (13Saheki T.

Laboratory findings of CTLN2 patients show moderately elevated plasma Cit and arginine (Arg) levels, an elevated plasma threonine to serine (Thr/Ser) ratio, a decreased Fischer ratio (branched-chain amino acids to aromatic amino acid ratio; BCAA/AAA) (17Saheki T.

Clinically, one of the most distinct features of CTLN2 are reports of patients having a peculiar fondness for foods high in protein and fat such as beans and nuts, and a dislike of foods high in carbohydrates such as rice and sweets (1Saheki T. Kobayashi K. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Seikagaku (Japanese). 2004; 76: 1543-1559PubMed Google Scholar, 13Saheki T.

Patients with CTLN1 or other urea cycle enzyme deficiencies typically are given restricted protein diets to minimize episodes of hyperammonemia resulting from protein degradation. In contrast, several CTLN2 patients have developed severe hyperammonemia or deterioration following an intravenous infusion of a high glucose solution (31Tamakawa S. Nakamura H. Katano T. Yoshizawa M. Ohtake K. Kubota T. J. Jpn. Soc. Intensive Care Med. (Japanese). 1994; 1: 37-41Crossref Google Scholar, 32Takahashi H. Kagawa T. Kobayashi K. Hirabayashi H. Yui M. Begum L. Mine T.

Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Ikeda S. Intern. Med. 2005; 44: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed a citrin deficiency patient who exhibited an increased blood ammonia level following a typical hospital meal but showed no increase following a meal rich in protein and fat. 3T. Sakheki, unpublished data. 3T. Sakheki, unpublished data. Yajima et al. (34Yajima Y. Hirasawa T. Saheki T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1982; 137: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have reported previously that the blood ammonia levels of CTLN2 patients demonstrate diurnal fluctuations; the levels are usually higher in the evening following a meal and low prior to a meal. Together these observations suggest that CTLN2 patients may present with hyperammonemia as a result of dietary intake of carbohydrates, and not protein, following a meal. Identification of mutations in SLC25A13 in CTLN2 patients led to the discovery that a type of neonatal hepatitis was also caused by the same mutations (35Tazawa Y. Kobayashi K. Ohura T. Abukawa D.

Sakamoto O. Iinuma K. Saheki T. Hum. Genet. 2001; 108: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the neonatal symptoms were markedly different from those of adult CTLN2 patients, we named the neonatal presentation NICCD (neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency) (1Saheki T. Kobayashi K. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi N. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Nishi I. Iijima M. Nakagawa M. Osame M. Kondo I. Saheki T. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Patients with NICCD show multiple metabolic abnormalities, including variable aminoacidemias (Cit, Thr, methionine, tyrosine, and Arg) accompanied by an increased Thr/Ser ratio, galactosemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoglycemia, cholestasis, and fatty liver (2Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Seikagaku (Japanese). 2004; 76: 1543-1559PubMed Google Scholar). Human citrin deficiency therefore results in NICCD during the first few months of life, with symptoms usually self-resolving by the 1st year in most cases. Following an apparently healthy period that can last from one to several decades, some patients with human citrin deficiency go on to develop severe CTLN2 (1Saheki T. Kobayashi K. J. Hum.

To fully understand the pathophysiology of human citrin deficiency and to aid in the development of novel therapeutics effective in treating NICCD and CTLN2 patients, it is critical to have an accurate animal model of human citrin deficiency. We have previously created a citrin (Ctrn) knock-out mouse (42Sinasac D.S. Moriyama M. Jalil M.A. Begum L. Li M.X. Iijima M. Horiuchi M. Robinson B.H. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Tsui L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by targeted disruption of the Slc25a13 gene. Although the resulting Ctrn-/- mice lacked Slc25a13 mRNA and citrin protein and demonstrated markedly reduced mitochondrial Asp transport and MA shuttle activity in vitro, there was no apparent phenotype in vivo. Nitrogen-loading experiments produced only minor changes in hepatic ammonia and amino acid levels in vivo. The mice however, did reveal deficits in ureogenesis from ammonia, gluconeogenesis from Lac, and an increase in the Lac to pyruvate (Pyr) (L/P) ratio during liver perfusion experiments. Mouse liver contains high mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) activity (43Williams M.T. Carrington H. Herrera A. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar),3 a component of the glycerol phosphate shuttle that can similarly transport NADH reducing equivalents into mitochondria, whereas human liver is known to contain much lower activity (44Sadava D. Depper M. Gilbert M. Bernard B. McCabe E.R. Biol. Neonat. 1987; 52: 26-32Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).3 These considerations led us to hypothesize that the higher glycerol phosphate shuttle activity in the liver of the Ctrn-/- mice may be sufficient to compensate for any decreases in MA shuttle activity resulting from the loss of citrin function. To test this hypothesis, we crossed mGPD-KO mice with Ctrn-KO mice. The resultant Ctrn/mGPD double knock-out (Ctrn-/-, mGPD-/-) mice revealed hyperammonemia under fed conditions, citrullinemia and hypoglycemia under fed and fasted conditions, and an altered Thr/Ser ratio and fatty liver under fasted conditions. Moreover, the hyperammonemia was enhanced by the administration of sucrose, with the rise in ammonia being closely associated with an increased L/P ratio. Finally, microarray gene expression analyses using liver RNA identified more than 100 genes that were differentially expressed in the double knock-out mice compared with wild-type controls, only a portion of which were also differentially expressed in either of the Ctrn-KO or mGPD-KO mice. These results support our contention that compensatory mechanisms in mouse are responsible for the observed differences in citrin deficiency between humans and mice, and that the more severe phenotype present in the double knock-out mice represent a more accurate model of human citrin deficiency. Animals—Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of the Slc25a13 gene that encodes citrin (Ctrn-/- or Ctrn-KO) and for the mGPD gene that encodes mGPD (mGPD-/- or mGPD-KO) were generated as described previously (42Sinasac D.S.

Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Both KO mutations were made congenic on the C57BL/6J genetic background by backcrossing for at least nine generations. The two KO strains were intercrossed to generate mice heterozygous for both mutations (Ctrn+/-, mGPD+/-), which in turn were intercrossed to obtain mice that were heterozygous for citrin and homozygous for mGPD (Ctrn+/-, mGPD-/-). These mice were then intercrossed to generate single mGPD-KO (Ctrn+/+, mGPD-/-) and double knock-out (Ctrn-/-, mGPD-/-) littermates. Single Ctrn-KO (Ctrn-/-, mGPD+/+) and C57BL/6J wild-type mice were also generate as littermates by intercrossing mice heterozygous for the Ctrn-KO mutation. Genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ear punch using procedures specific for each of the targeted disruptions made in the Ctrn-KO and mGPD-KO mice as described previously (42Sinasac D.S.

Animal Treatment—All mice were maintained at constant temperature (22 ± 1 °C) on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) with free access to water and CE2 chow (24.9% protein, 4.6% fat, and 51.4% carbohydrate providing 346.8 kcal/100g; CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Mice used for experiments were analyzed between 80 and 140 days of age. In each experiment, both genders were analyzed, and the results were pooled within each genotype if no differences between genders were observed. A sucrose solution (50% w/v of water; 10 g/kg body weight) was administered per os using a gastric tube to fed mice between 9 and 10 a.m. For fasting experiments, food was withdrawn at 5 p.m. on the day prior to performed experiments. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation at Kagoshima University. Determination of Plasma Parameters—Blood was drawn from the mice via cardiac puncture while under general anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg body weight) between 10 and 12 a.m. Plasma glucose and blood ammonia concentrations were assayed using glucose CII test and ammonia tests (Wako kits, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), respectively, and plasma insulin concentration, using mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (o-phenylenediamine) (AKRIN-011, Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). Plasma amino acid concentrations were determined with a JLC-500 model amino acid analyzer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) after deproteinization with 3% sulfosalicylic acid. Plasma triglycerides (TG; TG-II Kainos; Kainos Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), free fatty acids (FFA; Determiner-NEFA; Kyowa Medix Co.

Quantification of Liver TG and Asp—Total lipid was extracted from the liver with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol solution (v/v, 1:2) as described previously (51Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). TG was assayed using a commercially available kit (TG-EN Kainos). For the determination of hepatic Asp, a portion of liver was excised following blood withdrawal, quickly freeze-clamped, and homogenized with 20× volume of 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid after pulverization under liquid nitrogen. The resultant extract was diluted with an eluent and subjected to reversed-phase column chromatography with an ion pair reagent"

One difference between these settings is the availability of immunoglobulin Fc receptors. The question therefore arises whether a herpesvirus exposed to apparently neutralizing antibody can still infect Fc receptor(+) cells.Immune sera blocked murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) infection of fibroblasts, but failed to block and even enhanced its infection of macrophages and dendritic cells. Viral glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies also enhanced infection. MHV-68 appeared to be predominantly latent in macrophages regardless of whether Fc receptors were engaged, but the infection was not abortive and new virus production soon overwhelmed infected cultures. Lytically infected macrophages down-regulated MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation, endocytosis and their response to LPS.IgG Fc receptors limit the neutralization of gamma-herpesviruses such as MHV-68."

There is strong evidence to suggest that GHB has an important role as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. The human aldo-keto reductase AKR7A2 has been proposed previously to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) to GHB in human brain. In this study we have used RNA interference to evaluate the role of AKR7A2 in GHB biosynthesis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis and immunoblotting revealed that short interfering RNA molecules directed against AKR7A2 led to a significant reduction in both AKR7A2 transcript and protein levels 72 h post-transfection. We have shown that reduced expression of AKR7A2 results in a 90% decrease in SSA reductase activity of cell extracts. Furthermore, we have shown using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry that a decrease in the level of AKR7A2 was paralleled with a significant reduction in intracellular GHB concentration. This provides conclusive evidence that AKR7A2 is the major SSA reductase in these cells. In contrast, short interfering RNA-dependent reduction in AKR7A2 levels had no effect on the GHB dehydrogenase activity of the extracts, and inhibitor studies suggest that another enzyme characteristic of an NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase may be responsible for catalyzing this reverse reaction. Together these findings delineate pathways for GHB metabolism in the brain and will enable a better understanding of the relationship between GHB biosynthesis and catabolism in disease states and in drug overdose. γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous metabolite synthesized in the brain.

Wartburg J.P. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been used clinically as an anesthetic (4Kleinschmidt S. Schellhase C. Mertzlufft F. Eur. J. Anaesthesiol. 1999; 16: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in the treatment of sleep disorders (5Tunnicliff G. Raess B.U. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 278-283PubMed Google Scholar). It has also gained notoriety as a recreational drug and as a drug used by sexual predators in date rape cases (6Nicholson K. Robert L. Drug Alcohol Depend. 2001; 63: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).GHB in the brain is thought to derive predominantly from the metabolism of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA). GABA is transaminated to succinic semialdehyde (SSA) through the action of the mitochondrial enzyme GABA transaminase (7Park J. Osei Y. Churchich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7636-7639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSA can be subsequently reduced to form GHB (Fig. 1). Two enzymes have been shown to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of SSA in human brain (8Cash C.D. Maitre M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both these enzymes have been identified as members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family of enzymes as follows: aldehyde reductase AKR1A1 (9Hoffman P. Wermuth B. von Wartburg J.-P. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); and a dimeric SSA reductase AKR7A2, previously characterized as aflatoxin aldehyde reductase (10Schaller M. Schaffhauser M. Sans N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). AKR7A2 has high affinity for SSA with a Km of ∼20 μm, whereas AKR1A1 exhibits a lower affinity for SSA with a Km of 231 μm (11O'Connor T. Ireland L.S. Harrison D.J. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 487-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The high affinity of AKR7A2 for SSA coupled with its presence in human brain suggested that it could serve as the major succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSAR) in this tissue, but the presence of other AKR has previously prevented a definitive role from being established.Not all of the SSA produced by transamination of GABA is reduced to GHB. Studies of rat brain have shown that less than 0.15% of the metabolic flux from GABA takes this reductive pathway (12Gold B.I. Roth R.H. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SSA can also be oxidized by the mitochondrially located enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) producing succinate for entry into the Krebs cycle. Defects in SSADH are found in individuals suffering from γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, which results in an abnormal accumulation of GHB (13Gibson K.M. Hoffmann G.F. Hodson A.K. Bottiglieri T. Jakobs C. Neuropediatrics. 1998; 29: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SSA that cannot be oxidized in these individuals is reduced to GHB by SSAR, and it is the high levels of GHB that are presumed to cause the clinical syndrome associated with SSADH deficiency, characterized by psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, and poorly developed to absent speech (13Gibson K.M. Hoffmann G.F. Hodson A.K. Bottiglieri T. Jakobs C. Neuropediatrics. 1998; 29: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).GHB catabolism has been studied in rat brain, showing oxidation of GHB to SSA, through the action of an NAD(P)-dependent GHB dehydrogenase (GHB-DH) followed by oxidation to succinate by SSADH (14Kaufman E.E. Nelson T. Goochee C. Sokoloff L. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or metabolism to GABA by GABA transaminase (15Vayer P. Schmitt M. Bourguignon J.J. Mandel P. Maitre M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We and others have suggested previously that SSAR (AKR7A2) may be responsible for GHB oxidation in a coupled system (16Kaufman E.E. Relkin N. Nelson T. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) where the reaction is driven by removal of the product SSA. More recently, however, it has been shown that GHB can be metabolized to SSA by a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase, which appears to be dependent on the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate rather than cofactor (17Struys E.A. Verhoeven N.M. Jansen E.E. Te Brink H. J Gupta M. Burlingame T.G. Quang L.S. Maher T. Rinaldo P. Snead O.C. Goodwin A.K. Weerts E.M. Brown P.R. Murphy T.C. Picklo M.J. Jakobs C. Gibson K.M.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2347-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).GHB can penetrate the brain freely. It has been shown to transport across the blood-brain barrier by a carrier-mediated mechanism (20Bhattacharya I. Boje K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and acts through both a specific GHB receptor (21Snead O.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the GABA type B receptor (22Gervasi N. Monnier Z. Vincent P. Paupardin-Tritsch D. Hughes S. Crunelli V. Leresche N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11469-11478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that large increases in brain GHB concentration following external administration hyperstimulates the GHB receptor(s) (23Muller C. Viry S. Miche M. Andriamampandry C. Aunis D. Maitre M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this mechanism is likely to be the basis of the major pharmacological effects of GHB. In individuals with γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, the absence of SSADH leads to a 30-fold increase of GHB in the brain compared with normal brain concentration (13Gibson K.M. Hoffmann G.F. Hodson A.K. Bottiglieri T. Jakobs C. Neuropediatrics. 1998; 29: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and its believed that chronic hyperstimulation of the GABA type B receptor plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease (24Buzzi A. Wu Y. Frantseva M.V. Perez Velazquez J.L. Cortez M.A. Liu C.C. Shen L.Q. Gibson K.M. Snead O.C. Brain Res. 2006; 1090: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).With increased recreational usage, the therapeutic potential of GHB and the occurrence of disease states resulting from defects in enzymes involved in GHB metabolism, it was important to develop a clearer understanding of the key enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of GHB in the brain. In this study, we have investigated the role of AKR7A2 in acting as a SSA reductase in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown expression of AKR7A2 (25Elbashir S. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar, 26Caplen N. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of reduced expression on the ability of cells to reduce SSA, and on intracellular GHB levels. We also investigated whether AKR7A2 is the major GHB-DH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (27Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in 1:1 mixture consisting of Ham's F-12 and modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamate, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were a gift from Dr. Eve Lutz maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamate and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin.Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma, except for deuterated GHB (GHB-D6), obtained from Cerilliant Corp., Round Rock, TX, and zopolrestat, a gift from Pfizer, Groton, CT.Antibodies—Antibodies to human AKR7A2 were raised in rabbits (28Li D. Hinshelwood A. Gardner R. McGarvie G. Ellis E.M. Toxicology. 2006; 226: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Antibodies to AKR1A1 were a gift from John Hayes, University of Dundee (11O'Connor T. Ireland L.S. Harrison D.J. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 487-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Antibodies to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.RNAi—The siRNA sequence targeting AKR7A2, 5′-GUACAAGUAUGAGGACAAGTT-3′ and a control, scrambled oligonucleotide sequence were both chemically synthesized by MWG (Ebersbeg, Germany). SH-SY5Y cells were seeded into 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells per well) and transfected with AKR7A2 siRNA at a final concentration of 5 nm using Ribojuice siRNA transfection reagent (Novagen). The expression of AKR7A2 was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting 72 h after transfection.Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from SH-SY5Y using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR miniprep kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Relative quantitation of AKR7A2 expression levels was carried out with the LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using a set of oligonucleotide primers (forward, 5′-AAC TGG ACA CGG CCT TCA TG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG GAT CCA GCC ATT GCT CT-3′) to suit amplification under the specific cycling conditions for the LightCycler. PCRs were set up in 20-μl volumes with 0.5 μl of first strand cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer, and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) as detailed in the manual. The relative amount of cDNA synthesized in each RT-PCR was compared with β-actin mRNA levels detected using specific primers.Preparation of Cell Extracts—Protein was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells in 75-cm3 flasks or 6-well plates using a “freezethaw lysis” protocol that does not affect enzyme activity. Briefly, the media were aspirated, and the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Cells were detached in 1× SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) and microcentrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then transferred to 37 °C for 5 min. The freeze-thaw procedure was repeated twice. The cell lysate was microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford against bovine serum albumen standards (50Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Subcellular Fractionation of SH-SY5Y Cells—Subcellular fractionation was performed using differential centrifugation. 4 × 175-cm3 flasks of SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before harvesting and pelleting at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization media (0.25 m sucrose, neutralized to pH 7, 10 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5) and homogenized using a Teflon pestle. Homogenization media was added to 5 ml, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was retained as the nuclei-enriched fraction. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was retained as the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 34,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was retained as the fraction enriched for Golgi. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the endoplasmic reticulum fraction. The remaining supernatant was retained as the cytosolic fraction.Protein Gels and Western Blots—Protein samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide resolving gels with the buffer system described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). For Western blots, transfer to nitrocellulose was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus for 2 h at 250 mA. Protein-binding sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked overnight at room temperature in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween) containing 10% (w/v) skimmed milk. The nitrocellulose membranes were probed for 2 h with primary antibodies (at 1:2000 dilutions in TBST-skimmed milk). Membranes were washed with TBST and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:3000 dilution in TBST-skimmed milk) for 2 h. Membranes were washed with TBST and antibodies detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of band intensities was performed using Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software.Enzyme Assays—Reductase and dehydrogenase activities of SH-SY5Y protein extracts were measured by following the change in absorbance of cofactor (NAD(P)(H) at 340 nm, using a Beckman DU650 UV single-beam recording spectrophotometer. All assays were performed at 25 °C in reaction volumes of 1 ml. Substrates used were SSA, GHB, and 1,4-butanediol; and cofactors used were NADPH, NADP, and NAD. For determination of SSA reductase activity in protein extracts, 10 μm or 1 mm SSA substrate was used, and assays were performed in 100 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 6.6, 50 μm NADPH. For determination of 1,4-butanediol dehydrogenase activity in protein extracts, 1 mm 1,4-butanediol substrate was used, and assays were performed in 100 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 8, 50 μm NAD. For determination of GHB dehydrogenase activity in protein extracts, 1 or 10 mm GHB substrate was used, and assays were performed in 100 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 8, 50 μm NADP. The inhibitor zopolrestat was used at a concentration of 1 mm, sodium valproate was used at a concentration of 0.5 mm, and 4-methylpyrazole was used at a concentration of 2.5 mm (30Short D.M. Lyon R.

Cirimele V. Ludes B. Kintz P. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 792: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells and media were separated by centrifugation. 500 μl of CH3CN was added along with 10 μlof1 μg/ml deuterated GHB (GHB-d6) as an internal standard. Samples were dried and derivatized with 100 μlof N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide by heating at 60 °C for 30 min. 200 μlof ethyl acetate was added to each vial and mixed thoroughly, and an aliquot was analyzed by GC-MS. Analysis was performed on a trace GC-2000 series and MD 800 detector with an AS 2000 autosampler. The software used was Xcalibur™ homepage version 1.2 and Qual™ browser version 1.2.RESULTSEffect of RNAi Knockdown of AKR7A2 on GHB Synthesis—A double-stranded siRNA molecule designed to silence by binding to the 3′ end of AKR7A2 mRNA was transiently transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. This human neuroblastoma cell line was selected as it is known to synthesize several neurotransmitters and has proved useful as a model for studying function in neuronal cells (27Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kuhla B. Luth H.J. Haferburg D. Weick M. Reichenbach A. Arendt T. Munch G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The effect of the siRNA molecule on AKR7A2 mRNA levels was measured after 72 h using quantitative RT-PCR with primers specific for AKR7A2. This revealed that treatment with AKR7A2 siRNA led to an 86% reduction in AKR7A2 transcript levels (Table 1) at 72 h post-transfection. No mRNA for the highly similar AKR7A3 could be detected in control SH-SY5Y cells using primers that distinguish between the two genes (data not shown).TABLE 1Levels of AKR7A2 mRNA in siRNA-treated cellsAKR7A2 mRNA levelscopies/1000 β-actin moleculesControl SH-SY5Y Cells41.6 ± 2.3siRNA transfected cells6.1 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab To study the effect on AKR7A2 protein levels, cell extracts were prepared from siRNA-transfected cells, and the levels of AKR7A2 were detected using specific antibodies and Western blots (Fig. 2A). Analysis revealed over 90% reduction in AKR7A2 protein levels compared with control cells 72 h post-transfection, indicating that the RNA interference has been effective.FIGURE 2Silencing of AKR7A2 in SH-SY5Y cells.A, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were transfected with AKR7A2-targeted siRNA, and at 72 h post-transfection, levels of AKR7A2, AKR1A1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (loading control) were analyzed by immunoblotting. s.s., scrambled sequence of siRNA; vehicle, transfection reagent only. Enzyme assays using 1 mm (B) or 10 μm SSA (C) as substrate followed the change in cofactor (NADPH) in extracts from control, vehicle, or silenced cells 72 h after transfection. The AKR inhibitor zopolrestat was used at a concentration of 1 mm. Values represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6). Statistically significant differences relative to control were determined using one way ANOVA (***, p ≤ 0.001; ns, not significant).

The results in Fig. 2B show that 72 h after siRNA treatment, SSA reductase activity is reduced by ∼80% using a high (1 mm) concentration of SSA and by 90% using a low (10 μm) concentration of SSA (Fig. 2C) This indicates that even at high SSA concentrations, the “low Km” SSA reductase, AKR7A2, constitutes the major SSA reductase in this cell line. To determine the contribution of aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) to SSA reduction, enzyme assays were carried out on extracts from siRNA-treated cells in the presence of zopolrestat, an inhibitor of AKR1A1 (33Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Grimshaw C.E. Bohren K.M. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 11264-11275Google Scholar). This revealed that at 1 mm SSA, ∼50% of the residual activity in silenced cells was because of a zopolrestat-inhibitable enzyme, most likely the “high Km” aldehyde reductase AKR1A1 (Fig. 2B). However, by using 10 μm SSA, there was no further inhibition of SSAR activity, proving that when SSA levels are low, AKR7A2 is the predominant SSA reductase in these cells (Fig. 2C). siRNA-dependent inhibition of AKR7A2 in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells also led to an 90% reduction in AKR7A2 expression and in SSA reductase activity (data not shown), indicating that this is not a cell-specific phenomenon.Analysis of SH-SY5Y cells from siRNA-treated and control cells by GC-MS showed a 35% reduction in intracellular GHB content after 72 h (Fig. 2D). This is a significant decrease and confirms the important role of AKR7A2 in GHB synthesis. It is apparent, however, that the cells maintain intracellular GHB levels to a limited extent even with the loss of over 90% SSA reductase activity. Interestingly, we observed that knockdown of AKR7A2 led to a significant increase in 1,4-butanediol dehydrogenase activity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that a compensatory pathway for GHB synthesis from 1,4-butanediol is being evoked to counter the lower levels of GHB. This may explain why GHB levels are not as low as might be predicted from the decrease in SSAR activity.FIGURE 31,4-Butanediol dehydrogenase activity in AKR7A2-silenced cells. Enzyme assays using 1 mm 1,4-butanediol as substrate followed the change in cofactor (NAD) in extracts from control or silenced cells 72 h after transfection. Values represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6).

Extracts prepared from siRNA-treated cells were assayed for GHB-DH activity (Fig. 4). It is apparent that knockdown of AKR7A2 had no observable effect on GHB-DH activity, indicating that despite acting as the major SSA reductase, AKR7A2 is not responsible for the oxidation of GHB in these cells.FIGURE 4Effect of silencing of AKR7A2 on GHB-DH activity. Enzyme assays using 1 (A) or 10 mm (B) GHB as substrate followed the change in cofactor (NAD) in extracts from control, vehicle, or silenced cells 72 h after transfection.

Statistically significant differences relative to control were tested using one-way ANOVA (ns, not significant).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of GHB Dehydrogenase Enzymes in SH-SY5Y Cells—Measurement of GHB-DH activity in SH-SY5Y cells showed that both NAD and NADP-dependent activity is present but that the predominant activity is NAD-dependent, showing over 8-fold greater activity than the NADP-dependent activity (Fig. 5). Enzyme assays carried out in the presence of sodium valproate (an AKR inhibitor) and 4-methylpyrazole (an ADH inhibitor) were used to characterize the key enzymes further. The major NAD-dependent activity is inhibitable by 4-methylpyrazole but not sodium valproate, whereas the NADP-dependent GHB-DH activity is not inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole but is inhibited by sodium valproate. These data indicate that the major enzyme responsible for GHB-DH catabolism is an NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.FIGURE 5GHB dehydrogenase activity in SH-SY5Y cells. Enzyme assays using GHB as substrate followed the change in cofactor NAD (A) or NADP (B) in SH-SY5Y cell extracts in the presence or absence of the enzyme inhibitors sodium valproate or 4-methylpyrazole. Values represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6). Statistically significant differences relative to control were determined using one-way ANOVA (***, p ≤ 0.001; ns, not significant). C, subcellular localization of NAD-dependent GHB-DH. Enzyme assays using GHB as substrate followed the change in cofactor, NAD, in SH-SY5Y cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions. Values represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subcellular fractionation of SH-SY5Y cells revealed that the NAD-dependent GHB-DH activity is concentrated within the mitochondrial fraction, where the specific activity is over 20 times that found in the cytosol (Fig. 5C). A mitochondrial location would be appropriate for an enzyme that can produce SSA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle via succinate.DISCUSSIONThere has been considerable speculation over the identity of the enzymes responsible for the reduction of SSA to GHB, originally identified as NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductases (3Tabakoff B. Wartburg J.P. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Cash C.D. Maitre M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Later work added to the intrigue as it appeared that an aflatoxin aldehyde reductase, AKR7A2, might be responsible (10Schaller M. Schaffhauser M. Sans N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study we provide proof that AKR7A2 is responsible for the vast proportion of SSA reductase activity in SH-SY5Y cells when SSA concentrations are between 10 μm and 1 mm.There is a small proportion (10%) of SSA reductase activity remaining in siRNA-treated cells. By using inhibitors, we have shown that about half of this activity (5%) is attributable to a zopolrestat-inhibitable enzyme. This would be consistent with aldehyde reductase AKR1A1 (8Cash C.D. Maitre M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 1169-1175Cros"
https://openalex.org/W2137373119,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat disorders are caused by the expansion of CAG tracts in certain genes, resulting in transcription of proteins with abnormally long polyQ inserts. When these inserts expand beyond 35–45 glutamines, affected proteins form toxic aggregates, leading to neuron death. Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) with an inserted glutamine repeat has previously been used to model polyQ-mediated aggregation in vitro. However, polyQ insertion lengths in these studies have been kept below the pathogenic threshold. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to study monomer folding dynamics and dimer formation in CI2-polyQ chimeras with insertion lengths of up to 80 glutamines. Our model recapitulates the experimental results of previous studies of chimeric CI2 proteins, showing high folding cooperativity of monomers as well as protein association via domain swapping. Surprisingly, for chimeras with insertion lengths above the pathogenic threshold, monomer folding cooperativity decreases and the dominant mode for dimer formation becomes interglutamine hydrogen bonding. These results support a mechanism for pathogenic polyQ-mediated aggregation, in which expanded polyQ tracts destabilize affected proteins and promote the formation of partially unfolded intermediates. These unfolded intermediates form aggregates through associations by interglutamine interactions.

We perform molecular dynamics simulations to study monomer folding dynamics and dimer formation in CI2-polyQ chimeras with insertion lengths of up to 80 glutamines. Our model recapitulates the experimental results of previous studies of chimeric CI2 proteins, showing high folding cooperativity of monomers as well as protein association via domain swapping. Surprisingly, for chimeras with insertion lengths above the pathogenic threshold, monomer folding cooperativity decreases and the dominant mode for dimer formation becomes interglutamine hydrogen bonding. These results support a mechanism for pathogenic polyQ-mediated aggregation, in which expanded polyQ tracts destabilize affected proteins and promote the formation of partially unfolded intermediates. These unfolded intermediates form aggregates through associations by interglutamine interactions. The polyglutamine (polyQ) 3The abbreviations used are:polyQpolyglutamineR.M.S.D.root mean-squared deviationDMDdiscrete molecular dynamics. 3The abbreviations used are:polyQpolyglutamineR.M.S.D.root mean-squared deviationDMDdiscrete molecular dynamics. repeat disorders are a family of inherited disorders characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, as well as the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. These include Huntington's disease (HD), spino-cerebellar ataxias (SCA) 1–6, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) (1Riley B.E. Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2183-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Each disease is caused by the expansion of a tract of repeated CAG triplet in a distinct gene, causing transcription of proteins with lengthened polyQ repeats. Although the genes (and proteins) involved in different polyQ diseases have little homology, these disorders share a striking relationship between their clinical manifestation and their genetic underpinning. Symptoms appear only if the length of the expanded tract exceeds a critical value of 35–45 glutamines, with a greater number of repeats leading to earlier disease onset and more severe manifestations (2Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Wanker E.E. Amzel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is hypothesized that neuronal toxicity present in polyQ diseases is derived from the polyQ expansion itself, which induces pathogenesis by a common molecular mechanism in these disorders (3Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A nucleation-elongation mechanism, in which the formation of a high energy nucleus is the rate-limiting step in the formation of a toxic protein aggregate, has been proposed to account for the timeframe of disease onset (3Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 5Chen S.

The β-helix, proposed as such a nucleus for polyQ aggregation, has recently been found to be stable only in tracts of 37 or more repeated glutamines (6Khare S.D. Ding F. Gwanmesia K.N. Dokholyan N.V. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 230-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A β-helix is a protein conformation in which the backbone dihedral angles of each amino acid corresponds to the β-region in the Ramachandran plot, and the peptide forms a helical structure with a periodic length much larger than that of α-helix, 3.6. polyglutamine root mean-squared deviation discrete molecular dynamics. polyglutamine root mean-squared deviation discrete molecular dynamics. Although intracellular aggregates rich in polyQ-containing peptides are the most visible cytological manifestations of polyQ disorders (7Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that soluble oligomers, rather than these insoluble aggregates, are toxic to cells (4Poirier M.A. Li H.

However, the role of polyQ tracts in the formation of these oligomeric species, as well as the nature of their pathogenic effect, remains unclear. Inspired by the hypothesis of a common molecular mechanism of the polyQ-mediated aggregation of proteins, chimeric proteins with inserted glutamine repeats have been used as an in vitro model system to study polyQ-mediated oligomerization (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Gordon-Smith D.J. Carbajo R.J. Stott K. Neuhaus D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1995; 92: 6509-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) first engineered chimeric CI2-polyQ with inserted tracts of 4–10 glutamines. While these mutants were found to form soluble aggregates, association was later found not to occur by the hypothesized glutamine-mediated interactions. In contrast, the oligomers preserved native-like structures and formed through a domain-swapping mechanism (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a domain-swapped aggregate, certain regions of a protein associate with complementary regions of a like protein, mimicking native interactions in a monomer. This type of association is made possible by a flexible hinge region which changes conformation between monomeric and domain-swapped forms. The crystal structure of domain-swapped CI2-polyQ dimers has been solved by x-ray crystallography (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but electron density for the glutamine insert could not be determined. The authors hypothesized a random coil conformation for the insert. Gordon-Smith et al. (13Gordon-Smith D.J. Carbajo R.J. Stott K. Neuhaus D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) performed NMR studies to examine the possibility of interglutamine interactions in the dimer. They found that any interglutamine interactions, if present, did not appreciably slow the motion of backbone amide groups. While no experimental evidence has been found of interglutamine interactions in these CI2 chimeras, we believe that this is due to the small insert-length of 4–10 glutamines in previous studies, far below the pathogenic threshold (35–45 glutamines). We hypothesize that once the insertion length exceeds the pathogenic threshold the CI2 model system will aggregate in a different pathway, which might be relevant to in vivo toxicity. Because the CI2-polyQ model system has been explored by previous experimental (3Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl.

J. 2004; 87: 1900-1918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) studies, we systematically studied the conformational dynamics of chimeric CI2-polyQ proteins with a variety of insert lengths (4–80 glutamines), including glutamine tracts longer than the pathogenic threshold. In chimeric CI2 monomers, we observed a decrease in folding cooperativity as a function of increasing polyQ insertion length. Using a coarse-grained protein model, molecular dynamics simulations also fully recapitulated the known crystal structure of CI2 domain-swapped dimers. We observed that the dominant mode of dimer formation in CI2 chimeras change from domain swapping to interglutamine interactions as polyQ insert length increased beyond the pathogenic threshold. The observation of the length-dependent folding/aggregation behavior in the polyQ-inserted CI2 protein, a non-amyloidogenic protein, supports a mechanism for polyQ-mediated aggregation in which insert length determines the degree of intra- versus interchain interactions: at small insert lengths, the destabilization induced by the introduction of polyglutamine leads to domain-swapping whereas at large insert lengths (greater than pathogenic threshold) interchain glutamine-glutamine interactions dominate and lead to aggregation. Discrete Molecular Dynamics—Discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) is employed to study protein conformational dynamics. The detailed description of the DMD algorithm can be found in Ref. 20Smith S.W. Hall C.K. Freeman B.D. J. Comp. Phys. 1997; 134: 16-30Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Rapaport D.C. The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulations.

Fold Des. 1998; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar. In DMD, interatomic interactions are governed by square-well potential functions. Neighboring interactions, such as bonds, bond angles, and dihedrals, are modeled by infinitely high square well potentials. During a simulation, atom velocity remains constant until a potential step is encountered, where it changes instantaneously according to the conservations of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. Simulations proceed as a series of such collisions, with a rapid sorting algorithm employed at each step to determine the following collision. CI2-PolyQ Model—Proteins are modeled using a “beads-on-a-string” approach, in which four pseudo-atoms represent the N, Cα, C′, and O atoms of the backbone, with optional beads representing the sidechain depending on the residue type (6Khare S.D. Ding F. Gwanmesia K.N. Dokholyan N.V. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 230-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ab initio folding of CI2 protein in silico remains a challenge in computational biology. To ensure the proper folding of CI2 protein, we use a Gō-like potential, which favors native contacts and ensures that the native structure is the energetic ground state. For simplicity, all non-glycine residues of the CI2 host protein are modeled as alanines, with Cβ atoms as the interaction centers. Two side-chain beads are used to model the inserted glutamines: one bead (the β-bead) for the Cβ and Cγ atoms, and another bead (the γ-bead) for the carboxylamine group (6Khare S.D. Ding F. Gwanmesia K.N. Dokholyan N.V. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 230-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the polyQ insertion, we use a physical interaction model as in Ref. 23Ding F. Guo W.

A. 2004; 101: 13786-13791Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, including hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The parameters to model the topology of each amino acids and peptide bonds between consecutive residues have been published previously (6Khare S.D. Ding F. Gwanmesia K.N. Dokholyan N.V. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 230-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ding F. Buldyrev S.V. Dokholyan N.V. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition to the existing sidechain-backbone and backbone-backbone hydrogen bond interactions of this previous model, we introduce sidechain-sidechain hydrogen bonds between the glutamine γ-beads. We specify that a given glutamine residue can engage in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds, because a carboxylamine group can donate two protons and accept two protons. To model the aggregation of polyQ-inserted proteins, we use the symmetrical Gō potential (23Ding F. Guo W. Dokholyan N.V. Shakhnovich E.I. Shea J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 1035-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Ding F. Prutzman K.C. Campbell S.L. Dokholyan N.V.

A. 2004; 101: 13786-13791Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), where native-like interactions between residues from different molecules are energetically favored. Such a model has been successfully used to model protein aggregation (22Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3525-3532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The physical interaction model, describing the glutamine interaction, comprises hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, including backbone-backbone, sidechain backbone, and sidechain-sidechain interactions. To tune the relative contributions of the structure- and physics-based models, we use the simple criteria that the folding-transition temperature of CI2 (6Khare S.D. Ding F. Gwanmesia K.N. Dokholyan N.V. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 230-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the melting temperature of isolated polyQ peptides (15Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) should be comparable. Accordingly, we assign the strength of the Gō-potential as 1ϵ, and the strengths of hydrophobic interactions as well as backbone-backbone, sidechain backbone, and sidechain-sidechain hydrogen-bonding interactions as 0.7ϵ, 5ϵ, 2.4ϵ, and 5ϵ, respectively. We tested the relative interaction contributions by performing folding simulations of chimeric CI2 with polyQ insertions from 4 to 10, which are experimentally shown to have similar stability to the wild type (15Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We found that small perturbations of the relative ratio between the structure-based potential and the physical potential do not affect the relative folding transition temperature (Tm, a measure of the folding stability) of chimeric CI2. Temperature is in the unit of ϵ/kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Replica-Exchange DMD Simulations—Efficient exploration of the potential energy landscape of molecular systems is the central theme of most molecular modeling applications. Sampling efficiency at a given temperature is governed by the ruggedness, and the slope toward the energy minimum in the land-scape. Although passage out of local minima is accelerated at higher temperatures, the free energy landscape is altered due to larger entropic contributions. To efficiently overcome energy barriers while maintaining conformational sampling corresponding to a relevant free energy surface, we utilize the replica exchange sampling scheme (28Zhou R. Berne B.J. Germain R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14931-14936Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 29Sugita Y. Okamoto Y. Chem. Phys.

In replica exchange computing, multiple simulations or replicas of the same system are performed in parallel at different temperatures. Individual simulations are coupled through Monte Carlo-based exchanges of simulation temperatures between replicas at periodic time intervals. Temperatures are exchanged between two replicas, i and j, maintained at temperatures Ti and Tj and with energies Ei and Ej according to the canonical Metropolis criterion (33Allen M.P. Tildesley D.J. Computer Simulations of Liquids. Clarendon Press, Oxford1987: 110-139Google Scholar) with the exchange probability where p = 1 if Δ= (1/kBTi - 1/kBTj) (Ej - Ei) ≤ 0 and p = exp(-Δ), if Δ> 0. Monomer simulations were performed over a set of temperatures ranging from 0.7 to 1.35 {0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975, 1.00, 1.025, 1.040, 1.050, 1.060, 1.075, 1.10, 1.15, 1.20, 1.35} in the serial DMD simulations. Each simulation of dimer formation was conducted for 96 h and comprised 8 replicas, which were individually switched between 8 temperatures in the range of {0.95, 0.98, 1.00, 1.04, 1.07, 1.10, 1.13, 1.16}. Temperature ranges in dimer simulations include the folding transition temperature of the corresponding monomer. A box size of 350 Å, corresponding to the 80 μm concentration, was used for these simulations. Starting from a fully extended conformation, we performed a total time length of 106 time units (t.u.) for each simulation. In the replica exchange simulations, we performed the exchange every 500 time units. The time unit is determined by the units of mass, length, and energy used in the simulation. CI2 chimeras containing glutamine inserts of length 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, and 80 glutamines inserted between residues 43 and 44 were modeled. For brevity, a protein with an insert of N glutamines will be referred to as CI2-QN. All simulations were started from fully extended conformations. As the Insert Length Increases, Folding Cooperativity Decreases Without Significantly Altering Thermodynamic Stability—All monomer simulations display an apparent two-state folding transition similar to that for wild-type CI2. In Fig. 1a, we present a typical folding transition for CI2 with various lengths of glutamine insertion. At temperatures below the folding transition temperature (TF ∼ 1.05ϵ/kBT), the protein remains in a folded conformation with low potential energies. A sharp transition of potential energy is observed at TF, and the protein remains fully unfolded with high energies at temperatures higher than TF. Hence, TF corresponds to the peak in the specific heat plot (Fig. 1b). The folding transition temperature TF corresponds to the midpoint temperature Tm in thermal denaturation experiments. Hence, the value of TF can serve as a measure of protein thermodynamic folding stability. We find that all CI2 chimeras with different lengths have similar values for TF, suggesting that insertion of glutamines in the loop region of CI2 does not significantly alter the stability of the protein. This is in agreement with previous experimental results (15Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The width of the transition peak in a specific heat plot (Fig. 1b) is an indicator of folding cooperativity for a protein, which is in turn related to the excitation barrier of folding/unfolding events. We define the peak width of specific heat plot by the temperature range with specific heat values larger than half of the peak value (Table 1 and Fig. 1b). For insert lengths of 4–10 glutamines, specific heat peak width does not vary significantly from the wild-type protein. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Ladurner and Fersht (15Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that the folding rate (excitation barrier of free energy) of CI2 chimeras is not affected by short polyQ inserts within experimental precision. In CI2 with insert lengths of 30 or more glutamines, we observe a significant broadening of the peak width, suggesting a decrease in the folding cooperativity of the monomers. We conclude that as the insertion length increases toward the pathogenic threshold and beyond, the transition barrier between the folded and unfolded states decreases significantly. As a result, the proteins with long inserts spend more time in an unfolded or partially unfolded state.TABLE 1The estimated TF and width of the specific heat peak, dThalf The TF is defined as the temperature with the largest specific heat.Insertion lengthTF(ϵ/kBT)dThalf(ϵ/kBT)wt CI21.070.13Q41.060.12Q61.050.14Q81.060.14Q101.060.12Q201.070.11Q301.050.14Q401.070.16Q501.050.18Q601.040.23Q701.050.24 Open table in a new tab CI2 Chimeras with Small Insertion Lengths Associate via Domain-swapping—It has been proposed that domain-swapping association is governed by the monomer topology and the location of the flexible hinge region within a monomer determines the structure of domain-swapped oligomers (24Ding F. Prutzman K.C. Campbell S.L. Dokholyan N.V. Structure. 2006; 14: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Yang S. Cho S.S. Levy Y. Cheung M.S. Levine H. Wolynes P.G. Onuchic J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13786-13791Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine these hinge regions, we use a recently developed H-Predictor (24Ding F. Prutzman K.C. Campbell S.L. Dokholyan N.V. Structure. 2006; 14: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to compute each residues propensity to participate in the domain-swapping hinge region. A low H-predictor score (ΔE/ΔL) for a given residue indicates a high propensity to be involved in the hinge region in a domain-swapped structure. For CI2-Q4, the H-Predictor identifies a hinge region (marked in red in Fig. 2a) that encompasses the glutamine insert, and similar results are obtained for other insertion lengths (data not shown). In agreement with experimental findings that CI2-QN (4 ≤ N ≤ 10) associate by domain swapping (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we observe that DMD simulations of CI2-Q4 and CI2-Q10 show frequent formation of domain-swapped dimers (Fig. 2b). The hinge regions of the modeled and experimentally determined structures agree with those identified by H-predictor. The crystal structure of the CI2-Q4 dimer has been determined by x-ray crystallography (PDB ID 1CQ4) (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and provides an invaluable benchmark to validate our models. Because of high B-factors, the crystal structure of the flexible glutamine inserts was not experimentally determined (Fig. 2c). Although the relative orientation of the two folded CI2 domains (pseudomonomers) within the domain-swapped dimer is variable, the centroid dimer conformation from simulations (Fig. 2b) agrees with the location of the hinge region and the orientation of dimers within the crystal lattice given pictorially in Chen et al. (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, the centroid conformation is defined as the dimer conformation with the smallest average R.M.S.D. to all other dimer conformations from the simulations. The relative R.M.S.D. between the two structures is ≈4Å. We next studied the dynamic features of the glutamine inserts in the CI2-Q4 and CI2-Q10 domain-swapped dimers. We compute frequency maps, defined as matrices of contact frequencies for each pair of residues, for each dimer along its simulation trajectory. We find that persistent native-like contacts, definitive of association by domain swapping, formed between monomers. The frequency of interglutamine contacts (circled in Fig. 2d) is weaker than that of the interdomain contacts, suggesting that the polyQ tract is flexible and does not form persistent structures in the domain-swapped dimer. This observation explains the high B-factor in the x-ray crystal structure, and also agrees with NMR studies of these dimers, in which permanent interglutamine interactions were not found (13Gordon-Smith D.J. Carbajo R.J. Stott K. Neuhaus D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our simulation studies show that CI2 chimeras with small insertion length (N < 20) associate by a domain-swapping mechanism, where the driving force is native-like CI2 interactions. These aggregates contain insertion lengths far below the pathogenic threshold, and possess few non-native structural features. CI2 Chimeras with Insertion Lengths Close to or Beyond Pathogenic Threshold Associate by Interglutamine Contacts—To determine the association mechanism of CI2 chimeras with longer inserts, we computed the average number of contacts per residue for interdomain and interglutamine interactions (Fig. 3a). Here, interdomain contacts of CI2 residues are defined as interactions between the first 43 residues of one protein and the last 25 residues of the opposite protein. The interglutamine interactions include all interprotein contacts between glutamine residues. Data are collected for all simulations in which the centers of mass of the two proteins fall within a cutoff distance of 30 Å along a specific simulation trajectory, indicating that a putative dimer is successfully formed (Fig. 3a). A cutoff of 7.5 Å between the Cβ atoms of each residue (Cα for Gly) is used. We observe that the dominant mode of association of CI2-QN with N < 20 is domain-swapping (Fig. 3a). This result agrees with the experiments of Stott et al. (14Stott K. Blackburn J.M. Butler P.J. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6509-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) in which short insert mutants (CI2-Q4, CI2-Q10) were found to associate exclusively by domain swapping. However, we find that the frequency of interglutamine interactions surpasses that of interdomain contacts in CI2 with more than 35–40 inserted glutamines. Interestingly, this transition coincides with the pathogenic threshold for polyQ disorders. For insertion lengths longer than 30 glutamines, we also find that the average rate of protein association increases along with the length of the insert (data not shown). Our results suggest that any protein, even such a “benign” protein as CI2, can be driven to aggregate by a glutamine-mediated mechanism when the polyQ insertion exceeds a certain critical length. Chimeric CI2 with an inserted polyQ tract has been experimentally employed as the in vitro model system to study polyQ repeat disease. Many experimental studies of polyQ-containing peptides and proteins are available to serve as computational benchmark for in silico studies of polyQ aggregation (3Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4Poirier M.A. Li H.

Biol. 1993; 3: 249-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have constructed a model of chimeric CI2 proteins with polyQ insertions of varying lengths. Simulations of proteins with short insertions (N < 20) recapitulate experimentally determined thermodynamic and kinetic properties of aggregation: 1) We find that the folding transition temperature TF does not change with increasing insertion length. Because TF corresponds to Tm, a measure of stability, our results agree with the conclusion of Ladurner and Fersht (15Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that short polyQ inserts do not alter the stability of CI2 chimeras. 2) We find that chimeras with short inserts associate by a domain-swapping mechanism. The simulation-derived structure for the CI2-Q4 domain-swapped dimer is in full agreement with the crystal structure (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 3) The polyQ tract within short insert domain-swapped dimers is highly dynamic, which is consistent with the corresponding high B-factor in the crystal structure (12Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and NMR study of Gordon-Smith et al. (13Gordon-Smith D.J. Carbajo R.J. Stott K. Neuhaus D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These benchmark tests validate our computational model. Our simulation studies provide a possible scenario for the polyQ-mediated aggregation. Although polyQ insertion does not alter the folding stability of the protein, it reduces the excitation barrier for the unfolding process, as indicated by reduced folding cooperativity in proteins with longer polyQ inserts. As a result, even under native-like conditions, polyQ-expanded protein spends more time in a partially folded conformation than wild-type protein. Such intermediates have been implicated in the aggregation of human lysozyme variants (34Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). For shorter glutamine inserts, the unfolded state is rescued by the formation of domain-swapped aggregates, because the energy benefit of forming native interactions dominates over that of the polyQ-mediated interactions. However, as the insertion length exceeds the pathogenic threshold (35Bhattacharyya A.M. Thakur A.K. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15400-15405Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar–40), the glutamine-mediated interactions, mainly hydrogen bonds, dominate over the native contacts. The increased propensity of inter-polyQ interactions as the insertion length increases is compatible with Wetzel and co-workers (35Bhattacharyya A.M. Thakur A.K. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15400-15405Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 36Crick S.L. Jayaraman M. Frieden C. Wetzel R. Pappu R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16764-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) discovery that nucleation takes place in monomer, because the rate-limiting step of aggregation can be the formation of nucleus in each monomer. This scenario is also consistent with the theoretical and experimental results from Pappu and co-workers (36Crick S.L. Jayaraman M. Frieden C. Wetzel R. Pappu R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16764-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 37Wang X. Vitalis A. Wyczalkowski M.A. Pappu R.V. Proteins. 2006; 63: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that monomeric polyQ peptides form collapsed states. Their studies support the association of polyQ peptides in the same way as the collapse of isolated polyQ chains. To find potential structural features of polyQ aggregates, we searched for persistent conformations present in CI2 monomers and dimers over a range of insertion lengths. We do not find the presence of regular secondary structure elements within the polyQ region, such as β-strands or β-helices, postulated to be the building blocks of the amyloid aggregate. However, within the time-scale of our simulations, we observe the transient formation of β-helices within CI2 monomers with insertion length of 40 (Fig. 3b). This fact suggests that the formation of persistent, ordered structural elements composing an aggregate occurs on a time scale much larger than that sampled by our simulations, and requires large structural rearrangements within multiple (more than two) chains of the protein. We believe that our simulations capture the early steps in the process of aggregate formation."
https://openalex.org/W2074161884,"The role of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) in the regulation of energy metabolism and immune system by locally reactivating glucocorticoids has been extensively studied. Experiments determining initial rates of enzyme activity revealed that 11beta-HSD1 can catalyze both the reductase and the dehydrogenase reaction in cell lysates, whereas it predominantly catalyzes the reduction of cortisone to cortisol in intact cells that also express hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), which provides cofactor NADPH. Besides its role in glucocorticoid metabolism, there is evidence that 11beta-HSD1 is involved in the metabolism of 7-keto- and 7-hydroxy-steroids; however the impact of H6PDH on this alternative function of 11beta-HSD1 has not been assessed.We investigated the 11beta-HSD1-dependent metabolism of the neurosteroids 7-keto-, 7alpha-hydroxy- and 7beta-hydroxy-dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 7-keto- and 7beta-hydroxy-pregnenolone, respectively, in the absence or presence of H6PDH in intact cells. 3D-structural modeling was applied to study the binding of ligands in 11beta-HSD1.We demonstrated that 11beta-HSD1 functions in a reversible way and efficiently catalyzed the interconversion of these 7-keto- and 7-hydroxy-neurosteroids in intact cells. In the presence of H6PDH, 11beta-HSD1 predominantly converted 7-keto-DHEA and 7-ketopregnenolone into their corresponding 7beta-hydroxy metabolites, indicating a role for H6PDH and 11beta-HSD1 in the local generation of 7beta-hydroxy-neurosteroids. 3D-structural modeling offered an explanation for the preferred formation of 7beta-hydroxy-neurosteroids.Our results from experiments determining the steady state concentrations of glucocorticoids or 7-oxygenated neurosteroids suggested that the equilibrium between cortisone and cortisol and between 7-keto- and 7-hydroxy-neurosteroids is regulated by 11beta-HSD1 and greatly depends on the coexpression with H6PDH. Thus, the impact of H6PDH on 11beta-HSD1 activity has to be considered for understanding both glucocorticoid and neurosteroid action in different tissues."

They have saved millions of lives and helped to curb many devastating diseases. Since the advent of antibiotics in the middle of the 20th century, the main challenge of antibiotic therapy has been fighting infections caused by bacterial pathogens that have developed resistance to the available drugs. Not a single class of antibiotics has escaped the inevitable emergence of resistance. Currently, the constant development of new drugs is the only available strategy to keep up with an ever-growing variety of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.The development of microbial genomics brought new hope to the drug discovery field. Several hundred bacterial genes were found to be essential (1Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10268-10273Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2Hutchison C.A. Peterson S.N. Gill S.R. Cline R.T. White O. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1999; 286: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and many others were identified as virulence genes (3Schoolnik G.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The products of such genes are viewed as promising drug targets. Until now, however, very few successful drug candidates have been produced with the help of genomics (4Thomson C.J. Power E. Ruebsamen-Waigmann H. Labischinski H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).An alternative approach is to follow the lead of nature and to develop new drugs that act on the targets “experimentally validated” in the course of evolution. Among such targets, the ribosome is the preferred one; more than half of all the known antibiotics arrest cell growth by interfering with the ribosome functions and inhibiting protein synthesis.The ribosome, which has a molecular weight of 2.5 million daltons, is one of the largest enzymes in the cell. Each of the two ribosomal subunits is built of RNA and proteins, with ribosomal RNA being the main structural and functional component of the ribosome. The ability of the ribosome to carry out efficient and accurate translation depends on the structural integrity and operational competence of its multiple functional centers. Perturbing rRNA structure, its conformational flexibility, or its interaction with the ligands should have a profound effect on translation. Therefore, not surprisingly, most antibiotics that act on the ribosome interact directly with rRNA (see Refs. 5Poehlsgaard J. Douthwaite S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6Franceschi F. Duffy E.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Tenson T. Mankin A.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar for reviews). The sites of action of many drugs have been mapped to the main functional centers, and their mechanisms of action have been elucidated (8Schlunzen F. Zarivach R. Harms J. Bashan A. Tocilj A.

However, it is generally unknown which of the functional sites, besides the main ones, can be targeted by antibiotics.In the small ribosomal subunit, antibiotics act upon a variety of sites where the drugs may affect binding of tRNAs, displace mRNA, or interfere with translocation (11Moazed D.

In a striking contrast, the distribution of sites of antibiotic action in the large ribosomal subunit is highly constrained. Despite the enormous size of the large subunit, the multiplicity of activities in which it is involved, and the diversity of drugs that inhibit the large subunit functions, all clinically relevant antibiotics act on essentially one site: the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) 3The abbreviations used are: PTC, peptidyltransferase center; BME, 2-mercaptoethanol; nt, nucleotide(s). 3The abbreviations used are: PTC, peptidyltransferase center; BME, 2-mercaptoethanol; nt, nucleotide(s). and the adjacent region of the nascent peptide exit tunnel (5Poehlsgaard J.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Only two other sites in the bacterial large ribosomal subunit, the GTPase-associated center and the translation factor binding region, are targeted by a few other known antibiotics (19Thompson J. Schmidt F. Cundliffe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7915-7917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Porse B.T. Leviev I. Mankin A.S. Garrett R.A. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, one would expect that binding of small molecules to other, yet undiscovered, sites could inhibit functions of the large ribosomal subunits (24Schroeder S.J. Blaha G. Tirado-Rives J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Protein synthesis inhibitors act on critical centers of the ribosome, where structural perturbations have a detrimental effect on the ribosome functions. Similar perturbations can be caused by mutations. As a result, there is a clear correlation between the distribution of the known deleterious mutations in rRNA and the location of antibiotic-binding sites in the ribosome. We therefore reasoned that the clustering of deleterious mutations at a particular ribosomal locale may help in identifying new centers that can be targeted by antibiotics. With the general goal to identify new putative sites of antibiotic action and to map new functionally and structurally critical centers in the ribosome, we used random mutant rRNA libraries to isolate and characterize a variety of deleterious mutations in rRNA of the small and large ribosomal subunits. In our previous work, we reported a collection of deleterious mutations in 16 S rRNA that highlighted several sites as potential antibiotic targets (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several regions of previously unrecognized functional importance were found where rRNA mutations had a strong deleterious effect on translation. A conceptually similar but complementary approach has been applied to 16 S rRNA by Cunningham and co-workers (26Laios E. Waddington M. Saraiya A.A. Baker K.A. O'Connor E. Pamarathy D. Cunningham P.R. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2004; 128: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we describe the results of mutational studies of rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit. Clusters of deleterious mutations in 23 S rRNA pinpointed several regions in the large ribosomal subunit that are sensitive to structural alterations and thus may be targeted by new protein synthesis inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Strains—The 10,617-bp plasmid pLK35 (27Douthwaite S. Powers T. Lee J.Y. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) carries an Escherichia coli rRNA operon rrnB under the control of the λ PL promoter and the ampicillin resistance gene as a selective marker. The 10,055-bp pLK45 plasmid (28Powers T. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) is a derivative of pLK35 that carries a spectinomycin resistance mutation C1192T in the 16 S rRNA gene and an erythromycin resistance mutation A2058G in the 23 S rRNA gene. Compared with pLK35, pLK45 lacks ∼550 bp downstream from the rrnB operon. For inducible expression of plasmid-borne rRNA operon, pLK35 and pLK45 plasmids were propagated in the E. coli strain POP2136 (29Rottmann N. Kleuvers B. Atmadja J. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (F- glnV44 hsdR17 endA1 thi-1 aroB mal- cI857 λ PR TetR) (New England Biolabs). Constitutive expression of the plasmid-borne rRNA operon was achieved in the E. coli strain JM109 (endA1, recA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17 (r-k, m+k), relA1, supE44 (lac-proAB) (F′, traD36, proAB, laqIqZΔM15)) (Promega) that lacks the λ repressor. Random mutagenesis of pLK45 was carried out in the E. coli mutator strain XL-1 Red (endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac mutD5 mutS mutT Tn 10 (Tetr)a) (Stratagene).Mutagenesis and Construction of Segment-Mutant Libraries—Mutagenesis and fragment exchange were carried out essentially as described previously (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the E. coli mutator strain XL-1 Red was transformed with the plasmid pLG857 (30Remaut E. Stanssens P. Fiers W. Gene (Amst. 1981; 15 (.)): 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) that carries a copy of the temperature-sensitive λ repressor gene cI857 and a kanamycin resistance marker. The plasmid pLK45 was introduced into pLG857-containing XL-1 Red cells and propagated for 1 day at 30 °C (under conditions where pLK45-borne rRNA operon is not expressed). The mutated pLK45 plasmid was isolated and used as a template for PCR amplification. rDNA segments corresponding to the rrnB segments flanked by the restriction sites unique in pLK45 were PCR-amplified using low mutation frequency Triple Master enzyme mixture (Eppendorf). Primers GTGATAAGCAATTTTCGTGTCCCC and CACACGCCTAAGCGTGCTCCCACT were used to amplify the XbaI-SnaBI segment (library C), CCGGCGAGGGGAGTGAAAAAGAAC and GTCAGCATTCGCACTTCTGATACC primers were used for amplification of the SnaBI-SphI segment (library D), AAGCCTGCGAAGGTGTGCTGTGAG and GAGACAGCCTGGCCATCATTACGC primers were used to amplify the SphI-BsgI segment (library E), and ACGGTCCTAAGGTAGCGAAATTCC and TGAATCCGTTAGCGAGGTGCCGCC primers were used to generate the BsgI-BamHI segment (library F) (see Fig. 1). PCR products were cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes and cloned into unmutated pLK45 cut with the same enzymes. Segment-mutant libraries were transformed into POP2136 cells and plated onto LB agar/ampicillin plates that were incubated at 30 °C. The resulting segment-mutant libraries were enriched in clones carrying deleterious mutations by one round of negative selection as described previously (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Screening of the Segment-Mutant Libraries and Mapping of the rRNA Mutations—A robotic colony picker (Biopick BP600; BioRobotics) was used to inoculate 8,000 colonies from library C and 12,000 colonies from each of libraries D, E, and F into 90-μl LB/ampicillin broth cultures in 384-well plates. After growing at 30 °C for 48 h, each plate was replicated using a 384-pin replicator (Boekel) into two new plates, one with LB/ampicillin medium and one with LB/ampicillin supplemented with 15 μg/ml erythromycin. The former (control) plate was incubated overnight at 30 °C; the latter plate was incubated overnight at 42 °C. Culture densities were read at 600 nm using the Spectra Max Plus384 plate reader (Amersham Biosciences). Clones that exhibited poor growth at 42 °C were rearranged into 96-well plates with fresh medium, and the phenotypes were retested. Plasmids were isolated from clones that reproducibly exhibited poor growth at 42 °C. The mutagenized rrn segments were sequenced using the same primers that were used for PCR amplification. The severity of the deleterious phenotype was assessed by testing the ability of the mutant plasmids to transform E. coli JM109 cells at 37 °C or POP2136 cells at 42 °C.Introduction of the Mutations into the pLK35 Plasmid—The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate selected mutations in the pLK35 plasmid. Mutagenesis was carried out using the supplier’s protocol (Stratagene) with the following PCR conditions: 95 °C for 2 min (95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 25 min) × 18 cycles. The generated PCR products were treated with DpnI restriction enzyme and transformed into POP2136 cells. Fragment exchange was used for introduction of the 34-nt deletion in helix 38 in the pLK35 plasmid. The XbaI-SphI segment was excised from the plasmid pLK1192U that carried a deletion of the 872-905 segment of 23 S rRNA (31Sergiev P.V. Kiparisov S.V. Burakovsky D.E. Lesnyak D.V. Leonov A.A.

Biol. 2005; 353: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), purified in 1% Sea-Plaque agarose gel (Cambrex), and cloned into pLK35 vector cut with the same restriction enzymes. The U860C mutation was then introduced into the resulting plasmid using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit.Polysome Profile Analysis—Polysomes were analyzed as described previously (32Ron E.Z.

The ratio of mutant 23 S rRNA to wild-type 23 S rRNA in the gradient fractions was assessed with a primer extension inhibition assay (34Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using the primer GTAAAGGTTCACGGGGTC specific for the pLK45-resident mutation A2058G. Primer extension products were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Preparation of the Mutant 50 S Subunits—The cultures of POP2136 cells carrying the pLK35 plasmid or its derivatives were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB/ampicillin and then diluted 1:600 to 1:2500 into 1 liter of fresh LB/ampicillin medium. After shaking for 2 h at 30 °C, the temperature was raised to 42 °C, and cultures were grown for about 4 h until A600 reached 0.5. Cells were pelleted at 8,000 rpm in a JLA-10.5 rotor (Beckman) for 10 min at 4 °C, and cell pellets were kept frozen at -70 °C. Ribosomes were prepared following the published protocols (35Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Frozen pellets were thawed in an ice-water bath, washed with 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 mm BME), pelleted by centrifugation in a JA-25.5 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C, and then resuspended in 20 ml of cold buffer A. Cells were lysed by passage through a French press at 18,000 p.s.i. 10 μl (1 unit/μl) of RQ1 DNase (Promega) was added, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation two times in the JA-25.5 rotor at 4 °C (16,000 rpm for 15 min and then 24,000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatant was layered onto a 10-ml 1.1 m sucrose cushion in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA) in a Beckman Optiseal polyallomer tube, and the tube was topped off with buffer B. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor at 33,000 rpm for 22 h at 4 °C. Ribosome pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm BME) and then resuspended in 300 μl of the same buffer. Optical density (A260) was determined, and samples were aliquoted, snap-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at -70 °C. For subunit preparation, 150 A260 of the sample was layered on 36 ml of 10-40% sucrose gradient prepared in buffer D, and the gradients were centrifuged in a Sorvall AH 629 rotor at 23,500 rpm for 18.5 h. Gradients were fractionated using a gradient fractionator (Brandel), and absorbance was monitored at 280 nm using an ISCO UA-6 absorbance detector. 1-ml fractions were collected into Eppendorf tubes. Fractions corresponding to 30, 42, and 50 S peaks were pooled, the MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to 10 mm, and buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm BME) was added to bring the sample volume to 9 ml. Ribosomal subunits were pelleted by centrifugation in a Ti-50 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Subunit pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer C and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Optical density (A260) of the resuspended subunits was determined, and the samples were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes, snap-frozen, and stored at -70 °C.Association of Ribosomal Subunits—One A260 of 30 S (72 pmol) and 50 S (36 pmol) subunits were combined in 250 μl of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NH4Cl, 15 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm BME) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. In some experiments, 2.2 μg (90 pmol) of tRNAfMet and 8 μg (500 pmol) of MFV mRNA (GGGAAAAGAAAAGAAAAGAAAAUGUUCGUUAAAAGAAAAGAAAAGAAAU) (36Polacek N. Patzke S. Nierhaus K.H. Barta A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were included in the reactions. Samples were layered onto 11 ml of 10-40% sucrose gradient in buffer E and centrifuged in an SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 23,500 rpm for 13-16 h at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated through the ISCO UA-6 absorbance detector.RESULTSSelection of Deleterious Mutations in 23 S rRNA—Our strategy for identification of critical structural and functional sites in the large ribosomal subunit was based on mapping deleterious mutations in the 50 S subunit rRNA. The experimental approach involved preparing libraries of clones in which randomly mutated plasmid-borne rRNA genes would be conditionally expressed, enriching the libraries in clones with deleterious mutations, and mapping the positions of the mutations.Random mutations were generated in the E. coli rrnB rRNA operon expressed under the control of the λ PL promoter in the pLK45 plasmid (28Powers T. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The plasmids were propagated in the E. coli strain POP2136 that carries the temperature-sensitive λ repressor. In this strain, transcription of the plasmid-borne rRNA operon is activated at 42 °C and is repressed at 30 °C. The plasmid-borne rrnB carries spectinomycin resistance mutation C1192T in the 16 S rRNA gene and erythromycin resistance mutation A2058G in 23 S rRNA genes. The presence of these mutations facilitates monitoring the expression of the plasmid-borne rRNA genes by primer extension analysis (34Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Powers T. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). According to this analysis, 3.5-4 h after shifting the temperature to 42 °C, the plasmid-encoded 23 S rRNA accounts for 40-60% of the total 23 S rRNA in POP2136 cells harboring pLK45 plasmids (38Lieberman K.R. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).As previously described in detail, the plasmid pLK45 was randomly mutagenized by propagating it in the mutator E. coli strain (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Individual segments of the mutated rrnB were PCR-amplified and cloned back into unmutated pLK45. In the resulting “segment-mutant libraries,” only a specific segment of the plasmid-borne rRNA operon carried the mutations. This experimental setup facilitated subsequent mapping and analysis of the mutations. Two of the segment-mutant libraries that span the 16 S rRNA gene have been described previously (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We now completed the rrnB mutagenesis by preparing four new segment-mutant libraries (C, D, E, and F) that covered the entire 23 and 5 S rRNA genes (Fig. 1). The mutated 781-bp segment in the library C bounded by the unique XbaI and SnaBI restriction sites included 259 bp of the 16-23 S intergenic spacer and a 522-bp 5′-terminal portion of the rrlB gene comprising domain I of 23 S rRNA. Library D, flanked by the SnaBI and SphI restriction sites, carried mutations in a 709-bp segment of the 23 S gene representing domain II. The SphI-BsgI 735-bp mutated segment in library E comprised domains III and IV. Finally, library F contained a 1497-bp mutated BsgI-BamHI segment that encoded 937 nt of domains V and VI of 23 S rRNA, the 23 S/5 S spacer, and the entire 5 S rRNA gene and included a 348-bp region downstream of the rrnB operon.After subjecting each library to one round of negative selection, which increased the representation of deleterious mutations (25Yassin A. Fredrick K. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16620-16625Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the libraries were plated on agar/ampicillin plates that were incubated at 30 °C. Individual clones were then tested for their ability to grow in liquid culture at 42 °C when mutant rRNA is expressed.Eight thousand clones from library C and 12,000 clones from each of libraries D, E, and F were individually tested, and ∼1,200 clones that grew poorly at 42 °C were initially selected. The phenotypes of the clones were retested, and the mutated rDNA segments were sequenced in 360 clones using the primers flanking the corresponding cloning sites. The analysis of sequencing data showed that ∼8% of the sequenced clones contained more than one mutation. Most of those clones were excluded from further analysis, since their investigation would necessitate the segregation of mutations. A number of the clones containing cloning defects, such as cloning site mutations, insertions or deletions of rDNA segments, or other plasmid rearrangements, were also excluded.As a result of this analysis, a total of 77 individual deleterious mutations were identified in 23 S rRNA (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Of these, 69 were single-base substitutions, and eight were single-nucleotide deletions occurring in runs of identical nucleotides. Three clones carried a mutation in the 23 S rRNA gene and an additional mutation in one of the transcribed spacers. One such clone from library C had a G380A mutation in 23 S rRNA and a mutation in the 16 S/23 S spacer (273 nt downstream from the 3′ end of the 16 S rRNA gene, in the intergenic spacer separating the tRNAGlu and 23 S rRNA genes). Two clones from library F (A2453G and ΔC 2556) each had an additional mutation, 356 and 321 nt downstream from the 3′ end of the 5 S rRNA gene, respectively. Because no clones with deleterious mutations exclusively in the intergenic spacers were found, we assumed that poor growth of these three clones was due to the expression of the mutant rRNA and tentatively included them in our analysis. No deleterious mutations were found in the 5 S rRNA gene.FIGURE 2Deleterious mutations in 23 S rRNA identified in this work. Mutations are colored according to the severity of the deleterious phenotype: strongly deleterious (red), moderately deleterious (blue), and mildly deleterious (green). A and B, positions of deleterious mutations in the 23 S rRNA primary and secondary structures, respectively. In B, nucleotide deletions in the stretches of nucleotide duplications are marked with asterisks; the precise position of the mutation within a stretch is unknown, and the indicated nucleotide position was chosen arbitrarily.

https://openalex.org/W2157573031,"Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) have become a major focus of interest in recent years. A number of reverse engineering approaches have been developed to help uncover the regulatory networks giving rise to the observed gene expression profiles. However, this is an overspecified problem due to the fact that more than one genotype (network wiring) can give rise to the same phenotype. We refer to this phenomenon as ""gene elasticity."" In this work, we study the effect of this particular problem on the pure, data-driven inference of gene regulatory networks.We simulated a four-gene network in order to produce ""data"" (protein levels) that we use in lieu of real experimental data. We then optimized the network connections between the four genes with a view to obtain the original network that gave rise to the data. We did this for two different cases: one in which only the network connections were optimized and the other in which both the network connections as well as the kinetic parameters (given as reaction probabilities in our case) were estimated. We observed that multiple genotypes gave rise to very similar protein levels. Statistical experimentation indicates that it is impossible to differentiate between the different networks on the basis of both equilibrium as well as dynamic data.We show explicitly that reverse engineering of GRNs from pure expression data is an indeterminate problem. Our results suggest the unsuitability of an inferential, purely data-driven approach for the reverse engineering transcriptional networks in the case of gene regulatory networks displaying a certain level of complexity."

Gene expression data show that SRF and its transcriptional cofactors are also expressed in lymphocyte precursors and mature lymphocytes. However, the role of SRF in lymphocyte development has not been addressed in vivo so far, attributed in part to early embryonic lethality of conventional Srf-null mice. To determine the in vivo role of SRF in developing lymphocytes, we specifically inactivated the murine Srf gene during T or B cell development using lymphocyte-specific Cre transgenic mouse lines. T cell-specific Srf deletion led to a severe block in thymocyte development at the transition from CD4/CD8 double to single positive stage. The few residual T cells detectable in the periphery retained at least one functional Srf allele, thereby demonstrating the importance of SRF in T cell development. In contrast, deletion of Srf in developing B cells did not interfere with the growth and survival of B cells in general, yet led to a complete loss of marginal zone B cells and a marked reduction of the CD5+ B cell subset. Our study also revealed a contribution of SRF to the expression of the surface molecules IgM, CD19, and the chemokine receptor 4 in B lymphocytes. We conclude that SRF fulfills essential and distinct functions in the differentiation of different types of lymphocytes.

Several studies support the importance of these genes for lymphocyte development: Overexpression of c-fos in mice augments the differentiation and accumulation of peritoneal B1b cells (35Mori S.

Activator protein 1 is composed of members of the Fos and Jun family of DNA-binding proteins. Induction of activator protein-1 is required for activation of the germline ɛ promoter. This represents an essential step preceding immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching to IgE (38Shen C-H. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and plays a central role in the regulation of promoter activity for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ in T cells (25Labuda T. Sundstedt A. Dohlsten M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The immediate early gene egr-1 has been shown to play a role in limiting the number of T cell precursors and in the efficient differentiation and survival of thymocytes during the process of positive selection (39Bettini M. Xi H. Milbrandt J. Kersh G.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1713-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SRF has the potential to regulate cell growth, survival or apoptosis by altering the expression of specific genes involved in these processes. Experiments in a human B cell line demonstrated that for apoptosis to proceed, the transcriptional events promoting cell survival and proliferation in which SRF is involved must first be inactivated by a caspase-mediated cleavage of the SRF protein (18Drewett V. Devitt A. Saxton J. Portman N. Greaney P. Cheong N.E. Alnemri T.F. Alnemri E. Shaw P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33444-33451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which SRF inhibits apoptosis is the transcriptional regulation of members of the B cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl) family of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1)). Neither Bcl-xl nor Bcl-2 is absolutely required for T cell development to maturity (40Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q.

TCFs are thought to function primarily through serum response elements via formation of ternary complexes with SRF. Recently, members of the TCF family of SRF cofactors have been characterized by knock-out studies. Elk-1 deficient mice display normal immune responses and mildly impaired neuronal gene inactivation (44Cesari F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Vuong L.G. Seibler J. Bode J. Wiebel F.F. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2004; 38: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Net mutants show defects in cell migration (45Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10853-10862Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), vasculature development (46Ayadi A. Zheng H. Sobieszczuk P. Buchwalter G. Moerman P. Alitalo K. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5139-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and impaired angiogenesis during wound healing (47Zheng H. Wasylyk C. Ayadi A. Abecassis J. Schalken J.A. Rogatsch H. Wernert N. Maira S.M. Multon M.C. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The strongest phenotype with regard to immune functions is observed in SAP-1-null mice where thymocyte development is severely impaired and a decrease in the amount of CD4+ and CD8+ single positive (SP) cells is seen resulting from defective thymocyte positive selection (48Costello P.S. Nicolas R.H. Watanabe Y. Rosewell I. Treisman R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The relatively mild phenotypes observed upon inactivation of single TCFs suggest functional redundancy between the different TCFs. Gene targeting in mice has been particularly helpful in deciphering the genetic networks underlying lymphocyte development and function. Classical disruption of both Srf-alleles in mice leads to early embryonic lethality associated with a gastrulation defect (9Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlaöger M. Ruöther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), thereby precluding the analysis of SRF function in subsequent developmental processes. To investigate potential contributions of SRF to lymphocyte differentiation and function, we conditionally ablated the Srf gene in developing lymphocytes of the mouse. Potential functional redundancies of TCF proteins are thereby also addressed since SRF mutagenesis inactivates all TCF functions that are dependent on wild-type SRF. We show that mice with ablation of the Srf gene in T cells display a substantial reduction in mature SP thymocytes and nearly complete abrogation of peripheral T cells. B cell-specific depletion of SRF, on the other hand, resulted in the loss of MZB cells and decrease of B1 cells only, whereas the majority of the conventional B2 cells was not affected. Thus our study demonstrates for the first time in vivo that SRF is an essential transcription factor for murine lymphopoiesis. Lymphocyte Specific Deletion of Srf in Mice—Animals were bred at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Srf was deleted specifically in murine lymphocytes by using mice carrying the conditional Srf allele Srfflex1neo(abbreviated fl), which is converted into the Srflx deletion allele (abbreviated lx) by Cre-mediated recombination (49Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conditional Srffl mice (49Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were bred to CD4-Cre (50Lee P.P. Fitzpatrick D.R. Beard C. Jessup H.K. Lehar S. Makar K.W. Pérez-Melgosa M. Sweetser M.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1317-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) mice on a mixed 129SvEv/C57Bl/6 background. Detection of the Srffl allele was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primer combinations (SRF-E/R and SRF-L/R) as previously described (49Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Cre transgene was detected by PCR using primer 1 (5′-ACGACCAAGTGACAGCAATG-3′) and 2 (5′-CTCGACCAGTTTAGTTACCC-3′). Srf deletion was assessed by Southern blot analysis performed on BglII-digested genomic DNA isolated from FACS-sorted lymphocytes. As described previously (49Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), hybridization with an external 3′ probe allowed discrimination between wt (4.6 kb), fl (3.8 kb), and lx alleles (1.4 kb). Histology—Formalin-fixed organs were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 μm thickness. Immunohistochemistry for T lymphocytes was performed with a rat-anti-CD3 antibody (CD3-12, Serotec Ltd.). A biotinylated rabbit-anti-rat antibody was used for detection of the bound primary antibody. B lymphocytes were detected with a biotin-conjugated rat-anti-mouse-CD45R/B220 monoclonal antibody (RA3-6B2, BD Biosciences). The avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method with diaminobenzidine as chromogen was used for detection of the biotinylated antibody. For cryosections, spleens were embedded in OCT freezing medium on dry ice, and 10-μm sections were prepared. Airdried sections were fixed and subsequently stained with a mixture of fluorescent dye-coupled antibodies containing rat-anti-MOMA-FITC (MCA947F, Serotec, Oxford, UK), rat-anti-mouse-IgM-Alexa 594 (clone R33-24), and mouse-anti-mouse-IgD-Alexa 647 (clone 1.3) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST) with 2% rat serum. Pictures were processed with PhotoImpact software (version 10.0 SE, Ulead Systems). Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions were prepared from thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, peritoneal cavity, and bone marrow. Peripheral blood was taken from the tail vein and heparinized using 375 I.E. heparin-sodium. Erythrocytes were depleted by lysis. After washing, cells were stained with various combinations of antibodies. To exclude dead cells, propidium iodide was used. The cell suspensions were measured on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (version 6.3.2 and 6.4.2). For cell sorting, cells were analyzed and collected on a MoFlo cell sorter (DakoCytomation). The following antibody conjugates were used: anti-CD4-PE-Cy5, anti-CD8-PE-Cy5, anti-Gr-1-PE, anti-Gr-1-FITC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-CD19-APC, anti-CD49-FITC, anti-CXCR4-Bio, anti-CD21/35-FITC, anti-CD23-PE, anti-CD8-FITC, anti-CD5-Cy (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), anti-IgM-PE, anti-IgD-FITC, and anti-F4/80-PE (Serotec, Oxford, UK). The biotinylated anti-CXCR-4 antibody was detected by streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA studies were performed as described previously (52Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Kraft R. Kostka S. Gaestel M. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14434-14443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A [α32P]ATP-labeled DNA fragment containing the c-fos serum response element (SRE) was used as a DNA-binding probe either with 4 μg T cell lysates from mice with a T cell-specific SRF deletion or 8 μg of B or T cell lysates from mice with a B cell-specific SRF deletion. To detect specific binding of SRF to the probe, SRF antiserum (G20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included for supershift analysis. Control shifts were performed with the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) tandem site of the NFATc1-P1-promoter (53Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Tyrsin D. Akimzhanov A. Moroz D. Jha M.K.

DNA Microarray Hybridization and Analysis—Sample preparation from FACS-sorted populations of splenocytes (B cells: CD19+IgM+IgD+), hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning of Affymetrix GeneChips was performed as previously described (54Pfoertner S. Jeron A. Probst-Kepper M. Guzman C.A. Hansen W. Westendorf A.M. Toepfer T. Schrader A.J. Franzke A. Buer J. Geffers R. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R54Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, Affymetrix MicroDB 3.0, and Affymetrix Data Mining Tool 3.0. All array experiments were scaled to a target intensity of 150, otherwise using the default values of the Microarray Suite. Genes were considered as regulated when their fold change was greater than or equal to an increase or decrease of 1.5, the statistical parameter for a significant change was less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999, and the signal difference of a certain gene was greater than 40. T Cell Lineage-specific Deletion of Srf—To delete Srf specifically in lymphocytes we used a conditional Srffl mouse strain where Cre-mediated recombination results in formation of the Srflx allele deleting the complete coding region of exon 1 (49Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, there is not a protein product being derived from this allele. However, the presence of such a truncated protein cannot be ruled out with 100% certainty (13Parlakian A. Tuil D. Hamard G. Tavernier G. Hentzen D. Concordet J.P. Paulin D. Li Z. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). If such a hypothetical product were derived from the Srflx locus, it would be predicted to have lost all the important functions of nuclear localization, dimerization, and DNA binding. To restrict deletion of the Srffl allele to developing T cells, the lymphocyte-specific CD4-Cre transgene (50Lee P.P. Fitzpatrick D.R. Beard C. Jessup H.K. Lehar S. Makar K.W. Pérez-Melgosa M. Sweetser M.T. Schlissel M.S. Nguyen S. Cherry S.R. Tsai J.H. Tucker S.M. Weaver W.M. Kelso A. Jaenisch R. Wilson C.B. Immunity. 2001; 15: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) was introduced by breeding. The resulting Cre expression is directed by the murine CD4 enhancer/promoter/silencer, which leads to efficient Cre-mediated deletion in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) and CD4+ SP thymocytes, in mature CD4+ T cells, and, to a lesser extent, in CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocytes (55Wolfer A. Bakker T. Wilson A. Nicolas M. Ioannidis V. Littman D.R. Lee P.P. Wilson C.B. Held W. MacDonald H.R. Radtke F. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant CD4-CreSrffl/fl progeny were obtained at Mendelian frequency and exhibited no obvious phenotypic abnormalities. T Cell-specific Srf Deletion Leads to a Block in T Cell Development—We first looked whether CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice still possessed T lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of spleen sections with a T cell-specific anti-CD3 antibody showed a striking decrease of CD3-positive cells, as compared with control specimen (Fig. 1A). This was verified by FACS analysis, which showed decreased numbers of peripheral T cells in spleen, blood, and lymph nodes of CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice when compared with littermate control mice (i.e. Srffl/fl, Srffl/wt, and CD4-Cre-Srffl/wt) (data not shown). The reduction of peripheral T cells suggested an impaired T cell development in the thymus. The overall number of thymocytes was similar in wild-type and SRF-deficient mice and no major differences in DN and DP thymocyte populations were detected by FACS analysis. We observed, however, a dramatic reduction of SP CD4+ (∼80%) and CD8+ (∼50%) T cells among the thymocytes from SRF-deficient CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice (Fig. 1B). Peripheral T Cells Lacking SRF Are Non-Viable—The remaining T cells may have survived without functional SRF or may represent a minority population that failed to delete the Srf gene. To address this question we sorted T and B cells from thymus and spleen and performed Southern blot analysis to distinguish the active Srffl allele from the inactive Srflx allele (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the absence of CD4 promoter activity in B cells, only the Srffl, but not the deleted Srflx allele could be detected in B cells from spleens of CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice (Fig. 2A, right panel). In contrast, the Srffl allele was completely recombined to Srflx in CD4+CD8+ DP cells from thymi of CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice (Fig. 2A, left panel). Thus, CD4-Cre-mediated excision of Srffl resulted in selective perturbations of T cell populations. The Srflx allele was also detectable in peripheral T cells isolated from the spleens of mutant animals (Fig. 2A, center). However, in these splenic T cells we detected an additional band, which was specific for the intact Srffl allele. We then decided to investigate SRF protein content of lymphocyte cells directly by EMSA. Protein extracts prepared from CD4-CD8- DN cells (in which Cre is not yet expressed) from thymi of mutant mice contain SRF as shown by the protein-DNA complex in Fig. 2B (left panel). In contrast, no such SRF-DNA complex was visible when we used CD4+CD8+ DP cell extracts from CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice. The presence of SRF protein in these shifted complexes was verified by supershift experiments with SRF antiserum. To prove the general capability of our protein extracts for specific DNA binding, we performed EMSA control experiments employing a tandem DNA binding site for the NFAT transcription factor (data not shown). Furthermore, when lymphocyte extracts from spleen were used for gel shift assays we detected SRF protein not only in B cells of CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice, but also in the remaining peripheral T cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). The latter result is in agreement with the Southern blot analysis, indicating the presence of the non-recombined Srffl allele in some splenic T cells. Taken together, our data suggest that peripheral T cells lacking both copies of Srf are non-viable and that the residual T cells found in CD4-CreSrffl/fl mice are derived from cells that have escaped Cre-mediated deletion. B Lineage-specific Srf Deletion—The CD19-Cre mouse strain used here for B cell-specific recombination of the Srffl allele has been generated by a knockin of the Cre recombinase into the CD19 locus.

The cytosolic protein talin connects αLβ2 to the actin filament. The talin head domain is also known to activate αLβ2 ligand binding. However, it remains to be determined whether talin promotes an intermediate or high affinity αLβ2. In this study using transfectants and T cells, we showed that talin induced an intermediate affinity αLβ2 that adhered constitutively to its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 but not ICAM-3. Adhesion to ICAM-3 was induced when an additional exogenous activating agent was included.

Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). In humans, 18 integrin α subunits and 8 integrin β subunits form 24 non-covalently associated heterodimers. Integrins have large ectodomains and relatively short cytoplasmic tails with the exception of the β4 subunit. Integrins are not known to have intrinsic enzymatic activities and signaling is achieved via the recruitment of cytosolic signaling proteins to their cytoplasmic tails. The integrin ectodomain can be segregated into two collective regions referred to as the headpiece and tailpiece (Fig. 1) (2Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The headpiece participates in ligand-binding. Structural studies of αIIbβ3, αVβ3, and α5β1 suggest at least three integrin ligand-binding affinity states having different conformations (2Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev.

By contrast, a high affinity integrin adopts an extended conformation with open headpiece derived from hybrid domain displacement. The intermediate affinity integrin conformation is proposed to be a collection of bent structures with open headpieces or extended structures with closed headpieces (3Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar).

Previously, we reported the requirement of integrin αLβ2 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 and CD11aCD18) having different affinity states for the adhesion to its ligands intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) 3The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; ME, Mg/EGTA; HD, head domain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; siRNA, small interference RNA; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; PBTL, peripheral blood T lymphocyte; sICAM, soluble ICAM; PS, positive selection; NS, negative selection.

Whereas an intermediate affinity αLβ2 bound ICAM-1, a high affinity αLβ2 was required for ICAM-3 binding. The Inserted (I)-domain (also known as the αA domain (9Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar)) is the primary ligand-binding domain of αLβ2. The order of binding affinities to different ICAMs using engineered isolated αL I domain is ICAM-1 > ICAM-2 > ICAM-3 (10Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Further, it was reported that an extended intermediate affinity αLβ2, stabilized by the small molecule allosteric antagonist XVA143, promoted rolling adhesion of leukocytes in shear flow (11Salas A.

Thus, the transition of αLβ2 across different affinity states may be required to fine-tune leukocyte adhesiveness during distinct stages of leukocyte homeostasis. Integrins can be activated via the process of inside-out signaling (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar).

The talin head domain (HD) is also shown to activate αLβ2 by forced separation of its cytoplasmic tails as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses (20Kim M. Carman C.V.

However, whether talin promotes an intermediate affinity or high affinity αLβ2 has not been fully characterized. Herein, we report that talin HD promotes an intermediate affinity αLβ2 in surrogate transfectants and in T cells as determined by ICAM adhesion and binding assays, activation reporter mAbs analyses, and migration studies. Antibodies and Reagents—The following mAbs were gifts from different sources: MHM23 (β2-specific, heterodimer-dependent mAb) and MHM24 (αL-specific, function-blocking mAb) (21Hildreth J.E. Gotch F.M.

Mouse anti-human αβ TCR (T10B9.1A-31), mouse anti-human CD3 (UCHT1), and mouse anti-human actin (Ab-5) were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-HA tag polyclonal antibody was purchased from Delta Biolabs (Gilroy, CA). Mouse anti-human talin (8d4) was purchased from Sigma. HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant human ICAM-1/Fc and ICAM-3/Fc were prepared as described previously (25Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J.

All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Expression Constructs—Integrin αL and β2 cDNAs in the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were described previously (25Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the numbering of integrin amino acids was based on Barclay et al. (27Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Law S.K. McKnight A.J.

Human talin 1 HD (Met1-Gln435) cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA isolated from THP-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) using relevant forward and reverse primers containing the XhoI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively. An mRNA extraction kit was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany. Reverse transcription-PCR kit was from Qiagen. The reverse transcription-PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pXJ40-HA (28Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 29Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

A similar N-terminal HA-tagged mouse talin HD (residues 1-435) construct has been reported and found to activate integrin αLβ2 in K562 transfectant (20Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Talin HD-EGFP construct was generated by PCR cloning of talin HD from pXJ40-HA-talin-HD using forward primer containing an XhoI site and reverse primer containing a KpnI site. The reverse primer in this case also contained two extra bases to allow fusion of talin HD inframe with the C terminus EGFP in the expression plasmid pEGFP-N1 (BD Bioscience). All constructs were verified by sequencing (Research Biolabs, Singapore). Cells and Transfection—MOLT-4, HUT-78, and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC. MOLT-4 was cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (JRH Biosciences Inc., Australia). HUT-78 was maintained in complete Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (JRH). COS-7 was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (JRH). All culture media contained 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (JRH). Transfection of COS-7 with expression plasmids (2 μg each) was performed using the Poly-fect transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The EGFP-tagged talin HD expression plasmid (2 μg) was transfected into MOLT-4 (2 × 106 cells per reaction) using the Amaxa Nucleofector device and reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Amaxa Gmbh, Germany). HUT-78 (0.5 × 106 cells per reaction) was transfected with 5 μg of talin siRNA or its control siRNA using similar procedure. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTLs) were isolated by the method of negative selection (NS) or positive selection (PS) from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Briefly, using the method of PS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-αβ TCR (T10B9.1A-31) followed by anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate mAb conjugated to MicroBead (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) on ice for 30 min. Labeled cells were washed once, loaded on an LS MACS column, and αβ+ T cells were eluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Using the method of NS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were processed and loaded onto a T Cell Enrichment Column (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. In both cases, purified cells were allowed to recover in RPMI culture media overnight. Ex vivo expansion of T cells to obtain T lymphoblasts was performed by maintaining cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 μg/ml PHA, and 1 nm recombinant interleukin-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Flow Cytometry—Samples for flow cytometry analyses were prepared as described previously (25Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Staining of cells with αLβ2 activation reporter mAbs was performed at 37 °C or 4 °C as described previously (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Immobilized ICAM Adhesion and Soluble ICAM Binding Assays—Adhesion of cells to ICAMs coated on Polysorb microtiter wells (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) were performed essentially as reported previously (25Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each microtiter well was coated with 0.5 μg of goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). The nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. ICAM/Fc at 1 ng/μlin phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was added to each well, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed twice in RPMI wash buffer (RPMI media containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) before assay. Cells labeled with 3.0 mm 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were incubated in RPMI wash buffer containing Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA, hereafter abbreviated as “ME”) and/or mAb KIM185 (10 μg/ml) to activate αLβ2-mediated adhesion. In all experiments, the αL-specific function-blocking mAb MHM24 (10 μg/ml) was included to demonstrate adhesion specificity mediated by αLβ2. Cell fluorescence, which corresponds to the number of cells adhering to ligand-coated well, was measured on a FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Soluble ICAM (sICAM) binding assay was performed as described previously (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For activating studies, ME (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) and/or activating mAb KIM185 (10 μg/ml) were used. The function-blocking mAb MHM24 (10 μg/ml) was used in all blocking conditions. For the TCR/CD3 cross-linking experiment, 5 μg/ml anti-αβ TCR (T10B9.1A-31) and 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 (UCHT1) were used. sICAM-bound cells were detected by flow cytometry and presented as histogram plots. For HUT-78 electroporated with talin siRNA or control siRNA, the number of cells gated positive was determined and normalized to the highest number of cells gated positive in that experiment, and presented as % cells gated positive. Cell Surface Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Labeling of MOLT-4 and HUT-78 cell surface αLβ2 followed by immunoprecipitation were performed as described (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and were subsequently transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Biotinylated αLβ2 protein bands were probed with streptavidin-conjugated HRP and detected using the enhanced-chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). HA-tagged talin HD was probed using rabbit anti-HA antibody followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and detected by ECL. After siRNA electroporation, the endogenous talin and actin of HUT-78 were probed with anti-talin mAb 8d4 and anti-actin mAb Ab5, respectively, followed by HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and ECL detection. Live Cell Imaging—Cells in culture medium with or without additives were seeded into one ICAM-coated (50 ng) Polysorb detachable microwell (Nunc). The microwell was fitted with an adaptor onto a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted fluorescence microscope (with 20× objective) housed in a closed system with temperature (37 °C) and CO2 (5%) controls. Images of cells were captured with time by a CoolSnap HQ charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and tracking velocities were analyzed using the software Metamorph® (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). For monitoring the effect of talin HD on MOLT-4 migration on ICAMs, only EGFP-talin HD-transfected cells (detected with 485/525 filters) were examined. Talin HD Induced an Intermediate Affinity αLβ2 That Constitutively Adhered to ICAM-1 but Not ICAM-3—The described role of talin in integrin activation prompted us to compare its contribution toward αLβ2-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. COS-7 cells were transfected with αLβ2 or αLβ2 and HA-tagged talin HD, which contains the major integrin interaction site (17Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The expressions of αLβ2 and talin HD were determined by flow cytometry analyses and anti-HA immunoblotting, respectively (Fig. 2A). The levels of αLβ2 expression in both transfectants were comparable. The talin HD transfectant showed a high level of talin HD expression as determined by anti-HA immunoblotting. Interestingly, the adhesion profiles to ICAMs were different between the two transfectants. Although αLβ2 transfectants adhered to ICAM-1 only in the presence of the activating agent Mg/EGTA (ME in all figures) or the β2-specific activating mAb KIM185 (22Andrew D. Shock A. Ball E. Ortlepp S. Bell J. Robinson M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), transfectants bearing αLβ2 and talin HD showed constitutive ICAM-1 adhesion, albeit at a lower level than that in the presence of an activating agent (Fig. 2B). Transfectants expressing αLβ2 adhered to ICAM-3 only when both ME and KIM185 were included, which was consistent with that reported previously (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfectants bearing αLβ2 and talin HD adhered to ICAM-3 when ME or KIM185 was included. In all cases, MHM24 (an αL-specific function-blocking mAb) abrogated adhesion, demonstrating αLβ2-mediated adhesion specificity. In addition, we examined the capacity of these transfectants to bind sICAMs (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the adhesion profiles to the ICAMs, transfectants bearing αLβ2 and talin HD showed detectable levels of sICAM-1 binding (shaded histogram) even in the absence of the activating agents as compared with transfectants bearing only αLβ2. Transfectants bearing αLβ2 and talin HD showed detectable levels of sICAM-3 binding in the presence of only one activating condition ME or KIM185, whereas transfectants bearing only αLβ2 required the presence of ME and KIM185. Binding specificity was verified by mAb MHM24 (open histogram). We previously proposed that, in the presence of one activating agent such as ME or KIM185, an intermediate affinity αLβ2 is induced that allows effective adhesion to ICAM-1 but not ICAM-3 (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the presence of both ME and KIM185, a high affinity αLβ2 is generated that mediates not only ICAM-1 but also ICAM-3 adhesion. Thus, the constitutive binding of talin HD/αLβ2 transfectant to ICAM-1, but not ICAM-3, and its capacity to bind ICAM-3 when only one activating agent was included suggest that talin HD induces an intermediate affinity αLβ2. Salt Bridge Disruption in αLβ2 Cytoplasmic Tails Generated an Intermediate Affinity αLβ2—The effect of talin HD on αLβ2 ligand binding recapitulates integrin activation via inside-out signaling. Talin HD was reported to induce the separation of the αLβ2 cytoplasmic tails (20Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Similarly, the disruption of a membrane proximal salt bridge linking the two cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3 was shown to promote its activation (19Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, whether the separation of cytoplasmic tails by salt bridge disruption induces an intermediate or high affinity αLβ2 requires clarification. A salt bridge-disrupted αLβ2 variant (αLβ2 D709R) (Fig. 1) was generated to examine its ICAM-binding properties with or without talin HD overexpression. The expression level of αLβ2 D709R was analyzed by flow cytometry, and talin HD was detected by anti-HA immunoblot (Fig. 3A). The αLβ2D709R transfectant showed constitutive adhesion to ICAM-1, and the co-expression of talin HD did not significantly alter the adhesion profile (Fig. 3B). The αLβ2D709R transfectant only adhered to ICAM-3 when activated by at least ME or KIM185. A similar adhesion profile was seen in the presence of talin HD co-expression. The study was reinforced with sICAM binding assays that showed similar sICAM binding profiles (Fig. 3C). Hence, it is apparent that salt bridge disruption promotes an intermediate affinity but not a high affinity αLβ2. We reasoned that talin HD overexpression had minimal effect on αLβ2D709R-mediated binding to ICAMs, because the αLβ2 cytoplasmic tails should have already undergone forced separation as a result of the D709R substitution. Talin Induced Expression of an Intermediate Affinity αLβ2 on T-cell Line HUT-78—Next, we asked whether talin promotes a population of intermediate affinity αLβ2 on T cells. We made use of two T cell lines HUT-78 and MOLT-4 in this study. Differences in the activity of αLβ2 on these cells were detected (Fig. 4A). Unlike MOLT-4 that required ME for adhesion to ICAM-1 (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), HUT-78 showed constitutive ICAM-1 adhesion. Whereas MOLT-4 required a combination of ME and KIM185 to adhere to ICAM-3, only ME was required for HUT-78 adhesion to ICAM-3. Thus, these data suggest the presence of a population of intermediate affinity αLβ2 on HUT-78. The αLβ2 activation reporter mAb MEM148 reacts with a β2 hybrid domain epitope that is masked in non-activated αLβ2 (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MEM148 precipitated surface biotin-labeled αLβ2 from HUT-78 but not MOLT-4 in the absence of exogenous αLβ2-activating agent (Fig. 4B). αLβ2 was precipitated by MEM148 from MOLT-4 when ME was included. The mAb MHM23 (β2 integrin heterodimer-specific) was included as a control. These data support the presence of a population of active αLβ2 on HUT-78. Talin promoted the expression of intermediate affinity αLβ2 in transfectants, thus we examined whether the population of active αLβ2 on HUT-78 was induced by talin. To this end, endogenous talin expression in HUT-78 was reduced using siRNA (Fig. 4C). The expression of αLβ2 on HUT-78 transfected with talin siRNA was similar to that transfected with control siRNA as determined by flow cytometry. HUT-78 transfected with talin siRNA showed reduced adhesion to ICAM-1, which was in contrast to that of the control siRNA. Representative data are shown (Fig. 4D). Adhesion to ICAM-1 could be restored in talin knockdown cells when treated with ME, suggesting that αLβ2 on these cells was functional. Talin knockdown also abrogated HUT-78 adhesion to ICAM-3 in the presence of ME, but adhesion was restored in the presence of ME and KIM185. sICAM binding assays were also performed, and similar binding profiles were observed (Fig. 4E). Taken together, talin contributes toward the generation of a population of an intermediate affinity αLβ2 on HUT-78. HUT-78 adhered to and migrated on immobilized ICAM-1 (data not shown). We also examined whether talin promoted MOLT-4 adhesion and migration on the ICAMs. MOLT-4 is non-adherent to the ICAMs unless the αLβ2 is activated (8Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MOLT-4 was transfected with talin HD-EGFP. Transfected cells, which were monitored by EGFP emission signal with a fluorescence microscope of a live-cell imaging system, constitutively adhered to and migrated on ICAM-1 (Fig. 5A). Transfected cells also migrated on ICAM-3 but required ME or KIM185, consistent with the requirement of two αLβ2 activation steps for effective binding ICAM-3. The motility of these cells was calculated and presented as a box plot (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these data suggest that talin promotes a population of an intermediate affinity αLβ2 that could mediate effective migration on ICAMs. T Lymphoblasts Express a Population of Intermediate Affinity αLβ2—We extended the investigation to examine the affinity state of αLβ2 on primary T cells. Human PBTLs were isolated by two procedures. Whereas PS T lymphocytes showed higher purity as compared with NS ones, as determined by flow cytometry using anti-αβ TCR mAb (Fig. 6A), PS may trigger T-cell response and transient αLβ2 activation as opposed to the untouched T cells obtained via the method of NS. Hence, we allowed the purified cells to recover overnight in culture and tested both isolated T cells in ICAM adhesion assays, which gave similar adhesion profiles (Fig. 6B). Adhesion to ICAM-1 required activation of αLβ2 with ME or KIM185, and adhesion to ICAM-3 required both activating agents. Adhesion specificity was demonstrated by MHM24. Thus, only PS PBTL was shown for subsequent assays. The binding profiles of PS PBTL to the sICAMs were also consistent with the adhesion profiles (Fig. 6C). The migration of PHA/interleukin-2-expanded T cells (henceforth referred to as T lymphoblasts) on ICAM-1 has"
https://openalex.org/W1976024390,"Background The synthetic triterpenoid 2-Cyano-3,12-Dioxooleana-1,9-Dien-28-Oic Acid (CDDO) and derivatives display anti-tumor activity against a variety of cultured tumor cell lines and in mouse xenografts. In this report, we have studied the effects of CDDO and its imidazolide derivative (CDDO-Im) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), using patients' CLL cells and a mouse model of CLL and small B cell lymphoma (SBL). Principal Findings CDDO and CDDO-Im efficiently induced apoptosis of malignant human and mouse B-cells ex vivo, although CDDO-Im was over 10-fold more potent than CDDO. Treating mice with CLL/SBL with liposome-formulated CDDO or CDDO-Im resulted in significant reductions of B cells in blood, spleen and lung. CDDO-Im was shown to be more potent than CDDO, while treatment with empty liposomes had no impact on disease. CDDO-Im treatment initially resulted in an increase of circulating B cells, which correlates with a reduction in resident lymphocytes in spleen, and lungs, suggesting that CDDO-Im induces mobilization of tumor cells from lymphoid organs and infiltrated tissues into the circulation. Analysis of blood cells recovered from treated mice also showed that CDDO-Im is a potent inducer of tumor cells death in vivo. Furthermore, CDDO-Im efficiently eradicated mouse CLL/SBL cells but had little effect on the viability of normal B and T cells in vivo. Significance The presented data demonstrate that triterpenoids CDDO and CDDO-Im reduce leukemia and lymphoma burden in vivo in a transgenic mouse model of CLL/SBL, and support the clinical testing of CDDO-based synthetic triterpenoids in patients with CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2065941133,"The LIM domain-containing TRIP6 (Thyroid Hormone Receptor-interacting Protein 6) is a focal adhesion molecule known to regulate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced cell migration through interaction with the LPA2 receptor. LPA stimulation targets TRIP6 to the focal adhesion complexes and promotes c-Src-dependent phosphorylation of TRIP6 at Tyr-55, which creates a docking site for the Crk Src homology 2 domain, thereby promoting LPA-induced morphological changes and cell migration. Here we further demonstrate that a switch from c-Src-mediated phosphorylation to PTPL1/Fas-associated phosphatase-1-dependent dephosphorylation serves as an inhibitory feedback control mechanism of TRIP6 function in LPA-induced cell migration. PTPL1 dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine 55 of TRIP6 in vitro and inhibits LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 in cells. This negative regulation requires a direct protein-protein interaction between these two molecules and the phosphatase activity of PTPL1. In contrast to c-Src, PTPL1 prevents TRIP6 turnover at the sites of adhesions. As a result, LPA-induced association of TRIP6 with Crk and the function of TRIP6 to promote LPA-induced morphological changes and cell migration are inhibited by PTPL1. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which PTPL1 phosphatase plays a counteracting role in regulating TRIP6 function in LPA-induced cell migration.

The LIM domain-containing TRIP6, also known as ZRP-1 (Zyxin-related Protein 1), is a zyxin family member that has been implicated in cell motility and transcriptional control (1Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Originally discovered as an interacting protein of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor in a yeast two-hybrid screen (2Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TRIP6 was later identified as a focal adhesion molecule with the capability to shuttle between cell surface and nucleus (3Murthy K.K.

Through the LIM domain-mediated protein-protein interactions, TRIP6 forms complexes with several molecules involved in actin rearrangement, cell adhesion, and migration, at least including p130cas (4Yi J.

Previously we have demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA2 receptor, but not LPA1 or LPA3 receptor, interacts with the LIM domains of TRIP6 (7Xu J. Lai Y.J. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10459-10468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This association promotes LPA-dependent recruitment of TRIP6 to the focal adhesion sites where it forms complexes with p130cas, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and c-Src. The function of TRIP6 in cell motility is regulated by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation at Tyr-55 (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is required for TRIP6 coupling to the Crk Src homology 2 domain and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation, thereby enhancing LPA-induced morphological changes and chemotaxis. Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires a tight coordination of various signaling molecules involved in cell adhesion and migration. Several tyrosine kinases and phosphatases have been shown to regulate these signaling events through reversible tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their substrates (16Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In particular, the focal adhesion kinase-Src-mediated pathways play a fundamental role in regulating adhesion turnover and disassembly during cell migration (17Panetti T.S. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d143-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand how tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of TRIP6 modulate its function in cell motility, we explored whether PTPL1 phosphatase is a candidate responsible for dephosphorylation of TRIP6. Human PTPL1, also known as FAP-1 (Fas-associated Phosphatase 1), PTP1E, and PTPN13 and its mouse homologue, PTP-BL, are ∼270-kDa cytosolic tyrosine phosphatases that contain an amino-terminal FERM domain, five PDZ motifs, and a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain (18Erdmann K.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The FERM domain functions as membrane-cytoskeleton linkers and may play a role in cytokinesis (19Herrmann L. Dittmar T. Erdmann K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several regulators of actin cytoskeleton have been shown to interact with the PDZ domains of PTPL1, at least including TRIP6, PARG (PTPL1-associated RhoGAP), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), ephrinB, PRK2 (protein kinase C-related kinase-2), CRIP2 (cysteine-rich intestinal protein 2), and RIL (Reversion-induced LIM), implicating a role for PTPL1 in actin dynamics (18Erdmann K.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A number of molecules have been identified as PTPL1 substrates, at least including ephrinB, RIL, IκB, and c-Src (20Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 21Nakai Y. Irie S. Sato T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7170-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Cuppen E.

Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); however, the functional consequences of their dephosphorylation are still poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that PTPL1 dephosphorylates c-Src-phosphorylated TRIP6 in vitro and inhibits LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 in cells through a direct protein-protein interaction. This dephosphorylation reduces TRIP6 turnover from the sites of adhesions and inhibits TRIP6 coupling to Crk. As a result, the function of TRIP6 in promoting LPA-induced morphological changes and cell migration is attenuated by PTPL1. Furthermore, LPA-induced cell migration is enhanced by suppression of endogenous PTPL1 expression but is reduced by overexpression of PTPL1, suggesting that PTPL1 acts as a negative regulator of cell motility. Plasmid Construction—A TRIP6 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-396 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into pCMV-Tag2A (Stratagene) to generate the FLAG-TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) expression vector. The pEYFP-TRIP6 was constructed by replacing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA sequences of pEGFP-TRIP6 with a cDNA fragment encoding yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). A cDNA fragment encoding GFP or a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was inserted into pCMV5-HA-PTPL1 (24Kimber W.A. Deak M. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) such that HA-PTPL1 was tagged in-frame with GFP or CFP at its amino terminus, respectively. To express a GFP-HA-PTPL1-ΔCD mutant lacking the catalytic domain of PTPL1, a SacI cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-2277 of PTPL1 was removed from pCMV-HA-PTPL1 and inserted into pEGFP-C2. To express the recombinant PTPL1 catalytic domain (designated PTPL1-CD), a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 2087-2485 of PTPL1 was amplified by PCR from pCMV5-HA-PTPL1 and inserted into pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). To inhibit the expression of PTP-BL, a mouse homologue of PTPL1, the pSUPER vector was used to direct the expression of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PTP-BL (designated pSUPER-si(m)PTPL1) that specifically targets the 21-nt sequences of PTP-BL, 5′-GAGTGAGCATTGCTGACCCTG-3′. A control siRNA (designated siScramble) expression vector was constructed by inserting the 19-nt sequences, 5′-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3′ that do not target any known cellular RNA, into pSUPER vector. The entire sequences of each cDNA clone were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation Assays—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)(LysS) was transformed with pGEX-6P3-TRIP6 or pGEX-6P3-PTPL1-CD. GST-TRIP6 and GST-PTPL1-CD were purified as described previously (7Xu J. Lai Y.J. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10459-10468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GST-PTPL1-CD was further digested with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to cleave GST. 1 μg of GST-TRIP6 was first phosphorylated by recombinant p60c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology) as described previously (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following reaction, GST-TRIP6-immobilized glutathione beads were washed four times to remove c-Src. These beads were then incubated with 0.1 or 0.5 μg of PTPL1-CD for 10 or 30 min in the phosphatase buffer (25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After SDS-PAGE, the immunoblot was probed with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20H; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect phosphorylated TRIP6. The blot was then stripped and reprobed with an anti-TRIP6 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TRIP6—Transfected HEK 293T cells were starved overnight followed by incubation with 2 μm LPA for 15 min. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (7Xu J. Lai Y.J. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10459-10468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using the antibodies specific to human TRIP6 (Bethyl Laboratories), mouse TRIP6 (BD Biosciences), vinculin (Sigma), PTPL1, FLAG epitope, GFP, HA epitope, or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous TRIP6, FLAG-TRIP6, or FLAG-TRIP6-Δ-(397-476), transfected SYF + c-Src or HEK 293T cells were starved in 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA-containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 8 h (SYR + c-Src cells) or overnight (HEK 293T cells) followed by incubation with 2 μm LPA for 15 min. The endogenous TRIP6 and transfected FLAG-TRIP6 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TRIP6 mouse antibody (BD Biosciences) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads from the lysates, respectively. After SDS-PAGE, tyrosine-phosphorylated TRIP6 was detected by immunoblotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20H; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total tyrosine phosphoproteins in SYF + c-Src MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-conjugated agarose beads, and the immunoblot was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine PY20H antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous c-Src-Y416 in the whole cell lysates of SYF + c-Src MEFs was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phospho-c-Src-Y416 antibody (Cell Signaling). Time-lapse Imaging of Live Cells—SYF + c-Src MEFs expressing YFP or CFP fusion proteins of TRIP6 or PTPL1 were plated on glass-bottomed 35-mm tissue culture dishes (MatTek Corp.). Cells were washed twice with phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then incubated with 10 μm LPA. The expression of YFP and CFP fusion proteins was visualized by Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope using a ×100 objective. The YFP images were acquired every 20 s for 30 min with a Photometrics 1400 charge-coupled device camera under the control of IPLab software (Scanlytics, Inc.). Transwell Cell Migration Assays—Transfected SKOV-3 cells were subjected to a transwell cell migration assay as described previously (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). TRIP6 Turnover—SYF + c-Src MEFs expressing YFP-PTPL1 or control YFP were starved for 8 h, followed by incubation with 2 μm LPA for 15, 30, and 45 min. Cells were harvested on ice in the Triton-X-containing buffer (1% Triton-X, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min. The detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fractions were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were dissolved in SDS lysis buffer, boiled, and sonicated to disrupt the cytoskeleton. Immunoblotting was performed to detect TRIP6, β-actin, and vinculin using antibodies specific to these proteins. PTPL1 Inhibits LPA-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TRIP6 through Direct Interaction with TRIP6—Previously it has been shown that the carboxyl-terminal LIM3 and PDZ-binding domain of TRIP6 interacts with the second PDZ domain of human PTPL1 and its mouse homologue PTP-BL in the yeast two-hybrid systems (3Murthy K.K. Clark K. Fortin Y. Shen S.H. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20679-20687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Cuppen E. van Ham M. Wansink D.G. de Leeuw A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance for this interaction has not yet been elucidated. In search of the candidate phosphatase of TRIP6, we tested the ability of PTPL1 to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine 55 of TRIP6 in vitro. We first phosphorylated GST-TRIP6 with recombinant c-Src kinase. Following the reaction, c-Src was removed by extensive washing and GST-TRIP6 was incubated with the catalytic domain of PTPL1 for 15 or 30 min. The result showed that the c-Src-phosphorylated TRIP6 was dephosphorylated in the presence of PTPL1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether PTPL1 regulates TRIP6 phosphorylation directly or acts as an adaptor by recruiting other phosphatases to TRIP6, control GFP, GFP-PTPL1, or a GFP-PTPL1-ΔCD mutant that is capable of binding to TRIP6 but lacks the catalytic domain of tyrosine phosphatase was overexpressed in Src-/-, Yes-/-, Fyn-/- triple knock-out MEFs in which c-Src had been reconstituted (designated SYF + c-Src MEFs). Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 was determined after LPA stimulation for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 1B, LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous TRIP6 was significantly reduced by overexpression of PTPL1, but not PTPL1-ΔCD. This result indicates that the phosphatase activity of PTPL1 is required for the reduction of TRIP6 phosphorylation. To understand whether PTPL1 negatively regulates TRIP6 phosphorylation at physiological conditions, we inhibited the expression of PTP-BL by a specific siRNA (designated si(m)PTPL1) and examined LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 in SYF + c-Src MEFs. Under this condition, LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 was enhanced, suggesting a physiological relevance for this regulation (Fig. 1C). Previously it has been reported that PTP-BL dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine 416 of c-Src, thereby preventing auto-phosphorylation of c-Src and inactivating its kinase activity (20Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 23Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although PTPL1 may mediate TRIP6 dephosphorylation through a direct interaction with TRIP6, it is also possible that PTPL1 indirectly inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6 by attenuating c-Src kinase activity. Perhaps because the expression and kinase activity of the reconstituted c-Src are high in SYF + c-Src MEFs, we did not observe a significant alteration of c-Src-Y416 phosphorylation or the total levels of tyrosine phosphoproteins by the inhibition of PTP-BL expression with its specific siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1). So next we compared tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type TRIP6 and a TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) deletion mutant that lacks LIM3 and PDZ-binding domains required for PTPL1 interaction but retains the ability to bind to the LPA2 receptor. The LPA-promoted association of PTPL1 with TRIP6, but not TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) mutant, was first confirmed in HEK 293T cells, which express substantial amounts of endogenous PTPL1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIP6, but not TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) mutant, was attenuated by overexpression of PTPL1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4 compared with lanes 1, 2, and lanes 7, 8 compared with lanes 5, 6). Together, these results suggest that PTPL1 mediates TRIP6 dephosphorylation through a direct protein-protein interaction. PTPL1 Reduces TRIP6 Turnover at the Sites of Adhesions and Inhibits LPA-induced Morphological Changes in SYF + c-Src Cells—Previously we have shown that in serum-free conditions TRIP6 is diffusely present in the cytosol. Upon stimulation with LPA for 15-20 min, TRIP6 is targeted to focal adhesions and co-localized with actin cytoskeleton (7Xu J. Lai Y.J. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10459-10468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of TRIP6 at Tyr-55 does not affect these signaling events but is important for TRIP6 turnover at the sites of adhesions (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PTPL1-dependent dephosphorylation may regulate TRIP6 turnover at focal adhesions. To examine the turnover of cytoskeleton-associated TRIP6 following LPA stimulation, we set up an experiment to determine LPA-induced accumulation of TRIP6 in the detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fractions. Therefore, SYF + c-Src cells expressing YFP-PTPL1 or control YFP were starved for 8 h, followed by stimulation with LPA for 15, 30, or 45 min, and the Triton-X-insoluble fractions were collected. Our results showed that LPA stimulation rapidly induced the accumulation of TRIP6 in the insoluble cytoskeletal fractions (Fig. 3A). It reached the highest level after 15 min of treatment. Subsequently, TRIP6 was dissociated from cytoskeleton; however, the turnover of cytoskeleton-associated TRIP6 was significantly delayed in cells overexpressing PTPL1 (Fig. 3B). Compared with TRIP6, significant amounts of vinculin were already present in the insoluble cytoskeletal fractions. In the control SYF + c-Src cells, LPA stimulation slightly increased the accumulation of vinculin in the detergent-resistant fractions but the turnover of vinculin was much slower than TRIP6 (Fig. 3A). In the cells overexpressing PTPL1, LPA stimulation did not further increase the accumulation or induce the turnover of vinculin in detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fractions. These results suggest that LPA induces a rapid assembly and disassembly of focal adhesion molecules in SYF + c-Src cells; however, this dynamic process is retarded by PTPL1 overexpression. LPA stimulation rapidly induces cytoskeletal rearrangement with cellular morphological changes through the coordinate activation of Rho GTPases (25Panetti T.S. Magnusson M.K. Peyruchaud O. Zhang Q. Cooke M.E. Sakai T. Mosher D.F. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previously we have demonstrated that overexpression of TRIP6, but not TRIP6-Y55F mutant, promoted LPA-induced morphological changes in SYF + c-Src MEFs. However, overexpression of TRIP6 in Srcnull SYF MEFs not only does not promote LPA-induced morphological changes but even retards this dynamic process (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One explanation is that TRIP6 forms stable complexes with other signaling molecules at the sites of adhesions and the accumulated mature adhesions perturb LPA-induced adhesion disassembly. Analogously, PTPL1-dependent dephosphorylation of TRIP6 may negatively regulate LPA-induced morphological changes. To explore this possibility, time-lapse imaging of live cells was performed in SYF + c-Src cells expressing YFP or YFP-TRIP6 with either CFP or CFP-PTPL1. Cells were washed twice with 1% fatty acid-free BSA-containing medium, and the expression of these proteins was verified by fluorescence microscopy. Subsequently, LPA was added to the cells and the YFP images of live cells were acquired by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Our results showed that the cells expressing control YFP and CFP started to retract their cell bodies soon after LPA stimulation for 5 min and almost completely rounded up after 15 min of treatment (Fig. 3C, panel one, and supplemental video S1, YFP+CFP.mov). However, this process became much slower when CFP-PTPL1 was co-expressed (Fig. 3C, panel two, and supplemental video S2, CFP+PTPL1.mov). Overexpression of YFP-TRIP6 accelerated the rate of LPA-induced morphological changes, and cells started to contract soon after LPA treatment for 1 min (Fig. 3C, panel three, and supplemental video S3, YFP-TRIP6+CFP.mov). In contrast, in cells co-expressing YFP-TRIP6 and CFP-PTPL1, LPA-induced morphological changes were almost completely blocked (Fig. 3C, panel four, and supplemental video S4, YFP-TRIP6+CFP-PTPL1.mov). It is apparent that the number of focal adhesions and the accumulation of YFP-TRIP6 at the sites of adhesions were increased when CFP-PTP-L1 was co-expressed. These results suggest that the relative expression of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated TRIP6 is a critical determinant of TRIP6 function in LPA-induced morphological changes. PTPL1 Reduces LPA-induced Association of TRIP6 with Crk and Attenuates TRIP6 Function in LPA-induced Cell Migration—Previously we have demonstrated that the pY55QAP motif of human TRIP6 or pY55QPP motif of mouse TRIP6 creates a docking site for the Crk Src homology 2 domain once Tyr-55 is phosphorylated by c-Src (15Lai Y.J. Chen C.S. Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because PTPL1 mediates dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine 55 of TRIP6, it would be expected to negatively regulate this association. Indeed, our result showed that LPA-induced interaction of TRIP6 with CrkI was significantly reduced by PTPL1 (Fig. 4A). This result implies a role for PTPL1 in regulating TRIP6 function in LPA-induced cell migration. So next we expressed PTPL1 with TRIP6 in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells in which c-Src is highly expressed and examined LPA-induced cell migration. Our result showed that overexpression of PTPL1 reduced LPA-induced transwell cell migration (Fig. 4B). In the absence of ligand stimulation, the relative cell migration rate was slightly higher in cells overexpressing TRIP6. However, the ability of TRIP6 to promote LPA-induced cell migration was significantly attenuated by PTPL1 overexpression. Because PTPL1 associates with a number of actin-associated molecules, it may play a general role in modulating cell motility through the binding and/or dephosphorylation of other substrates involved in cell adhesion and migration. To test this possibility, we first examined the effect of PTPL1 siRNA on cell motility. Indeed, suppression of endogenous PTPL1 expression significantly enhanced LPA-induced cell migration in SKOV-3 cells, suggesting a physiological relevance of PTPL1 in this regulation (Fig. 5A). To determine whether PTPL1 plays a general role in cell motility or specifically regulates LPA-induced cell migration through the modulation of TRIP6 function, next we expressed PTPL1 with the TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) mutant that lacks the PTPL1-binding domain but retains the ability to bind to the LPA2 receptor. As shown in Fig. 5B, TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) significantly enhanced LPA-induced cell migration. Although PTPL1 attenuated TRIP6-Δ-(397-476) function to promote LPA-induced cell migration, this effect was not statistically significant (p = 0.08, Student’s t-test). Thus, PTPL1-mediated dephosphorylation of TRIP6 plays a particular role in modulating its function in LPA-induced cell migration. Nonetheless, our results do not exclude the possibility that PTPL1 may play a broader role in cell migration induced by other growth factors through the binding and dephosphorylation of additional substrates involved in cell adhesion and migration. In summary, TRIP6 function in LPA-induced adhesion turnover and cell migration is coordinately regulated through c-Src- and PTPL1-dependent reversible tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Another example for this regulation is ephrinB. It has been reported that Src family kinases mediate ephrinB phosphorylation upon the engagement of ephrinB with Eph receptor and regulate ephrinB-stimulated angiogenic sprouting in primary endothelial cells. With delayed kinetics, ephrinB recruits PTP-BL and is dephosphorylated, which switches the Src-mediated signaling to PDZ-dependent signaling (23Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus far, several tyrosine phosphatases have been shown to modulate cell motility, at least including PTP-PEST, PTP-α, PTP-1B, SHP-2, and low molecular weight PTP (26Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O.

Overexpression or inhibition of these tyrosine phosphatases may perturb adhesion turnover and impair cell motility. For example, overexpression of PTP-PEST, a phosphatase for tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas, leads to the inactivation of Rac1 and defective cell migration (31Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32Sastry S.K. Lyons P.D. Schaller M.D. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the PTP-PEST-/- MEFs also show impaired cell spreading and migration (27Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, appropriate regulation of the tyrosine phosphatase activity of PTP-PEST is important for efficient cell migration. Likewise, overexpression of PTPL1 slows TRIP6 turnover at the sites of adhesions and negatively regulates TRIP6 function to promote LPA-induced cell migration. Because PTPL1 associates with a number of actin-associated molecules, it will be an important task to determine whether PTPL1 plays a wider role in modulating cell motility through dephosphorylation of other substrates involved in cell adhesion and migration.

One such compound is the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, which has been shown to significantly diminish worm burden in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Given the well established interaction between cyclosporin A and the cyclophilin superfamily of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases, we solved the structure of cyclophilin A from S. mansoni (SmCypA) by x-ray crystallography in the reduced and oxidized states at 1.5 and 1.8Å of resolution, respectively. Oxidized SmCypA contains a disulfide bridge between two C-terminal cysteines (Cys-122 and Cys-126). This is the first example of a cyclophilin containing this disulfide bridge. Parallel functional studies suggest a mechanism for regulation of SmCypA activity via oxidation of its thiol groups; in fact, whereas oxidized SmCypA is inactive, reduced SmCypA is an efficient isomerase active at nanomolar levels with a kcat/Km of 1.1 × 107 m–1 s–1, and it is inhibited by cyclosporin A (IC50 of 14 ± 4nm). The lack of conservation of this cysteine couple within the CypA superfamily, their close proximity to the active site, and the importance of thiol groups for peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity render this structural feature a challenge for the development of alternative and more effective anti-schistosomiasis inhibitors and may in addition imply an alternative function of SmCypA in the schistosome.

The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) is a specific inhibitor of Cyp, and it has permitted an improved understanding of the roles adopted by Cyps; in particular, the Cyp·CsA complex exerts its well known immunosuppressive effect through an interaction with the protein phosphatase calcineurin (6Kofron J.L.

The repertoire of Cyp functions is increasing with the identification of numerous atypical Cyps, including a 33-kDa human nuclear E isoform (hCYP33), which contains an additional RNA binding domain (9Mi H. Kops O. Zimmermann E. Jaschke A. Tropschug M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and cyclophilins that contain regions involved in hormone receptor binding. In most species isoform A, which is found in abundance in the cytosol, is the major isoform; the less-abundant isoform B is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, in schistosomes, isoform A represents the minor species and was reported to exhibit decreased PPIase activity in comparison to isoform B (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At present, schistosomiasis, which infects 200 million people worldwide, is treated using the drug of choice, praziquantel (11Cioli D. Pica-Mattoccia L. Parasitol Res. 2003; 90: 3-9Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is an obvious risk to base treatment on a single drug, and low sensitivity strains (11Cioli D. Pica-Mattoccia L. Parasitol Res. 2003; 90: 3-9Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have already appeared, making it clear that alternative treatments must be sought. Interestingly, in addition to its well known immunosuppressive effects, CsA (7Borel J.F. Baumann G. Chapman I. Donatsch P. Fahr A. Mueller E.A. Vigouret J.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 35: 115-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) proved to have anti-parasitic activities against a number of human protozoal and helminth parasites, including schistosomes (12Bell A. Roberts H.C. Chappell L.H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of such effects are as yet unknown, they have been observed to be unrelated to the PPIase and T cell activation roles and, therefore, raise the possibility of cyclophilins possessing alternative functions in parasites (13Page A.P. Kumar S. Carlow C.K. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 385-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structure and role of SmCypA in the schistosome and to clarify its interaction with CsA, we solved the tertiary structure of SmCypA by x-ray crystallography. SmCypA contains seven cysteines; two of these (Cys-122 and Cys-126), located in close proximity to the active site, are not conserved in the Cyp superfamily as a doublet. We crystallized two oxidation states of the apoenzyme; one presenting the reduced cysteine couple, and the other containing a disulfide bridge between these two residues never reported before in other Cyps. We have carried out functional experiments which demonstrate that these two diverse redox states have different PPIase activities; we proved that the oxidized form is inactive, whereas the reduced form is fully active. Given the presence of redox active cysteines and previous reports suggesting that the anti-parasitic actions of CsA are unrelated to the inhibition of PPIase activity (14Khattab A. Pica-Mattoccia L. Klinkert M.Q. Wenger R. Cioli D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 90: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it is possible that in the schistosome SmCypA may have an alternative role that may stimulate the development of novel anti-schistosomiasis therapies, specific for this unique cysteine couple. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of SmCypA—The SmCypA gene (accession number U50388 (15Klinkert M.Q. Bugli F. Cruz J. Engels B. Cioli D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) was amplified from adult Schistosoma mansoni cDNA (a kind gift from Prof. R. Pierce, Institut Pasteur, Lille, France) using KOD HotStart DNA polymerase (Novagen) and gene-specific primers according to standard protocols. All reactions were carried out in a PTC-150 Minicycler™ (MJ Research Inc.). The gene was directionally cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) expression vector via BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The fidelity of the PCR reaction was confirmed by sequencing (BMR Sequencing Service, University of Padova, Padova, Italy). SmCypA was expressed with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag in BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacterial cells upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, incubating overnight at 22 °C. Successful expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, highlighting a band at ∼45 kDa. After centrifugation, the bacterial cells were resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme and lysed by sonication (5 cycles of 45-s on, 15-s off pulses). The protein was purified from the soluble fraction by gravity flow on a disposable PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) containing 5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm CaCl2). The glutathione S-transferase tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cleaved SmCypAred was eluted upon washing with thrombin cleavage buffer, and the thrombin was removed from the eluate by passage on a 1-ml HiTrap™ benzamidine F-F(HS) column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SmCypAred was exchanged into crystallization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra centrifuge filter device (Millipore) with a molecular weight cut-off of 5000. For the functional experiments, SmCypA was buffer-exchanged into 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 86 mm NaCl. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion according to standard hanging drop methods. Crystals of reduced SmCypA (SmCypAred) grew over 3 days in a drop composed of 1 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) and 1 μl of well solution (32% (w/v) PEG 5K MME, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5). The oxidized form of SmCypA (SmCypAox) was obtained by stepwise soaking in well solution (30% (w/v) PEG 5K MME, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5) containing copper (II) sulfate until a final concentration of 2 μm was achieved (16Cavallini D. De Marco C. Dupre S. Rotilio G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The crystals were incubated overnight at 20 °C in the final soaking conditions before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were collected at resolutions ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 Å at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) and DESY (Hamburg, Germany) facilities. Both redox states of SmCypA were assigned a P212121 space group using the HKL suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). All data were refined to give satisfactory final R and Rfree factors and geometric parameters (Table 1). Protease-coupled PPIase Assay—PPIase activity was measured using the standard protease-coupled spectrophotometric assay (23Fischer G. Aumuller T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 148: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which follows the cleavage of the trans form of the chromogenic peptide substrate, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin. Reactions were carried out at 10 °C in 2.9 ml of assay buffer (35 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 86 mm NaCl, and 0.015% Triton-X-100). Ice-cold chymotrypsin solution (added from a 2 mm stock prepared in 10 mm HCl) was added to the cuvette immediately followed by SmCypA and peptide (added from a 7.8 mm stock, prepared in 0.47 m LiCl/TFE (6Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar)) to initiate the reaction. The cis-trans isomerization of the Pro-Phe bond was measured by following the absorbance increase at 390 nm over 200–600s. The initial concentrations of cis and trans peptide were determined using their absorption coefficients at different wavelengths (390–435 nm) depending on the substrate concentration and the difference between the initial and final absorbance values. Rate constants were calculated from duplicate or triplicate measurements using either Grafit 5.0.11 or Matlab 5 package 5. All results take into account the rate of the non-catalyzed reaction in the absence of SmCypA. CsA Inhibition Studies—CsA inhibition studies were carried out according to the above-described standard PPIase assay except that the enzyme (10 nm) was preincubated at 10 °C in assay buffer containing varying concentrations (0–100 nm)of CsA (added from stocks prepared in 50% (v/v) methanol) before the addition of peptide and chymotrypsin at final concentrations of 50 μm and 33 μm, respectively. First order rate constants were calculated from duplicate or triplicate measurements made at each inhibitor concentration, and the IC50 was calculated by non-linear regression using the Grafit 5.0.11 package. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) Assays—SmCypA (400 nm), diluted in assay buffer, was incubated at room temperature with 500 μm NEM (from 50 mg/ml stock prepared in 100% EtOH). At various time intervals an aliquot was removed and assayed for remaining PPIase activity as described above. Final SmCypA, peptide, and chymotrypsin concentrations were 20 nm, 50 μm, and 33 μm, respectively. Duplicate assay profiles were collected over 200–600 s from which the first order rate constants were obtained. Time at 0 min represents enzyme activity, before the addition of NEM. The amino acid sequence of SmCypA is in agreement with that of the alternatively spliced isoform of SmCypA, which results in a Ile to Phe substitution at position 95 (NCBI accession number U50388) (24Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The electron density corresponding to the main chain and side chains of both reduced and oxidized SmCypA is well defined, except for the first 10 N-terminal residues (indicating high flexibility). Both structures display good geometry with no residues lying within the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). Overall Tertiary Structure—The C-α backbone atoms of SmCypA (residues 10–172) and human hCYP33 (residues 139–300) were aligned using the C-α matching program (25Bachar O. Fischer D. Nussinov R. Wolfson H. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure displays significant similarity with hCYP33 (r.m.s.d. = 0.6 Å), not unexpected given the high sequence identity (66%) (20Wang T. Yun C.H. Gu S.Y. Chang W.R. Liang D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The core structure is a monomeric β-barrel formed by eight anti-parallel β-sheets and capped at either end by two α-helices, in agreement with the canonical fold of cyclophilins (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A, superimposition of the three-dimensional structures of SmCypAred (blue ribbon) and SmCypAox (magenta), highlighting the N and C termini. B, detailed view of the substrate/inhibitor binding site of SmCypAred (the view is 180° rotated with respect to panel A). Cys-122, Cys-126, and residues forming the pockets listed in Table 2 are shown in ball-and-stick format. The red circles indicate the approximate location of pockets 1, 2, and 3. C, as in B, shown is the substrate/inhibitor binding site of SmCypAox, containing the disulfide bond. D, magnified view of the active site loop. The interactions of water molecule (W40) with the sulfur atoms of Cys-122 and Cys-126 are shown together with their distances from the carbonyl groups of the loop, which make contact with the water. This figure was generated using PyMOL (34).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although we were unable to obtain crystals of SmCypA in complex with a peptide substrate or CsA, the main-chain and side-chain conformations of the active site residues (Arg-62, Phe-67, Met-68, Asn-109, Phe-120, Trp-128, Leu-129, and His-133) in the apoenzyme are identical to those reported for hCYP33 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, two cysteine residues (Cys-122 and Cys-126) are located in the vicinity of the active site and at a distance of 3.8 Å from each other. In the reduced enzyme, a water molecule (W40) is located within the loop delimited by the sulfur atoms of Cys-122 and Cys-126, at a distance compatible with H-bond. Moreover this water molecule is also at H-bond distance with the two carbonyl groups of Thr-124 and Gly-101 (Fig. 2D). The Two Redox Forms of SmCypA—Although all seven cysteine residues were in the reduced state, it was observed that a slight alteration in the position of the side chains of Cys-122 and Cys-126 would be compatible with a disulfide bond formation. To investigate this possibility we attempted to oxidize reduced crystals by progressive soaking with a reservoir solution containing copper (II) sulfate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We successfully obtained an oxidized crystal of SmCypA, as judged by subsequent crystallographic analysis. Alignment of the full-length main chain of both redox states indicates that the overall tertiary structure is highly similar (r.m.s.d. = 0.45 Å). In the electron density map of the oxidized form, an increased motility of a loop composed of residues 76–81 was observed together with a disulfide bond between Cys-122 and Cys-126 (2.05 Å) (Fig. 2D). The formation of the disulfide bridge is a result of side-chain rotameric movements and does not involve movement of the loop containing the cysteines or any other secondary structure element, as shown in Fig. 2A. The previously mentioned water molecule (W40), in between the sulfurs of Cys-122 and Cys-126, is absent in the oxidized structure. The other five cysteines (Cys-47, −58, −59, −69, and −168) are all in their reduced states and exceed the correct distance for disulfide bond formation. Except for Cys-58 and Cys-59, they are highly conserved among Cyps. Analysis of Surface and Pocket Alterations in the Two Redox States—To establish if there were any differences in the protein surface, internal/external pockets, or solvent accessibility of residues between the two redox states, a computational analysis was carried out using the MSD Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies program (33Krissinel E. Henrick K. Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg2005: 163-174Google Scholar). As expected, Cys-122 and Cys-126 were solvent-accessible in the reduced state and solvent-inaccessible in the oxidized enzyme. Formation of the disulfide bridge is coupled to alterations in two of the three pockets, each one lined by the residues listed in Table 2. Although pocket 1 is essentially the same in the two redox states, the internal pocket 2, upon oxidation, shows an increase in surface area and volume and a different amino acid composition (Table 2); in particular, the active site residue Arg-62 is out of this pocket. However, the most significant change is the collapse of pocket 3. In the reduced enzyme this internal pocket contains Cys-122 and Cys-126 in addition to four conserved active site residues (Phe-67, Met-68, Phe-120, and Leu-129) (Table 2); it is not exposed to the solvent (no mouth openings) and has a molecular surface area of 51.9 Å2. Upon oxidation, pocket 3 disappears due to the collapse of the implicated residues. Therefore, we conclude that formation of Cys-122–Cys-126 disulfide bond is associated with changes in the internal structure of the enzyme.TABLE 2Volumes and internal surface areas of three pockets of SmCypA; comparison between reduced (RED) and oxidized (OX) statesPocket no.ResiduesN_mthArea_msVol_msSmCypA1Asp92, Phe 95, Asn-109, Pro-112148.944.4REDAsp-92, Phe-95, Asn-109, Pro-112, Lys-132158.668.4OX2Arg-62, Ile-64, Met-68027.813.7REDVal-63, Met-68, Cys-69, Thr-123, Val-146, Glu-1500103.081.9OX3Phe-67, Met-68, Phe-120, Cys-122, Cys-126, Leu-12051.924.5REDPocket absent in OX Open table in a new tab PPIase Experiments—The cis to trans isomerization of succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide was measured using the standard protease-coupled assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The excess trans isomer is hydrolyzed by chymotrypsin within the dead time of the instrument, allowing us to further follow cis to trans isomerization of the peptide as catalyzed by SmCypA. PPIase assays, typically carried out at low substrate concentration (50 μm), generated characteristic first order reaction profiles that were fitted accordingly (Fig. 3A). As expected, non-catalyzed reaction had a greater effect on the initial velocity at higher substrate concentrations (indicating that we are near the Km), and the data no longer reflected a first order process. Therefore, at substrate concentrations lower than the Km, the Michaelis-Menten equation can be simplified to v = kcat[E][S]/Km. Because v = ko[S], the equation can be further simplified to ko = kcat[E]/Km. Our experiments were carried out at a peptide concentration of 50 μm; therefore, the plot of ko as a function of enzyme concentration yields a linear plot with the slope equivalent to a kcat/Km of 1.1 × 107 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 3A). Our enzyme is 10-fold more efficient than previously described for SmCypA and more similar to SmCypB (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably due to that fact that Bugli et al. (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) may have used a non-homogeneous redox state of the SmCypA. Furthermore, our protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography, whereas theirs, expressed as a non-fused protein, was purified by the harsher method of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion-exchange chromatography. Enzymatic Activity and Redox State of Cys-122 and Cys-126—To assess the importance of the redox state of SmCypA for rotamase activity, the PPIase activities of the oxidized and reduced forms of SmCypA were compared. The oxidized enzyme was prepared by treating a stock solution of SmCypA (400 nm) with 50 μm CuSO4. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, PPIase activity was measured at varying enzyme concentrations; using the standard assay, the oxidized enzyme was found to be inactive, even at 30 nm SmCypA. This is consistent with our structural findings on SmCypA showing the collapse of internal pocket 3, which in the reduced state contains residues involved in PPIase activity. Oxidation of the enzyme, therefore, would likely hinder binding of the peptide substrate to the active site. Oxidation and inactivation were also observed after incubation with substoichiometric amounts of CuSO4 even though in this case inactivation was incomplete (results not shown). This result confirms that copper acts catalytically to promote oxidation. Inactivation was found to be reversible upon reduction of SmCypAox; after the addition of EDTA (1 mm) and dithiothreitol (10 mm), activity was completely restored, confirming that Cys-122 and Cys-126 must be reduced for PPIase activity. Our experiments do not provide a good estimate of the steady state parameters for reduced SmCypA (Fig. 3B) because the Km is relatively high (>0.5 mm), and at the substrate concentrations required to explore the high asymptote of the Michaelis plot, both the rate of spontaneous isomerization of the substrate and the optical density of the sample are so high as to jeopardize the measurements. These values are compatible with those of similar Cyps (26Berriman M. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oxidized CypA has negligible catalytic activity, and the high rate of spontaneous isomerization of the substrate would render any estimate unreliable. Therefore, we cannot assign a value for the catalytic activity of oxidized SmCypA. The Effect of Thiol Modification on PPIase Activity—To assess the general importance of sulfhydryl groups for PPIase activity, SmCypA was treated with NEM, which covalently binds free sulfhydryl groups. During incubation with NEM, SmCypA was removed at various times and assayed for residual isomerase activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, incubation of 200 nm SmCypA with 500 μm NEM resulted in a decrease in PPIase activity over time, with ∼53% inhibition within the first 5 min (Fig. 3C). Although the precise sulfhydryl groups that were modified by NEM was not ascertained, a role of sulfhydryl groups in catalysis was clearly established. The Effect of CsA on PPIase Activity—Although the IC50 has already been established for SmCypA in a previous paper (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we repeated this analysis with our preparation. First order rate constants were plotted as a function of the logarithm of inhibitor concentration (Fig. 3D), and the IC50 was calculated from the corresponding dose-response curve, as previously described (26). SmCypA was extremely sensitive to CsA inhibition, and at a concentration of 10 nm SmCypA, an IC50 of 14 ± 4nm was determined (Fig. 3D). This value is in agreement with the IC50 calculated for CypA from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (20 nm) (26Berriman M. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and SmCypB; however, it is significantly lower than the previously reported value for SmCypA (72 μm) (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the crystallographic structure and the catalytic properties of two redox states of cyclophilin from S. mansoni, reduced and oxidized, the latter containing a novel intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys-122 and Cys-126, two cysteines located near the active site and present only in S. mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum. In addition, we show that the oxidized state of SmCypA is devoid of its cis-trans isomerase activity, this effect being reversible upon reduction of the disulfide bridge with dithiothreitol. The overall three-dimensional structure of both reduced and oxidized SmCypA is that of a monomer comprising a β-barrel enclosed by an α-helix at both ends, similar to that of all deposited Cyp structures. The substrate and inhibitor binding site is also highly similar if not identical to other Cyp members. However, unexpectedly, the oxidized structure contains a disulfide bond between Cys-122 and Cys-126, the former being relatively conserved among Cyps, whereas the latter is often replaced by a threonine. Formation of the disulfide bond does not perturb the overall structure of SmCypA, the average B factor over this region of the protein (amino acids 100–130) being the same as in the reduced enzyme. However, disulfide formation is associated to the collapse of the internal pocket 3, which contains key active site residues and, therefore, to an alteration in the solvent accessibility of Cys-122 and Cys-126. A water molecule (W40), present only in SmCypAred between the sulfur atoms of Cys-122 and Cys-126, may have a role in the formation of the disulfide. W40 participates in two H-bonds with the carbonyl groups of neighboring Thr-124 and Gly-101, which may increase its base properties and, thus, promote deprotonation of either cysteine, favoring disulfide bridge formation (Fig. 2D). The internal pocket 3 in the reduced enzyme houses several conserved active site residues in addition to Cys-122 and Cys-126. Its closure upon oxidation would interfere with substrate binding and, therefore, PPIase activity. In fact, we have shown that, whereas reduced SmCypA is active at nanomolar levels (kcat/Km of 1.1 × 107 m–1 s–1), the enzyme becomes inactive upon oxidation catalyzed by copper (II) sulfate or modification with NEM. The catalytic efficiency of SmCypAred is greater than previously reported (10Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but ∼10-fold lower than that of human and P. falciparum (26Berriman M. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) CypA isoforms. Our results lead us to suggest that SmCypA activity may be redox-regulated by thiol modification. Redox-regulation of cyclophilins has been reported for hCypA from T lymphocytes, in which key cysteine residues are glutathionylated (27Ghezzi P. Casagrande S. Massignan T. Basso M. Bellacchio E. Mollica L. Biasini E. Tonelli R. Eberini I. Gianazza E. Dai W.W. Fratelli M. Salmona M. Sherry B. Bonetto V. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This type of modification permits hCypA to regulate immunity, although the exact significance remains to be clarified. Another example is chloroplast CypA from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is redox-regulated by thiol modification in a mechanism involving thioredoxin (Trx) as the electron donor (28Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A. thaliana CypA is inactive in its oxidized state but active when Trx reduces the two disulfide bonds involving four conserved cysteine residues (Cys-53–Cys-170 and Cys-128 –Cys-175) (28Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the schistosomal enzyme the structure of SmCypAox shows that there is no disulfide bond between Cys-47 and Cys-168 (equivalent to Cys-53–Cys-170 of A. thaliana), the distance between these two SH groups being 5.4 Å, as in SmCypAred. On the other hand, the disulfide between Cys-122 and Cys-126 (equivalent to Cys-128 of A. thaliana) is clearly visible in the oxidized enzyme, forming a CXXXC motif analogous to that found in several proteins involved in redox cascades (29Senkevich T.G. White C.L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that SmCypA could form other disulfide bridges given that the other cysteines are either 5.4 Å apart (Cys-47–Cys-168, Cys-58 –Cys-59) or alone in the protein matrix (Cys-69). Because CypA from A. thaliana interacts with chloroplast Trx (28Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the possibility of an interaction between SmTrx and SmCypA was investigated and ruled out by pulldown assays using glutathione S-transferase-tagged SmCypA bound to a GSH-Sepharose column and recombinant SmTrx and by gel exclusion chromatography (results not shown). Parasite cyclophilins have been a subject of study because of the anti-parasitic effects of their inhibitor cyclosporin A, as observed both in vitro and in vivo against various parasitic protozoa, typically acting to decrease parasite burden and increase host longevity (12Bell A. Roberts H.C. Chappell L.H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Chappell L.H. Wastling J.M. Parasitology. 1992; 105: S25-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Munro G.H. McLaren D.J. Parasitology. 1990; 100: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to S. mansoni, CsA-susceptible parasites include P. falciparum, Leishmania major, and Toxoplasma gondii. With reference to some parasites, including S. mansoni, the CsA anti-parasitic effects are not related to PPIase activity and occur at sub-immunosuppressive levels, ruling out a direct involvement of the host immune system. This raises the question about the real biological functions of parasite cyclophilins (14Khattab A. Pica-Mattoccia L. Klinkert M.Q. Wenger R. Cioli D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 90: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our study confirms that SmCypAred is inhibited by CsA with an IC50 in the nanomolar range, similar to that of other Cyps (10–9–10–6 m). The search for novel schistosomiasis therapies is ongoing, yet treatment relies essentially on praziquantel. Ideal drug targets are schistosome proteins that exhibit peculiar structural features that may aid the development of specific inhibitors. Perhaps a more specific SmCypA inhibitor could be designed taking into account that thiols are essential for catalysis and that the active Cys-122 and Cys-126 are not conserved among the cyclophilin superfamily.

Marked responders have a sharp decline in viral titer within a few days of treatment initiation, whereas in other patients there is no effect on the virus (poor responders). Previous studies have shown that combination therapy modifies expression of hundreds of genes in vitro and in vivo. However, identifying which, if any, of these genes have a role in viral clearance remains challenging.The goal of this paper is to link viral levels with gene expression and thereby identify genes that may be responsible for early decrease in viral titer.Microarrays were performed on RNA isolated from PBMC of patients undergoing interferon/ribavirin therapy. Samples were collected at pre-treatment (day 0), and 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 days after initiating treatment. A novel method was applied to identify genes that are linked to a decrease in viral titer during interferon/ribavirin treatment. The method uses the relationship between inter-patient gene expression based proximities and inter-patient viral titer based proximities to define the association between microarray gene expression measurements of each gene and viral-titer measurements.We detected 36 unique genes whose expressions provide a clustering of patients that resembles viral titer based clustering of patients. These genes include IRF7, MX1, OASL and OAS2, viperin and many ISG's of unknown function.The genes identified by this method appear to play a major role in the reduction of hepatitis C virus during the early phase of treatment. The method has broad utility and can be used to analyze response to any group of factors influencing biological outcome such as antiviral drugs or anti-cancer agents where microarray data are available."

In addition to its cADPR-synthesizing activity, CD38 is in fact the only characterized enzyme that can effectively degrade cADPR. To better understand CD38-cADPR-dependent calcium signaling, it is important to know the structural determinants and molecular interactions involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR catalyzed by CD38. We have previously obtained the structure of a CD38-cADPR complex by using a catalytically inactive mutant of CD38. This was done by mutating the catalytic residue Glu-226 to glutamine (Q), and the inactive mutant (E226Q) was used to form a complex with cADPR (20Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The structure shows that Gln-226 is too far away from the binding site of cADPR to be involved in catalysis. An analog of cADPR, cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR), which is cyclized at the N7 position instead of the N1 position of cADPR, however, is able to bind close to Gln-226. These structural results have led us to propose that in wild-type CD38, cADPR may, in fact, bind close to Glu-226 in a manner similar to cGDPR so that catalysis can occur. It has been further proposed that the catalytic residue is involved not only in attacking the scissile glycosidic bond but also in stabilizing cADPR at an active position close to the residue for catalysis. To prove our proposal, a binary system consisting of the active wild-type CD38 and an inactive substrate analog is necessary. Recently, an analog of cADPR, N1-cIDPR, has been synthesized that is totally resistant to hydrolysis by CD38 (29Wagner G.K. Guse A.H. Potter B.V.L. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 4810-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also a close structural analog of cADPR, as shown in Fig. 1. The only difference is an oxo group at position 6 of the purine ring replacing the imino group of cADPR. N1-cIDPR is also a functional mimic of cADPR that can activate calcium signals that are almost identical to those triggered by cADPR in cells (30Kirchberger T. Wagner G. Xu J. Cordiglieri C. Wang P. Gasser A. Fliegert R. Bruhn S. Flugel A. Lund F.E. Zhang L.H. Potter B.V.L. Guse A.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 149: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have succeeded in obtaining a complex of N1-cIDPR with the wild-type CD38. The results show that the cyclic nucleotide indeed binds close to the catalytic residue Glu-226, confirming our original proposal. Structural analyses of the complex reveal that both the active site of CD38 and the substrate are flexible and multiple conformational changes accompany substrate binding and the catalytic process. Protein Production, Crystallization, Complex Formation, and Data Collection—Expression, purification, and crystallization of wild-type CD38 and E226Q mutant proteins were performed using procedures as previously described (18Liu Q.

Potter B.V.L. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 4810-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The CD38-N1-cIDPR complex was obtained by incubating preformed wild-type CD38 crystals with 20 mm N1-cIDPR for 15–300 min at 4 °C in 4 μl of soaking solution that also contained the crystallization buffer (10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0) and 30% glycerol. The preformed CD38 crystals were grown at room temperature as described previously (18Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q.

The incubation conditions required to obtain the complex did not alter the crystals as they were stable for as long as several hours at 4 °C. Similarly, the E226Q-N1-cIDPR complex was obtained by incubating preformed E226Q mutant crystals with 30 mm N1-cIDPR for 4 min at 4 °C in 3 μl of soaking solution consisting of crystallization buffer (15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0) and 30% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) A1 station under the protection of a liquid nitrogen cryo-stream at 100 K. A total of 360 images were collected from a single crystal with an oscillation angle of 1°. Raw images were integrated, scaled, and merged by using the program HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Refinement—The N1-cIDPR complex structures were refined by REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) with the starting model derived from the CD38 E226Q-cGDPR complex (PDB accession code 2O3T). There are two CD38 molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Only the electron densities in the active site of one of the two molecules were modeled as N1-cIDPR. In the other molecule, the electron densities are too noisy to be useful. The N1-cIDPR molecule was built in O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) based on the structure of cGDPR and the σ A weighted Fo – Fc difference electron densities. Solvents were added automatically by Arp/warp (34Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzmol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and manually inspected/modified under the program O. At the end of refinements, translation, libration, screw rotation (TLS) refinement implemented in REFMAC was introduced to model the data anisotropy. The refinement results and model statistics are listed in Table 1. Modeling the cADPR Structure—The cADPR model was built based on the wild-type CD38-N1-cIDPR complex. The O6 atom on the purine ring was changed to NH, and the new CD38-cADPR model was energetically minimized with the C6-N6 distance restrained at 1.33 Å. To keep the overall structure unchanged, we included the diffraction data during the energy minimization. Before running energy minimization with the program CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), the occupancies for residues 129, 133, 143–148, and 155 in molecule A were set to 0. These residues showed structural differences from their corresponding residues in the cGDPR complex and were supposed to undergo structural changes during cADPR binding. Setting their occupancies to 0 excludes the x-ray term restraints on these selected residues so that they can move during the energy minimization. A control, in which x-ray terms for these indicated residues were turned off, was also performed in an equivalent refinement of the original CD38-N1-cIDPR complex. Enzymatic Assay for cADPR Hydrolysis—The inhibition of cADPR hydrolysis by various concentrations of N1-cIDPR (0–1 mm) was determined by incubating 1 μm cADPR with 2 μg/ml of CD38 for 10 min at 20–24 °C in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 mm HCl. The precipitated protein was filtered, and the pH was neutralized with Tris base. After diluting the mixture 20-fold, the concentration of the unhydrolyzed cADPR present in the diluted reaction mixture was assayed by the fluorimetric cycling assay as described previously (36Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structure of N1-cIDPR Complexed with Wild-type CD38—The structure of the CD38-N1-cIDPR complex refined at 1.7 Å contained two molecules of CD38 in the asymmetric unit, with N1-cIDPR present in only one of them. This is also true for the cGDPR complex as previously reported (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). N1-cIDPR bound to a pocket at the cleft that separated the N- and C-domains of CD38 (Fig. 2, A and B). The 2′-, 3′-OH groups on the N1-cIDPR northern ribose form two hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of Glu-226 (Fig. 2C). The C1′-carbon of the bound N1-cIDPR, is 3.43 Å from Glu-226, a suitable distance for catalytic attack of the N1-glycosidic bond by the residue. Similar distances between the catalytic residue and the bound nucleotide ribose were also found in CD38 soaked in NGD (19Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and CD157 bound with NMN (37Yamamoto-Katayama S. Ariyoshi M. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Jingami H. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to Glu-226, N1-cIDPR interacted with the substrate binding motif (Trp-125, Ser-126, Arg-127, Thr-221, Phe-222) and the activity regulatory motif (Glu-146 and Trp-189) identified previously (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The oxygen at position 6 of the purine ring (6-oxo) was 2.24 Å from Glu-146 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, Ser-193, a residue previously identified as having an auxiliary catalytic role (19Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was 3.18 Å from the N1-glycosidic bond of N1-cIDPR. The geometry of the anomeric carbon (C1′) and its proximity to the OH group of Ser-193 suggest the formation of a hydrogen bond between C1′ and the OH group with C1′ being the hydrogen donor. Comparison between the N1-cIDPR and the cADPR Complexes—Comparing the CD38-N1-cIDPR structure with the previously published E226Q-cADPR structure (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that N1-cIDPR binds much deeper into the active site pocket (Fig. 3A). The binding of a non-hydrolyzable analog into the catalytic pocket is expected to block entry of cADPR. Indeed, we have observed inhibition of cADPR hydrolysis by N1-cIDPR with a half-maximal effect at 0.26 mm. Fig. 3B compares the binding of cADPR to the inactive E226Q mutant and N1-cIDPR to the wild-type CD38. It can be seen that, in the case of the cADPR-E226Q complex, the N6 of the cADPR was H-bonded not only to Glu-146 but also to Asp-155. Additionally, Glu-146 was H-bonded to one of the ribosyl hydroxyl groups of cADPR. Hydrophobic overlap between the cADPR adenine moiety and Trp-189 indole moiety was also extensive, involving both rings of the adenine. The mutation of the catalytic residue Glu-226 to Gln-226 trapped cADPR in an unproductive site, 6.12 Å away from the catalytic residue. In the case of N1-cIDPR, the N6 is replaced with oxygen (O6), resulting in altered interactions with both Glu-146 and Asp-155. N1-cIDPR is now closer to catalytic residue (Glu-226) and forms two H-bonds with its carboxyl group. Consistently, we have previously shown that cGDPR (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which also has O6 instead of N6 in its purine ring, likewise can bind deep into the pocket in a manner similar to N1-cIDPR. Comparison with E226Q-N1-cIDPR Complex—To directly compare with the E226Q-cADPR complex, we determined the crystal structure of the E226Q-N1-cIDPR complex at 1.76 Å. Similar to that seen with the wild-type CD38 complex as described above, N1-cIDPR not only can bind to the equivalent site in the E226Q mutant but can also bind very close to Gln-226 deep inside the site. The alignment of the E226Q-N1-cIDPR structure and wild-type CD38-N1-cIDPR structure shows slight differences for their equivalent sites (Fig. 4A). In the E226Q-N1-cIDPR structure, Gln-226 was 2.84 and 2.61 Å from the ribosyl 2′-, 3′-OH groups, respectively, suggesting the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl group of Gln-226 is less electronegative than the carboxyl group of Glu-226 in the wild-type CD38 and thus is expected to form weaker hydrogen bonding interactions. Consistently, Gln-226 was 3.71 Å to the C1′-carbon in the E226Q complex, farther away than the distance of 3.43 Å between Glu-226 and C1′-carbon of N1-cIDPR in the wild-type complex. These observations are all consistent with the proposal that the catalytic residue Glu-226 is also important in stabilizing the substrate, such as cADPR or N1-cIDPR, at its catalytic position. Two other residues, Ser-193 and Glu-146, also showed mildly altered interactions between N1-cIDPR and the enzyme upon Glu-226 mutation as shown in Fig. 4A. The consequence of the E226Q mutation can also be seen in the electron densities of N1-cIDPR in the E226Q mutant and wild-type CD38. Comparing the Fo – Fc omit electron densities for N1-cIDPR in E226Q (Fig. 4B) and in the wild-type CD38 (Fig. 4C), it can be seen that the electron density for O6 was absent in the E226Q-N1-cIDPR complex (Fig. 4B), whereas it was very clear in the CD38-N1-cIDPR complex (Fig. 4C). A Proposed Nonproductive Site along the cADPR Entry Pathway—CD38 is the only known protein that can hydrolyze cADPR to ADP-ribose and thus is important for the metabolism of cADPR. In our prior study, we have demonstrated the trapping of cADPR in a nonproductive site when it formed a binary complex with mutants of CD38, E226Q, E226G, or E226D (28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effort to form a complex between cADPR and wild-type CD38 resulted in only ADPR, the product, in the active site due to the hydrolysis of cADPR. N1-cIDPR, which is not hydrolyzable by the wild-type CD38, is thus more suitable for complex formation. The crystal structure of CD38-N1-cIDPR complex determined in this study demonstrates that N1-cIDPR can reach the catalytic residue and be stabilized by forming two H-bonds between them (Fig. 2C). During the hydrolysis of cADPR by the wild-type CD38, these two H-bonds are likely to be also present, since they are likely to be important in both substrate activation and the stabilization of the reaction intermediate. There is likely a nonproductive site on the wild-type CD38 during substrate binding, similar to that seen in the E226Q-cADPR complex (Fig. 3). The superposition of apo-CD38 with apo-E226Q shows that the nonproductive site seen in E226Q is structurally conserved with the corresponding site in the wild-type CD38, with a root mean square difference of only 0.27 Å for residues Trp-125, Ser-126, Arg-127, Glu-146, Asp-155, Trp-189, Ser-193, Thr-221, Phe-222, and Glu-226 (see supplemental Fig. S1). It is logical to propose that during the entry of cADPR into the active site, the substrate may interact with this same site. As the site is close to the mouth of the active site pocket, it can represent the first and transitory contact site of cADPR with CD38 before reaching the catalytic residue Glu-226. The E226Q-cADPR complex thus is likely to represent a transient state during the binding of cADPR. Fig. 5B superimposes this transient state (gray) and the final state (green) of cADPR binding inside the active site. These results represent the most detailed description of the catalytic hydrolysis of cADPR at atomic resolution and are fully consistent with all available biochemical data. Model of the CD38-cADPR Complex—The close similarity between N1-cIDPR and cADPR makes it a suitable analog for elucidating the structural determinants important for cADPR hydrolysis by the wild-type CD38. To obtain a model for the wild-type CD38-cADPR complex, the 6-oxo group (O6) on the purine ring was replaced by an imino group (NH) followed by energy minimization to construct the hydrogen bond interaction between cADPR and Glu-146. The results show that the side chain of residue Glu-146 undergoes a large movement and forms two hydrogen bonds to purine N6 and N7 at distances of 2.6 and 2.9 Å, respectively (Fig. 5A, green). To judge the significance of the revealed molecular motions, we also performed a control refinement of the CD38-N1-cIDPR complex in which x-ray terms for residues (129, 133, 143–148, and 155) were turned off. The refined N1-cIDPR-CD38 and cADPR-CD38 models were superimposed on these residues. Results show that the root mean square deviation between those indicated residues is 0.17 Å for the side chain atoms and 0.06 Å for the main chain atoms, suggesting that the protein side chain atoms are more flexible than the main chain during the transition from cIDPR to cADPR. The most obvious movement seen in the side chains is for Glu-146, the residue involved in forming two H bonds with the cADPR N6 and N7 atoms. The cADPR-CD38 model obtained should represent the final position of cADPR in the Michaelis complex before the catalytic attack. Superimposed on the model is the structure of the apo-CD38 (Fig. 5A, yellow) to illustrate the conformational change of the residue Glu-146 during catalysis. Conformational Changes Accompanying Substrate Binding and Catalysis—The first change involves residues Glu-146 and Asp-147. During cADPR entry, the two residues need to retreat from the yellow positions (apo-CD38, Fig. 5A) to the green positions (Fig. 5A) of the final states, respectively, to make room for the adenine ring of cADPR. The backward movements of the residues Glu-146 and Asp-147 were also observed for the binding of both N1-cIDPR and cGDPR but not for the binding of either NAD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide, or nicotinamide mononucleotide (16Graeff R. Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Hao Q. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28951-28957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5853-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They are thus specific for cyclic substrates but not for linear substrates. The important role of Glu-146 in regulating the enzymatic activities of CD38 has been well established by site-directed mutagenesis (17Graeff R. Munshi C. Aarhus R. Johns M. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is also structurally obvious as it forms direct hydrogen bonds with the N6 of cADPR and the ribosyl 2′-OH group (Fig. 5B, gray) to facilitate the recruitment of cADPR. As the substrate moves to the final catalytic position, Glu-146 constructs sustained hydrogen bonding interactions with the N6 and N7 nitrogen on the substrate purine ring (Fig. 5, A and B, green). The second change is the indole ring of Trp-125. Comparison of the cADPR-E226Q complex and the cADPR-CD38 model shows that the side chain of Trp-125 rotates toward the active site, accompanying the entry of cADPR from the nonproductive site to the productive site. This results in a 1.16 Å movement for the tip (CH2 atom) of the indole ring (Fig. 5B). The conformational change of the Trp-125 side chain is necessary; otherwise, cADPR would have a close hydrophobic contact with Trp-125 at a distance of 2.40Å, which is stereochemically unlikely. In other words, the conformational change of the side chain relieves the contact between Trp-125 and the substrate from 2.40 to 3.42 Å, a more favorable distance for hydrophobic interaction. The conformational change for Trp-125 during the catalysis is consistent with the reduced intrinsic fluorescence changes upon substrate binding (38Cakir-Kiefer I. Muller-Steffner H. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The third change is the side chain of Arg-127, which also undergoes a small movement (0.93 Å) during the substrate binding process to optimize its interactions with the substrate (Fig. 5A). Similar to Trp-125, the movement of Arg-127 is essential, or cADPR will be too close to Arg-127 with a distance of only 1.80 Å. Enzyme-induced Structural Changes of the Substrate—Corresponding to the conformational changes observed in the active site of the enzyme, cADPR itself also undergoes changes. This can be shown by comparing the structures of cADPR determined at its free acid form by x-ray crystallography (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C, yellow, Free form) and cADPR bound to the wild-type CD38 derived from the N1-cIDPR complex (Fig. 5C, green, Activated form). The crystal structure of cADPR is shown by NMR to be the same as its natural form adopted in solution (39Graham S.M. Pope S.C. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2001; 20: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For easy visualization of the substrate transformation, we aligned the adenine rings of the two cADPR molecules (Fig. 5C). Comparing the free form cADPR with the one that bound deep into the active site of the wild-type CD38, it can be seen that the northern ribose was altered to fit the active site as it forms two H-bonds with the catalytic residue Glu-226. Concomitantly, the phosphate groups also change their conformations to adopt more comfortable interactions with the enzyme's substrate recognition motif defined by residues Trp-125, Ser-126, Arg-127, Thr-221, and Phe-222. Implications for Inhibitor Design of cADPR Analogs—Studies using CD38 knock-out mice have firmly established the important role of CD38 in a wide range of physiological functions. Most recently, CD38 and its metabolite, cADPR, have been shown to be critical for social behavior in mice by regulating oxytocin secretion (40Jin D. Liu H.X. Hirai H. Torashima T. Nagai T. Lopatina O. Shnayder N.A. Yamada K. Noda M. Seike T. Fujita K. Takasawa S. Yokoyama S. Koizumi K. Shiraishi Y. Tanaka S. Hashii M. Yoshihara T. Higashida K. Islam M.S. Yamada N. Hayashi K. Noguchi N. Kato I. Okamoto H. Matsushima A. Salmina A. Munesue T. Shimizu N. Mochida S. Asano M. Higashida H. Nature. 2007; 446: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It is clearly desirable to develop effective antagonists and agonists of CD38 for physiological studies as well as for possible clinical intervention. The detailed structures of the complexes present in this study should provide valuable clues for their design. One possible approach would be to model such compounds based upon N1-cIDPR. Here we showed that binding of the non-hydrolyzable substrate to the active site indeed results in inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CD38. Modifications on N1-cIDPR to increase its affinity for the active site should produce much more effective inhibitors. An obvious possibility is to introduce an amino group at the 8-position of the purine ring, which could potentially form a hydrogen bond with Asp-155, increasing its affinity for the active site relative to N1-cIDPR (41Moreau C. Wagner G.K. Weber K. Guse A.H. Potter B.V.L. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 5162-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The availability of the high resolution structure of the active site provided in this study together with structural approaches to the design of novel potential non-hydrolyzable ligands should also allow the use of computer docking programs to design molecules that fit better into the active pocket. It is anticipated that effective regulator molecules for CD38 will be forthcoming.

https://openalex.org/W2083739200,"We reasoned that by identifying genetic markers on human X chromosome regions where recombination is rare or absent, we should be able to construct X chromosome genealogies analogous to those based on Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms, with the advantage of providing information about both male and female components of the population.We identified a 47 Kb interval containing an Alu insertion polymorphism (DXS225) and four microsatellites in complete linkage disequilibrium in a low recombination rate region of the long arm of the human X chromosome. This haplotype block was studied in 667 males from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. The haplotypic diversity was highest in Africa (0.992+/-0.0025) and lowest in the Americas (0.839+/-0.0378), where no insertion alleles of DXS225 were observed. Africa shared few haplotypes with other geographical areas, while those exhibited significant sharing among themselves. Median joining networks revealed that the African haplotypes were numerous, occupied the periphery of the graph and had low frequency, whereas those from the other continents were few, central and had high frequency. Altogether, our data support a single origin of modern man in Africa and migration to occupy the other continents by serial founder effects. Coalescent analysis permitted estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor as 182,000 years (56,700-479,000) and the estimated time of the DXS225 Alu insertion of 94,400 years (24,300-310,000). These dates are fully compatible with the current widely accepted scenario of the origin of modern mankind in Africa within the last 195,000 years and migration out-of-Africa circa 55,000-65,000 years ago.A haplotypic block combining an Alu insertion polymorphism and four microsatellite markers on the human X chromosome is a useful marker to evaluate genetic diversity of human populations and provides a highly informative tool for evolutionary studies."
https://openalex.org/W1984901242,"Cdc25B and Cdc25C are closely related dual specificity phosphatases that activate cyclin-dependent kinases by removal of inhibitory phosphorylations, thereby triggering entry into mitosis. Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C, has been implicated as an oncogene and been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C, inhibits cell proliferation in long term assays. Chimeric proteins generated from the two phosphatases show that the anti-proliferative activity is associated with the C-terminal end of Cdc25B. Indeed, the catalytic domain of Cdc25B is sufficient to suppress cell viability in a manner partially dependent upon its C-terminal 26 amino acids that is shown to influence substrate binding. Mutation analysis demonstrates that both the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B as well as its ability to interact with its substrates contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation. These results demonstrate key differences in the biological activities of Cdc25B and Cdc25C caused by differential substrate affinity and recognition. This also argues that the antiproliferative activity of Cdc25B needs to be overcome for it to act as an oncogene during tumorigenesis.

In mammalian cells, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) 3The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinasekdkilodalton activity regulates entry into mitosis, whereas Cdk2 action primarily determines initiation of the cell cycle and proper progression through the S phase (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Cdk1 and Cdk2 activities are regulated at several levels. These include binding to different cyclins, activation by phosphorylation of a regulatory threonine (threonine 161 in Cdk1 or threonine 160 in Cdk2), reversible phosphorylation at two inhibitory residues (threonine 14 and tyrosine 15), subcellular localization, and binding to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). The last step in activation of Cdk1 and Cdk2 is removal of the inhibitory phosphates from threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. In mammalian cells, this dephosphorylation event is accomplished by three related dual specificity phosphatases: Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C (2Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y.

Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cdc25B and Cdc25C induce mitosis by activating Cdk1/cyclin B (7Donzelli M. Draetta G.F.

Activated Cdk1/cyclin B then phosphorylates and activates Cdc25C, which in turn keeps Cdk1/cyclin B active, creating a positive feedback loop that drives the cell through mitosis (11Hoffmann I.

Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc25B has been suggested to be cell cycle-dependent and a determinant for its substrate specificity (9Karlsson C. Katich S. Hagting A. Hoffmann I. Pines J. J.

Cdc25B immunoprecipitated from cells in S phase is active toward pT14pY15Cdk2/cyclin A, whereas it targets pT14pY15Cdk1/cyclin B when immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells in the G2/M phases. Abrupt hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C at the G2/M transition is believed to activate phosphatase activity toward its substrate pT14pY15Cdk1/cyclin B (11Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on specific residues also transforms these phosphatases into targets for certain members of the 14-3-3 protein family.

Their N termini, consisting of approximately 300 residues, are believed to have regulatory functions and show a low degree of sequence homology (20% identity) (7Donzelli M. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These regions contain nuclear import and export signals and binding sites for 14-3-3 family members. The majority of the regulatory phosphorylations occur within the N termini of Cdc25B and Cdc25C (11Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G.

Their C termini (∼200 amino acids in length) contain the catalytic domain (starting with a conserved LIDG motif and including a HCX5R motif) and are quite similar (61% identity). Several studies have investigated the roles of the N-terminal regulatory domains and C-terminal catalytic regions in the activities of Cdc25B and Cdc25C in vitro. Here chimeric Cdc25B and Cdc25C proteins are used in a cellular context to determine the roles of different regions of Cdc25B and Cdc25C in regulation of cellular proliferation as well as substrate recognition. Moreover, it is demonstrated that overexpression of Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C, inhibits cell proliferation. It is shown that the catalytic activity of Cdc25B as well as its interaction with Cdks is important for its ability to suppress cell growth. Cell Culture—Human HCT116 (colon carcinoma) and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 10% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Construction of Plasmids and Chimeras—Cdc25B and Cdc25A cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription. Total RNA was extracted from human WI-38 fibroblasts using the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) also following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent PCR amplifications were performed on a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 μl of the cDNA reaction, 200 μm dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 1% TritonX-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 400 μm of either Cdc25B or Cdc25A-specific primers, and 1 unit of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The following primers were used for PCR amplification. For Cdc25B, the primers were 5′-ATG GAG GTG CCC CAG C (forward) and 5′-GCG CGA TAT CTT ATC ACT GGT CCT GCA GCC G (reverse). For Cdc25A, the primers were 5′-ATG GAA CTG GGC CCG GA (forward) and 5′-GCG CGA TAT CTT TCA GAG CTT CTT CAG ACG (reverse). For Cdc25C, the primers were 5′-ATG TCT ACG GAA CTC TTC (forward) and 5′-GCG CGA TAT CTC ATG GGC TCA TGT C (reverse). Cdc25C was amplified from a plasmid. PCR conditions were as follow: a hot start at 94 °C for 2 min was followed by (for Cdc25B and Cdc25A) 30 cycles of the cycling step (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min) or for Cdc25C, 18 cycles of the cycling step (94 °C for 25 s, 61 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 30 s) and an additional extension time of 10 min at 68 °C. To generate the 25B/C and 25C/B chimeras, sequences corresponding to the N and C termini of Cdc25B and Cdc25C were PCR-amplified. The following primer sets were used. The N-terminal part of Cdc25B was amplified with 5′-ATGGAGGTGCCCCAGC (forward) and 5′-TCGGTGGTCACTGTCC (reverse). The C terminus of Cdc25B was amplified with 5′-GAGCTGATTGGAGATTAC (forward) and 5′-GCGCGATATCTTATCACTGGTCCTGCAGCCG (reverse). The N terminus of Cdc25C was amplified with 5′-ATGTCTACGGAACTCTTC (forward) and reverse 5′-CCCCTGGTTAGAATC (reverse). The C terminus of Cdc25C was amplified with 5′-CACCTGATTGGTGATTTTTC (forward) and 5′-GCGCGATATCTTATCATGGGCTCATGTC (reverse). Underlining indicates the restriction sites for EcoRV. These fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRV, purified, and blunt end-ligated (Roche Applied Science). ΔN25B and ΔN25C were generated with the primers used to amplify the C termini of Cdc25B and Cdc25C. ΔN25B/C and ΔN25C/B were produced by fusion PCR. For the first round of PCR, the following primers were used. For the Cdc25B parts, the forward primer used to amplify the C terminus of Cdc25B together with 5′-CTGGCTTCGACACCTCAGTAGCTCATCCTTGAAGGC and the reverse primer used to amplify the C terminus of Cdc25B together with 5′-GCCTTCAAGGATGAGCTACTGAGGTGTCGAAGCCAG were used. For the Cdc25C parts the forward primer used to amplify the C terminus of Cdc25C together with 5′-CTTGAGGCGGAAGGTCTTCAACTCAGTCTTGTGGTC and the reverse primer used to amplify the C terminus of Cdc25C together with 5′-GACCACAAGACTGAGTTGAAGACCTTCCGCCTCAAG were used. Next, the appropriate PCR products were mixed and used as templates for the second round of PCR. The primers used in the second round of PCR were as follows. For ΔN25B/C, they were the forward primer for the C terminus end of Cdc25B and the reverse primer for the C-terminal end of Cdc25C. For ΔN25C/B, they were the forward primer for the C-terminal end of Cdc25C and the reverse primer for the C terminus of Cdc25B. The sequence encoding the FLAG epitope contained a restriction site for BamHI (underlined) (GCGC GGA TCC ACC ATG GAT TAC AAG GAT GAC GAC GAT AAG) and was contained within the 5′ end of each forward primer. A restriction site for EcoRV (underlined) was included at the beginning of some of the reverse primers. The PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and EcoRV, purified, and subcloned into the pcDNA3 plasmid. The identity of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The catalytically inactive mutants of full-length Cdc25B (C488S) and Cdc25C (C377S) and their derivatives were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following protocols provided by the manufacturer. Plasmids carrying the FLAG-tagged full-length Cdc25B, Cdc25C, or their derivatives were used as templates in the PCRs. The following primer sets were used. For mutant Cdc25B, it was 5′-ATT TTC CAC TCT GAA TTC TCA TCT GAG CGT GGG CCC (forward) and GGG CCC ACG CTC AGA TGA GAA TTC AGA GTG GAA AAT (reverse). For mutant Cdc25C, it was 5′-GTG TTC CAC TCT GAA TTC TCC TCA GAG AGG GGC CCC (forward) and 5′-GGG GCC CCT CTC TGA GGA GAA TTC AGA GTG GAA CAC (reverse). For Cdc25B416, it was 5′-GAC CTC AAG TAC ATC GCA CCA GAA ACG ATG GTG (forward) and 5′-CAC CAT CGT TTC TGG TGC GAT GTA CTT GAG GTC (reverse). For Cdc25B470, it was 5′-AGC TTC CTA CTG AAG GCC CCC ATC GCG CCC TGT (forward) and 5′-ACA GGG CGC GAT GGG GGC CTT CAG TAG GAA GCT (reverse). The mutated bases are underlined. Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and immunoblotted. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-FLAG was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-Cdc25B (H-85), mouse anti-Cdc25A (F-6), mouse anti-Cdc25C (H-6), rabbit anti-Cdk2 (M2), mouse anti-Cdk1 (C-19), rabbit anti-pT14pY15Cdk1 (cross-reacts with Cdk2), rabbit anti-cyclin B (H-433), and rabbit anti-cyclin A (H-432) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-Tyr(P)15 Cdk1 (cross-reacts with Cdk2) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody to mouse anti-β-actin was from Oncogene Research Products. Peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit or mouse IGG (MP Biomedicals) were used as secondary antibodies. The signals were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography films (Labscientific, Inc.). Colony Formation Assays—Each of the plasmids expressing Cdc25B, Cdc25C, Cdc25A, mutant Cdc25B, mutant Cdc25C, their derivatives, or empty vector was co-transfected with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance into exponentially growing HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine™ reagent and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were subjected to puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection for 12–14 days. The colonies were fixed and stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitations—HCT116 cells were transfected as described. The cells were lysed in the buffer described for immunoblotting. Mouse anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was used in immunoprecipitation assays, which were performed following manufacturer's protocols. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted as described. Recombinant Adenoviruses—The FLAG-tagged open reading frames of Cdc25B, mutant Cdc25B, and Cdc25C were cut out of plasmids and subcloned into the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vectors. These constructs were linearized by digestion with PmeI and were co-transformed together with the adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1 into the homologous recombination-competent Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. The resultant recombinants were linearized with PacI and transfected into the adenovirus packaging cell line, 293T. High titer of recombinant adenoviruses was obtained by several rounds of infection. The cells were infected with multiplicity of infection of 8–12 for Ad-25B, 5–10 for Ad-25C, and 35–40 for Ad-mt25B. Cdc25B but Not Cdc25C Inhibits Colony Formation—The long term consequences of overexpression of Cdc25B and Cdc25C on cell proliferation were investigated. The open reading frames of Cdc25B and Cdc25A were amplified from RNA extracted from WI-38 human fibroblasts using reverse transcription-PCR. The open reading frames of all three phosphatases were FLAG-tagged at their N termini and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each of these constructs or empty vector was co-transfected together with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance into HCT116 cells. Immunoblotting using transiently transfected cell lysates and anti-FLAG antibody or specific antibody to each protein showed that these proteins were expressed at similar levels and exhibited the expected mobility (65 kd for Cdc25B, 55 kd for Cdc25C, and 60 kd for Cdc25A) (Fig. 1A). These constructs were then used in colony formation assays. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, HCT116 cells were subjected to puromycin selection for 12–14 days before fixing and staining the colonies with Giemsa (Fig. 1B). The tumor suppressor protein p53 was included in this experiment as a control. Consistent with previous published observations, p53 expression inhibited colony formation (33Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Cdc25A was included in this experiment as a control for overexpression of an oncoprotein and appeared to impose a negative effect on cell proliferation (41%) but was not as effective as Cdc25B. Cdc25B significantly reduced the number of colonies (16%) compared with empty vector (set at 100%) (Fig. 1, B and C). By contrast, Cdc25C did not have any significant effect on the number, size, or shape of the colonies (90 and 110%, respectively) (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that ectopic expression of Cdc25B but not Cdc25C reduces long term viability of the cells. The Phosphatase Activity of Cdc25B Contributes to the Ability to Inhibit Cell Proliferation—It is well established that mutating the catalytic cysteine abolishes the phosphatase activities of the Cdc25s (6Gabrielli B.G.

Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To verify the role of the phosphatase activities of Cdc25B and Cdc25C in these assays, their catalytically inactive mutants Cdc25B (C488S) and Cdc25C (C377S) (referred to as mt25B and mt25C) were generated and were FLAG-tagged at their N termini. When compared with wild type Cdc25B (16%), the ability to suppress colony formation was impaired with the mutant Cdc25B (45%) (Fig. 1, B and C). This result argues that the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B accounts for a significant part of its antiproliferative ability. Nevertheless the mutant Cdc25B retained some ability to suppress colony formation. This is most likely due to its ability to sequester its substrates and deprive the cell of their functions (6Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Xu X. Burke S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). By contrast, neither the inactive form of Cdc25C nor the wild type protein had any significant effect on the number, size, or shape of the colonies (90 and 110%, respectively) (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, both the active and phosphatase-dead forms of Cdc25B and Cdc25C differ in their biological effects. Importantly, the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B dramatically enhances its ability to suppress cell growth. The Catalytic Domain of Cdc25B Is Sufficient to Suppress Cell Viability—The N-terminal ends of Cdc25B and Cdc25C have been implicated in their regulation (14Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. McCormack A.K. Ellem K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28607-28614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the N terminus of Cdc25B in its antiproliferative activity, chimeras in which the N termini of Cdc25B and Cdc25C were exchanged were generated (25B/C and 25C/B) (Fig. 2). 25B/C consists of residues 1–390 of Cdc25B fused to residues 281–473 of Cdc25C (Fig. 2). The N terminus of 25C/B encompasses residues 1–280 of Cdc25C, and it was fused to residues 391–580 of Cdc25B (Fig. 2). The chimeras were generated by blunt end cloning to avoid possible influence of irrelevant sequences. As controls, constructs expressing only the catalytic domains of Cdc25B (ΔN25B) and Cdc25C (ΔN25C) and their corresponding catalytically inactive mutants were generated (Fig. 2). ΔN25B contains residues 391–580 of Cdc25B and ΔN25C residues 281–473 of Cdc25C. All of the constructs were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus. Each of these constructs or empty vectors was co-transfected with a puromycin-resistant plasmid into HCT116 cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cell samples were split in half. One half were lysed and immunoblotted with FLAG antibody to verify similar expression levels and size of the proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). To further validate these constructs, the immunoblots were then stripped and subsequently probed with specific antibodies against the N or C terminus of Cdc25B or Cdc25C (Fig. 3, A and B). The second half of each cell sample was subjected to colony formation assays. The number of colonies formed by the 25B/C construct was 60% of that of empty vector (set at 100%) (Fig. 4, A and B). This was 4-fold greater than that of full-length Cdc25B (16%), suggesting that the N-terminal region of Cdc25B plays a role in its antiproliferative activity. However, the result with 25B/C was still 1.5-fold less than full-length Cdc25C (90%), arguing that the N-terminal part of Cdc25C may negatively regulate the activity. The 25C/B chimera and ΔN25B on the other hand appeared to be more efficient than the full-length Cdc25B in inhibiting cell proliferation because the number of colonies formed following their overexpression were 5 and 0.5% compared with the empty vector (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that the C terminus of Cdc25B is responsible for its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, and the N terminus of Cdc25B when fused to its C terminus negatively regulates this activity. The mtΔN25B reduced the number of colonies (50%), but not as efficiently as the wild type (0.5%), further confirming that the catalytic activity of Cdc25B plays a major role in its ability to suppress cell viability. The ΔN25C and its mutant behaved like the full-length Cdc25C and did not affect colony formation significantly (Fig. 4, A and B). These results also suggest that the N terminus of Cdc25B may also be involved in the suppression of colony formation that resulted from overexpression of 25B/C.FIGURE 3Various Cdc25B and Cdc25C proteins are expressed at comparable levels. pcDNA3 vectors expressing the indicated FLAG-tagged proteins or empty vector were transfected into HCT116 cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed, and expression levels of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody or specific antibodies against the N or C terminus of Cdc25B or Cdc25C. β-Ac"
