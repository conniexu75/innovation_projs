https://openalex.org/W2075820034,"Hypervariable genetic markers, including a novel locus-specific marker detected by a mouse major histocompatibility complex probe, reveal that multiple paternity is common in families of polygynous red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus). Almost half of all nests contained at least one chick resulting from an extra-pair fertilization, usually by a neighboring male. Genetically based measures of reproductive success show that individual males realize more than 20% of their overall success from extra-pair fertilizations, on average, and that this form of mating behavior confounds traditional measures of male success. The importance of alternative reproductive tactics in a polygynous bird is quantified, and the results challenge previous explanations for the evolution of avian polygny."
https://openalex.org/W2052075352,"The oxygen isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperature (αo) varies as a function of x in La2-xSrxCuO4 and La2-xBaxCuO4, with the maximum αo values (αo ≥ 0.5) found for x near 0.12. This unusual x dependence implies that the isotope effect is influenced by proximity to the Abma → P42/ncm structural phase transition in these systems. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements reveal little change in lattice parameters or orthorhombicity due to isotope exchange in strontium-doped materials where αo > 0.5, eliminating static structural distortion as a cause of the large isotope effects. The anomalous behavior of αo in both strontium- and barium-doped materials, in combination with the previously discovered Abma → P42/ncm structural phase-transition in La1.88Ba0.12CuO4, suggests that an electronic contribution to the lattice instability is present and maximizes at ∼1/8 hole per copper atom. These observations indicate a close connection between hole doping of the Cu-O sheets, tilting instabilities of the CuO6 octahedra, and superconductivity in La2CuO4-based superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1993989481,The western equatorial Pacific warm pool (sea-surface temperatures >29°C) was observed to migrate eastward across the date line during the 1986-1987 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event. Direct velocity measurements made in the upper ocean from 1986 to 1988 indicate that this migration was associated with a prolonged reversal in the South Equatorial Current forced by a large-scale relaxation of the trade winds. The data suggest that wind-forced zonal advection plays an important role in the thermodynamics of the western Pacific warm pool on interannual time scales.
https://openalex.org/W2091569024,"A stratigraphic record of climatic cooling equal in timing and severity to the Younger Dryas event of the North Atlantic region has been obtained from lacustrine sediments in the Glacier Bay area of southeastern Alaska. Fossil pollen show that a late Wisconsin pine parkland was replaced about 10,800 years ago by shrub- and herb-dominated tundra, which lasted until about 9,800 years ago. This vegetational change is matched by geochemical evidence for loss of organic matter from catchment soils and increased mineral erosion. If this event represents the Younger Dryas, then an explanation for a hemisphere-wide propagation of a North Atlantic climatic perturbation must be sought."

Radiocarbon dating and stylistic comparisons indicate that the northern tropical lowlands were inhabited at the onset of the Holocene, suggesting a time depth of 9000 years before the present for tropical forest-savanna adaptations in northern South America."

https://openalex.org/W2038890713,"Three new polymorphs of zinc sulfide are described. All are related structurally to wurtzite but difier in that they represent stacking sequences of hexagonal closest-packing of higher periodicity than that of the basic wurtzite structure. The latter structure may be designated 2H in the nomenclature of Ramsdell (1947). The new polymorphs correspond to 4H, 6H and 15R, and are isotypic with the corresponding polymorphs of silicon carbide. A tabulation of the crystallographic properties follows."
https://openalex.org/W2058943641,"One of the major technology challenges in the next decade will be to develop means of using coal imaginatively as a source of chemicals and in a more energy-efficient manner. The Clean Air Act will help to diminish the acid rain but will not reduce CO{sub 2} emissions. The Department of Energy (DOE) is fostering many innovations that are likely to have a positive effect on coal usage. Of the different innovations in the use of coal fostered by DOE, two are of particular interest. One is the new pressurized fluid bed combustion (PFBC) combined-cycle demonstration. The PFBC plant now becoming operational can reduce SO{sub 2} emissions by more than 90% and NO{sub x} emissions by 50-70%. A second new technology co-sponsored by DOE is the Encoal mild coal gasification project that will convert a sub-bituminous low-BTU coal into a useful higher BTU solid while producing significant amounts of a liquid fuel."

The prospects are reviewed, with particular attention given to large optical aperturesynthesis instruments analogous to the Very Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Typical parameters for a particular system are presented."

https://openalex.org/W2010007935,"While Slanger et al. (1988) have reported that the 248-nm KrF laser radiation generates ozone from oxygen, despite this wavelength's exceeding of the conventionally accepted photodissociation threshold of 242.4 for the ground electronic state, the initiating mechanism for this ozone formation remains obscure. It is presently suggested that the initiating step is the absorption of the 248-nm radiation by O2. In a reply to the present authors, Slanger et al. indicate that their original experiment should have been performed by introducing pure O2 into a baked cell, with the start time defined by the unblocking of the 248-nm laser."

In Geography it is a knowledge and understanding of the natural and human environments, to the end that they may best be utilized toward better living in the broadest sense."
