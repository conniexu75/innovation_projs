https://openalex.org/W2018286352,"The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain disorders in model organisms, highlighting the need for an in vitro model of human brain development. Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype. Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development and disease even in this most complex human tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2044021940,"Qiong Wang and colleagues introduce the AdipoChaser mouse, an in vivo tool to track the formation and turnover of adipocytes. They use this inducible mature adipocyte lineage-tracing system to monitor adipogenesis and follow the formation of white and beige adipocytes under different conditions: high-fat diet, cold exposure and β-adrenergic stimulation. The system produced some interesting findings on in vivo adipogenesis, including that beige adipocytes differentiate de novo from specialized precursors rather than by transdifferentiation of mature white adipocytes. White adipose tissue displays high plasticity. We developed a system for the inducible, permanent labeling of mature adipocytes that we called the AdipoChaser mouse. We monitored adipogenesis during development, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and cold exposure. During cold-induced 'browning' of subcutaneous fat, most 'beige' adipocytes stem from de novo–differentiated adipocytes. During HFD feeding, epididymal fat initiates adipogenesis after 4 weeks, whereas subcutaneous fat undergoes hypertrophy for a period of up to 12 weeks. Gonadal fat develops postnatally, whereas subcutaneous fat develops between embryonic days 14 and 18. Our results highlight the extensive differences in adipogenic potential in various fat depots."
https://openalex.org/W2026894676,"The human intestine, colonized by a dense community of resident microbes, is a frequent target of bacterial pathogens. Undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota provides protection from bacterial infections. Conversely, disruption of the microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric pathogens. How pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded protection is largely unknown. Here we show that two antibiotic-associated pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and Clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. S. typhimurium accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. Similarly, C. difficile expansion is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting in C. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting impaired expansion. These effects are reversed by exogenous dietary administration of free sialic acid. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment of conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both Salmonella and C. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion. These data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a similar manner. This insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2045960652,"Mammalian development requires cytosine methylation, a heritable epigenetic mark of cellular memory believed to maintain a cell's unique gene expression pattern. However, it remains unclear how dynamic DNA methylation relates to cell type-specific gene expression and animal development. Here, by mapping base-resolution methylomes in 17 adult mouse tissues at shallow coverage, we identify 302,864 tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tsDMRs) and estimate that >6.7% of the mouse genome is variably methylated. Supporting a prominent role for DNA methylation in gene regulation, most tsDMRs occur at distal cis-regulatory elements. Unexpectedly, some tsDMRs mark enhancers that are dormant in adult tissues but active in embryonic development. These 'vestigial' enhancers are hypomethylated and lack active histone modifications in adult tissues but nevertheless exhibit activity during embryonic development. Our results provide new insights into the role of DNA methylation at tissue-specific enhancers and suggest that epigenetic memory of embryonic development may be retained in adult tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2060719766,"β-barrel membrane proteins are essential for nutrient import, signalling, motility and survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is responsible for the biogenesis of β-barrel membrane proteins, with homologous complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we describe the structure of BamA, the central and essential component of the BAM complex, from two species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. BamA consists of a large periplasmic domain attached to a 16-strand transmembrane β-barrel domain. Three structural features shed light on the mechanism by which BamA catalyses β-barrel assembly. First, the interior cavity is accessible in one BamA structure and conformationally closed in the other. Second, an exterior rim of the β-barrel has a distinctly narrowed hydrophobic surface, locally destabilizing the outer membrane. And third, the β-barrel can undergo lateral opening, suggesting a route from the interior cavity in BamA into the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2056013470,"Topoisomerases are expressed throughout the developing and adult brain and are mutated in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how topoisomerases are mechanistically connected to ASD is unknown. Here we find that topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor, dose-dependently reduces the expression of extremely long genes in mouse and human neurons, including nearly all genes that are longer than 200 kilobases. Expression of long genes is also reduced after knockdown of Top1 or Top2b in neurons, highlighting that both enzymes are required for full expression of long genes. By mapping RNA polymerase II density genome-wide in neurons, we found that this length-dependent effect on gene expression was due to impaired transcription elongation. Interestingly, many high-confidence ASD candidate genes are exceptionally long and were reduced in expression after TOP1 inhibition. Our findings suggest that chemicals and genetic mutations that impair topoisomerases could commonly contribute to ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Reducing topoisomerase activity in mouse and human neurons is found to reduce the expression of long genes by impairing transcription elongation: among genes affected are numerous high-confidence candidates for autism spectrum disorder. Topoisomerases, enzymes involved in DNA winding, are expressed throughout the brain, and mutations have been discovered in some individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mark Zylka and colleagues show that reducing topoisomerase activity selectively reduces the expression of long genes in mouse and human neurons by impairing transcription elongation. The authors note that many ASD candidate genes, including Cntnap2, Nrxn1 and Cntn4, are exceptionally long and confirm that expression of several ASD candidate genes is reduced by topoisomerase inhibition. These findings suggest that chemicals and genetic mutations that impair topoisomerases — and possibly other components of the transcription machinery — could contribute to ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2025532285,"A transmembrane O-glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) expressed on fibroblastic reticular cells is the activating ligand for platelet receptor CLEC-2; this interaction leads to perivenular release of sphingosine-1-phosphate and expression of VE-cadherin on high endothelial venules, a key process for the maintenance of vascular integrity in lymph nodes. The lymph nodes, essential sites for immune responses, are supplied with circulating lymphocytes that enter via specialized post-capillary blood vessels known as high endothelial venules (HEVs). How the integrity of this vascular barrier is maintained in the face of the increase in lymphocyte homing during immune responses is not known. Lijun Xia and colleagues now show that the mechanism involves cross-talk between HEVs, platelets and the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) that surround the HEVs. The transmembrane protein podoplanin, expressed on FRCs, interacts with the platelet activation receptor CLEC-2, prompting the release of sphingosine-1-phosphate that in turn preserves the adhesion molecule VE-cadherin on the HEVs. This finding may suggest new approaches to the regulation of lymph node homeostasis in conditions of increased HEV proliferation, such as chronic inflammation. Circulating lymphocytes continuously enter lymph nodes for immune surveillance through specialized blood vessels named high endothelial venules1,2,3,4,5, a process that increases markedly during immune responses. How high endothelial venules (HEVs) permit lymphocyte transmigration while maintaining vascular integrity is unknown. Here we report a role for the transmembrane O-glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN, also known as gp38 and T1α)6,7,8 in maintaining HEV barrier function. Mice with postnatal deletion of Pdpn lost HEV integrity and exhibited spontaneous bleeding in mucosal lymph nodes, and bleeding in the draining peripheral lymph nodes after immunization. Blocking lymphocyte homing rescued bleeding, indicating that PDPN is required to protect the barrier function of HEVs during lymphocyte trafficking. Further analyses demonstrated that PDPN expressed on fibroblastic reticular cells7, which surround HEVs, functions as an activating ligand for platelet C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2, also known as CLEC1B)9,10. Mice lacking fibroblastic reticular cell PDPN or platelet CLEC-2 exhibited significantly reduced levels of VE-cadherin (also known as CDH5), which is essential for overall vascular integrity11,12, on HEVs. Infusion of wild-type platelets restored HEV integrity in Clec-2-deficient mice. Activation of CLEC-2 induced release of sphingosine-1-phosphate13,14 from platelets, which promoted expression of VE-cadherin on HEVs ex vivo. Furthermore, draining peripheral lymph nodes of immunized mice lacking sphingosine-1-phosphate had impaired HEV integrity similar to Pdpn- and Clec-2-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that local sphingosine-1-phosphate release after PDPN–CLEC-2-mediated platelet activation is critical for HEV integrity during immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2074536102,"The size of a typical eukaryotic cell is of the order of ∼10 μm. However, some cell types grow to very large sizes, including oocytes (immature eggs) of organisms from humans to starfish. For example, oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis grow to a diameter ≥1 mm. They have a correspondingly large nucleus (germinal vesicle) of ∼450 μm in diameter, which is similar to smaller somatic nuclei, but contains a significantly higher concentration of actin. The form and structure of this nuclear actin remain controversial, and its potential mechanical role within these large nuclei is unknown. Here, we use a microrheology and quantitative imaging approach to show that germinal vesicles contain an elastic F-actin scaffold that mechanically stabilizes these large nuclei against gravitational forces, which are usually considered negligible within cells. We find that on actin disruption, ribonucleoprotein droplets, including nucleoli and histone locus bodies, undergo gravitational sedimentation and fusion. We develop a model that reveals how gravity becomes an increasingly potent force as cells and their nuclei grow larger than ∼10 μm, explaining the requirement for a stabilizing nuclear F-actin scaffold in large Xenopus oocytes. All life forms are subject to gravity, and our results may have broad implications for cell growth and size control."
https://openalex.org/W2032131517,"Resistance to pharmacologic agents used in chemotherapy is common in most human carcinomas, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which is resistant to almost all drugs, including gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used as a first-line treatment. Poor survival rates of PDA patients have, therefore, not changed much over 4 decades. Recent data indicated that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are abundant in the microenvironment of several tumors, including PDA, secrete pro-tumorigenic factors that contribute to cancer progression and dissemination. In this study, we show for the first time that TAMs can also induce chemoresistance of PDA by reducing gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Macrophages co-cultured with cancer cells or TAM-conditioned medium significantly reduced apoptosis and activation of the caspase-3 pathway during gemcitabine treatment. In vivo PDA models of mice, which have reduced macrophage recruitment and activation, demonstrated improved response to gemcitabine compared with controls. Similarly, inhibition of monocytes/macrophages trafficking by a CSF1-receptor antagonist GW2580 augmented the effect of gemcitabine in a transgenic mouse PDA model that was resistant to gemcitabine alone. Analysis of multiple proteins involved in gemcitabine delivery and metabolism revealed that TAMs induced upregulation of cytidine deaminase (CDA), the enzyme that metabolizes the drug following its transport into the cell. Decreasing CDA expression by PDA cells blocked the protective effect of TAMs against gemcitabine. These results provide the first evidence of a paracrine effect of TAMs, which mediates acquired resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Modulation of macrophage trafficking or inhibition of CDA may offer a new strategy for augmenting the response of PDA to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1985629708,"Statins are prescribed widely to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk and have been shown to have beneficial effects in a broad range of patients. However, statins are associated with an increased risk, albeit small, of clinical myopathy and type 2 diabetes. Despite evidence for substantial genetic influence on LDL concentrations, pharmacogenomic trials have failed to identify genetic variations with large effects on either statin efficacy or toxicity, and have produced little information regarding mechanisms that modulate statin response. Here we identify a downstream target of statin treatment by screening for the effects of in vitro statin exposure on genetic associations with gene expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 480 participants of a clinical trial of simvastatin treatment. This analysis identified six expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that interacted with simvastatin exposure, including rs9806699, a cis-eQTL for the gene glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in creatine synthesis. We found this locus to be associated with incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity in two separate populations (meta-analysis odds ratio = 0.60). Furthermore, we found that GATM knockdown in hepatocyte-derived cell lines attenuated transcriptional response to sterol depletion, demonstrating that GATM may act as a functional link between statin-mediated lowering of cholesterol and susceptibility to statin-induced myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2152130162,"The X-ray crystal structure of NapA, a Na+/H+ antiporter from Thermus thermophilus, in an active, outward-facing state is reported; comparisons to the structure of a related transporter in a low pH/inactivated, inward-facing state show the conformational changes that occur when the membrane protein moves from an inward-facing to an outward-facing state, suggesting that Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model. This manuscript reports an X-ray crystal structure of NapA, a sodium/proton antiporter from Thermus thermophilus, in an active, outward-facing state. Antiporters of this type are active in the plasma membrane of all living cells, where they help to regulate intracellular pH, sodium concentration and cell volume. Comparison of this new structure to a previously published structure of a related transporter in a low pH/inactivated, inward-facing state reveals the conformational changes that occur when the membrane protein moves from an inward-facing to an outward-facing state. Sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every cell, are vital for cell homeostasis1. In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets2. The best understood model system for Na+/H+ antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli1,3, for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available4,5,6. NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein1,4. Like many Na+/H+ antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur7. The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form4. Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3 Å resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH 7.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding1,8,9 directly, a role supported here by molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20° against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500 ions per second3, Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general."
https://openalex.org/W1989425393,"To study the evolution of drug resistance, we genetically and biochemically characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains selected in vitro for ethambutol resistance. Mutations in decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-arabinose (DPA) biosynthetic and utilization pathway genes Rv3806c, Rv3792, embB and embC accumulated to produce a wide range of ethambutol minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that depended on mutation type and number. Rv3806c mutations increased DPA synthesis, causing MICs to double from 2 to 4 μg/ml in a wild-type background and to increase from 16 to 32 μg/ml in an embB codon 306 mutant background. Synonymous mutations in Rv3792 increased the expression of downstream embC, an ethambutol target, resulting in MICs of 8 μg/ml. Multistep selection was required for high-level resistance. Mutations in embC or very high embC expression were observed at the highest resistance level. In clinical isolates, Rv3806c mutations were associated with high-level resistance and had multiplicative effects with embB mutations on MICs. Ethambutol resistance is acquired through the acquisition of mutations that interact in complex ways to produce a range of MICs, from those falling below breakpoint values to ones representing high-level resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2010942421,"Although the Hsp90 chaperone family, comprised in humans of four paralogs, Hsp90α, Hsp90β, Grp94 and Trap-1, has important roles in malignancy, the contribution of each paralog to the cancer phenotype is poorly understood. This is in large part because reagents to study paralog-specific functions in cancer cells have been unavailable. Here we combine compound library screening with structural and computational analyses to identify purine-based chemical tools that are specific for Hsp90 paralogs. We show that Grp94 selectivity is due to the insertion of these compounds into a new allosteric pocket. We use these tools to demonstrate that cancer cells use individual Hsp90 paralogs to regulate a client protein in a tumor-specific manner and in response to proteome alterations. Finally, we provide new mechanistic evidence explaining why selective Grp94 inhibition is particularly efficacious in certain breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1979153753,"In several cell types, the protein deacetylase SIRT1 regulates the activities of FoxO transcription factors whose activation is critical in muscle atrophy. However, the possible effects of SIRT1 on the activity of FoxOs in skeletal muscle and on the regulation of muscle size have not been investigated. Here, we show that after food deprivation, SIRT1 levels fall dramatically in type II skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior), which show marked atrophy, unlike in the liver (where SIRT1 rises) or heart or the soleus, a type I muscle (where SIRT1 is unchanged). Maintenance of high SIRT1 levels by electroporation in mouse muscle inhibits markedly the muscle wasting induced by fasting as well as by denervation, and these protective effects require its deacetylase activity. SIRT1 overexpression reduces muscle wasting by blocking the activation of FoxO1 and 3. It thus prevents the induction of key atrogenes, including the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, atrogin1 and MuRF1, and multiple autophagy (Atg) genes and the increase in overall proteolysis. In normal muscle, SIRT1 overexpression by electroporation causes rapid fiber hypertrophy without, surprisingly, activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Thus, SIRT1 activation favors postnatal muscle growth, and its fall appears to be critical for atrophy during fasting. Consequently, SIRT1 activation represents an attractive possible pharmacological approach to prevent muscle wasting and cachexia.Background: SIRT1 regulates the activity of FoxO transcription factors and protects tissues from diverse insults.Results: Upon fasting, SIRT1 levels fall in skeletal muscle, but SIRT1 overexpression deacetylates FoxO3 and thus inhibits induction of atrophy-related genes.Conclusion: SIRT1 overexpression blocks muscle atrophy induced by fasting and denervation and in fed mice promotes hypertrophy.Significance: SIRT1 activity is important in the regulation of muscle size.

Conclusion: SIRT1 overexpression blocks muscle atrophy induced by fasting and denervation and in fed mice promotes hypertrophy. Significance: SIRT1 activity is important in the regulation of muscle size. An important survival mechanism in mammals in times of food scarcity, injury, and systemic disease (including cancer cachexia, sepsis, diabetes, and renal failure) is to increase protein degradation and reduce protein synthesis in skeletal muscle to provide the organism with a supply of amino acids for hepatic gluconeogenesis, direct oxidation, or repair processes (1Tisdale M.J.

It is now well established that these various types of muscle wasting, although induced by diverse physiological stimuli, involve similar adaptive changes in the transcription of a common set of atrophy-related genes (atrogenes). These adaptations lead to a general activation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (3Sandri M.

This antagonism between PGC-1α and FoxOs in skeletal muscle is surprising because in liver, PGC-1α cooperates with FoxO3 in the induction of gluconeogenic genes during fasting (13Puigserver P.

Thus, these key pathways can be regulated in opposite fashions and serve different functions in different tissues, especially muscle. Among the seven members of the sirtuin family in mammals, SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, has been the most studied and shown to protect against a surprisingly wide number of pathological processes (14Haigis M.C.

The possible influence of SIRT1 on muscle size—on the atrophy or hypertrophy process—and on the regulation of FoxO transcription factors have not been studied.

Specifically, we hypothesized that SIRT1 activation in muscle might provide protection against muscle wasting induced by disuse, fasting, and disease by inhibiting FoxOs and activating PGC-1α. We therefore examined whether changes in SIRT1 activity may play a role in the increase in muscle proteolysis and atrophy upon food deprivation (which is signaled by decreases in IGF1 and insulin levels and enhanced glucocorticoids) and also by denervation (which prevents normal contractile activity). We show here that SIRT1 overexpression, by inhibiting FoxO1 and 3, is a major regulator of muscle mass, and not only can prevent the rapid loss of muscle mass upon fasting or denervation, but also can induce rapid hypertrophy of normal muscle. The following antibodies were used: anti-SIRT1 (07-131; Millipore), anti-SIRT3 (5490; Cell Signaling), anti-SIRT6 (S4322; Sigma), anti-FLAG (F1804; Sigma), anti-acetyl-lysine (ICP0380; Immunechem), anti-JunB (sc-73; Santa Cruz), and anti-ATP5B (sc-55597; Santa Cruz).

Acetylated histone H4 (12–353) was purchased from Millipore. Adult male CD1 mice (28–30 g) were used in all experiments.

Denervation was performed at the same time as the electroporation, and muscles were collected at the times indicated. In reporter experiments, 10 μg of firefly luciferase constructs containing multiple binding sites for FoxOs (hereafter referred to as FoxO1 and 3) (Addgene plasmid 1789) and 5 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) together with either FLAG-SIRT1 (5 μg) or FLAG-SIRT1H355A (5 μg) (kindly provided by Dr. Pere Puigserver) were co-electroporated. A construct for IκBα-SR was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 15264). In electroporation experiments, no microscopic evidence for inflammation was observed. All mouse experiments were performed with the approval of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Fibers stained with a FLAG antibody (Sigma) or expressing GFP and an equal number of nontransfected fibers were used for measurement of cross-sectional areas using Metamorph (Molecular Devices).

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed to synthesize cDNA. Quantitative real time PCR was performed with mouse gene specific primers (the sequences of the primers used are available upon request) and DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes) using a C100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). FLAG-SIRT1 or -SIRT1H355A was affinity-purified from electroporated muscles and used for deacetylase assay. Acetylated histone H4 peptide (0.2 μg, Millipore) was incubated with the purified FLAG-SIRT1 with or without 5 mm NAD+ (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Each reaction was blotted on nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by acetyl-lysine antibody (Immunechem) in Western blot. Intensity of dots was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The analysis was performed using Student's t test, and significant differences are demonstrated by asterisks. The data are presented as means ± S.E. To determine whether SIRT1 is involved in muscle atrophy during fasting for different periods, we analyzed the expression of SIRT1 and two atrophy-associated ubiquitin ligases, atrogin1 and MuRF1, in mouse tibialis anterior (TA) 2The abbreviation used is: TAtibialis anterior. muscles. Although no change was seen in SIRT1 content at 12 or 24 h after food was removed (Fig. 1A and Table 1), when SIRT1 is known to stimulate PGC-1α and lipid oxidation (20Gerhart-Hines Z. Rodgers J.T. Bare O. Lerin C. Kim S.H. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Wu Z. Puigserver P.

This delayed fall in SIRT1 protein coincided with the induction of atrogin1 and MuRF1 and the loss of muscle mass (which was not significant until this time).TABLE 1Loss of body and TA muscle weights during fastingBody weightTA weight% LossgmgFed31.5 ± 1.048.2 ± 5.4Fasted for 18 h27.0 ± 1.043.1 ± 3.811aa p < 0.05 versus fed control (n = 5).Fasted for 48 h24.2 ± 1.138.8 ± 1.119.6aa p < 0.05 versus fed control (n = 5).a a p < 0.05 versus fed control (n = 5). Open table in a new tab tibialis anterior. The tibialis anterior is composed of type II (pale) muscle fibers, which tend to show marked wasting after food deprivation (21Li J.B. Goldberg A.L. Effects of food deprivation on protein synthesis and degradation in rat skeletal muscles.Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). By contrast, type I (dark) fibers are relatively resistant to wasting in fasting. Interestingly, the dark soleus muscle showed little or no change in SIRT1 content after a 2-day fast (data not shown). In contrast to these changes in type II muscle, in the livers of these fasted mice, SIRT1 content had increased by 48 h, and in heart, its level did not change (Fig. 1E). To determine whether the large reduction in SIRT1 protein in the TA muscle resulted from decreased gene expression, we assayed the levels of SIRT1 mRNA by real time PCR but found no significant change (Fig. 1B), as had been reported in liver (26Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1α and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Thus, the decline in muscle SIRT1 during fasting most likely occurred by enhanced protein degradation or perhaps reduced translation. To determine whether other sirtuins also decrease in muscles during fasting, we also analyzed by Western blot the content of another nuclear sirtuin SIRT6 and the mitochondrial sirtuin, SIRT3. Although there was no change in the level of SIRT6, SIRT3 level increased during fasting, as was reported previously (27Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Goetzman E. Jing E. Schwer B. Lombard D.B. Grueter C.A. Harris C. Biddinger S. Ilkayeva O.R. Stevens R.D. Li Y. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Bain J.R. Newgard C.B. Farese Jr., R.V. Alt F.W. Kahn C.R. Verdin E. SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation by reversible enzyme deacetylation.Nature. 2010; 464: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). Thus, muscle SIRT1 is regulated in a distinct fashion, and during fasting, its level decreases specifically in muscle at times when the atrogene program is induced, and there is rapid wasting. We therefore hypothesized that the reduction in SIRT1 protein is important in the activation of FoxO3 and the induction of atrogenes upon fasting. If so, overexpression of SIRT1 might inhibit the fasting-associated rise in atrogene expression and thus reduce atrophy (just as the beneficial effects of SIRT1 in other tissues were observed only upon its pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression (15Baur J.A.

We measured the cross-sectional area of individual fibers in the TA muscle using an anti-FLAG antibody to stain electroporated SIRT1, which as expected was found only in muscle nuclei (Fig. 2B).

Now Dale Umetsu and colleagues report that invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells directly recognize the glycosphingolipid asperamide B derived from A. fumigatus. Asperamide B stains and activates mouse and human iNKT cells and induces airway hyper-reactivity in mice, suggesting that fungi can be directly detected by iNKT cells. Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that is ubiquitous in the environment and is commonly associated with allergic sensitization and severe asthma in humans. Although A. fumigatus is recognized by multiple microbial pattern-recognition receptors, we found that an A. fumigatus–derived glycosphingolipid, asperamide B, directly activates invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in vitro in a CD1d-restricted, MyD88-independent and dectin-1–independent fashion. Moreover, asperamide B, when loaded onto CD1d, directly stained, and was sufficient to activate, human and mouse iNKT cells. In vivo, asperamide B rapidly induced airway hyperreactivity, which is a cardinal feature of asthma, by activating pulmonary iNKT cells in an interleukin-33 (IL-33)-ST2–dependent fashion. Asperamide B is thus the first fungal glycolipid found to directly activate iNKT cells. These results extend the range of microorganisms that can be directly detected by iNKT cells to the kingdom of fungi and may explain how A. fumigatus can induce severe chronic respiratory diseases in humans."

In conjunction with functional assays, these cross-linking studies led us to postulate that PLB binds to a unique Ca2+-free (E2) state of SERCA and decreases the Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme through direct effects on the Ca2+ binding sites (5Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. Close proximity between residue 30 of phospholamban and cysteine 318 of the cardiac Ca2+ pump revealed by intermolecular thiol cross-linking.J. Biol.

Recently, a gain-of-function, cross-linkable PLB mutant, PLB4 (N27A, N30C, L37A, V49G-PLB) (Fig. 1), was developed (10Akin B.L. Chen Z. Jones L.R.

Here, we took advantage of PLB4 to stabilize the Ca2+-free state of SERCA and to crystallize it in complex with PLB. The 2.8-Å resolution structure, crystallized in nonyl maltoside, reveals a previously unresolved conformational state of the Ca2+ pump captured by PLB, which we define as E2-PLB. Importantly, the structure of E2-PLB is incompatible with Ca2+ (or Mg2+) binding to the enzyme, and confirms the hypothesis that mutually exclusive binding of PLB and Ca2+ to SERCA is the mechanism by which PLB decreases apparent Ca2+ affinity (5Jones L.R.

SR vesicles sedimenting at 45,000 × g were isolated from rabbit back and hind leg muscles as described previously for cardiac SR vesicles (13Jones L.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Watanabe A.M.

SR vesicle pellets were extracted with 0.6 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), and stored frozen in small aliquots at −40 °C at a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml. Recombinant WT-PLB and PLB4 were expressed and purified from Sf21 insect cells using anti-PLB monoclonal antibody (2D12) affinity chromatography as previously described (14Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. Functional reconstitution of recombinant phospholamban with rabbit skeletal Ca2+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Purified PLB was eluted from the column in 0.1% decyl maltoside or 0.01% dodecyl maltoside (Anatrace), which in control experiments were determined to be optimal detergents for co-crystallization of PLB with the solubilized Ca2+ pump. The purified, eluted PLB proteins were concentrated 100-fold with an Amicon concentrator, and then exhaustively dialyzed against 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 20% glycerol, and 0.1% decyl maltoside or 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. The final working concentrations of PLB were 8–10 mg of protein/ml. PLB was stored frozen at −40 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. The Ca2+ pump suitable for crystallization was solubilized directly from SR vesicles without prior purification or extraction of SR vesicles with low concentrations of deoxycholate (15Sørensen T.L.

Thawed SR vesicles were diluted 1:1 to a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml in buffer containing 2% nonyl maltoside (Anatrace), 20% glycerol, 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.12 m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2.8 mm EGTA (final concentrations). The samples were allowed to stand for 7 min at room temperature, then ultracentrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor. The supernatant was collected and PLB was added from the concentrated working solutions at a ratio of 0.14 mg of PLB/1.0 mg of solubilized SR vesicle protein, determined in control experiments to be a saturating concentration of PLB for inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity by lowering the apparent Ca2+ affinity. This amount of added PLB gave a molar ratio of PLB to SERCA of 2.9:1, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting (16Akin B.L. Jones L.R. Characterizing phospholamban to sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) protein binding interactions in human cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles using chemical cross-linking.J.

Final volumes of mother liquors were adjusted by addition of 20% glycerol to make the final EGTA concentration 2 mm and samples were stored at 4 °C. Ca2+-ATPase prepared by this method (in 2 mm EGTA) retained 95–100% of the initially solubilized activity for at least 3 weeks at 4 °C in the presence and absence of PLB (Fig. 2B). In pilot studies, the Ca2+ pump was solubilized from SR vesicles using other detergents, including C12E8 and octyl glucoside. Solubilization conditions were identical to that described above, using 2% detergent concentrations (Fig. 2B). One day after the initial Ca2+-ATPase solubilization and addition of PLB, mother liquors were sedimented a second time by ultracentrifugation as described above. Hanging drops were made by mixing 1 μl of the sedimented mother liquors with 1 μl of reservoir solution (15% glycerol, 17% (w/v) PEG-2000, 200 mm NaOAc, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 °C. Single crystals appeared within 2 weeks and grew to a final size of 150 × 100 × 50 μm within 1 month. Crystals were mounted using nylon fiber loops and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen with no additional cryo-protectant. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at Beamline 19-ID operated by the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source within Argonne National Laboratory. All diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 0.979 Å from a single crystal at 100 K. The crystal was formed from PLB4 added in decyl maltoside. The diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the program package HKL3000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the individual protein domains of SERCA (PDB code 2C8L) (18Jensen A.M. Sørensen T.L. Olesen C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Modulatory and catalytic modes of ATP binding by the calcium pump.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as the search models. Solutions were found for the three cytoplasmic domains using Phaser (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar), but no solution for the transmembrane region was obtained. The initial model was constructed from the three cytoplasmic domains and used to calculate initial electron density maps into which the individual transmembrane helices were manually fit using the program Coot (version 0.6.1 (20Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar)) and the connectivity of the M4 and M5 helices to one of the cytoplasmic domains and the C-terminal transmembrane helix as points of reference. Helix M4 required fitting as two distinct sections and the connecting polypeptide was manually fit to the electron density in Coot. The structure was subjected to interative rounds of model building and refinement using the program Refmac5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Optimal description of a protein structure in terms of multiple groups undergoing TLS motion.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) to model the anisotropy of the individual domains and PLB. In addition to SERCA and PLB, the final model includes one potassium ion and 2 non-covalently associated maltose molecules, for which the acyl chains were not visible in the electron density and hence have been modeled simply as maltose residues. Initial attempts to include a magnesium ion bound to site I in the transmembrane domain gave rise to a negative difference peak at 4.2 σ in the Fo − Fc electron density map at the position of the modeled magnesium ion. Based on this information, combined with the lack of a positive peak in the Fo − Fc electron density map greater than 2.7 σ when the model is refined in the absence of magnesium and the fact that magnesium ions are not required for PLB cross-linking, we conclude that the PLB-SERCA complex lacks metal ions bound to the transmembrane metal sites. Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined colorimetrically by measuring inorganic phosphate release from ATP (16Akin B.L. Jones L.R. Characterizing phospholamban to sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) protein binding interactions in human cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles using chemical cross-linking.J.

Ionized Ca2+ concentrations were set by addition of CaCl2. Some reaction tubes in addition contained 60–80 μg of anti-PLB 2D12 antibody to reverse PLB inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity (23Chen Z. Akin B.L. Jones L.R. Mechanism of reversal of phospholamban inhibition of the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase by protein kinase A and by anti-phospholamban monoclonal antibody 2D12.J. Biol.

KCa values designate Ca2+ concentrations at which Ca2+-ATPase is half-maximally activated. Cross-linking assays were conducted with solubilized Ca2+-ATPase protein reconstituted with PLB4 taken from mother liquors used for protein crystallization. The Ca2+-ATPase protein (12 μg) was added to 500 μl of buffer identical to that indicated above for determination of Ca2+-ATPase activity with omission of NaN3. Cross-linking was conducted with 1 mm KMUS for 2 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 7.5 μl of gel loading buffer containing 15% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-PLB antibody, 2D12, for detection of PLB cross-linked to SERCA1a (skeletal muscle isoform) (Fig. 3C). Cross-linking of the canine cardiac isoform of the Ca2+ pump (SERCA2a) to N30C-PLB or PLB4 co-expressed in insect cells was conducted identically as previously described (10Akin B.L. Chen Z.

Cross-linking was conducted with 1 mm KMUS for 1 min at room temperature. The results shown in Fig. 6 were conducted in the absence of ATP, however, similar results were obtained with inclusion of 3 mm ATP. Ki values indicate Ca2+ concentrations at which cross-linking is inhibited by 50%.FIGURE 6Lack of effect of Mg2+ on PLB cross-linking.

However, the Ca2+-ATPase is extremely labile and prone to denaturation when solubilized without Ca2+ (24Toyoshima C. Nomura H.

For example, solubilizing SERCA in the absence of Ca2+ in C12E8 caused a 3-fold decrease in Ca2+ affinity and loss of enzyme activity with a t½ of ∼3 days at 4 °C. Octyl glucoside, on the other hand, did not affect Ca2+ affinity, but caused even more rapid denaturation of the enzyme, with a t½ of less than 1 day at 4 °C. Consequently, a major challenge was to develop a new detergent system that would facilitate co-crystallization of SERCA reconstituted with PLB without denaturing the enzyme. The nonionic detergent nonyl maltoside was ultimately selected for solubilization of SERCA as it had little effect on the Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme (KCa = 0.25 versus 0.21 μm in the absence of detergent) (Fig. 2A), and preserved 90–100% of the solubilized Ca2+-ATPase activity for several weeks at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). SERCA solubilized in nonyl maltoside was then reconstituted with WT-PLB or PLB4 solubilized in decyl maltoside or dodecyl maltoside (shown with PLB4 solubilized in decyl maltoside in Fig. 2B), detergents that also preserved SERCA catalytic activity for weeks when stored at 4 °C. Ca2+-ATPase assays in the newly developed detergent system show that WT-PLB and PLB4 decreased the Ca2+ affinity of the solubilized enzyme by 2- and 5-fold, respectively, but had no significant effect on maximal ATPase activity measured at saturating Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3B). This alteration in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA is the hallmark of PLB inhibition (2Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Phospholamban.

As expected, addition of the 2D12 anti-PLB antibody (which mimics the effect of Ser16/Thr17 phosphorylation of PLB (23Chen Z. Akin B.L. Jones L.R.

The remarkable stability of Ca2+-free SERCA solubilized in nonyl maltoside is reported here for the first time. It should be mentioned that rabbit skeletal muscle SR vesicles were used as the source of the Ca2+ pumps in this study due to the high content of the ATPase protein in the SR membrane, making enzyme purification unnecessary (15Sørensen T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1973309106,"Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax disease, is lethal owing to the actions of two exotoxins: anthrax lethal toxin (LT) and oedema toxin (ET). The key tissue targets responsible for the lethal effects of these toxins are unknown. Here we generated cell-type-specific anthrax toxin receptor capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2)-null mice and cell-type-specific CMG2-expressing mice and challenged them with the toxins. Our results show that lethality induced by LT and ET occurs through damage to distinct cell types; whereas targeting cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells is required for LT-induced mortality, ET-induced lethality occurs mainly through its action in hepatocytes. Notably, and in contradiction to what has been previously postulated, targeting of endothelial cells by either toxin does not seem to contribute significantly to lethality. Our findings demonstrate that B. anthracis has evolved to use LT and ET to induce host lethality by coordinately damaging two distinct vital systems."
https://openalex.org/W2031022464,"Blau and colleagues show that non-dividing heterokaryons between mouse embryonic stem cells and human fibroblasts, in which human nuclei reprogram to a more embryonic state, can be used to identify signalling pathways involved in reprogramming. They delineate that IL-6 signalling and JAK/STAT target kinase Pim1 signalling are induced during this reprogramming, and that they increase the efficiency of factor-mediated reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cell status. Molecular insights into somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) would aid regenerative medicine, but are difficult to elucidate in iPS because of their heterogeneity, as relatively few cells undergo reprogramming (0.1–1%; refs 1, 2). To identify early acting regulators, we capitalized on non-dividing heterokaryons (mouse embryonic stem cells fused to human fibroblasts), in which reprogramming towards pluripotency is efficient and rapid3, enabling the identification of transient regulators required at the onset. We used bi-species transcriptome-wide RNA-seq to quantify transcriptional changes in the human somatic nucleus during reprogramming towards pluripotency in heterokaryons. During heterokaryon reprogramming, the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6), which is not detectable at significant levels in embryonic stem cells, was induced 50-fold. A 4-day culture with IL6 at the onset of iPS reprogramming replaced stably transduced oncogenic c-Myc such that transduction of only Oct4, Klf4 and Sox2 was required. IL6 also activated another Jak/Stat target, the serine/threonine kinase gene Pim1, which accounted for the IL6-mediated twofold increase in iPS frequency. In contrast, LIF, another induced GP130 ligand, failed to increase iPS frequency or activate c-Myc or Pim1, thereby revealing a differential role for the two Jak/Stat inducers in iPS generation. These findings demonstrate the power of heterokaryon bi-species global RNA-seq to identify early acting regulators of reprogramming, for example, extrinsic replacements for stably transduced transcription factors such as the potent oncogene c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2170292410,"Quantum point contacts are narrow, one-dimensional constrictions usually patterned in a two-dimensional electron system, for example by applying voltages to local gates. The linear conductance of a point contact, when measured as function of its channel width, is quantized in units of GQ = 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. However, the conductance also has an unexpected shoulder at ∼0.7GQ, known as the '0.7-anomaly', whose origin is still subject to debate. Proposed theoretical explanations have invoked spontaneous spin polarization, ferromagnetic spin coupling, the formation of a quasi-bound state leading to the Kondo effect, Wigner crystallization and various treatments of inelastic scattering. However, explicit calculations that fully reproduce the various experimental observations in the regime of the 0.7-anomaly, including the zero-bias peak that typically accompanies it, are still lacking. Here we offer a detailed microscopic explanation for both the 0.7-anomaly and the zero-bias peak: their common origin is a smeared van Hove singularity in the local density of states at the bottom of the lowest one-dimensional subband of the point contact, which causes an anomalous enhancement in the Hartree potential barrier, the magnetic spin susceptibility and the inelastic scattering rate. We find good qualitative agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results on the dependence of the conductance on gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature, source-drain voltage (including the zero-bias peak) and interaction strength. We also clarify how the low-energy scale governing the 0.7-anomaly depends on gate voltage and interactions. For low energies, we predict and observe Fermi-liquid behaviour similar to that associated with the Kondo effect in quantum dots. At high energies, however, the similarities between the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect end."
https://openalex.org/W1968604225,"Rhodopsin photosensors of phototactic algae act as light-gated cation channels when expressed in animal cells. These proteins (channelrhodopsins) are extensively used for millisecond scale photocontrol of cellular functions (optogenetics). We report characterization of PsChR, one of the phototaxis receptors in the alga Platymonas (Tetraselmis) subcordiformis. PsChR exhibited ∼3-fold higher unitary conductance and greater relative permeability for Na(+) ions, as compared with the most frequently used channelrhodopsin-2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR2). Photocurrents generated by PsChR in HEK293 cells showed lesser inactivation and faster peak recovery than those by CrChR2. Their maximal spectral sensitivity was at 445 nm, making PsChR the most blue-shifted channelrhodopsin so far identified. The λmax of detergent-purified PsChR was 437 nm at neutral pH and exhibited red shifts (pKa values at 6.6 and 3.8) upon acidification. The purified pigment undergoes a photocycle with a prominent red-shifted intermediate whose formation and decay kinetics match the kinetics of channel opening and closing. The rise and decay of an M-like intermediate prior to formation of this putative conductive state were faster than in CrChR2. PsChR mediated sufficient light-induced membrane depolarization in cultured hippocampal neurons to trigger reliable repetitive spiking at the upper threshold frequency of the neurons. At low frequencies spiking probability decreases less with PsChR than with CrChR2 because of the faster recovery of the former. Its blue-shifted absorption enables optogenetics at wavelengths even below 400 nm. A combination of characteristics makes PsChR important for further research on structure-function relationships in ChRs and potentially useful for optogenetics, especially for combinatorial applications when short wavelength excitation is required."
https://openalex.org/W2096967258,"Splicing abnormalities have profound impact in human cancer. Several splicing factors, including SAM68, have pro-oncogenic functions, and their increased expression often correlates with human cancer development and progression. Herein, we have identified using mass spectrometry proteins that interact with endogenous SAM68 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Among other interesting proteins, we have characterized the interaction of SAM68 with SND1, a transcriptional co-activator that binds spliceosome components, thus coupling transcription and splicing. We found that both SAM68 and SND1 are upregulated in PCa cells with respect to benign prostate cells. Upregulation of SND1 exerts a synergic effect with SAM68 on exon v5 inclusion in the CD44 mRNA. The effect of SND1 on CD44 splicing required SAM68, as it was compromised after knockdown of this protein or mutation of the SAM68-binding sites in the CD44 pre-mRNA. More generally, we found that SND1 promotes the inclusion of CD44 variable exons by recruiting SAM68 and spliceosomal components on CD44 pre-mRNA. Inclusion of the variable exons in CD44 correlates with increased proliferation, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Strikingly, we found that knockdown of SND1, or SAM68, reduced proliferation and migration of PCa cells. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that SND1 is a novel regulator of alternative splicing that promotes PCa cell growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W1992392674,"Strongly activated “coated” platelets are characterized by increased phosphatidylserine (PS) surface expression, α-granule protein retention, and lack of active integrin αIIbβ3. To study how they are incorporated into thrombi despite a lack of free activated integrin, we investigated the structure, function, and formation of the α-granule protein “coat.” Confocal microscopy revealed that fibrin(ogen) and thrombospondin colocalized as “cap,” a single patch on the PS-positive platelet surface. In aggregates, the cap was located at the point of attachment of the PS-positive platelets. Without fibrin(ogen) retention, their ability to be incorporated in aggregates was drastically reduced. The surface fibrin(ogen) was strongly decreased in the presence of a fibrin polymerization inhibitor GPRP and also in platelets from a patient with dysfibrinogenemia and a fibrinogen polymerization defect. In contrast, a fibrinogen-clotting protease ancistron increased the amount of fibrin(ogen) and thrombospondin on the surface of the PS-positive platelets stimulated with collagen-related peptide. Transglutaminases are also involved in fibrin(ogen) retention. However, platelets from patients with factor XIII deficiency had normal retention, and a pan-transglutaminase inhibitor T101 had only a modest inhibitory effect. Fibrin(ogen) retention was normal in Bernard-Soulier syndrome and kindlin-3 deficiency, but not in Glanzmann thrombasthenia lacking the platelet pool of fibrinogen and αIIbβ3.

Platelet-based coagulation: different populations, different functions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The function and the mechanism of formation of the α-granule protein coat are poorly understood, which complicates understanding of the role of the coated platelets themselves. Although our previous study hypothesized that it can serve to attach coated to non-coated platelets and allow their incorporation into aggregates (8.Yakimenko A.O. Verholomova F.Y. Kotova Y.N.

One hypothesis for coat formation is that proteins are cross-linked by platelet-derived thrombin-activated factor XIII (fXIII) and/or tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (4.Dale G.L. Friese P. Batar P. Hamilton S.F. Reed G.L. Jackson K.W. Clemetson K.J. Alberio L. Stimulated platelets use serotonin to enhance their retention of procoagulant proteins on the cell surface.Nature. 2002; 415: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, fXIII knock-out mice exhibit normal coated platelet formation (13.Jobe S.M. Leo L. Eastvold J.S. Dickneite G. Ratliff T.L. Lentz S.R. Di Paola J. Role of FcRγ and factor XIIIA in coated platelet formation.Blood. 2005; 106: 4146-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is the conversion of platelet α-granule fibrinogen into fibrin associated with platelets (10.Munnix I.C. Cosemans J.M. Auger J.M. Heemskerk J.W. Platelet response heterogeneity in thrombus formation.Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 102: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with the possible entanglement of other proteins in the fibrin mesh. In favor of this, strong platelet stimulation without thrombin (e.g. by a glycoprotein VI agonist convulxin or a PAR1 agonist SFLLRN) leads to the formation of a phosphatidylserine-expressing subpopulation without the coat (17.Topalov N.N. Kotova Y.N. Vasil'ev S.A. Panteleev M.A. Identification of signal transduction pathways involved in the formation of platelet subpopulations upon activation.Br. J. Haematol. 2012; 157: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, binding to αIIbβ3 or another receptor is an obvious possibility at least for fibrinogen (and thrombospondin, another major α-granule protein). Other proteins such as factor Va can also use specific binding mechanisms (18.Fager A.M. Wood J.P. Bouchard B.A. Feng P. Tracy P.B. Properties of procoagulant platelets: defining and characterizing the subpopulation binding a functional prothrombinase.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our study focuses on the imaging of the fibrin(ogen) coat on the PS-positive platelet surface, on the functional role of this coat and on the mechanisms of its formation. The three main findings are as follows: (i) α-granule proteins form a single localized cap rather than a uniformly spread coat; (ii) it allows the coated platelets to bind to non-coated ones and become incorporated into a growing thrombus; (iii) fibrin(ogen) and thrombospondin localize to this cap mainly due to fibrin polymerization.

She possessed a homozygous p.Asp314Tyr mutation in the ITGB3 gene. Her platelets failed to aggregate or to support clot retraction. The patient had a severe bleeding syndrome with frequent hematomas and purpuras and had a history of blood transfusion with platelet concentrates. Another patient (whose platelets were used for experiments in Fig. 5, B and C) had little residual integrin by flow cytometry; the platelets also did not aggregate, and the patient had a history of bleeding during surgery and platelet concentrate transfusion. Kindlin-3 deficient patient was described previously as having leukocyte adhesion deficiency disease type III characterized by both immunodeficiency (20.Robert P. Canault M. Farnarier C. Nurden A. Grosdidier C. Barlogis V. Bongrand P. Pierres A. Chambost H. Alessi M.C.

Immunol. 2011; 186: 5273-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and severe Glanzmann-type bleeding. It was caused by a homozygous mutation (c.310-2A.C) in the FERMT3 gene that led to an open reading frameshift (p.Asn54ArgfsX142) that prevented kindlin-3 expression. Kindlin-3-deficient platelets expressed integrin αIIbβ3, but it failed to become activated, and the platelets did not aggregate in response to either ADP or collagen. The Bernard-Soulier syndrome patient had a mutation in the CD42a (glycoprotein IX) gene (p.Asn61Ser) leading to zero GPIb expression, giant platelets and thrombocytopenia (2.1 × 107 ml−1), and reduced ristocetin-induced agglutination. Atypically, this Bernard-Soulier syndrome patient had a normal bleeding time (∼5 min) and no clinical manifestations. The patient with dysfibrinogenemia had a homozygous fibrinogen Metz mutation (p.Arg16Cys) in the Aα chain preventing fibrinopeptide A release, so that no fibrin clot formation was observed, although fibrinopeptide B was released normally. Platelet aggregation was normal. The patient suffered from severe bleeding and had a history of fibrinogen transfusions. (The last transfusion was 2 years before this study.) The patient with severe fXIII deficiency (fXIII < 1%) had a homozygous T866 insertion in exon 6 (p.Pro255SerfsX16). Platelets were isolated from freshly drawn blood of healthy adult volunteers or patients. Investigations were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control donors, or from their parents. Briefly, blood was collected into 3.8% sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at a 9:1 blood/anticoagulant volume ratio and supplemented with prostaglandin E1 (1 μm) and apyrase (0.1 unit/ml) to prevent platelet activation. It was centrifuged to obtain platelet-rich plasma that was supplemented with 3.8% sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at a 1:3 citrate/plasma ratio to lower pH. Platelets were concentrated by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min (or 1000 × g for 5 min), resuspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and subjected to gel filtration on a chromatography column packed with Sepharose CL-2B and equilibrated with buffer A. Platelets at indicated concentrations were activated by incubation with agonists in buffer A with 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 15 min in the presence of labeling antibodies, diluted 10-fold, and immediately analyzed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or Accuri C6 (Accuri Cytometers, Ann Arbor, MI) flow cytometer. The acquired data were processed using a WinMDI (version 2.8, Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) or CFlow software (Accuri Cytometers). Compensation was done for all types of two-color and three-color analysis. To quantify thrombospondin or fibrin(ogen) binding, activated platelets were additionally incubated with anti-thrombospondin antibody or FITC-anti-fibrinogen antibody for 5 min and then (for the anti-thrombospondin sample) with secondary antibody for an additional 5 min, fixed in 1.5% formalin in PBS for 20 min, diluted 15-fold, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The ability of different subpopulations to aggregate was evaluated essentially as described (8.Yakimenko A.O. Verholomova F.Y. Kotova Y.N. Ataullakhanov F.I.

Platelets at 50,000/μl were activated by incubation with agonists in buffer A with 2.5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of FITC-annexin V and PE-CD62P or CD61-PerCP for 15 min in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml Monafram with and without shaking (600 rpm in an MS1 Minishaker (IKA, Staufen, Germany)). Then, samples were diluted 10-fold and analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Alternatively, platelets at 50,000/μl were activated with agonists in buffer A with 2.5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of PE-annexin V and CD42b-FITC. This was followed by addition of 1 μm PPACK and 1 mg/ml fibrinogen. Next, platelets were shaken (600 rpm) for 5 min, diluted 10-fold, and analyzed in a flow cytometer. Glass coverslips (24 × 24 mm, Heinz Herenz, Hamburg, Germany) were cleaned with potassium dichromate, rinsed with distilled water, and dried, and the clean coverslips were coated with 20 mg/ml fibrinogen in buffer A for 40 min at room temperature, rinsed with distilled water, and then assembled as part of the flow chamber. In the experiments with non-aggregated platelets, samples were prepared as described above. In the experiments with aggregates, platelets at 50,000/μl were activated by incubation with 100 nm thrombin and 10 μg/ml CRP in buffer A with 2.5 mm CaCl2 and fluorescently labeled annexin V and CD61 for 15 min. Then, 1 μm PPACK and 1 mg/ml fibrinogen were added; the platelets were vortexed for 3 min and allowed to spread on the fibrinogen surface in the chamber for 5 min. Confocal images were acquired with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 100× objective. For Fig. 5B, a Leica DMI 6000 SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems SAS, Nanterre, France) with a resonant scanner and 100× objective was used. To visualize the products of tTG activity, we used 7.5% SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions as described (21.Sugimura Y. Hosono M. Wada F. Yoshimura T. Maki M. Hitomi K. Screening for the preferred substrate sequence of transglutaminase using a phage-displayed peptide library: identification of peptide substrates for TGASE 2 and Factor XIIIA.J. Biol.

One mg/ml fibrinogen was cross-linked by 50 nm tTG in buffer 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT; pH 8.0. Some samples contained 200 μm T101, 10 mm GPRP, 10 mm GPPP, or 25 mm EDTA as a positive control for the inhibitor of transglutaminase activity. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 25 mm EDTA. Samples were mixed with 3× loading buffer, and 7.5 μl of each sample were run in Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer. Gels were stained with Coomassie R-250. Platelets were resuspended in T3EN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA) at 1 μl/106 platelets and lysed by adding 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 30 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 12% SDS at a 1:5 ratio. Samples were boiled for 5 min and then spun at 14000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Ten μg of total protein were loaded on a 10% gel and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-FXIIIA Ig or anti-Fg Ig and revealed by chemiluminescence. Glass coverslips (24 × 24 mm, Heinz Herenz, Hamburg, Germany) were cleaned with potassium dichromate, rinsed with distilled water, and dried. Then, the coverslips were coated with 200 μg/ml native fibrillar type I collagen (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA) in buffer A for 60 min at room temperature in a humid chamber, rinsed with distilled water, dried at 37 °C, and then assembled as a part of the flow chamber (slit depth of 80 μm). Flow chambers with tubings were blocked with buffer A for at least 30 min before the perfusion of blood. Blood from healthy donors was collected into 3.8% sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at a 9:1 blood/anticoagulant volume ratio and recalcified with 7.5 mm CaCl2 (providing physiological free ionized calcium concentration) upon entry into the flow chamber. Recalcified whole blood was perfused for 2 min at shear rate of 500 s−1 over the collagen. Thereafter, the flow chamber was post-perfused at the same shear rate for a further 2 min with buffer A containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm PPACK, and annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 to detect phosphatidylserine exposure. Confocal images of thrombi were acquired with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate with platelets from different donors except for studies with patients. Comparisons were carried out with the paired Student's t test. Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. Values are reported as mean ± S.D. unless specified otherwise. A typical experiment on the formation of the fibrinogen coat in the PS-expressing subpopulation in presented in Fig. 1A. Washed platelets were activated with thrombin, labeled with annexin V and anti-human fibrinogen antibody, and analyzed at indicated time points by flow cytometry. In agreement with previous reports, this leads to the appearance of a distinct PS-positive subpopulation that have retained secreted fibrin(ogen). Both the mean fluorescence and quantity increased steadily with time over the course of 30 min before reaching a plateau. To study the structure of this fibrin(ogen) coat on the platelet surface, these activated platelets labeled with annexin V and anti-human fibrinogen antibody were imaged by confocal microscopy. Intriguingly, the coat of the PS-positive platelets was not uniformly spread over the platelet surface but rather was located in a single cap (Fig. 1B). A three-dimensional reconstruction of it is shown in Fig. 1C (see also supplemental Movie 1). The annexin V concentration in the cap was also high and increased compared with the rest of the platelet surface (Fig. 1B), indicating that the cap is phospholipid-based. It was clear that the cap contained fibrin(ogen) at a density vastly exceeding that on the rest of the platelet surface. Each procoagulant platelet had only one cap, and 85% of platelets possessed a cap (Fig. 1D). The cap was formed early in the platelet activation coinciding with the overall shape change (data not shown). In the PS-negative platelets, fibrinogen was distributed differently, with several points of fluorescence over the surface in agreement with previous reports. Significantly, both the procoagulant platelets in general and their caps lacked unoccupied active integrins (supplemental Fig. S1). Residual αIIbβ3 itself was detected more or less uniformly over the whole platelet with little concentration in the cap (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the α-granule membrane glycoprotein, P-selectin, was also distributed over the whole platelet surface in a manner different from that of fibrin(ogen) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, glycoprotein Ib was concentrated in the cap (Fig. 2C). We have previously hypothesized that coated platelets can be incorporated into aggregates despite their lack of activated integrins because of their fibrin(ogen) coat that could interact with activated integrin αIIbβ3 molecules on non-coated platelets. To study this, platelets were activated either with thrombin (producing ∼5% PS+ platelets) or thrombin plus CRP (∼70% PS+ platelets) in the presence or absence of an αIIbβ3 antagonist Monafram for 15 min and shaken during activation to induce aggregation. Samples with and without shaking were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the percentage of platelets lost from the suspension after shaking (calculated from the single platelet histogram) was assessed. In agreement with previous reports, thrombin-stimulated platelets readily formed aggregates, although potent activation with thrombin plus CRP resulted in less aggregation in the sample (Fig. 3A). Addition of Monafram abolished both the thrombin-induced and thrombin/CRP-induced aggregation (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that the fibrin(ogen) cap on the PS+/Ca+ platelet surface cannot itself provide the basis for the aggregate formation and that αIIbβ3 is always involved. To test whether the fibrin(ogen) cap is responsible for the coated platelet incorporation into the aggregates, platelets were stimulated with thrombin plus CRP (to produce PS+ platelets with high fibrin(ogen)) or CRP alone (to obtain PS+ platelets with low fibrin(ogen)) for 15 min, supplemented with PPACK and fibrinogen, shaken for 5 min at 600 rpm, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentages of platelets from the three different subpopulations (excluding aggregates from the analysis) that left the suspension after shaking were assessed (15.Topalov N.N. Yakimenko A.O.

https://openalex.org/W2058772642,"Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of E3 ligases and require cullin neddylation for their activation. The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 reportedly blocked cullin neddylation and inactivated CRLs, which resulted in apoptosis induction and tumor suppression. However, CRL roles in ovarian cancer cell survival and the ovarian tumor repressing effects of MLN4924 are unknown. We show here that CRL4 components are highly expressed in human epithelial ovarian cancer tissues. MLN4924-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, MLN4924 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic drug treatments. Depletion of CRL4 components Roc1/2, Cul4a, and DDB1 had inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer cells similar to MLN4924 treatment, which suggested that CRL4 inhibition contributed to the chemotherapeutic effect of MLN4924 in ovarian cancers. We also investigated for key CRL4 substrate adaptors required for ovarian cancer cells. Depleting Vprbp/Dcaf1 did not significantly affect ovarian cancer cell growth, even though it was expressed by ovarian cancer tissues. However, depleting Cdt2/Dcaf2 mimicked the pharmacological effects of MLN4924 and caused the accumulation of its substrate, CDT1, both in vitro and in vivo. MLN4924-induced DNA damage and apoptosis were partially rescued by Cdt1 depletion, suggesting that CRL4(CDT2) repression and CDT1 accumulation were key biochemical events contributing to the genotoxic effects of MLN4924 in ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that CRL4(CDT2) is a potential drug target in ovarian cancers and that MLN4924 may be an effective anticancer agent for targeted ovarian cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2141172966,"A quantum point contact (QPC) is a very basic nano-electronic device: a short and narrow transport channel between two electron reservoirs. In clean channels electron transport is ballistic and the conductance $G$ is then quantised as a function of channel width with plateaus at integer multiples of $2e^2/h$ ($e$ is the electron charge and $h$ Planck's constant). This can be understood in a picture where the electron states are propagating waves, without need to account for electron-electron interactions. Quantised conductance could thus be the signature of ultimate control over nanoscale electron transport. However, even studies with the cleanest QPCs generically show significant anomalies on the quantised conductance traces and there is consensus that these result from electron many-body effects. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies understanding of these anomalies is an open problem. We report evidence that the many-body effects have their origin in one or more spontaneously localised states that emerge from Friedel oscillations in the QPC channel. Kondo physics will then also contribute to the formation of the many-body state with Kondo signatures that reflect the parity of the number of localised states. Evidence comes from experiments with length-tunable QPCs that show a periodic modulation of the many-body physics with Kondo signatures of alternating parity. Our results are of importance for assessing the role of QPCs in more complex hybrid devices and proposals for spintronic and quantum information applications. In addition, our results show that tunable QPCs offer a rich platform for investigating many-body effects in nanoscale systems, with the ability to probe such physics at the level of a single site."
https://openalex.org/W1978629444,"Imiquimod (IMQ), a nucleoside analogue of the imidazoquinoline family, is used in the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and other skin diseases. It is reported to be a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist and, as such, initiates a Th1 immune response by activating sentinel cells in the vicinity of the tumour. BCC is a hedgehog (HH)-driven malignancy with oncogenic glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) signalling activated in a ligand-independent manner. Here we show that IMQ can also directly repress HH signalling by negatively modulating GLI activity in BCC and medulloblastoma cells. Further, we provide evidence that the repressive effect of IMQ on HH signalling is not dependent on TLR/MYD88 signalling. Our results suggest a mechanism for IMQ engaging adenosine receptors (ADORAs) to control GLI signalling. Pharmacological activation of ADORA with either an ADORA agonist or IMQ resulted in a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated GLI phosphorylation and reduction in GLI activator levels. The activation of PKA and HH pathway target gene downregulation in response to IMQ were abrogated by ADORA inhibition. Furthermore, activated Smoothened signalling, which positively signals to GLI transcription factors, could be effectively counteracted by IMQ. These results reveal a previously unknown mode of action of IMQ in the treatment of BCC and also suggest a role for ADORAs in the regulation of oncogenic HH signalling."

We investigated cellular properties of LM2 including actin cytoskeleton organization, motility and signaling pathways that drive the expression of genes associated with the lung metastasis signature. Parental cells exhibit well-developed stress fibers, whereas LM2 had poorly organized stress fibers. LM2 exhibited higher levels of K-Ras protein and corresponding higher levels of phosphorylated ERK compared with parental cells. The Ras-ERK pathway was responsible for the disruption of stress fibers because inhibition of MEK with UO126 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) against K-Ras or ERK1/2 resulted in restoration of stress fibers and focal adhesions. We observed that the K-Ras-ERK pathway is important for the expression of genes associated with the lung metastasis signature. Paradoxically, inhibition of the Ras-ERK pathway did not result in inhibition of cell motility but was accompanied by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Inhibition of both ERK and PI3K pathways was required to inhibit motility of LM2 cells. These results suggest that both ERK and PI3K pathways drive motile functions of metastatic LM2 cells and genes associated with the lung metastasis signature."
https://openalex.org/W2137586290,"Monocyte infiltration and macrophage formation are pivotal steps in atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability. Gremlin-1/Drm is crucial in embryo-/organogenesis and has been shown to be expressed in the adult organism at sites of arterial injury and to inhibit monocyte migration. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and characterize the role of Gremlin-1 in atherosclerosis. Here we report that Gremlin-1 is highly expressed primarily by monocytes/macrophages in aortic atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE(-/-) mice and is secreted from activated monocytes and during macrophage development in vitro. Gremlin-1 reduces macrophage formation by inhibiting macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine critically involved in atherosclerotic plaque progression and vulnerability. Gremlin-1 binds with high affinity to MIF (KD = 54 nm), as evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, and reduces MIF-induced release of TNF-α from macrophages. Treatment of ApoE(-/-) mice with a dimeric recombinant fusion protein, mGremlin1-Fc, but not with equimolar control Fc or inactivated mGremlin1-Fc, reduced TNF-α expression, the content of monocytes/macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions, and attenuated atheroprogression. The present data disclose that Gremlin-1 is an endogenous antagonist of MIF and define a role for Gremlin-1/MIF interaction in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2095764592,"Humanin (HN) is a 24-aa polypeptide that offers protection from Alzheimer's disease and myocardial infarction, increases insulin sensitivity, improves survival of β cells, and delays onset of diabetes. Here we examined the acute effects of HN on insulin secretion and potential mechanisms through which they are mediated. Effects of a potent HN analog, HNGF6A, on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were assessed in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and cultured murine β cell line (βTC3) in vitro. Sprague-Dawley rats (3 mo old) that received HNGF6A required a significantly higher glucose infusion rate and demonstrated higher insulin levels during hyperglycemic clamps compared to saline controls. In vitro, compared to scrambled peptide controls, HNGF6A increased GSIS in isolated islets from both normal and diabetic mice as well as in βTC3 cells. Effects of HNGF6A on GSIS were dose dependent, K-ATP channel independent, and associated with enhanced glucose metabolism. These findings demonstrate that HNGF6A increases GSIS in whole animals, from isolated islets and from cells in culture, which suggests a direct effect on the β cell. The glucose-dependent effects on insulin secretion along with the established effects on insulin action suggest potential for HN and its analogs in the treatment of diabetes.—Kuliawat, R., Klein, L., Gong, Z., Nicoletta-Gentile, M., Nemkal, A.

https://openalex.org/W1965798340,"Several proteasome-associated proteins regulate degradation by the 26 S proteasome using the ubiquitin chains that mark most substrates for degradation. The proteasome-associated protein Ecm29, however, has no ubiquitin-binding or modifying activity, and its direct effect on substrate degradation is unclear. Here, we show that Ecm29 acts as a proteasome inhibitor. Besides inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage of peptide substrates in vitro, it inhibits the degradation of ubiquitin-dependent and -independent substrates in vivo. Binding of Ecm29 to the proteasome induces a closed conformation of the substrate entry channel of the core particle. Furthermore, Ecm29 inhibits proteasomal ATPase activity, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition and gate regulation by Ecm29 is through regulation of the proteasomal ATPases. Consistent with this, we identified through chemical cross-linking that Ecm29 binds to, or in close proximity to, the proteasomal ATPase subunit Rpt5.

Significance: Ecm29 functions in part by preventing activity of proteasomes that do not pass quality control. The proteasome is the major cytosolic protease in eukaryotes. The 26 S proteasome holoenzyme consists of a core particle (CP) 3The abbreviations used are: CP, core particle; RP, regulatory particle; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; Suc-, succinimidyl-; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. with one or two regulatory particles (RPs), giving rise to a protease complex of about 2.5 MDa in size. Many proteasome substrates are marked for degradation by the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain (1.Finley D.

The first step in degradation is the selection of substrates by a large number of E2 and E3 enzymes that mark specific proteins for degradation. However, additional steps of potential regulation are present at the proteasome. This includes substrate delivery to the proteasome as well as recognition and deubiquitination by the proteasome. These are facilitated by proteasome-intrinsic ubiquitin receptors, like yeast Rpn10 (human PSMD4) and Rpn13 (ADRM1); shuttling factors, like Rad23 (RAD23A/B); and proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes, like Ubp6 (USP14) (1.Finley D.

Finally, substrates require unfolding by the proteasomal AAA-ATPase (the Rpt proteins) and translocation to the inside of the cylindrically shaped CP, where proteolysis occurs.

Despite these numerous associations, the molecular effects of Ecm29 binding to the 26 S proteasome remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that Ecm29 preferentially binds to nucleotide-depleted as well as certain mutant proteasomes. Upon binding to proteasomes, Ecm29 inhibits the in vivo and in vitro degradation of substrates. Binding of Ecm29 to the proteasomes causes a closed gate conformation and, more importantly, causes an inhibition of proteasomal ATPase activity. The latter can explain the observed reduction in in vivo degradation in the presence of Ecm29. See Table 1 for the genotypes of strains used.

Monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) was used for detection of FLAG-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega) was used for detection of β-galactosidase. Polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Enzo) and monoclonal anti-T7 (Novagen) were used for the detection of ubiquitinated substrates, and anti-Pgk1 antibody (Invitrogen) was used as a loading control. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). All images were acquired using a Gbox imaging system (Syngene) with GeneSnap software. To determine the relative levels of Ecm29 in Fig. 6, peak volumes for the different bands were determined using the Genetool analysis software from Syngene, and values for each Ecm29 signal were corrected for input using the Rpt5 immunoblot. These corrected values were normalized to the signal for ATP without proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 8A) or ecm29Δ with ATP (Fig. 8C).

Briefly, between 1 and 6 liters of overnight cultures (A600 ∼10) were collected, washed in H2O, and resuspended in two pellet volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP). The cells were lysed by French press, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min). The supernatant was filtered through a cheesecloth, IgG beads (MP Biomedicals) were added (∼0.5 ml/liter of culture), and the lysate was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h.

https://openalex.org/W2037711270,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is a concerted process that integrates transcriptional regulation with hormonal signals. A major regulator is thyroid hormone (TH), which acts through its nuclear receptor (TR) to induce the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC). Forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 also is an important regulator of these genes; however, its functional interactions with TR are not known. Here, we report that TR-mediated transcriptional activation of PCK1 and G6PC in human hepatic cells and mouse liver was FoxO1-dependent and furthermore required FoxO1 deacetylation by the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, SirT1. siRNA knockdown of FoxO1 decreased, whereas overexpression of FoxO1 increased, TH-dependent transcriptional activation of PCK1 and G6PC in cultured hepatic cells. FoxO1 siRNA knockdown also decreased TH-mediated transcription in vivo. Additionally, TH was unable to induce FoxO1 deacetylation or hepatic PCK1 gene expression in TH receptor β-null (TRβ(-/-)) mice. Moreover, TH stimulated FoxO1 recruitment to the PCK1 and G6PC gene promoters in a SirT1-dependent manner. In summary, our results show that TH-dependent deacetylation of a second metabolically regulated transcription factor represents a novel mechanism for transcriptional integration of nuclear hormone action with cellular energy status."
https://openalex.org/W2144761756,"The N-terminal domain (NTD) of steroid receptors harbors a transcriptional activation function (AF1) that is composed of an intrinsically disordered polypeptide. We examined the interaction of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with the NTD of the progesterone receptor (PR) and its ability to regulate AF1 activity through coupled folding and binding. As assessed by solution phase biophysical methods, the isolated NTD of PR contains a large content of random coil, and it is capable of adopting secondary α-helical structure and more stable tertiary folding either in the presence of the natural osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide or through a direct interaction with TBP. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry confirmed the highly dynamic intrinsically disordered property of the NTD within the context of full-length PR. Deletion mapping and point mutagenesis defined a region of the NTD (amino acids 350-428) required for structural folding in response to TBP interaction. Overexpression of TBP in cells enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by the PR NTD, and deletion mutations showed that a region (amino acids 327-428), similar to that required for TBP-induced folding, was required for functional response. TBP also increased steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) interaction with the PR NTD and cooperated with SRC-1 to stimulate NTD-dependent transcriptional activity. These data suggest that TBP can mediate structural reorganization of the NTD to facilitate the binding of co-activators required for maximal transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2014391280,"PKA signaling is important for the post-translational modification of proteins, especially those in cardiomyocytes involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. PKA activity is spatially and temporally regulated through compartmentalization by protein kinase A anchoring proteins. Cypher/ZASP, a member of PDZ-LIM domain protein family, is a cytoskeletal protein that forms multiprotein complexes at sarcomeric Z-lines. It has been demonstrated that Cypher/ZASP plays a pivotal structural role in the structural integrity of sarcomeres, and several of its mutations are associated with myopathies including dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we show that Cypher/ZASP, interacting specifically with the type II regulatory subunit RIIα of PKA, acted as a typical protein kinase A anchoring protein in cardiomyocytes. In addition, we show that Cypher/ZASP itself was phosphorylated at Ser(265) and Ser(296) by PKA. Furthermore, the PDZ domain of Cypher/ZASP interacted with the L-type calcium channel through its C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Expression of Cypher/ZASP facilitated PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel in vitro. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel at Ser(1928) induced by isoproterenol was impaired in neonatal Cypher/ZASP-null cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Cypher/ZASP interacted with the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin, which is a phosphatase for the L-type calcium channel. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that Cypher/ZASP not only plays a structural role for the sarcomeric integrity, but is also an important sarcomeric signaling scaffold in regulating the phosphorylation of channels or contractile proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1993841973,"LKB1 loss is a frequent homozygous deletion and/or gene mutation found in lung adenocarcinomas. However, few cases of LKB1 loss by either deletion or mutation are seen in Asian patients. Our preliminary data showed that LKB1 loss was associated with p53 mutation in lung tumors from Taiwanese adenocarcinoma patients and p53 transcription is directly regulated by NKX2-1. Therefore, we hypothesized that LKB1 loss could occur due to aberration of p53 regulation mediated by NKX2-1. In the present study, 16 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were investigated to determine if LKB1 transcription could be deregulated by NKX2-1-mediated p53 aberration. Mechanistic studies indicated that LKB1 was directly upregulated by p53 and that NKX2-1-mediated p53 expression may positively regulate LKB1 expression in p53 wild-type cells. However, in p53-mutated cells, LKB1 transcription was deregulated by NKX2-1 via suppression of SP1 binding onto the LKB1 promoter. Therefore, the action of the NKX2-1/p53 pathway on LKB1 loss differed in p53 wild-type versus p53-mutated cells. As expected, soft-agar growth and invasion capability was significantly reduced by ectopic expression of NKX2-1 in p53 wild-type cells, but it was markedly elevated by silencing NKX2-1 in p53-mutated cells. Similar reciprocal observations were also seen in lung tumors from lung adenocarcinoma patients with either wild-type or mutated p53 tumors. Cox regression analysis showed that patients with low-LKB1 tumors had poorer overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) when compared with patients with high-LKB1 tumors. In p53 wild-type patients, shorter OS and RFS periods were predicted for low-NKX2-1/low-LKB1 tumors than for high-NKX2-1/high-LKB1 tumors. In patients with p53-mutated tumors, poorer OS and RFS were predicted for high-NKX2-1/low-LKB1 tumors than for low-NKX2-1/high-LKB1 tumors. In summary, losses of LKB1 at the transcriptional level by altered activity of the NKX2-1/p53 pathway may promote tumor malignancy and poor patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1964817567,"Genetic lesions and other regulatory events lead to silencing of the 13q14 locus in a majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. This locus encodes a pair of critical proapoptotic microRNAs, miR-15a/16-1. Decreased levels of miR-15a/16-1 are critical for the increased survival exhibited by CLL cells. Similarly, in a de novo murine model of CLL, the NZB strain, germline-encoded regulation of the syntenic region resulted in decreased miR-15a/16-1. In this paper, we have identified additional molecular mechanisms regulating miR-15a/16-1 levels and have shown that the transcription factor BSAP (B-cell-specific activator protein) directly interacts with Dleu2, the host gene containing the miR-15a/16-1 loci, and by negative regulation of the Dleu2 promoter, results in repression of miR-15a/16-1 expression. CLL patient B-cell expression levels of BSAP were increased compared with control sources of B cells. With the use of small interfering RNA-mediated repression, the levels of BSAP were decreased in vitro in the NZB-derived malignant B-1 cell line, LNC, and in ex vivo CLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). BSAP knockdown led to an increase in the expression of miR-15a/16-1 and an increase in apoptosis, and a cell cycle arrest in both the cell line and patient PBMCs. Moreover, using Dleu2 promoter analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we have shown that BSAP directly interacts with the Dleu2 promoter. Derepression of the Dleu2 promoter via inhibition of histone deacetylation combined with BSAP knockdown increased miR-15a/16-1 expression, and also increased malignant B-cell death. In summary, therapy targeting enhanced host gene Dleu2 transcription may augment CLL therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1983160807,"Paramyxovirus genomes are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes consisting of nucleoprotein (N)-encapsidated viral RNA. Measles virus (MeV) N features an amino-terminal RNA-binding core and a 125-residue tail domain, of which only the last 75 residues are considered fully mobile on the nucleocapsid surface. A molecular recognition element (MoRE) domain mediates binding of the viral phosphoprotein (P). This P N-tail interaction is considered instrumental for recruiting the polymerase complex to the template. We have engineered MeV N variants with tail truncations progressively eliminating the MoRE domain and upstream tail sections. Confirming previous reports, RNPs with N truncations lacking the carboxyl-terminal 43-residues harboring the MoRE domain cannot serve as polymerase template. Remarkably, further removal of all tail residues predicted to be surface-exposed significantly restores RNP bioactivity. Insertion of structurally dominant tags into the central N-tail section reduces bioactivity, but the negative regulatory effect of exposed N-tail stems is sequence-independent. Bioactive nucleocapsids lacking exposed N-tail sections are unable to sustain virus replication, because of weakened interaction of the advancing polymerase complex with the template. Deletion of the N-MoRE-binding domain in P abrogates polymerase recruitment to standard nucleocapsids, but polymerase activity is partially restored when N-tail truncated RNPs serve as template. Revising central elements of the current replication model, these data reveal that MeV polymerase is capable of productively docking directly to the nucleocapsid core. Dispensable for polymerase recruitment, N-MoRE binding to P-tail stabilizes the advancing polymerase-RNP complex and may rearrange unstructured central tail sections to facilitate polymerase access to the template."
https://openalex.org/W2112415599,"The RAS protooncogene has a central role in regulation of cell proliferation, and point mutations leading to oncogenic activation of Ras occur in a large number of human cancers. Silencing of tumor-suppressor genes by DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is essential for oncogenic cellular transformation by Ras, and Dnmt1 is overexpressed in numerous human cancers. Here we provide new evidence that the pleiotropic regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family member RGS6 suppresses Ras-induced cellular transformation by facilitating Tip60-mediated degradation of Dmnt1 and promoting apoptosis. Employing mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and RGS6(-/-) mice, we found that oncogenic Ras induced upregulation of RGS6, which in turn blocked Ras-induced cellular transformation. RGS6 functions to suppress cellular transformation in response to oncogenic Ras by downregulating Dnmt1 protein expression leading to inhibition of Dnmt1-mediated anti-apoptotic activity. Further experiments showed that RGS6 functions as a scaffolding protein for both Dnmt1 and Tip60 and is required for Tip60-mediated acetylation of Dnmt1 and subsequent Dnmt1 ubiquitylation and degradation. The RGS domain of RGS6, known only for its GTPase-activating protein activity toward Gα subunits, was sufficient to mediate Tip60 association with RGS6. This work demonstrates a novel signaling action for RGS6 in negative regulation of oncogene-induced transformation and provides new insights into our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Ras-induced oncogenic transformation and regulation of Dnmt1 expression. Importantly, these findings identify RGS6 as an essential cellular defender against oncogenic stress and a potential therapeutic target for developing new cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2614508755,"Dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways can lead to colon cancer. However, research on the key signaling effectors or regulators in colon carcinogenesis is limited. Casein kinase-2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1; also known as PLEKHO1) is crucial during adult bone formation and is a promising drug target for osteoporosis therapy. In this study, we observed that CKIP-1 was downregulated in human colon cancer tissues and colon cancer cell lines, and this result was correlated with colon cancer progression. CKIP-1 silencing in colon cancers involved promoter methylation. In colon cancer HCT116 and SW480 cells, CKIP-1 overexpression inhibited cell growth and migration. CKIP-1 also suppressed in-vivo tumor formation. Notably, the growth-suppressive role of CKIP-1 was dependent on the downregulation of the cell cycle-regulated oncogene Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor-1 (Smurf1). During cell cycle progression, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased Smurf1 production by an mTOR-dependent translational control mechanism. Rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduced Smurf1 protein levels, and Smurf1 was degraded in mitosis. In colon cancer, CKIP-1 controlled Smurf1 expression by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and enhancing Smurf1 autodegradation, and CKIP-1 downregulation was correlated with Smurf1 upregulation in colon carcinogenesis. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms of the candidate tumor suppressor CKIP-1."
https://openalex.org/W4255839061,"We built an in-house oligonucleotide array on which 394 genes were selected based on our Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) data and previously reported array data and listed several genes related to cancer progression. Among these, we focused on SEC11A, which encodes the SPC18 protein. SEC11A mRNA expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) in gastric cancer (GC) tissue samples. Expression and distribution of SPC18 protein were investigated by immunohistochemical analysis in two independent GC cohorts (Hiroshima cohort, n=99 and Chiba cohort, n=989). To determine the effect of SPC18 on cell viability and invasiveness in vitro, MTT and Boyden chamber invasion assays were performed. To evaluate the influence of SPC18 on cell growth in vivo, GC cells were injected into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Levels of TGF-α and EGF in media from the GC cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Studies in human tissue revealed overexpression of SEC11A mRNA in 40% of 42 GC samples by qRT–PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis of SPC18 revealed that 26 and 20% of GC cases were SPC18-positive in the Hiroshima and Chiba cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, the Kaplan–Meier analysis showed poorer survival in SPC18-positive GC cases than in SPC18-negative GC cases. Forced expression of SPC18 activates GC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The levels of TGF-α in culture media from GC cells were reduced by knockdown of SPC18. These results indicate that SPC18 contributes to malignant progression through promotion of TGF-α secretion in GC."

Here we report biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of the interaction between DOT1L and MLL fusion proteins, AF9/ENL. The AF9/ENL-binding site in human DOT1L was mapped, and the interaction site was identified to a 10-amino acid region (DOT1L865–874). This region is highly conserved in DOT1L from a variety of species. Alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis shows that four conserved hydrophobic residues from the identified binding motif are essential for the interactions with AF9/ENL.

https://openalex.org/W2054145940,"The Ewing sarcoma (ES) EWS-FLI1 chimeric oncoprotein is a prototypic aberrant ETS transcription factor with activating and repressive regulatory functions. We report that EWS-FLI1-repressed promoters are enriched in forkhead box (FOX) recognition motifs, and identify FOXO1 as a EWS-FLI1-suppressed regulator orchestrating a major subset of EWS-FLI1-repressed genes. In addition to FOXO1 regulation by direct promoter binding of EWS-FLI1, its subcellular localization and activity is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation downstream of EWS-FLI1. Restoration of nuclear FOXO1 expression in ES cells impaired proliferation and significantly reduced clonogenicity. Gene-expression profiling revealed a significant overlap between EWS-FLI1-repressed and FOXO1-activated genes. As a proof of principle for a potential therapeutic application of our findings, the treatment of ES cell lines with methylseleninic acid (MSA) reactivated endogenous FOXO1 in the presence of EWS-FLI1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced massive cell death dependent on FOXO1. In an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, MSA increased FOXO1 expression in the tumor paralleled by a significant decrease in ES tumor growth. FOXO1 reactivation by small molecules may therefore serve as a promising strategy for a future ES-specific therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020470870,"Modular signal receptors empower organisms to process environmental stimuli into adequate physiological responses. At the molecular level, a sensor module receives signals and processes the inherent information into changes of biological activity of an effector module. To better understand the molecular bases underpinning these processes, we analyzed signal reception and processing in the dimeric light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) blue light receptor YF1 that serves as a paradigm for the widespread Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) signal receptors. Random mutagenesis identifies numerous YF1 variants in which biological activity is retained but where light regulation is abolished or inverted. One group of variants carries mutations within the LOV photosensor that disrupt proper coupling of the flavin-nucleotide chromophore to the protein scaffold. Another larger group bears mutations that cluster at the dyad interface and disrupt signal transmission to two coaxial coiled-coils that connect to the effector. Sequence covariation implies wide conservation of structural and mechanistic motifs, as also borne out by comparison to several PAS domains in which mutations leading to disruption of signal transduction consistently map to confined regions broadly equivalent to those identified in YF1. Not only do these data provide insight into general mechanisms of signal transduction, but also they establish concrete means for customized reprogramming of signal receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2102079751,"Functional smooth muscle engineering requires isolation and expansion of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and this process is particularly challenging for visceral smooth muscle tissue where progenitor cells have not been clearly identified. Herein we showed for the first time that efficient SMCs can be obtained from human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs). Clonal lines were generated from c-kit(+) hAFSCs. Differentiation toward SM lineage (SMhAFSCs) was obtained using a medium conditioned by PDGF-BB and TGF-β1. Molecular assays revealed higher level of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), desmin, calponin, and smoothelin in SMhAFSCs when compared to hAFSCs. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that SMhAFSCs also presented in the cytoplasm increased intermediate filaments, dense bodies, and glycogen deposits like SMCs. SMhAFSC metabolism evaluated via mass spectrometry showed higher glucose oxidation and an enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli in comparison to hAFSCs. Patch clamp of transduced hAFSCs with lentiviral vectors encoding ZsGreen under the control of the α-SMA promoter was performed demonstrating that SMhAFSCs retained a smooth muscle cell-like electrophysiological fingerprint. Eventually SMhAFSCs contractility was evident both at single cell level and on a collagen gel. In conclusion, we showed here that hAFSCs under selective culture conditions are able to give rise to functional SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2027130619,"Mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene are found in a high proportion of human prostate cancers, and in mice, Pten deletion induces high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). However, progression from HGPIN to invasive cancer occurs slowly, suggesting that tumorigenesis is subject to restraint. We show that Pten deletion, or constitutive activation of the downstream kinase AKT, activates the transforming growth factor (TGF)β pathway in prostate epithelial cells. TGFβ signaling is known to have a tumor suppressive role in many cancer types, and reduced expression of TGFβ receptors correlates with advanced human prostate cancer. We demonstrate that in combination either with loss of Pten or expression of constitutively active AKT1, inactivation of TGFβ signaling by deletion of the TGFβ type II receptor gene relieves a restraint on tumorigenesis. This results in rapid progession to lethal prostate cancer, including metastasis to lymph node and lung. In prostate epithelium, inactivation of TGFβ signaling alone is insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis, but greatly accelerates cancer progression. The activation of TGFβ signaling by Pten loss or AKT activation suggests that the same signaling events that have key roles in tumor initiation also induce the activity of a pathway that restrains disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2119171542,"Large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are highly expressed in airway smooth muscle (ASM). Utilizing the ovalbumin (OVA) and house dust mite (HDM) models of asthma in C57BL/6 mice, we demonstrate that systemic administration of the BK channel agonist rottlerin (5 μg/g) during the challenge period reduced methacholine-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in OVA- and HDM-sensitized mice (47% decrease in peak airway resistance in OVA-asthma animals, P<0.01; 54% decrease in HDM-asthma animals, P<0.01) with a 35-40% reduction in inflammatory cells and 20-35% reduction in Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intravenous rottlerin (5 μg/g) reduced AHR within 5 min in the OVA-asthma mice by 45% (P<0.01). With the use of an ex vivo lung slice technique, rottlerin relaxed acetylcholine-stimulated murine airway lumen area to 87 ± 4% of the precontracted area (P<0.01 vs. DMSO control). Rottlerin increased BK channel activity in human ASM cells (V50 shifted by 73.5±13.5 and 71.8±14.6 mV in control and asthmatic cells, respectively, both P<0.05 as compared with pretreatment) and reduced the frequency of acetylcholine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in murine ex vivo lung slices. These findings suggest that rottlerin, with both anti-inflammatory and ASM relaxation properties, may have benefit in treating asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1983211580,"X-ray structural and mutational analyses have shown that bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) pumps protons electrostatically through a hydrogen bond network using net positive charges created upon oxidation of a heme iron (located near the hydrogen bond network) for O2 reduction. Pumping protons are transferred by mobile water molecules from the negative side of the mitochondrial inner membrane through a water channel into the hydrogen bond network. For blockage of spontaneous proton back-leak, the water channel is closed upon O2 binding to the second heme (heme a3) after complete collection of the pumping protons in the hydrogen bond network. For elucidation of the structural bases for the mechanism of the proton collection and timely closure of the water channel, conformational dynamics after photolysis of CO (an O2 analog)-bound CcO was examined using a newly developed time-resolved infrared system feasible for accurate detection of a single C=O stretch band of α-helices of CcO in H2O medium. The present results indicate that migration of CO from heme a3 to CuB in the O2 reduction site induces an intermediate state in which a bulge conformation at Ser-382 in a transmembrane helix is eliminated to open the water channel. The structural changes suggest that, using a conformational relay system, including CuB, O2, heme a3, and two helix turns extending to Ser-382, CuB induces the conformational changes of the water channel that stimulate the proton collection, and senses complete proton loading into the hydrogen bond network to trigger the timely channel closure by O2 transfer from CuB to heme a3."

Recent studies have revealed a significant number of molecular signaling components that are essential mediators of eyelid development. Receptor-mediated sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling is known to influence diverse biological processes, but its involvement in eyelid development has not been reported. Here, we show that two S1P receptors, S1P2 and S1P3, are collectively essential mediators of eyelid closure during murine development. Homozygous deletion of the gene encoding either receptor has no apparent effect on eyelid development, but double-null embryos are born with an ""eyes open at birth"" defect due to a delay in epithelial sheet extension. Both receptors are expressed in the advancing epithelial sheet during the critical period of extension. Fibroblasts derived from double-null embryos have a deficient response to epidermal growth factor, suggesting that S1P2 and S1P3 modulate this essential signaling pathway during eyelid closure."

Our understanding about the function of CblA is derived primarily from biochemical studies on MeaB, which belongs to the G3E family of SIMIBI phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) G-proteins (14.Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Classification and evolution of P-loop GTPases and related ATPases.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Google Scholar). Several members of this family of NTPases serve as metallochaperones. These include CooC, HypB, and UreG, accessory proteins involved in the maturation of nickel-containing enzymes. CooC is a Ni2+-binding ATPase that undergoes metal- and nucleotide-dependent dimerization and catalyzes the insertion of nickel into carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (15.Jeon W.B. Cheng J. Ludden P.W. Purification and characterization of membrane-associated CooC protein and its functional role in the insertion of nickel into carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum.J. Biol.

Van Beeumen J. Turano P. Dikiy A. Bryant D.A. Ciurli S. UreG, a chaperone in the urease assembly process, is an intrinsically unstructured GTPase that specifically binds Zn2+.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4684-4695Google Scholar). HypB is activated by GTP-dependent dimerization and is needed for nickel insertion into the [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase (17.Rey L. Imperial J. Palacios J.M.

Some metallochaperones bind the transition metal and transfer it directly to the target protein, whereas others facilitate metal insertion but do not directly bind the cofactor. MeaB is an example of the latter class as it gates the transfer of AdoCbl from adenosyltransferase (ATR) to MCM (3.Padovani D. Banerjee R.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21567-21572Google Scholar) but does not itself bind the metal-containing cofactor. GTP hydrolysis by MeaB is required for transfer of AdoCbl from ATR to MCM. Most G-proteins including the G3E GTPases are predicted to signal via conserved sequence motifs known as switch I and switch II (18.Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z.

Switch I and switch II function as loaded springs that interact with the Mg2+ ion in the GTPase site and signal to target proteins by undergoing conformational changes in response to nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and exchange. In G3E G-proteins, the EXXG peptide defines the minimal consensus sequence for the switch II region (14.Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Classification and evolution of P-loop GTPases and related ATPases.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Google Scholar). The switch I sequence is not strongly conserved with the exception of the nearly ubiquitously present threonine and glutamate residues in Ras-like GTPases (23.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants.Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Google Scholar). The γ-phosphate of GTP makes direct hydrogen bonding contacts with the main-chain amides of the conserved threonine and glycine residues in the switch I and II sequences, respectively. The carboxylate of the switch II glutamate residue forms a water-mediated contact with the Mg2+ ion that is also coordinated by the β- and γ-phosphate oxygen atoms. In Ras proteins, the water molecule that serves as a nucleophile in the GTPase reaction is activated via interaction with a conserved glutamine residue in the switch II consensus motif, DXXGQ.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27492-27502Google Scholar). However, the corresponding aspartate in MeaB, Asp-92, is not positioned for catalysis. It is displaced 11–14 Å from the active site in all reported structures (27.Hubbard P.A. Padovani D. Labunska T. Mahlstedt S.A. Banerjee R. Drennan C.L.

Koutmos M. Banerjee R. A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 535-539Google Scholar). CblA and MeaB comprise seven central and parallel-stranded β-sheets in the G-domain and flanking N- and C-terminal α-helical extensions (27.Hubbard P.A. Padovani D. Labunska T. Mahlstedt S.A. Banerjee R. Drennan C.L. Crystal structure and mutagenesis of the metallochaperone MeaB: insight into the causes of methylmalonic aciduria.J. Biol.

The C-terminal extension forms a dimerization arm. In addition to the switch I (residues 92–108) and switch II (residues 154–162) loops, two other signature G-protein motifs are present in MeaB: the P-loop and the base specificity loop that extend between residues 62 and 70 and residues 200 and 204, respectively. The P-loop has a GXXGXGKST consensus sequence that interacts with the phosphate moiety of nucleotides. The switch II motif in MeaB-like GTPases has the following consensus sequence: ETVGVGQSE. In a subset of SIMIBI G-proteins, GTP-dependent conformational changes in the switch regions expose dimerization surfaces that are essential for their biological function (30.Chan K.H. Li T. Wong C.O. Wong K.B. Structural basis for GTP-dependent dimerization of hydrogenase maturation factor HypB.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e30547Google Scholar). In Ras-like GTPases, GTP hydrolysis elicits a conformational change in the switch I region that exposes an effector domain involved in recognition of downstream target proteins (22.Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Structure-function relationships of the G domain, a canonical switch motif.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 943-971Google Scholar). In the G3E G-proteins, the functions of switch I and switch II motifs in the context of their metallochaperone functions have not been addressed. In MeaB, an additional conformationally dynamic region, switch III, plays a critical role in bidirectional signal transduction with MCM (28.Lofgren M. Padovani D. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 535-539Google Scholar). Although unrelated at a primary sequence level, the switch III region in the Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins is used for signal transmission (31.Li Q. Cerione R.A. Communication between switch II and switch III of the transducin α subunit is essential for target activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Google Scholar, 32.Warner D.R. Gejman P.V.

MeaB exhibits similar affinities for GTP and GDP and is expected to be predominantly GTP-loaded in the cell (2.Padovani D. Banerjee R. Assembly and protection of the radical enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, by its chaperone.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Google Scholar). The MeaB·GTP complex prevents assembly of the MCM active site with inactive precursors of AdoCbl (3.Padovani D. Banerjee R. A G-protein editor gates coenzyme B12 loading and is corrupted in methylmalonic aciduria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21567-21572Google Scholar). Comparison of the apo, GDP-, and GMPPNP-bound structures of MeaB with other G3E family members suggests that switch I and switch II are not in their catalytically active conformations (Fig. 1). The association of MeaB with MCM results in an ∼100-fold rate enhancement of the GTPase reaction and increases the affinity for GTP (4.Padovani D. Labunska T. Banerjee R. Energetics of interaction between the G-protein chaperone, MeaB, and B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Google Scholar). Thus, MCM functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for MeaB. Although other G3E subfamily proteins exhibit low intrinsic GTPase activity, GAP activators have not been reported for them to the best of our knowledge. Two models for GAP activation of MeaB by MCM that are not mutually exclusive include: (i) contribution in trans of one or more catalytic residues by MCM to the active site of MeaB and (ii) induction of a conformational change in the MeaB·MCM complex that brings the active site residues of MeaB into catalytic register (35.Scrima A. Thomas C. Deaconescu D. Wittinghofer A. The Rap-RapGAP complex: GTP hydrolysis without catalytic glutamine and arginine residues.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1145-1153Google Scholar, 36.Seewald M.J. Körner C. Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. RanGAP mediates GTP hydrolysis without an arginine finger.Nature. 2002; 415: 662-666Google Scholar). In addition to gating the transfer of AdoCbl from ATR to MCM, MeaB also functions to protect MCM from inactivation during catalytic turnover and to rescue MCM that is inactivated (2.Padovani D. Banerjee R. Assembly and protection of the radical enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, by its chaperone.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Google Scholar, 3.Padovani D. Banerjee R. A G-protein editor gates coenzyme B12 loading and is corrupted in methylmalonic aciduria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21567-21572Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of either GDP or GTP, MeaB slows the rate of MCM inactivation by 30-fold (28.Lofgren M. Padovani D. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 535-539Google Scholar), and the exchange of GDP for GTP drives the ejection of inactive cofactor from the active site of MCM. The limited biochemical studies support a role for CblA that is analogous to the better characterized bacterial MeaB in protecting MCM from inactivation and rescuing inactive MCM (37.Takahashi-Íñiguez T. García-Arellano H. Trujillo-Roldán M.A. Flores M.E. Protection and reactivation of human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by MMAA protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 404: 443-447Google Scholar). Furthermore, human MCM also exhibits GAP activity with respect to CblA (29.Froese D.S. Kochan G. Muniz J.R. Wu X. Gileadi C. Ugochukwu E. Krysztofinska E. Gravel R.A. Oppermann U. Yue W.W. Structures of the human GTPase MMAA and vitamin B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and insight into their complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38204-38213Google Scholar). In this study, we interrogated the role of the switch II motif in mediating the chaperone functions of MeaB and in transmitting the GAP function of MCM. To this end, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis at positions in switch II that are conserved between MeaB and CblA. We demonstrate that switch II mutations compromise regulation of AdoCbl transfer from ATR to the MCM·MeaB complex, reduce protection of MCM from inactivation during turnover, and impair ejection of inactive cofactor from the active site of MCM. Remarkably, a subset of switch II mutations enhances the intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB while disrupting MCM-dependent GAP activation. We also report the structure of MeaB crystallized in the presence of GDP and AlFx−. Our results suggest a strategy for switch II-dependent autoinhibition of the intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB, which exists predominantly in an inactive conformation. Complexation with MCM is predicted to stabilize MeaB in a conformation in which its GTPase function is activated. AdoCbl, GMPPNP, ATP, GTP, methylmalonic acid, coenzyme A, and other reagent grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Aldrich. Methylmalonyl-CoA was synthesized using malonyl-CoA synthetase and purified as described previously (38.Padovani D. Banerjee R. Alternative pathways for radical dissipation in an active site mutant of B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2951-2959Google Scholar). The HPLC column used to quantify guanosine nucleotides was a μBondapakTM NH2 10-μm, 125 Å, 3.9 × 300-mm column purchased from Waters. Plasmids encoding the M. extorquens ATR and MCM were generous gifts from Mary E. Lidstrom (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). A synthetic gene encoding M. extorquens AM1 MeaB with 5′-NcoI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites was generated by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ) to optimize codon usage in Escherichia coli and reduce the GC content. The synthetic MeaB gene was cloned into the pET-21d(+) expression vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) using the NcoI and XhoI sites. Site-specific mutants of MeaB were generated using a QuikChange kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following forward primers were used to generate the mutants, and the reverse primers had the complimentary sequences: E154A, 5′-CGATGTCATTCTGGTGGCAACCGTTGGCGTCGGTCAGAGCG-3′; T155A, 5′-CGATGTCATTCTGGTGGCAAGCCGTTGTTGGCGTCGGTCAGAGCG-3′;Q160A, 5′-GGAAACCGTTGGCGTCGGTGCGAGCGAAACCGCCGTTGC-3′; S161A, 5′-GGAAACCGTTGGCGTCGGTCAGGCCGAAACCGCCGTTGGCAG-3′; E162A, 5′-CCGTTGGCGTCGGTCAGAGCGCAACCGCCGTTGGCAGATCTG-3′; Q160A/E162A, 5′-GGAAACGTTGGCGTCGGTGCGAGCGCAACCGCCGTTGCAGATCTG-3′. Following sequence confirmation, the Q160A plasmid and E162A primer pair were used to generate the Q160A/E162A double mutant. Recombinant M. extorquens MeaB, MCM, and ATR were expressed and purified from E. coli BL-21(DE3) as described previously (4.Padovani D. Labunska T. Banerjee R.

Loss of allostery and coenzyme B12 delivery by a pathogenic mutation in adenosyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5790-5798Google Scholar). The purified enzymes were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 containing 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol (Buffer A). Protein samples were concentrated to 11 mg ml−1 in 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm GDP-AlFx−. GDP-AlFx− was prepared by mixing GDP, AlCl3, and potassium fluoride at a 1:5:15 ratio and used after gel filtration. The MeaB·GDP crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution, which contained 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 m sodium sulfate. Crystals were cryoprotected for a few minutes before being flash frozen in liquid N2 by transfer to a solution of 20% glycerol, 15% PEG 3350 (w/v), 0.15 m sodium sulfate, 5 mm GDP, and 1 mm AlFx− in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals of MeaB·GDP were of space group P21 (a = 63.7, b = 78.6, c = 69.6, β = 108.6) with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data for MeaB·GDP crystallized in the presence of AlFx− were collected at 100 K on beamline GM/CA-CAT 23-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Data were recorded on a Mar300 detector and processed with XDS (40.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Google Scholar) to 1.8-Å resolution (Table 1).
