The species is characterized by small (3.1 by 2.6 micro) operculate spores without projections. Infections are first seen in late winter, and mortality reaches its peak in early June."

https://openalex.org/W2062018221,"Plasmatic fusion in both plant and animal fertilization seems to start with the coalescence of cell membranes of the gametes. In male gametes, the area of fusion is predetermined: in some algae it is the flagellar tip, while in animal organisms it is the acrosome filament. These organelles thus fulfill comparable roles in the mechanism of fertilization."

Very young animals and wounded animals are especially vulnerable. Effective predation is directly related to the concentration of Dileptus to which the victim is exposed."

https://openalex.org/W1978200699,"W EHEN CHARLES DARWIN pointed out the role that natural selection of certain genetic types has played in the evolution of animal and plant species, it was soon realized that modern man may be subjected to similar selective influences. As a result, two slightly different considerations were advanced, each complementary to the other. One dealt with the changes in natural selection that civilization has brought about. Darwin had stressed the ruthless struggle, in which the genetically less fit has a poorer chance of reproducing his kind than the more fit. Did not civilization reduce or eliminate this selection against the less fit by improving his chance of reproduction through charitable care, or artificial remedies ? Had not an ominous situation been created which would lead to an increase in undesirable genetic constitutions? But to counteract this pessimistic view another possibility fired the imagination toward hopeful perspectives. Could not man take the genetic fate of the species into his own hands ? Could he not be more efficient and successful than nature, and by the use of his knowledge improve the genetic qualities of future generations? Francis Galton coined the word eugenics to cover the whole -study of agencies under social control that may improve or impair the racial [meaning hereditary] qualities of future generations, either physically or mentally. In accordance with its two aspects, the field of eugenics has often been subdivided into two branches, called negative and positive eugenics. The first is concerned with combating the increase or the presence of alleles or of genie combinations producing undesirable phenotypes, the second with furthering the increase of alleles or combinations causing desirable phenotypes, or at least guarding against the decrease of such genotypes. The facts that eugenists use as a basis for the dis-"

This peak is, however, very small at this stage and is therefore normally obscured by diffusion. With time it develops and finally becomes predominant. Whether the three peaks are resolved depends on how rapid diffusion is compared to electrophoretic migration. If diffusion permits good resolution of the two initial peaks, the third one becomes visible between them and gradually absorbs them. If diffusion is too rapid to permit resolution, the shape of the single visible peak changes from a regular gaussian form due to ordinary diffusion alone through a complicated distortion to another regular gaussian due to combined electrodiffusion and diffusion (2; 8)."

Lethal dosages were also determined. Light was the conditioned stimulus, and electric shock the unconditioned stimulus. Responses were forward darting and backward swimming movements accompanied by increased gill movement. Acquisition of conditioned responses was suppressed by higher dose levels."

I press it upon your attention the more willingly because teachers and professional men generally are given to overlooking the importance of its precept. An engineering school has a hard duty, for it must teach science and business, humanity and common sense, and withal it must give its students professional ideals. The present is a period of discussion and adjustment of the relationships of engineering courses to the preparatory schools and to the so-called liberal college courses. Various of our universities are setting up requirements for entrance into their engineering courses which include a part of the subjects leading more particularly to the bachelor of arts degree; and one of our greatest universities has made the possession of a bachelor of arts or equivalent degree the prime requirement of entrance into the studies of its engineering school, and has called its school a graduate school of engineering. The adopted name for that school seems to me a misnomer, for the major portion of its teach-"
