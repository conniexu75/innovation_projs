This was the first demonstration of a natural vector of any monkey malaria."

https://openalex.org/W191929154,"The interconversion of progesterone and 4-pregnen2Oc+olS-one is catalyzed by an enzyme preparation obtained from rat ovarian tissue (1, 2). Included among the properties of a crude preparation of the requisite 20cr-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was its utilization of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and, to a lesser extent, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide for the reduction of progesterone. It has been proposed (3) that hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase possessing dual nucleotide specificity may function metabolically as pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, and as a consequence, regulate reversible transfer of hydrogen between reduced triphosphopyridine ‘nucleotide and diphosphopyridine nucleotide, the steroid functioning as a coenzymic hydrogen carrier. A necessary requirement for the application of this hypothesis to the hormone action of progesterone is that the 20a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, or some other similar enzyme required for the metabolism of the hormone, should also exhibit transhydrogenase activity. This paper reports the absence of such activity from preparations of rat ovary 2Oar-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and demonstrates that this lack of transhydrogenase activity stems from the single pyridine nucleotide requirement of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1966627492,"IN crustaceans the hepatopancreas is the main organ of enzyme production. In isopods this organ consists of two types of cells which differ in size and were first distinguished by Weber1. This author observed in the smaller cells dense clumps of yellowish granules which became the subject of some controversy. Weber thought these granules to be ‘enzymogens’, a contention which was denied by Frenzel2. Patrick3 held the granules to represent mucin or mucigens since they could be stained—so she claimed—only with mucin stains. Patane4, on the other hand, found the granule in question to be untouched by mucin-specific histological techniques and he considered them as catabolic products since they gave reactions characteristic of purine bases."

https://openalex.org/W1966863416,"CARBOXYPEPTIDASE is a metallo-enzyme which contains zinc. It has been reported by Coleman and Vallee1 that the enzyme can be de-activated by removal of zinc and that activity can be restored by the addition of zinc, cobaltous, ferrous, nickel and manganous ions but not by addition of cadmium, magnesium or calcium ions. This metallo-enzyme therefore falls in the group of enzymes which have no specific metal requirement for activity2. In biological systems, however, a particular metal, zinc, is associated with the enzyme presumably because complex ion equilibria favour this particular association over all others. The situation is not very different from that found in the case of the enzyme enolase, where magnesium and manganous are the particular ions associated with activity in the biological system, but where other cations such as zinc can activate the enzyme in vitro 3. The apparent stability constants for the association of zinc and cobaltous ions with carboxypeptidase are 2 × 108 and 1 × 106 respectively1. The pH range of activation by the different cations indicates that association with the active centre is in the order zinc (II) > nickel(II) and cobalt (II). The study of complexes of a wide variety of simple organic ligands has shown2 that this stability sequence is observed only when one of the co-ordinating centres is sulphide, R—S −. I conclude that zinc is bound by a sulphide group in carboxypeptidase and give the following additional evidence in support of this binding."

This terminology, introduced by Linderstrøm-Lang in his Lane Memorial Lectures1, served well in the few years since it was invented, and has thoroughly permeated the literature. Developments since that time have lessened its usefulness. Arguments to demonstrate this, and suggestions for a more useful general terminology, are the substance of this communication."

Commercially modified corn starches produced the same weight gain as normal corn starch during 21 days of feeding. In contrast to commercial starches, a very highly oxidized laboratory-prepared starch produced a lower weight gain during the same period."
https://openalex.org/W2040116448,"THE precise manner in which margination and emigration of leucocytes occur in acute inflammation has not been elucidated despite numerous careful studies with the light microscope. Utilizing electron microscopy we have observed the emigration of leucocytes from capillaries in areas of acute inflammation in dog pancreas. Capillary endothelial cells react to injury by forming intra-lumenal finger-like projections of cytoplasm. These projections insinuate themselves around, and envelop, adjacent leucocytes, and, in this manner, draw the latter into the capillary wall (Fig. 1). This intramural localization of leucocytes is equivalent to ‘margination’ as seen by light microscopy and would appear to occur by a process similar to that of phagocytosis. The leucocytes are then extruded through the antiluminal border of the endothelial cell where they are separated from the extravascular space only by the basement membrane of the endothelial cell. After separation of leucocyte and endothelial cell by as much as 300 A., new basement membrane forms between them and is continuous with the old. Simultaneously old basement membrane adjacent to the leucocyte becomes smudged and frayed and gradually melts away, releasing the leucocyte into the extravascular space."

The lipid content was found to vary from 18 to 73 percent of dry weight for cultures of different age and method of analysis. The pigments of the nonsaponifiable fraction were separated by adsorption chromatography and counter-current extraction and tentatively identified. The fatty acid fraction was converted to the corresponding methyl esters and analyzed by gas chromatography. The principal fatty acids present were: palmitic, oleic, and linolenic acids. Traces were detected of caprylic, capric, lauric, and palmitoleic acids."

When the hæmolysate is added to serum in tubes at 37° C., precipitation continues for several days. In agar-gel, using a double diffusion technique, a well-marked precipitate band is formed (Fig. 1). Peetoom et al. 1 described a precipitate of this type in agar-gel, but only minimal precipitation in fluid media. In spite of antigenic differences between adult and fœtal hæmoglobins2, serum and hæmolysate from adult and umbilical cord blood form precipitates in agar-gel, which are qualitatively the same. Cross-precipitation also occurs between human and some animal sera and hæmolysates. As the reaction is of general occurrence, it causes false positive results in tests for auto-antibodies when the tissue extract used as antigen contains sufficient lysed erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1981821113,"BY the Haeckelian view of early development, gastrulation by invagination reflects the evolutionary history of primitive Metazoa. It is a corollary of this theory that gastrulation by ingression is a derived form of emboly. Nevertheless ingression, the method of endoderm formation among the lower cnidarians, is probably the more primitive mode of gastrulation, as observed by Metschnikoff1,2, Hyman3,4 and others. The diploblastic level of organization probably arose in early Metazoa by a process resembling ingression, or some other type of delamination, giving rise to solid planula-like forms. It is therefore probable that invagination is merely a developmental expedient, which has arisen secondarily and independently in the more advanced Cnidaria and other metazoan groups."

https://openalex.org/W2028049980,"Recurrent facilitation in the cat's spinal cord has been studied in deep peroneal and quadriceps motoneurons with the use of intracellular recording. The presence of facilitation was indicated by several criteria, among them increased firing index of the cells or decreased latency of firing. In many, but not all, facilitated cells the conditioning volley caused a small visible depolarization. Subthreshold synaptic potentials were frequently increased in magnitude by the conditioning volley, which also increased the effectiveness of a stimulus applied through the microelectrode. Facilitation was found in a large percentage of the motoneurons investigated and was clearly able to bring about pronounced changes in the excitability and firing behavior of these cells."
