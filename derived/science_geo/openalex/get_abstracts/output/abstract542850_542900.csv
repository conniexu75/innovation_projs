https://openalex.org/W1933156045,"Under stress, such as heat shock, the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is shown to accumulate primarily in the 5′ untranslated region of induced mRNAs owing to the translocation of an m6A interacting protein, YTHDF2, into the nucleus, resulting in increased cap-independent translation of these mRNAs, indicating one possible mechanism by which stress-responsive genes can be preferentially expressed. The distribution of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) base modification along mRNAs is uneven — it is under-represented in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) compared to other regions. Shu-Bing Qian and colleagues have found that under a stress such as heat shock, the m6A modification accumulates primarily in the 5′ UTR of induced mRNAs due to the translocation of an m6A interacting protein, YTHDF2, into the nucleus. YTHDF2 blocks the action of the m6A 'eraser' protein FTO, resulting in increased cap-independent translation of these mRNAs. The results indicate one possible mechanism by which stress-responsive genes can be preferentially expressed. The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which has broad roles in RNA biology1,2,3,4,5. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of m6A along mRNAs results in relatively less methylation in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) compared to other regions6,7. However, whether and how 5′UTR methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the 5′UTR in translation initiation, very little is known about whether m6A modification influences mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain adenosines within the 5′UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs are preferentially methylated. We find that the dynamic 5′UTR methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well-characterized m6A ‘reader’. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5′UTR methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m6A ‘eraser’ FTO from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5′UTR methylation in the form of m6A promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 mRNA as an example, we demonstrate that a single m6A modification site in the 5′UTR enables translation initiation independent of the 5′ end N7-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of 5′UTR methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of m6A, but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response."

However, current methods yield ensemble profiles that are insensitive to cell-to-cell variation. Here we combine microfluidics, DNA barcoding and sequencing to collect chromatin data at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate the utility of the technology by assaying thousands of individual cells and using the data to deconvolute a mixture of ES cells, fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors into high-quality chromatin state maps for each cell type. The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of subpopulations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data. Our method for single-cell analysis reveals aspects of epigenetic heterogeneity not captured by transcriptional analysis alone."
https://openalex.org/W2192723508,"Kidney cells and tissues derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) may enable organ regeneration, disease modeling and drug screening. We report an efficient, chemically defined protocol for differentiating hPSCs into multipotent nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) that can form nephron-like structures. By recapitulating metanephric kidney development in vitro, we generate SIX2+ SALL1+ WT1+ PAX2+ NPCs with 90% efficiency within 9 days of differentiation. The NPCs possess the developmental potential of their in vivo counterparts and form PAX8+ LHX1+ renal vesicles that self-organize into nephron structures. In both two- and three-dimensional culture, NPCs form kidney organoids containing epithelial nephron-like structures expressing markers of podocytes, proximal tubules, loops of Henle and distal tubules in an organized, continuous arrangement that resembles the nephron in vivo. We also show that this organoid culture system can be used to study mechanisms of human kidney development and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1897844819,"Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (i.e., non-Hermitian) quantum system: it requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localisation, and dynamical properties. Using a spatially-structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies -- exceptional points. These are known to cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption, and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the nontrivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe the mode switching and topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which can lead to novel functionalities of polariton-based devices."
https://openalex.org/W2173669563,"Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) are ubiquitous ion channels responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) signalling and essential for a broad array of cellular processes ranging from contraction to secretion, and from proliferation to cell death. Despite decades of research on InsP3Rs, a mechanistic understanding of their structure-function relationship is lacking. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, near-atomic (4.7 Å) resolution electron cryomicroscopy structure of the tetrameric mammalian type 1 InsP3R channel in its apo-state. At this resolution, we are able to trace unambiguously ∼85% of the protein backbone, allowing us to identify the structural elements involved in gating and modulation of this 1.3-megadalton channel. Although the central Ca(2+)-conduction pathway is similar to other ion channels, including the closely related ryanodine receptor, the cytosolic carboxy termini are uniquely arranged in a left-handed α-helical bundle, directly interacting with the amino-terminal domains of adjacent subunits. This configuration suggests a molecular mechanism for allosteric regulation of channel gating by intracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W2266690651,"The tetrameric thyroxine transport protein transthyretin (TTR) forms amyloid fibrils upon dissociation and monomer unfolding. The aggregation of transthyretin has been reported as the cause of the life-threatening transthyretin amyloidosis. The standard treatment of familial cases of TTR amyloidosis has been liver transplantation. Although aggregation-preventing strategies involving ligands are known, understanding the mechanism of TTR aggregation can lead to additional inhibition approaches. Several models of TTR amyloid fibrils have been proposed, but the segments that drive aggregation of the protein have remained unknown. Here we identify β-strands F and H as necessary for TTR aggregation. Based on the crystal structures of these segments, we designed two non-natural peptide inhibitors that block aggregation. This work provides the first characterization of peptide inhibitors for TTR aggregation, establishing a novel therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2236823150,"Purified actin filaments depolymerize slowly, and cytosolic conditions strongly favour actin assembly over disassembly, which has left our understanding of how actin filaments are rapidly turned over in vivo incomplete. One mechanism for driving filament disassembly is severing by factors such as Cofilin. However, even after severing, pointed-end depolymerization remains slow and unable to fully account for observed rates of actin filament turnover in vivo. Here we describe a mechanism by which Twinfilin and Cyclase-associated protein work in concert to accelerate depolymerization of actin filaments by 3-fold and 17-fold at their barbed and pointed ends, respectively. This mechanism occurs even under assembly conditions, allowing reconstitution and direct visualization of individual filaments undergoing tunable, accelerated treadmilling. Further, we use specific mutations to demonstrate that this activity is critical for Twinfilin function in vivo. These findings fill a major gap in our knowledge of cellular disassembly mechanisms, and suggest that depolymerization and severing may be deployed separately or together to control the dynamics and architecture of distinct actin networks."

Without stressors, the activity of Nrf2 is inhibited by its interaction with the Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1). Here, we describe (3S)-1-[4-[(2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl) sulfonylamino]-1-naphthyl]pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (RA839), a small molecule that binds noncovalently to the Nrf2-interacting kelch domain of Keap1 with a Kd of ∼6 μm, as demonstrated by x-ray co-crystallization and isothermal titration calorimetry. Whole genome DNA arrays showed that at 10 μm RA839 significantly regulated 105 probe sets in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Canonical pathway mapping of these probe sets revealed an activation of pathways linked with Nrf2 signaling. These pathways were also activated after the activation of Nrf2 by the silencing of Keap1 expression. RA839 regulated only two genes in Nrf2 knock-out macrophages. Similar to the activation of Nrf2 by either silencing of Keap1 expression or by the reactive compound 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester (CDDO-Me), RA839 prevented the induction of both inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release in response to lipopolysaccharides in macrophages.

Nrf2 regulates the expression of several cytoprotective anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory proteins by binding to the cis-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) within gene promoters. Nrf2 itself is regulated by the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is a substrate recognition subunit for a cullin3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase and functions as a sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stress. Structural elements of the Keap1 protein include the C-terminal Nrf2-binding kelch domain, the intervening region, and the broad complex-Tramtrack-Bric-a-Brac domain. Keap1 binds as a dimer via its two Kelch domains to one molecule of Nrf2, specifically to the high affinity ETGE and the low affinity DLG motives at the N terminus of Nrf2. Without stressors, this leads to the ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of the transcription factor. In the presence of oxidative or electrophilic stress, cysteine residues within the intervening region and broad complex-Tramtrack-Bric-a-Brac domain of Keap1 become modified. According to the hinge and latch model, this weakens the interaction between Keap1 and the DLG motif of Nrf2 but does not lead to a release of Nrf2 (6.Tong K.I. Kobayashi A. Katsuoka F. Yamamoto M.

The conformation cycling model postulates a stabilization of the Keap1/Nrf2 interaction by the Keap1 modification, which prevents the release of Nrf2 (8.Baird L. Swift S. Llères D.

Noncovalent inhibitors of Keap1 could be superior to covalent Keap1 binders with respect to toxicity because of their reversible and potentially more selective mode of action (19.Park B.K. Boobis A.

These molecules also possess cellular activity measured by either reporter gene induction or the activation of selected stress response genes that are, however, also regulated by mechanisms in addition to Nrf2. Despite these achievements, it is unknown whether direct inhibition of the Keap1/Nrf2 interaction is indeed able to stimulate Nrf2-dependent gene expression with high selectivity, as well as to exhibit cellular effects similar to those that have been attributed to the covalent Keap1 inhibitors. We therefore set out to search for a small molecule noncovalent binder to the Keap1 kelch domain with Nrf2-dependent biological activity. We identified compound RA839, the characterization of which is described in the present study.

The study was performed under the terms of the German Animal Protection Law, as well as according to international animal welfare legislation and rules and in accordance with the Sanofi Company Charter on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male mice (C57/Bl 6) with a body weight of about 22 g were housed in standard Makrolon cages type III at 22 ± 2 °C and 45–65% humidity under a normal light-dark cycle (light off 1800–0600) for at least 7 days on standard chow (Ssniff R/M) for acclimatization prior to the experiment. Three groups (n = 8)of mice were used for the study. On the study day, the mice were starved for 3 h prior to the start of treatment. As the test compound was metabolically labile, it was tested in the presence of 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a nonspecific total inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. ABT was dissolved in saline and administered at 50 mg/kg per gavage 1 h prior to the administration of RA839. The compound was dissolved in 95% (v/v) hydroxyethyl cellulose (0.5% (w/v))/5% (v/v) solutol and administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 30 mg/kg. Three hours later, the animals were euthanized in deep isoflurane anesthesia by terminal blood collection. Hepatic tissue samples were collected after laparotomy for subsequent RNA isolation. An FP assay was used to measure binding of the human Keap1 kelch domain (amino acids Ala321–Thr609) to a fluorescently labeled peptide containing the Keap1 ETGE binding site of human Nrf2 (Alexa633-AFFAQLQLDEETGEFL; JPT Technologies). 2 μl of test compound in reaction buffer (PBS, 2 mm dl-DTT, 0.015% (v/v) Brij-35) containing 6% (v/v) DMSO were mixed with 2 μl of the Keap1 kelch domain in reaction buffer without DMSO in a black 384-well microtiter plate and incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min. Thereafter, 2 μl of the fluorescently labeled Nrf2 peptide in reaction buffer without DMSO were added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 30 min at ambient temperature. The final concentrations of the Keap1 kelch domain and the fluorescently labeled Nrf2 peptide were 20 and 50 nm, respectively. FP was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 635 and 660 nm, respectively. The sequence of the DLG peptide used for competition was ILWRQDIDLGVSREV. The ARE-luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out as described recently (23.Richter M. Winkel A.F. Schummer D. Gerlitz M. de Hoop M. Brunner B. Glien M. Schmoll D. Pau d'arco activates Nrf2-dependent gene expression via the MEK/ERK-pathway.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2014; 39: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 after an incubation time of 6 h was determined using the PathHunter U2OS Keap1-NRF2 nuclear translocation cell line (DiscoverX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Nrf2-ARE binding activity was determined in nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells using the TransAM Nrf2 kit (Actif Motif) as described (23.Richter M. Winkel A.F. Schummer D. Gerlitz M. de Hoop M. Brunner B. Glien M. Schmoll D. Pau d'arco activates Nrf2-dependent gene expression via the MEK/ERK-pathway.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2014; 39: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The specificity of binding was determined by competition with oligonucleotides that had the sequence of either the wild-type or the mutated ARE motif according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are presented as the difference in the extinction measured in the presence of the noncompeting oligonucleotide and the extinction that was determined in the presence of the competing oligonucleotide. BMDM were generated from total bone marrow of 12-week-old Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice in the C57BL/6J background as described previously (24.Kuchler L. Giegerich A.K. Sha L.K. Knape T. Wong M.S.

Redox Signal. 2014; 21: 2483-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Compounds were prepared as DMSO stock solutions and further diluted in growth medium (RPMI medium (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (PAA Laboratories)). BMDM were incubated with the indicated concentrations of the compounds at a fixed DMSO concentration of 0.2% (v/v). For the gene array studies, the incubation time was 4 h, before RNA was isolated. In the case of the NO release assay, BMDM were preincubated for 1 h in the presence of the compounds before LPS from Escherichia coli (055:B5, Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After 48 h, NO release was measured, and RNA was isolated for gene expression studies. Cell viability was determined by the determination of lactate dehydrogenase release using the Cytotox-ONE assay (Promega). The transfection was performed in growth medium using GeneMute for primary macrophages (SignaGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day post-transfection, the medium was exchanged for fresh medium with or without LPS, and cells were incubated for 48 h before either NO release was determined or RNA was isolated for gene expression studies. The following siRNAs were used: siKeap1-1 (Dharmacon, J-041104-09, target sequence GCGCCAAUGUUGACACGGA), siKeap1-2 (Qiagen, Mm_Keap1_7, target sequence TTCCTGCAACTCGGTGATCAA), and as a control the nonsilencing siControl (sequence UUUCGCGUAUACGCGAAACdTdT). For the detection of NO release, cell supernatants were added to an equal volume of Griess reagent (Sigma). After an incubation of 15 min, the absorbance at 540 nm was determined. The murine Keap1 Kelch-DC (309–624), which has 100% sequence identity within the Keap1 kelch binding site with the human protein, was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography in a final buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm DTT. The protein was concentrated to 5.5 mg/ml. Crystallization experiments were performed by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.9 m lithium sulfate, and 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. For soaking experiments single crystals were transferred into a soaking solution containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.9 m lithium sulfate, 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10% (v/v) DMSO, and 10 mm RA839. After 4 days, crystals were harvested directly from the soaking solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at the Swiss Light Source. Data processing and structure refinement was performed as described (25.Halland N. Brönstrup M. Czech J. Czechtizky W. Evers A. Follmann M. Kohlmann M. Schiell M. Kurz M. Schreuder H.A. Kallus C.

Chem. 2015; 58: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structures factors of the crystal structure were submitted to the Protein Data Bank (code 5CGJ). The N-terminal domain of Nrf2 (1–96) was cloned in pET15, expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified via an N-terminal His tag (7.Tong K.I. Padmanabhan B. Kobayashi A. Shang C. Hirotsu Y. Yokoyama S.

Biol. 2007; 27: 7511-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). 10 μg of the protein were bound to 200 μl of HIS-select HF nickel affinity gel (Sigma) equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C followed by washing twice with binding buffer. The gel was resuspended in 250 μl of binding buffer. 50-μl aliquots of the gel were incubated with 1 μg of recombinant Flag-tagged Keap1 (OriGene) in the presence of 1% DMSO either without RA839 or in the presence of 1, 10, or 100 μm RA839 in a final volume of 70 μl for 5 h at room temperature. As a control, the Nrf2-loaded gel was incubated in the absence of Keap1. In addition, Keap1 was incubated with unloaded affinity gel. The reactions were washed three times with binding buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and loaded on 16% Tris-glycine SDS gels (Invitrogen). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described. The blots were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing they were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig for 1 h. Detection was performed by Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Sigma). Subsequently, the blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody specific for His tag (Cell Signaling Technology). The molecular weights of samples were estimated using the Spectra multicolor marker (Sigma). The interactions of 10 μm RA839 with a panel of 93 receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and protein kinases (supplemental Table S1) were tested by Eurofins Cerep (France). ITC measurements were carried out on a VP-ITC ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described (26.Anderka O. Boyken J. Aschenbach U. Batzer A. Boscheinen O. Schmoll D. Biophysical characterization of the interaction between hepatic glucokinase and its regulatory protein: impact of physiological and pharmacological effectors.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31333-31340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The measuring cell contained 40 μm Keap1 kelch domain protein, and the syringe contained 400 μm ligand in binding buffer (60 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.1). The titrant was either RA839 or the ETGE peptide with the sequence AFFAQLQLDEETGEFL. Blank titrations of ligands into buffer were also performed to correct for heats generated by dilution and mixing. The heat evolved after each injection was obtained from the time integral of the calorimetric signal, and data were fit to a binding model using Origin version 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Reverse transcription and real time PCR were performed as described previously (23.Richter M. Winkel A.F. Schummer D. Gerlitz M. de Hoop M. Brunner B. Glien M. Schmoll D. Pau d'arco activates Nrf2-dependent gene expression via the MEK/ERK-pathway.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2014; 39: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with the following primer sets: Mm00500821-m1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (Nqo1)), Mm00802655-m1 (glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (Gclc)), Mm00497269-m1(Keap1), Mm00440502-m1 (inducible nitric-oxide synthase (Nos2)) Mm00497268_m1 (Keap1), Mm00477784_m1 (Nrf2), and Mm01546394-s1 (Rpl37a). Quantification was performed using the δδCt method with RPL37a as internal standard. Comparative microarray analysis was performed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). Four replicates originating from four different mice were carried out, resulting in four independent microarrays for each individual treatment and control group. Total RNA from mouse macrophages was isolated, and the integrity of RNA samples was controlled by RNA nano assay (Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer). First and second strand cDNA syntheses were performed using SuperScript SSII RT polymerase system (Invitrogen). Biotin-UPT- and -CTP-labeled cRNA was transcribed in vitro using Enzo BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics). 15 μg of cRNA samples were fragmented, added to hybridization buffer, and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip. Microarrays were washed and double-stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate (Molecular Probes), anti-streptavidin antibody, and again streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate and then scanned. Quality control of each chip was performed according the Affymetrix quality criteria, including mean average difference, raw intensity, and 3′/5′ ratio of housekeeping genes β-actin and Gapdh. Expression data were submitted to the NCBI GEO database (accession number GSE71695). Bioinformatics analysis of the Affymetrix raw data were performed with the Array Studio software package (OmicSoft). For this, Affymetrix cel files were first processed with robust multiarray average as a normalization method, and the data were then log2 transformed. For detection of expressed genes all Affymetrix probe sets with intensity signals of <6 in at least 25% of the samples were filtered out. Principal component analysis was applied to all samples as a quality control measure. To detect differentially expressed genes, a pairwise ANOVA statistical test was applied between the treated and control groups. Criteria for determining differentially expressed genes with statistical significance were changes in expression levels higher than 2-fold and a p value <0.01. Pathway and global functional analyses of differentially expressed genes were performed using the IPA software (Qiagen). Data sets containing Affymetrix probe sets and corresponding expression values were uploaded into the application, and each gene identifier was mapped using the IPA library. Canonical pathway analysis identified the canonical pathways from the IPA library that were most significant to the data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: 1) a ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway and 2) Fisher's exact test to calculate a p value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the data set and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone. The IPA downstream effects analysis was used to identify the biological functions that were most significant to the data set. Right-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to calculate a p value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to these data sets are due to chance alone. Furthermore, IPA downstream effects analysis was used to predict increases or decreases of these biological functions occurring in macrophages after treatment by integrating the direction change of the differentially expresses genes into a z score algorithm calculation. RA839 (5 μm) was incubated in duplicates for 20 min at 37 °C in liver microsomal fraction (1 mg/ml protein) of human, rat, and mouse in the presence or absence of NADPH co-factor (1 mm). The reaction was stopped by addition of five volumes of precooled acetonitrile. The concentration of RA839 was determined by LC-MS. RA839 (Fig. 1 and supplemental text) was obtained by a screening effort followed by a medicinal chemistry program ((3S)-1-[4-[(2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl) sulfonylamino]-1-naphthyl]pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid) that will be described elsewhere. RA839 prevented the interaction of an Nrf2-derived peptide that included the sequence of Keap1 binding ETGE motif with the Keap1 kelch domain as determined by an FP assay with an IC50 of 0.14 + 0.04 μm (mean ± S.D. n = 6) (Fig. 2A). Peptides with the sequences of the ETGE and the DLG motives had IC50 values in this assay of 0.22 and >40 μm, respectively. Co-crystallization of RA839 with the Keap kelch domain revealed its binding mode (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The naphthalene ring system inserted deep into the central solvent channel of the kelch domain and the electron-rich ring formed stacking interactions with the Arg415 side chain. The sulfonamide moiety formed a polar contact to Ser602, placing the tetramethylphenyl-substituent into a hydrophobic and aromatic pocket of the Keap kelch binding site formed by Tyr334, Phe577, and Tyr572. The carboxylic group interacted directly with Arg483. The Kd of the interaction between the Keap kelch domain and RA839 amounted to 6 μm as determined by ITC, with a 1:1 stoichiometry of protein and ligand (Fig. 4 and Table 2). This is ∼100-fold weaker than the binding of a 16-mer peptide with the ETGE sequence to the Kelch domain (Table 2). The thermodynamic profile showed that binding of RA839 to the kelch domain was driven by exothermic processes. This indicates a substantial contribution of ionic interaction to the overall binding, which is in line with the x-ray structure that demonstrated the interaction of RA839 with Arg415 and Arg483. The significance of the interaction with Arg483 is demonstrated by comparison with compounds RA889 and RA912 (Fig. 1) that were inactive in the FP assay (IC50 > 10 μm) (Fig. 2A). These compounds are structurally related to RA839 but lack the carboxyl group that interacts with Arg483. The reactive Keap1 inhibitor CDDO-Me does not interact with the Keap1 kelch domain (11.Cleasby A. Yon J. Day P.J. Richardson C. Tickle I.J. Williams P.A. Callahan J.F. Carr R. Concha N. Kerns J.K"
https://openalex.org/W1961739599,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) has crucial roles in fatty acid metabolism and is an attractive target for drug discovery against diabetes, cancer and other diseases. Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACC (ScACC) is crucial for the production of very-long-chain fatty acids and the maintenance of the nuclear envelope. ACC contains biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT) activities, and its biotin is linked covalently to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Most eukaryotic ACCs are 250-kilodalton (kDa), multi-domain enzymes and function as homodimers and higher oligomers. They contain a unique, 80-kDa central region that shares no homology with other proteins. Although the structures of the BC, CT and BCCP domains and other biotin-dependent carboxylase holoenzymes are known, there is currently no structural information on the ACC holoenzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length, 500-kDa holoenzyme dimer of ScACC. The structure is remarkably different from that of the other biotin-dependent carboxylases. The central region contains five domains and is important for positioning the BC and CT domains for catalysis. The structure unexpectedly reveals a dimer of the BC domain and extensive conformational differences compared to the structure of the BC domain alone, which is a monomer. These structural changes reveal why the BC domain alone is catalytically inactive and define the molecular mechanism for the inhibition of eukaryotic ACC by the natural product soraphen A and by phosphorylation of a Ser residue just before the BC domain core in mammalian ACC. The BC and CT active sites are separated by 80 Å, and the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2182922542,"Studies have suggested chronic pain syndromes are associated with neural reorganization in specific regions associated with perception, processing, and integration of pain. Urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) represents a collection of pain syndromes characterized by pelvic pain, namely Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS), that are both poorly understood in their pathophysiology, and treated ineffectively. We hypothesized patients with UCPPS may have microstructural differences in the brain compared with healthy control subjects (HCs), as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common gastrointestinal pain disorder. In the current study we performed population-based voxel-wise DTI and super-resolution track density imaging (TDI) in a large, two-center sample of phenotyped patients from the multicenter cohort with UCPPS (N = 45), IBS (N = 39), and HCs (N = 56) as part of the MAPP Research Network. Compared with HCs, UCPPS patients had lower fractional anisotropy (FA), lower generalized anisotropy (GA), lower track density, and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in brain regions commonly associated with perception and integration of pain information. Results also showed significant differences in specific anatomical regions in UCPPS patients when compared with IBS patients, consistent with microstructural alterations specific to UCPPS. While IBS patients showed clear sex related differences in FA, MD, GA, and track density consistent with previous reports, few such differences were observed in UCPPS patients. Heat maps illustrating the correlation between specific regions of interest and various pain and urinary symptom scores showed clustering of significant associations along the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop associated with pain integration, modulation, and perception. Together, results suggest patients with UCPPS have extensive microstructural differences within the brain, many specific to syndrome UCPPS versus IBS, that appear to be localized to regions associated with perception and integration of sensory information and pain modulation, and seem to be a consequence of longstanding pain."
https://openalex.org/W2192382922,"Introduction Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values are increasingly reported in breast MRI. As there is no standardized method for ADC measurements, we evaluated the effect of the size of region of interest (ROI) to diagnostic utility and correlation to prognostic markers of breast cancer. Methods This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board; the need for written informed consent for the retrospective analyses of the breast MRIs was waived by the Chair of the Hospital District. We compared diagnostic accuracy of ADC measurements from whole-lesion ROIs (WL-ROIs) to small subregions (S-ROIs) showing the most restricted diffusion and evaluated correlations with prognostic factors in 112 consecutive patients (mean age 56.2±11.6 years, 137 lesions) who underwent 3.0-T breast MRI. Results Intra- and interobserver reproducibility were substantial (κ = 0.616–0.784; Intra-Class Correlation 0.589–0.831). In receiver operating characteristics analysis, differentiation between malignant and benign lesions was excellent (area under curve 0.957–0.962, cut-off ADC values for WL-ROIs: 0.87×10−3 mm2s-1; S-ROIs: 0.69×10−3 mm2s-1, P<0.001). WL-ROIs/S-ROIs achieved sensitivities of 95.7%/91.3%, specificities of 89.5%/94.7%, and overall accuracies of 89.8%/94.2%. In S-ROIs, lower ADC values correlated with presence of axillary metastases (P = 0.03), high histological grade (P = 0.006), and worsened Nottingham Prognostic Index Score (P<0.05). In both ROIs, ADC values correlated with progesterone receptors and advanced stage (P<0.01), but not with HER2, estrogen receptors, or Ki-67. Conclusions ADC values assist in breast tumor characterization. Small ROIs were more accurate than whole-lesion ROIs and more frequently associated with prognostic factors. Cut-off values differed significantly depending on measurement procedure, which should be recognized when comparing results from the literature. Instead of using a whole lesion covering ROI, a small ROI could be advocated in diffusion-weighted imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2198367484,"At the onset of meiosis, each chromosome needs to find its homologue and pair to ensure proper segregation. In Drosophila, pairing occurs during the mitotic cycles preceding meiosis. Here we show that germ cell nuclei undergo marked movements during this developmental window. We demonstrate that microtubules and Dynein are driving nuclear rotations and are required for centromere pairing and clustering. We further found that Klaroid (SUN) and Klarsicht (KASH) co-localize with centromeres at the nuclear envelope and are required for proper chromosome motions and pairing. We identified Mud (NuMA in vertebrates) as co-localizing with centromeres, Klarsicht and Klaroid. Mud is also required to maintain the integrity of the nuclear envelope and for the correct assembly of the synaptonemal complex. Our findings reveal a mechanism for chromosome pairing in Drosophila, and indicate that microtubules, centrosomes and associated proteins play a crucial role in the dynamic organization of chromosomes inside the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2216708218,"The physiological gaseous molecule, carbon monoxide (CO) becomes a subject of extensive investigation due to its vasoactive activity throughout the body but its role in gastroprotection has been little investigated. We determined the mechanism of CO released from its donor tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) in protection of gastric mucosa against 75% ethanol-induced injury. Rats were pretreated with CORM-2 30 min prior to 75% ethanol with or without 1) non-selective (indomethacin) or selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (SC-560) and COX-2 (celecoxib) inhibitors, 2) nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NNA, 3) ODQ, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, hemin, a heme oxygenase (HO)-1 inductor or zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), an inhibitor of HO-1 activity. The CO content in gastric mucosa and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level in blood was analyzed by gas chromatography. The gastric mucosal mRNA expression for HO-1, COX-1, COX-2, iNOS, IL-4, IL-1β was analyzed by real-time PCR while HO-1, HO-2 and Nrf2 protein expression was determined by Western Blot. Pretreatment with CORM-2 (0.5–10 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated ethanol-induced lesions and raised gastric blood flow (GBF) but large dose of 100 mg/kg was ineffective. CORM-2 (5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg i.g.) significantly increased gastric mucosal CO content and whole blood COHb level. CORM-2-induced protection was reversed by indomethacin, SC-560 and significantly attenuated by celecoxib, ODQ and L-NNA. Hemin significantly reduced ethanol damage and raised GBF while ZnPPIX which exacerbated ethanol-induced injury inhibited CORM-2- and hemin-induced gastroprotection and the accompanying rise in GBF. CORM-2 significantly increased gastric mucosal HO-1 mRNA expression and decreased mRNA expression for iNOS, IL-1β, COX-1 and COX-2 but failed to affect HO-1 and Nrf2 protein expression decreased by ethanol. We conclude that CORM-2 released CO exerts gastroprotection against ethanol-induced gastric lesions involving an increase in gastric microcirculation mediated by sGC/cGMP, prostaglandins derived from COX-1, NO-NOS system and its anti-inflammatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W1940503517,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels in 5-HT neurons are assumed to be principal effectors of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors, but their pharmacology, subunit composition and the role in regulation of 5-HT neuron activity have not been fully elucidated. We sought for a pharmacological tool for assessing the functional role of GIRK channels in 5-HT neurons by characterizing the effects of drugs known to block GIRK channels in the submicromolar range of concentrations. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in brainstem slices were used to determine concentration-response relationships for the selected GIRK channel blockers on 5-HT1A autoreceptor-activated inwardly rectifying K+ conductance in rat dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. 5-HT1A autoreceptor-activated GIRK conductance was completely blocked by the nonselective inwardly rectifying potassium channels blocker Ba2+ (EC50 = 9.4 μM, full block with 100 μM) and by SCH23390 (EC50 = 1.95 μM, full block with 30 μM). GIRK-specific blocker tertiapin-Q blocked 5-HT1A autoreceptor-activated GIRK conductance with high potency (EC50 = 33.6 nM), but incompletely, i.e. ~16% of total conductance resulted to be tertiapin-Q-resistant. U73343 and SCH28080, reported to block GIRK channels with submicromolar EC50s, were essentially ineffective in 5-HT neurons. Our data show that inwardly rectifying K+ channels coupled to 5-HT1A autoreceptors display pharmacological properties generally expected for neuronal GIRK channels, but different from GIRK1-GIRK2 heteromers, the predominant form of brain GIRK channels. Distinct pharmacological properties of GIRK channels in 5-HT neurons should be explored for the development of new therapeutic agents for mood disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2268316738,"Objective Distinct lymphocyte subpopulations have been implicated in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and obesity-associated inflammation in mouse models of insulin resistance. Information on the relationships of lymphocyte subpopulations with type 2 diabetes remain limited in human population-based cohort studies. Methods Circulating levels of innate (γδ T, natural killer (NK)) and adaptive immune (CD4+ naive, CD4+ memory, Th1, and Th2) lymphocyte subpopulations were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 929 free-living participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Cross-sectional relationships of lymphocyte subpopulations with type 2 diabetes (n = 154) and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated by generalized linear models. Results Each standard deviation (SD) higher CD4+ memory cells was associated with a 21% higher odds of type 2 diabetes (95% CI: 1–47%) and each SD higher naive cells was associated with a 22% lower odds (95% CI: 4–36%) (adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI). Among participants not using diabetes medication, higher memory and lower naive CD4+ cells were associated with higher fasting glucose concentrations (p<0.05, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity). There were no associations of γδ T, NK, Th1, or Th2 cells with type 2 diabetes, glucose, or insulin. Conclusions A higher degree of chronic adaptive immune activation, reflected by higher memory and lower naive CD4+ cells, was positively associated with type 2 diabetes. These results are consistent with a role of chronic immune activation and exhaustion augmenting chronic inflammatory diseases, and support the importance of prospective studies evaluating adaptive immune activation and type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2198274127,"Phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) is a quantitatively minor phospholipid in eukaryotic cells that plays a fundamental role in regulating endocytic membrane traffic. Despite its clear importance for cellular function and organism physiology, mechanistic details of its biology have so far not been fully elucidated. In part, this is due to a lack of experimental tools that specifically probe for PtdIns(3,5)P2 in cells to unambiguously identify its dynamics and site(s) of action. In this study, we have evaluated a recently reported PtdIns(3,5)P2 biosensor, GFP-ML1Nx2, for its veracity as such a probe. We report that, in live cells, the localization of this biosensor to sub-cellular compartments is largely independent of PtdIns(3,5)P2, as assessed after pharmacological, chemical genetic or genomic interventions that block the lipid's synthesis. We therefore conclude that it is unwise to interpret the localization of ML1Nx2 as a true and unbiased biosensor for PtdIns(3,5)P2."
https://openalex.org/W2204462566,"Kinases are downstream modulators and effectors of several cellular signaling cascades and play key roles in the development of neoplastic disease. In this study, we aimed to evaluate SRC, LYN and CKB protein and mRNA expression, as well as their promoter methylation, in gastric cancer. We found elevated expression of SRC and LYN kinase mRNA and protein but decreased levels of CKB kinase, alterations that may have a role in the invasiveness and metastasis of gastric tumors. Expression of the three studied kinases was also associated with MYC oncogene expression, a possible biomarker for gastric cancer. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of these genes, we evaluated the DNA promoter methylation of the three kinases. We found that reduced SRC and LYN methylation and increased CKB methylation was associated with gastric cancer. The reduced SRC and LYN methylation was associated with increased levels of mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that DNA methylation is involved in regulating the expression of these kinases. Conversely, reduced CKB methylation was observed in samples with reduced mRNA and protein expression, suggesting CKB expression was found to be only partly regulated by DNA methylation. Additionally, we found that alterations in the DNA methylation pattern of the three studied kinases were also associated with the gastric cancer onset, advanced gastric cancer, deeper tumor invasion and the presence of metastasis. Therefore, SRC, LYN and CKB expression or DNA methylation could be useful markers for predicting tumor progression and targeting in anti-cancer strategies."

Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a suggested biomarker for identification of high-risk patients with severe fibrosis stages. This study aimed to examine associations between plasma MFAP4 (pMFAP4) and transient elastography or chronic hepatitis C virus infection in drug users and in a mixed patient cohort with increased risk of liver disease. Moreover, the study aimed to identify comorbidities that significantly influence pMFAP4.pMFAP4 was measured in samples from 351 drug users attending treatment centres and from 248 acutely hospitalized medical patients with mixed diagnoses. Linear and logistic multivariate regression analyses were performed and nonparametric receiver operating characteristic-curves for cirrhosis were used to estimate cut-off points for pMFAP4. Univariate and subgroup analyses were performed using non-parametric methods.pMFAP4 increased significantly with liver fibrosis score. pMFAP4 was significantly associated with chronic viral infection in the drug users and with transient elastography in both cohorts. In the mixed patient cohort, pMFAP4 was significantly increased among patients with a previous diagnosis of liver disease or congestive heart failure compared to patients with other diagnoses.pMFAP4 has the potential to be used as an outreach-screening tool for liver fibrosis in drug users and in mixed medical patients. pMFAP4 level is positively associated with transient elastography, but additional studies are warranted to validate the possible use of pMFAP4 in larger cohorts and in combination with transient elastography."
https://openalex.org/W2188090437,"The objective of this study was to determine whether a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) exerts a triglyceride-lowering effect in a hyperlipidemic state using the fructose-fed rat model and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Rats were fed either a starch control diet or a diet containing 65% fructose for 8 weeks to induce hypertriglyceridemia. During the 9th week of the study, rats were maintained on their respective diet and administered vehicle or GSPE via oral gavage for 7 days. Fructose increased serum triglyceride levels by 171% after 9 weeks, compared to control, while GSPE administration attenuated this effect, resulting in a 41% decrease. GSPE inhibited hepatic lipogenesis via down-regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 in the fructose-fed animals. GSPE increased fecal bile acid and total lipid excretion, decreased serum bile acid levels and increased the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. However, bile acid biosynthetic gene expression was not increased in the presence of GSPE and fructose. Serum cholesterol levels remained constant, while hepatic cholesterol levels decreased. GSPE did not modulate expression of genes responsible for esterification or biliary export of the newly synthesized cholesterol, but did increase fecal cholesterol excretion, suggesting that in the presence of GSPE and fructose, the liver may secrete more free cholesterol into the plasma which may then be shunted to the proximal small intestine for direct basolateral to apical secretion and subsequent fecal excretion. Our results demonstrate that GSPE effectively lowers serum triglyceride levels in fructose-fed rats after one week administration. This study provides novel insight into the mechanistic actions of GSPE in treating hypertriglyceridemia and demonstrates that it targets hepatic de novo lipogenesis, bile acid homeostasis and non-biliary cholesterol excretion as important mechanisms for reducing hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in the presence of fructose."
https://openalex.org/W2271989552,"Annually, tons and tons of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are produced in the world. And they are applied in almost all aspects of our life. Their release from the products into environment may pose issue for human health. Although many studies have reported the adverse effects of ZnO NPs on organisms, little is known about the effects on female reproductive systems or the related mechanisms. Quantitative proteomics have not been applied although quantitative transcriptomics have been used in zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) research. Genes are very important players however proteins are the real actors in the biological systems. By using hen’s ovarian granulosa cells, it was found that ZnO-NP-5μg/ml and ZnSO4-10μg/ml treatments produced the same amount of intracellular Zn and resulted in similar cell growth inhibition. And NPs were found in the treated cells. However, ZnO-NP-5μg/ml specifically regulated the expression of genes and proteins compared with that in ZnSO4-10μg/ml treatment. For the first time, this investigation reports that intact NPs produce different impacts on the expression of genes and proteins involved in specific pathways compared to that by Zn2+. The findings enrich our knowledge for the molecular insights of zinc oxide nanoparticles effects on the female reproductive systems. This also may raise the health concern that ZnO NPs may adversely affect the female reproductive systems through regulation of specific signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1828689731,"Vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) have proven effective in humans and animals. In this regard, the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is one of the technologies of choice to generate such highly immunogenic vaccines. The extended use of these vaccines for human and animal populations is constrained because of high production costs, therefore a significant improvement in productivity is crucial to ensure their commercial viability. Here we describe the use of the previously described baculovirus expression cassette, called TB, to model the production of two VLP-forming vaccine antigens in insect cells. Capsid proteins from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2 Cap) and from the calicivirus that causes rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV VP60) were expressed in insect cells using baculoviruses genetically engineered with the TB expression cassette. Productivity was compared to that obtained using standard counterpart vectors expressing the same proteins under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Our results demonstrate that the use of the TB expression cassette increased the production yields of these vaccine antigens by around 300% with respect to the standard vectors. The recombinant proteins produced by TB-modified vectors were fully functional, forming VLPs identical in size and shape to those generated by the standard baculoviruses, as determined by electron microscopy analysis. The use of the TB expression cassette implies a simple modification of the baculovirus vectors that significantly improves the cost efficiency of VLP-based vaccine production, thereby facilitating the commercial viability and broad application of these vaccines for human and animal health."
https://openalex.org/W2196561742,"Reactive cardiac fibrosis resulting from chronic pressure overload (PO) compromises ventricular function and contributes to congestive heart failure. We explored whether nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NTKs) play a key role in fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts (CFb), and could potentially serve as a target to reduce PO-induced cardiac fibrosis. Our studies were carried out in PO mouse myocardium induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, via an intraperitoneally implanted mini-osmotic pump at 0.44 mg/kg/day reduced PO-induced accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and improved left ventricular geometry and function. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment inhibited NTK activation (primarily Pyk2 and Fak) and reduced the level of FSP1 positive cells in the PO myocardium. In vitro studies using cultured mouse CFb showed that dasatinib treatment at 50 nM reduced: (i) extracellular accumulation of both collagen and fibronectin, (ii) both basal and PDGF-stimulated activation of Pyk2, (iii) nuclear accumulation of Ki67, SKP2 and histone-H2B and (iv) PDGF-stimulated CFb proliferation and migration. However, dasatinib did not affect cardiomyocyte morphologies in either the ventricular tissue after in vivo administration or in isolated cells after in vitro treatment. Mass spectrometric quantification of dasatinib in cultured cells indicated that the uptake of dasatinib by CFb was greater that that taken up by cardiomyocytes. Dasatinib treatment primarily suppressed PDGF but not insulin-stimulated signaling (Erk versus Akt activation) in both CFb and cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that dasatinib treatment at lower doses than that used in chemotherapy has the capacity to reduce hypertrophy-associated fibrosis and improve ventricular function."
https://openalex.org/W2207243325,"Imputation, the process of inferring genotypes for untyped variants, is used to identify and refine genetic association findings. Inaccuracies in imputed data can distort the observed association between variants and a disease. Many statistics are used to assess accuracy; some compare imputed to genotyped data and others are calculated without reference to true genotypes. Prior work has shown that the Imputation Quality Score (IQS), which is based on Cohen’s kappa statistic and compares imputed genotype probabilities to true genotypes, appropriately adjusts for chance agreement; however, it is not commonly used. To identify differences in accuracy assessment, we compared IQS with concordance rate, squared correlation, and accuracy measures built into imputation programs. Genotypes from the 1000 Genomes reference populations (AFR N = 246 and EUR N = 379) were masked to match the typed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coverage of several SNP arrays and were imputed with BEAGLE 3.3.2 and IMPUTE2 in regions associated with smoking behaviors. Additional masking and imputation was conducted for sequenced subjects from the Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence and the Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence in African Americans (N = 1,481 African Americans and N = 1,480 European Americans). Our results offer further evidence that concordance rate inflates accuracy estimates, particularly for rare and low frequency variants. For common variants, squared correlation, BEAGLE R2, IMPUTE2 INFO, and IQS produce similar assessments of imputation accuracy. However, for rare and low frequency variants, compared to IQS, the other statistics tend to be more liberal in their assessment of accuracy. IQS is important to consider when evaluating imputation accuracy, particularly for rare and low frequency variants."
https://openalex.org/W2097006752,"Background Postoperative delirium is one of the most common postoperative complications in geriatric patients. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) assesses cognitive function in patients and is associated with postoperative delirium. However, whether there is an age-dependent relationship between preoperative MMSE score and postoperative delirium remains unknown. Methods We therefore set out to investigate the association between preoperative MMSE score and postoperative delirium in young-old (≤80 year-old, 75.46±4.69 years, 27.0% male, n = 63) and old-old (>80 year-old, 84.51±3.46 years, 20.9% male, n = 67) participants, who had repairs of hip fractures under general anesthesia. The Confusion Assessment Method and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale were administrated before surgery, and on the first, second and fourth days after surgery, to assess the incidence and severity of the delirium, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to calculate the optimal cutoff score of MMSE in predicting postoperative delirium. Results Thirty-four (26.2%) of 130 patients (80.12±6.12 years, 23.8% male) developed postoperative delirium. Preoperative MMSE scores were negatively associated with higher incidences and greater severity of postoperative delirium. The optimal cutoff scores of MMSE associated with postoperative delirium for young-old and old-old participants were 18.4 and 21.4, with a sensitivity of 60% and 83.8%, and a specificity of 92.5% and 62.8%, respectively. Conclusion The data demonstrated the optimal cutoff score of MMSE associated with postoperative delirium in young-old adults might be lower than that in old-old adults. Pending further investigation, these findings suggest that the association between preoperative MMSE score and postoperative delirium is age-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2120233859,"Several lines of evidence suggest that facial cues of adiposity may be important for human social interaction. However, tests for quantifiable cues of body mass index (BMI) in the face have examined only a small number of facial proportions and these proportions were found to have relatively low predictive power. Here we employed a data-driven approach in which statistical models were built using principal components (PCs) derived from objectively defined shape and color characteristics in face images. The predictive power of these models was then compared with models based on previously studied facial proportions (perimeter-to-area ratio, width-to-height ratio, and cheek-to-jaw width). Models based on 2D shape-only PCs, color-only PCs, and 2D shape and color PCs combined each performed significantly and substantially better than models based on one or more of the previously studied facial proportions. A non-linear PC model considering both 2D shape and color PCs was the best predictor of BMI. These results highlight the utility of a “bottom-up”, data-driven approach for assessing BMI from face images."
https://openalex.org/W2120578950,"Different dolphin and tuna species have frequently been reported to aggregate in areas of high frontal activity, sometimes developing close multi-species associations to increase feeding success. Aerial surveys are a common tool to monitor the density and abundance of marine mammals, and have recently become a focus in the search for methods to provide fisheries-independent abundance indicators for tuna stock assessment. In this study, we present first density estimates corrected for availability bias of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from the Golf of Lions (GoL), compared with uncorrected estimates of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT; Thunnus thynnus) densities from 8 years of line transect aerial surveys. The raw sighting data were further used to analyze patterns of spatial co-occurrence and density of these three top marine predators in this important feeding ground in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. These patterns were investigated regarding known species-specific feeding preferences and environmental characteristics (i. e. mesoscale activity) of the survey zone. ABFT was by far the most abundant species during the surveys in terms of schools and individuals, followed by striped dolphins and fin whales. However, when accounted for availability bias, schools of dolphins and fin whales were of equal density. Direct interactions of the species appeared to be the exception, but results indicate that densities, presence and core sighting locations of striped dolphins and ABFT were correlated. Core sighting areas of these species were located close to an area of high mesoscale activity (oceanic fronts and eddies). Fin whales did not show such a correlation. The results further highlight the feasibility to coordinate research efforts to explore the behaviour and abundance of the investigated species, as demanded by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)."
https://openalex.org/W2263029921,"Patients with giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) show progressive loss of motor and sensory function starting in childhood and typically live for less than 30 years. GAN is caused by autosomal recessive mutations leading to low levels of gigaxonin (GIG), a ubiquitously-expressed BTB/Kelch cytoplasmic protein believed to be an E3 ligase substrate adaptor. GAN pathology is characterized by aggregates of intermediate filaments (IFs) in multiple tissues. To delineate the molecular pathway between GIG deficiency and IF pathology, we undertook a proteomic screen to identify the normal binding partners of GIG. Prominent among them were several classes of IFs, including the neurofilament subunits whose accumulation leads to the axonal swellings for which GAN is named. We showed these interactions were dependent on the Kelch domain of GIG. Furthermore, we identified the E3 ligase MYCBP2 and the heat shock proteins HSP90AA1/AB1 as interactors with the BTB domain that may result in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of intermediate filaments. Our open-ended proteomic screen provides support to GIG’s role as an adaptor protein, linking IF proteins through its Kelch domain to the ubiquitin pathway proteins via its BTB domain, and points to future approaches for reversing the phenotype in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2198406845,"The use of chemical tools to validate clinical targets has gained in popularity over recent years and the importance of understanding the activity, selectivity and mechanism of action of these compounds is well recognized. Dysregulation of the HSP70 protein family has been linked to multiple cancer types and drug resistance, highlighting their importance as popular targets for anti-cancer drug development. Apoptozole is a recently identified small molecule, which has been reported to possess strong affinity for the HSP70 isoforms HSP72 and HSC70. We investigated apoptozole as a potential chemical tool for HSP70 inhibition. Unfortunately, using both biochemical and biophysical techniques, we were unable to find any experimental evidence that apoptozole binds to HSP70 in a specific and developable way. Instead, we provide experimental evidence that apoptozole forms aggregates under aqueous conditions that could interact with HSP70 proteins in a non-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2190078508,"Background Recognition of the intermuscular spaces within lumbar paraspinal muscles is critically important for using the paramedian muscle-splitting approach to the lumbar spine. As such, it is important to determine the intermuscular spaces within the lumbar paraspinal muscles by utilizing modern medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods A total of 30 adult cadavers were studied by sectional anatomic dissection, and 60 patients were examined using CT (16 slices, 3-mm thickness, 3-mm intersection gap, n = 30) and MRI (3.0T, T2-WI, 5-mm thickness, 1-mm intersection gap, n = 30). The distances between the midline and the superficial points of the intermuscular spaces at different intervertebral disc levels were measured. Results Based on study of our cadavers, the mean distances from the midline to the intermuscular space between multifidus and longissimus, from intervertebral disc levels L1–L2 to L5–S1, were 0.9, 1.1, 1.7, 3.0, and 3.5 cm, respectively. Compared with the upper levels (L1–L3), the superficial location at the lower level (L4–S1) is more laterally to the midline (P<0.05). The intermuscular space between sacrospinalis and quadratus lumborum, and that between longissimus and iliocostalis did not exist at L4–S1. The intermuscular spaces in patients also varied at different levels of the lumbar spine showing a low discontinuous density in CT and a high signal in MRI. There were no significant differences between the observations in cadavers and those made using CT and MRI. Conclusion The intermuscular spaces within the paraspinal muscles vary at different intervertebral disc levels. Preoperative CT and MRI can facilitate selection of the muscle-splitting approach to the lumbar spine. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of medical imaging techniques in surgical planning."

TDBP-TAZTO can pass through the blood brain barrier and accumulate in brain. However, the neurotoxicity of TDBP-TAZTO has not yet studied in rodents. We hypothesize that TDBP-TAZTO could induce the neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons. The male adult rats were exposed to TDBP-TAZTO of 5 and 50 mg/kg by gavage, daily for 6 months. TDBP-TAZTO resulted in cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, which may be related with TDBP-TAZTO-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivation, upregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins, downexpression of neurogenesis-related proteins in hippocampus, and hippocampal neurons damage in DG, CA1 and CA3 areas. Our findings suggested that TDBP-TAZTO induces significant hippocampal neurotoxicity, which provokes cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors in adult rats. Therefore, this research will contribute to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of TDBP-TAZTO in human."
https://openalex.org/W1840538150,"We sought to understand gaps in reporting childhood TB cases among public and private sector health facilities (dubbed ""non-NTP"" facilities) outside the network of national TB control programmes, and the resulting impact of under-reporting on estimates of paediatric disease burden and market demand for new medicines.Exploratory assessments were carried out in Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan, reaching a range of facility types in two selected areas of each country. Record reviews and interviews of healthcare providers were carried out to assess numbers of unreported paediatric TB cases, diagnostic pathways followed and treatment regimens prescribed.A total of 985 unreported diagnosed paediatric TB cases were identified over a three month period in 2013 in Indonesia from 64 facilities, 463 in Pakistan from 35 facilities and 24 in Nigeria from 20 facilities. These represent an absolute additional annualised yield to 2013 notifications reported to WHO of 15% for Indonesia, 2% for Nigeria and 7% for Pakistan. Only 12% of all facilities provided age and sex-disaggregated data. Findings highlight the challenges of confirming childhood TB. Diagnosis patterns in Nigeria highlight a very low suspicion for childhood TB. Providers note the need for paediatric medicines aligned to WHO recommendations.This study emphasises the impact of incomplete reporting on the estimation of disease burden and potential market size of paediatric TB medicines. Further studies on ""hubs"" (facilities treating large numbers of childhood TB cases) will improve our understanding of the epidemic, support introduction efforts for new treatments and better measure markets for new paediatric medicines."
https://openalex.org/W2172524433,"Background and aim The public health impact of population-based mammography screening programs depends on high participation rates. Thus, monitoring participation rates, as well as understanding and considering the factors influencing attendance, is important. With the goal to acquire information on the appropriate level of intervention for increasing screening participation our study aimed to (1) examine whether, over and above individual factors, the neighborhood of residence influences a woman’s mammography non-attendance, and (2) evaluate, whether knowing a woman’s neighborhood of residence would be sufficient to predict non-attendance. Methods We analyze all women invited to mammography screening in 2005–09, residing in the city of Malmö, Sweden. Information regarding mammography screening attendance was linked to data on area of residence, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics available from Statistics Sweden. The influence of individual and neighborhood factors was assessed by multilevel logistic regression analysis with 29,901 women nested within 212 neighborhoods. Results The prevalence of non-attendance among women was 18.3%. After adjusting for individual characteristics, the prevalence in the 212 neighborhoods was 3.6%. Neighborhood of residence had little influence on non-attendance. The multilevel analysis indicates that 8.4% of the total individual differences in the propensity of non-attendance were at the neighborhood level. However, when adjusting for specific individual characteristics this general contextual effect decreased to 1.8%. This minor effect was explained by the sociodemographic characteristic of the neighborhoods. The discriminatory accuracy of classifying women according to their non-attendance was 0.747 when considering only individual level variables, and 0.760 after including neighborhood level as a random effect. Conclusion Our results suggest that neighborhoods of residence in Malmö, Sweden (as defined by small-area market statistics (SAMS) areas) do not condition women’s participation in population based mammography screening. Thus, interventions should be directed to the whole city and target women with a higher risk of non-attendance."

Potential anti-inflammatory effects of GnRH-antagonists may be most pronounced in patients with high GnRH and gonadotropin levels. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a GnRH-antagonist, cetrorelix, in RA patients with high gonadotropin levels.We report intention-to-treat post hoc analyses among patients with high gonadotropin levels (N = 53), i.e. gonadotropin levels>median, from our proof-of-concept, double-blind AGRA-study (N = 99). Patients with active longstanding RA, randomized to subcutaneous cetrorelix (5mg days1-2; 3mg days 3-5) or placebo, were followed through day 15. Only predefined primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed.The primary endpoint, Disease Activity Score of 28-joint counts with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), improved with cetrorelix compared with placebo by day 5 (-1.0 vs. -0.4, P = 0∙010). By day 5, more patients on cetrorelix achieved at least a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology scale (44% vs. 19%, P = 0.049), DAS28-CRP≤3.2 (24% vs. 0%, P = 0.012), and European League against Rheumatism 'Good-responses' (19% vs. 0%, P = 0.026).

https://openalex.org/W1801361445,"Sustainable management of dryland river systems is often complicated by extreme variability of precipitation in time and space, especially across large catchment areas. Understanding regional water quality changes in southern African dryland rivers and wetland systems is especially important because of their high subsistence value and provision of ecosystem services essential to both public and animal health. We quantified seasonal variation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in the Chobe River using spatiotemporal and geostatistical modeling of water quality time series data collected along a transect spanning a mosaic of protected, urban, and developing urban land use. We found significant relationships in the dry season between E. coli concentrations and protected land use (p = 0.0009), floodplain habitat (p = 0.016), and fecal counts from elephant (p = 0.017) and other wildlife (p = 0.001). Dry season fecal loading by both elephant (p = 0.029) and other wildlife (p = 0.006) was also an important predictor of early wet season E. coli concentrations. Locations of high E. coli concentrations likewise showed close spatial agreement with estimates of wildlife biomass derived from aerial survey data. In contrast to the dry season, wet season bacterial water quality patterns were associated only with TSS (p<0.0001), suggesting storm water and sediment runoff significantly influence E. coli loads. Our data suggest that wildlife populations, and elephants in particular, can significantly modify river water quality patterns. Loss of habitat and limitation of wildlife access to perennial rivers and floodplains in water-restricted regions may increase the impact of species on surface water resources. Our findings have important implications to land use planning in southern Africa's dryland river ecosystems."

The potential involvement of EBV in the clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains unexplained. The aim of this study was to determine whether EBV-DNA load in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CLL patients may influence heterogeneity in the course of the disease. The study included peripheral blood samples from 115 previously untreated patients with CLL (54 women and 61 men) and 40 healthy controls (16 women and 24 men). We analyzed the association between the EBV-DNA load in PBMCs and the stage of the disease, adverse prognostic factors, and clinical outcome. Detectable numbers of EBV-DNA copies in PBMCs were found in 62 out of 115 CLL patients (53.91%). The EBV-DNA copy number/μg DNA was significantly higher in patients who required early implementation of treatment, presented with lymphocyte count doubling time <12 months, displayed CD38-positive or ZAP-70-positive phenotype, and with the del(11q22.3) cytogenetic abnormality. Furthermore, the EBV-DNA copy number/μg DNA showed significant positive correlation with the concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2-microglobulin. We have shown that in CLL patients, higher EBV-DNA copy number predicted shorter survival and shorter time to disease progression, and it was associated with other established unfavorable prognostic factors. This suggests that EBV may negatively affect the outcome of CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2239543890,"Both oncogenic and tumor-suppressor activities are attributed to the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, NF-kB may positively or negatively regulate proliferation. The molecular determinants of these opposing roles of NF-kB are unclear. Using primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) as a model, we show that increased RelA levels and consequent increase in basal transcriptional activity of RelA induces IRF1, a target gene. Induced IRF1 upregulates STAT1 and IRF7, and in consort, these factors induce the expression of interferon response genes. Activation of the interferon pathway down-regulates CDK4 and up-regulates p27 resulting in Rb hypo-phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest. Stimulation of HMEC with IFN-γ elicits similar phenotypic and molecular changes suggesting that basal activity of RelA and IFN-γ converge on IRF1 to regulate proliferation. The anti-proliferative RelA-IRF1-CDK4 signaling axis is retained in ER+/HER2- breast tumors analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using immuno-histochemical analysis of breast tumors, we confirm the negative correlation between RelA levels and proliferation rate in ER+/HER2- breast tumors. These findings attribute an anti-proliferative tumor-suppressor role to basal RelA activity. Inactivation of Rb, down-regulation of RelA or IRF1, or upregulation of CDK4 or IRF2 rescues the RelA-IRF1-CDK4 induced proliferation arrest in HMEC and are points of disruption in aggressive tumors. Activity of the RelA-IRF1-CDK4 axis may explain favorable response to CDK4/6 inhibition observed in patients with ER+ Rb competent tumors."

Among these, Fbs1/FBG1/FBXO2, Fbs2/FBG2/FBXO6, and Fbs3/FBG5/FBXO27 recognize the N-glycans of glycoproteins, whereas FBG3/FBXO44 has no sugar-binding activity, despite the high sequence homology and conservation of the residues necessary for oligosaccharide binding between Fbs1-3 and FBG3. Here we determined the crystal structure of the Skp1-FBG3 complex at a resolution of 2.6 Å. The substrate-binding domain of FBG3 is composed of a 10-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich with three helices. Although the overall structure of FBG3 is similar to that of Fbs1, the residues that form the Fbs1 carbohydrate-binding pocket failed to be superposed with the corresponding residues of FBG3. Structure-based mutational analysis shows that distinct hydrogen bond networks of four FBG3 loops, i.e., β2-β3, β5-β6, β7-β8, and β9-β10, prevent the formation of the carbohydrate-binding pocket shown in Fbs1."

A mutant strain was obtained using UV mutagenesis, showing faster growth and differences in pellet formation besides higher production levels. Here, we show the first proteome study of a marine fungus. Comparative proteomics were applied to gain deeper understanding of the regulation of production and of the physiology of the wild type strain and its mutant. For this purpose, an optimised protein extraction protocol was established. In total, 4759 proteins were identified. The central metabolic pathway of strain LF580 was mapped using the KEGG pathway analysis and GO annotation. Employing iTRAQ labelling, 318 proteins were shown to be significantly regulated in the mutant strain: 189 were down- and 129 upregulated. Proteomics are a powerful tool for the understanding of regulatory aspects: The differences on proteome level could be attributed to limited nutrient availability in the wild type strain due to a strong pellet formation. This information can be applied for optimisation on strain and process level. The linkage between nutrient limitation and pellet formation in the non-model fungus M. brevicaulis is in consensus with the knowledge on model organisms like Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum."

The patients were divided into three groups according to surgical approach: anterior (n = 19), posterior (n = 76), and combined (n = 58). We assessed demographic variables, perioperative parameters, and clinical outcomes ≥12 months after surgery (20.5 ± 7.6 months), including Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, improvement, recovery rate, and complications.The anterior group had the most favorable preoperative conditions, including the highest preoperative JOA score (12.95 ± 1.86, p = 0.046). In contrast, the combined group had the highest occupancy ratio (48.0% ± 11.6%, p = 0.002). All groups showed significant neurological improvement at final follow-ups, with JOA recovery rates of 59.7%, 54.6%, and 68.9% in the anterior, posterior, and combined groups, respectively (p = 0.163). After multivariable adjustments, the groups did not have significantly different clinical outcomes (postoperative JOA score, p = 0.424; improvement, p = 0.424; recovery rate, p = 0.080). Further, subgroup analyses of patients with occupancy ratios ≥50% showed similar functional outcomes following the posterior and combined approaches. Overall complication rates did not differ significantly among the three approaches (p = 0.600). Occupancy ratios did not have a significant negative influence on postoperative recovery following the posterior approach.If applied appropriately, all three approaches are effective for treating MCSM. All three approaches had equivalent neurological outcomes, even in subgroups with high occupancy ratios. Further investigations of surgical approaches to MCSM are needed, particularly prospective multicenter studies with long-term follow-up."

Based on two past NAEP development periods for 17-year-old students, 1978/80 to 2012 (more optimistic) and 1992 to 2012 (more pessimistic), and demographic projections from the US Census Bureau, cognitive trends until 2060 for the entire age cohort and ethnic groups were estimated. Estimated population averages for 2060 are 103 (optimistic) or 102 (pessimistic). The average rise per decade is dec = 0.76 or 0.45 IQ points. White-Black and White-Hispanic gaps are declining by half, Asian-White gaps treble. The catch-up of minorities (their faster ability growth) contributes around 2 IQ to the general rise of 3 IQ; however, their larger demographic increase reduces the general rise at about the similar amount (-1.4 IQ). Because minorities with faster ability growth also rise in their population proportion the interactive term is positive (around 1 IQ). Consequences for economic and societal development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2235894871,"Background Scabies, a highly pruritic and contagious mite infestation of the skin, is endemic among tropical regions and causes a substantial proportion of skin disease among lower-income countries. Delayed treatment can lead to bacterial superinfection, and treatment of close contacts is necessary to prevent reinfestation. We describe scabies incidence and superinfection among children in American Samoa (AS) to support scabies control recommendations. Methodology/Principal Findings We reviewed 2011–2012 pharmacy records from the only AS pharmacy to identify children aged ≤14 years with filled prescriptions for permethrin, the only scabicide available in AS. Medical records of identified children were reviewed for physician-diagnosed scabies during January 1, 2011–December 31, 2012. We calculated scabies incidence, bacterial superinfection prevalence, and reinfestation prevalence during 14–365 days after first diagnosis. We used log binomial regression to calculate incidence ratios for scabies by age, sex, and county. Medical record review identified 1,139 children with scabies (incidence 29.3/1,000 children aged ≤14 years); 604 (53%) had a bacterial superinfection. Of 613 children who received a scabies diagnosis during 2011, 94 (15.3%) had one or more reinfestation. Scabies incidence varied significantly among the nine counties (range 14.8–48.9/1,000 children). Children aged <1 year had the highest incidence (99.9/1,000 children). Children aged 0–4 years were 4.9 times more likely and those aged 5–9 years were 2.2 times more likely to have received a scabies diagnosis than children aged 10–14 years. Conclusions/Significance Scabies and its sequelae cause substantial morbidity among AS children. Bacterial superinfection prevalence and frequent reinfestations highlight the importance of diagnosing scabies and early treatment of patients and close contacts. Investigating why certain AS counties have a lower scabies incidence might help guide recommendations for improving scabies control among counties with a higher incidence. We recommend interventions targeting infants and young children who have frequent close family contact."
https://openalex.org/W2125079109,"The ferret is a suitable small animal model for preclinical evaluation of efficacy of antiviral drugs against various influenza strains, including highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Rigorous pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) assessment of ferret data has not been conducted, perhaps due to insufficient information on oseltamivir PK. Here, based on PK data from several studies on both uninfected and influenza-infected groups (i.e., with influenza A viruses of H5N1 and H3N2 subtypes and an influenza B virus) and several types of anesthesia we developed a population PK model for the active compound oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in the ferret. The ferret OC population PK model incorporated delayed first-order input, two-compartment distribution, and first-order elimination to successfully describe OC PK. Influenza infection did not affect model parameters, but anesthesia did. The conclusion that OC PK was not influenced by influenza infection must be viewed with caution because the influenza infections in the studies included here resulted in mild clinical symptoms in terms of temperature, body weight, and activity scores. Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine that administration of a 5.08 mg/kg dose of oseltamivir phosphate to ferret every 12 h for 5 days results in the same median OC area under the plasma concentration-time curve 0–12 h (i.e., 3220 mg h/mL) as that observed in humans during steady state at the approved dose of 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. Modeling indicated that PK variability for OC in the ferret model is high, and can be affected by anesthesia. Therefore, for proper interpretation of PK/PD data, sparse PK sampling to allow the OC PK determination in individual animals is important. Another consideration in appropriate design of PK/PD studies is achieving an influenza infection with pronounced clinical symptoms and efficient virus replication, which will allow adequate evaluation of drug effects."
https://openalex.org/W2298766913,"Cancer cells have a high iron requirement and many experimental studies, as well as clinical trials, have demonstrated that iron chelators are potential anti-cancer agents. The ligand, 2-benzoylpyridine 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT), demonstrates both potent anti-neoplastic and anti-retroviral properties. In this study, Bp4eT and its recently identified amidrazone and semicarbazone metabolites were examined and compared with respect to their anti-proliferative activity towards cancer cells (HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia, MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma, HCT116 human colon carcinoma and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma), non-cancerous cells (H9c2 neonatal rat-derived cardiomyoblasts and 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts) and their interaction with intracellular iron pools. Bp4eT was demonstrated to be a highly potent and selective anti-neoplastic agent that induces S phase cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Both semicarbazone and amidrazone metabolites showed at least a 300-fold decrease in cytotoxic activity than Bp4eT towards both cancer and normal cell lines. The metabolites also lost the ability to: (1) promote the redox cycling of iron; (2) bind and mobilize iron from labile intracellular pools; and (3) prevent 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-labeled transferrin by MCF-7 cells. Hence, this study demonstrates that the highly active ligand, Bp4eT, is metabolized to non-toxic and pharmacologically inactive analogs, which most likely contribute to its favorable pharmacological profile. These findings are important for the further development of this drug candidate and contribute to the understanding of the structure-activity relationships of these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1896984480,"The role of general practitioners (GPs) as reservoir and potential source for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) transmission is unknown. Our primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of SA and community-acquired methicillin resistant SA (CA-MRSA) carrier status (including spa typing) among GPs and their patients in Belgium. The secondary objective was to determine the association between SA/CA-MRSA carriage in patients and their characteristics, SA carriage in GPs, GP and practice characteristics.The Belgian GPs, who swabbed their patients in the APRES study (which assessed the prevalence of SA nasal carriage in nine European countries; November 2010 -June 2011), were asked to swab themselves as well (May-June 2011). GPs and their patients had to complete a questionnaire on factors related to SA carriage and transmission. SA isolation including CA-MRSA and spa typing was performed on the swabs.In eighteen practices 34 GPs swabbed patients of which 25 GPs provided personal swabs. The analysis was performed on 3008 patient records. Among GPs SA carriage (28%) was more prevalent than among their patients (19.2%), but CA-MRSA carriage was not present. SA was more prevalent among younger patients and those living with cattle. Spa typing SA and MRSA strains did not suggest correlation within practices or between patients and GPs, but chronic skin conditions of GPs and always handshaking patients by SA positive GPs were associated with more SA among patients, and hand washing after every patient contact with less SA among patients in practices with high antibiotic prescribing rates.No MRSA was found among GPs, although their SA carriership was higher compared to their patients'. Spa types did not cluster within practices, possibly due to difference in timing of swabbing. To minimise SA transmission to their patients GPs should consider taking appropriate care of their chronic skin diseases, antibiotic prescribing behaviour, handshaking and hand washing habits."

https://openalex.org/W2341259053,"To prospectively evaluate the changes in fatty acid concentration after administrating a 60% high-fat diet to a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease rat model and to perform a correlation analysis between fatty acid with molecular diffusion (Dtrue), perfusion-related diffusion (Dfast), and perfusion fraction (Pfraction).This prospective study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a 60% high-fat diet until the study was finished. Point-resolved spectroscopy sequence 1H-MRS with TR = 1,500 msec, TE = 35 msec, NEX = 64, and 8×8×8 mm3 voxel was used to acquire magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed on a two-dimensional multi-b value spin echo planar image with the following parameters: repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4500 /63; field of view, 120×120 msec2; matrix, 128×128; section thickness, 3 mm; number of repetition, 8; and multiple b value, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500, 1000 sec/mm2. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy data (control) were acquired. 1H proton MRS and diffusion-weighted imaging were obtained every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The individual contributions of the true molecular diffusion and the incoherent motions of water molecules in the capillary network to the apparent diffusion changes were estimated using a least-square nonlinear fitting in MatLab. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare each week's fatty acid mean quantification. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between each fatty acid (e.g., total lipid (TL), total saturated fatty acid (TSFA), total unsaturated fatty acid (TUSFA), total unsaturated bond (TUSB), and polyunsaturated bond (PUSB)) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) mapping images (e.g., Dtrue, Dfast, and Pfraction).The highest mean TL value was at week 8 (0.278 ± 0.10) after the administration of the 60% high-fat diet, followed by weeks 6, 4, 2, and 0. The concentration level (16.99±2.29) of TSFA at week 4 was the highest. No significant differences in the concentrations of TUSFA, TUSB, or PUSB were observed in different weeks.After the administration of the 60% high-fat diet in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease model, TL and TSFA depositions had significant changes. The mean concentrations of TUSFA, TUSB, PUSB did not significantly change. Total unsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated bond showed positive correlations with Dtrue and Pfraction."
https://openalex.org/W2337887086,"Ex vivo generated monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC)-vaccines have long been touted as promising immunotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment, although the response rate generally remains low. The reasons for this are still unclear and confounded by the diversity in manufacturing protocols that may affect moDC function. Preclinical studies have shown that the stimulatory function of dendritic cells can be improved by engaging invariant NKT cells in vivo through the presentation of the glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide via CD1d. However, expression of CD1d on moDC has been shown to be negatively correlated with expression of CD1a, which in turn has been suggested to be a surrogate marker for IL-12 secreting type-1 polarized moDC, the preferred functional characteristics for cancer vaccines. Here we challenge this notion by showing that plasma-derived lipids drive functional levels of CD1d expression, while CD1a expression can vary considerably in these cells without being correlated with a loss of polarization or immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2108334763,"The label switching problem occurs as a result of the nonidentifiability of posterior distribution over various permutations of component labels when using Bayesian approach to estimate parameters in mixture models. In the cases where the number of components is fixed and known, we propose a relabelling algorithm, an allocation variable-based (denoted by AVP) probabilistic relabelling approach, to deal with label switching problem. We establish a model for the posterior distribution of allocation variables with label switching phenomenon. The AVP algorithm stochastically relabel the posterior samples according to the posterior probabilities of the established model. Some existing deterministic and other probabilistic algorithms are compared with AVP algorithm in simulation studies, and the success of the proposed approach is demonstrated in simulation studies and a real dataset."
