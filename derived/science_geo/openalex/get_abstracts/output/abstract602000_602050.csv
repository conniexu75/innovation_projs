However, an ideal method to determine leg dominance in relation to task performance is still lacking.To test the agreement between self-reported and observed leg dominance in bilateral mobilizing and unilateral stabilizing tasks, and to assess whether the dominant leg switches between bilateral mobilizing tasks and unilateral stabilizing tasks.Cross-sectional study.Forty-one healthy adults: 21 men aged 36 ± 17 years old and 20 women aged 36 ±15 years old.Participants self-reported leg dominance in the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire-Revised (WFQ-R), and leg dominance was observed during performance of four bilateral mobilizing tasks and two unilateral stabilizing tasks. Descriptive statistics and crosstabs were used to report the percentages of agreement.The leg used to kick a ball had 100% agreement between the self-reported and observed dominant leg for both men and women. The dominant leg in kicking a ball and standing on one leg was the same in 66.7% of the men and 85.0% of the women. The agreement with jumping with one leg was lower: 47.6% for men and 70.0% for women.It is appropriate to ask healthy adults: ""If you would shoot a ball on a target, which leg would you use to shoot the ball?"" to determine leg dominance in bilateral mobilizing tasks. However, a considerable number of the participants switched the dominant leg in a unilateral stabilizing task."
https://openalex.org/W2778747082,"Background Across European countries, differences exist in biosimilar policies, leading to variations in uptake of biosimilars and divergences in savings all over Europe. Objectives The aim of this article is to provide an overview of different initiatives and policies that may influence the uptake of biosimilars in different European countries. Recommendations will be formulated on how to create sustainable uptake. Methods An overview of policies on biosimilars was obtained via a questionnaire, supplemented with relevant articles. Topics were organized in five themes: availability, pricing, reimbursement, demand-side policies, and recommendations to enhance uptake. Results In all countries studied, biological medicines are available. Restrictions are mainly dependent on local organization of the healthcare system. Countries are willing to include biosimilars for reimbursement, but for commercial reasons they are not always marketed. In two thirds of countries, originator and biosimilar products may be subjected to internal reference pricing systems. Few countries have implemented specific incentives targeting physicians. Several countries are implementing pharmacist substitution; however, the scope and rules governing such substitution tend to vary between these countries. Reported educational policies tend to target primarily physicians, whereas fewer initiatives were reported for patients. Recommendations as proposed by the different country experts ranged from the need for information and communication on biosimilars to competitive pricing, more support for switching and guidance on substitution. Conclusions Most countries have put in place specific supply-side policies for promoting access to biosimilars. To supplement these measures, we propose that investments should be made to clearly communicate on biosimilars and educate stakeholders. Especially physicians need to be informed on the entry and use of biosimilars in order to create trust. When physicians are well-informed on the treatment options, further incentives should be offered to prescribe biosimilars. Gainsharing can be used as an incentive to prescribe, dispense or use biosimilars. This approach, in combination with binding quota, may support a sustainable biosimilar market."

Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide (AβOs) are thought to be proximal neurotoxins involved in early neuronal oxidative stress and synapse damage, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and memory impairment in AD. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) against the deleterious impact of AβOs on hippocampal neurons. To this end, we established transwell cocultures of rat hippocampal neurons and MSCs. We show that MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles protect neurons against AβO-induced oxidative stress and synapse damage, revealed by loss of pre- and postsynaptic markers. Protection by MSCs entails three complementary mechanisms: 1) internalization and degradation of AβOs; 2) release of extracellular vesicles containing active catalase; and 3) selective secretion of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor to the medium. Results support the notion that MSCs may represent a promising alternative for cell-based therapies in AD.

AD begins with loss of recent memories and progresses to include loss of consolidated memories and deficits in several cognitive domains, finally depriving patients of their sense of self. The disease poses a great threat to older individuals and their families, becoming a serious socioeconomic problem with increasing longevity. Although considerable insight has been gained into mechanisms of pathogenesis of AD, no treatments are currently available to effectively halt or reverse its progression.

However, the mechanisms underlying those neuroprotective actions of MSCs have not been elucidated. It is generally accepted that MSCs do not exert their beneficial actions through direct differentiation into neural tissue, but rather by acting as trophic mediators releasing immune modulatory, proangiogenic, and/or proneurogenic factors (15Caplan A.I.

Additional mechanisms involved in paracrine signaling promoted by MSCs include the secretion of specific cytokines (16Montemurro T. Viganò M. Ragni E. Barilani M. Parazzi V. Boldrin V. Lavazza C.

Here, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of MSCs in an in vitro model of AD, to gain insight into possible mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication (20Lindoso R.S. Sandim V. Collino F. Carvalho A.B. Dias J. da Costa M.R. Zingali R.B. Vieyra A.

We demonstrate that MSCs and MSC-derived EVs block oxidative stress and synapse damage induced by AβOs in hippocampal neurons and unveil novel neuroprotective mechanisms of action of MSCs, namely the clearance of extracellular AβOs, selective secretion of cytokines, and the release of active catalase via EVs. We initially evaluated the effects of exposure of MSCs to AβOs (500 nm) by investigating cell viability (Fig. 1, A–C), proliferation (Fig. 1, D–F), oxidative stress (measured by levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); Fig. 1, G and H), and cellular respiration (via high-resolution respirometry) following exposure to oligomers (Fig. 1I). ROS levels in MSCs were barely detectable (see below). No changes in viability, proliferation rate, intracellular ROS levels, or respiratory parameters of MSCs were detected in AβO-exposed cultures (Fig. 1). To investigate the protective potential of MSCs against neuronal oxidative stress induced by AβOs (21De Felice F.G. Velasco P.T. Lambert M.P. Viola K. Fernandez S.J. Ferreira S.T. Klein W.L.

Representative DCF fluorescence images of vehicle-, AβO-, or H2O2-exposed neurons are shown in Fig. 2, A–D, E–H, or I–L, respectively. The large increases in ROS levels induced by AβOs (Fig. 2M) or H2O2 (Fig. 2N) were fully prevented when neurons were cocultured with MSCs. No evidence of increased cellular oxidative stress was detected in MSCs exposed to AβOs (Fig. 2O) or H2O2 (not shown). In line with previous studies (e.g. see Ref. 24De Felice F.G. Wu D. Lambert M.P.

Double immunolabeling for pre- and postsynaptic markers, synaptophysin and PSD-95, respectively, was used to assess the impact of AβOs on synapses and the possible protective action of MSCs. Compared with vehicle-treated cultures, hippocampal neurons exposed to AβOs presented a significant reduction in levels of PSD-95, and this reduction was blocked by coculture with MSCs (Fig. 3, A–E). Levels of the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, showed a trend, albeit not statistically significant, of reduction in neurons exposed to AβOs, and this trend was also prevented in the presence of MSCs (Fig. 3F). Quantification of co-localized PSD-95 and synaptophysin puncta, a measure of synapse density, revealed that exposure to AβOs reduced the density of synapses (Fig. 3G) proportionally to the decrease in PSD-95 abundance. Significantly, coculture with MSCs prevented AβO-induced synapse loss. Next, we investigated whether protection against neuronal oxidative stress and synapse loss could be related to MSC-mediated clearance of AβOs from the culture medium. Dot-immunoblotting (using oligomer-sensitive antibody NU4) (25De Felice F.G. Vieira M.N.N. Saraiva L.M. Figueroa-Villar J.D. Garcia-Abreu J. Liu R. Chang L. Klein W.L. Ferreira S.T.

Results showed a time-dependent reduction in AβO immunoreactivity in the culture medium of MSCs, suggesting that AβOs were internalized (Fig. 4A, top and middle lanes). Control experiments showed no decrease in AβO immunoreactivity in the medium when oligomers were applied onto gelatin-coated coverslips immersed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F-12–filled wells in the absence of cultured MSCs (not shown) or when AβOs were incubated under identical conditions with HEK293 cells instead of MSCs (Fig. 4A, bottom lane). All lanes were quantified by densitometry, as shown in the graph (Fig. 4B). To directly determine whether MSCs internalized AβOs, we used fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 4C shows that fluorescent HyLite AβOs (prepared using HyLite Aβ, as described under “Methods”) were bound to the surface of MSCs after 20 min of exposure and remained bound 3 h after exchange of the medium containing oligomers for fresh medium (Fig. 4D). Internalization of AβOs by MSCs was evidenced by orthogonal section analysis of confocal images obtained after 72 h (Fig. 4E). Next, we evaluated the dynamics of internalization by continuously exposing MSCs to 500 nm AβOs for different time intervals and removing the oligomer-containing medium immediately before image acquisition. Under these conditions, AβOs were found to be bound to the external surface of the membrane of MSCs after 1 h of exposure (not shown) and were internalized by ∼75% of the cells 3 h later (Fig. 4F). The presence of AβOs in roughly globular cytoplasmic structures (indicated by arrows in the representative image shown in Fig. 4F) suggests that oligomers were contained within an intracellular compartment in MSCs. After 24 h of exposure to AβOs, the proportion of cells presenting intense oligomer labeling decreased to 50%, and oligomer fluorescence signal was absent or extremely weak in the remaining cells (Fig. 4G). The percentage of cells positive for oligomer signal further decreased to 40% after 48 h of exposure to AβOs (Fig. 4H). To determine how MSCs process internalized AβOs, we investigated whether oligomers co-localized with endosomal (early endosome antigen 1; EEA1) and lysosomal (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1; LAMP-1) markers. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that AβOs co-localize with both EEA1 (Fig. 5, A–D) and LAMP-1 (Fig. 5, E–L). Treatment of MSCs with the lysosomal protease inhibitor, E64d, resulted in significantly increased AβO immunoreactivity, which almost completely co-localized with LAMP-1 labeling, within ∼100% of the cells after 24 h (Fig. 5, J and K). In the course of our study, we found that MSCs internalized polystyrene beads, which were encountered within acidic, LysoTracker-positive compartments in ∼66% of the cells after 3 h of incubation. In line with the results described above, AβOs added to the culture medium were internalized by MSCs and accumulated in the same LysoTracker-positive compartments (Fig. 6, A–D), suggesting that the same internalization pathway was utilized by both beads and AβOs. Because the internalization of polystyrene beads showed that MSCs exhibit endocytic capacity for larger particles, we asked whether MSCs would also be able to internalize and degrade larger amyloid aggregates. This was indeed confirmed for Aβ fibrillar aggregates; after 3 h of exposure of cells to fibrillar Aβ (instead of AβOs), thioflavin S–labeled amyloid aggregates were clearly detected within LAMP-1-positive compartments in MSCs (Fig. 6E). To determine whether MSCs might protect neurons from the toxic impact of AβOs via the release of neuroprotective cytokines, we measured a panel of cytokines in the culture medium of MSCs either alone or in coculture with hippocampal neurons, and exposed or not to AβOs. For all cytokines detected in the multiplex assay we used, exposure to AβOs did not modify cytokine levels in the culture medium of MSCs alone, as illustrated for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Fig. 7 (A–C), white bars). Furthermore, fractalkine, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels in the culture medium of hippocampal neuronal cultures alone or in coculture with MSCs were not modified by exposure to AβOs. Interestingly, however, levels of IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF in the culture medium of hippocampal neuronal cultures were up-regulated by coculture with MSCs, both in the absence and in the presence of AβOs (Fig. 7). In the case of VEGF, exposure to AβOs further increased the levels secreted to the culture medium compared with vehicle-treated MSC/neuronal cocultures (Fig. 7C). To establish whether the release of IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF to the culture medium was mechanistically connected to the protection of neurons against oxidative stress induced by AβOs, we performed experiments in which the three cytokines were blocked by neutralizing antibodies added to the cultured medium. To this end, we cocultured MSCs with neurons for 24 h in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 (0.5 μg/ml; R&D Systems), IL-10 (1 μg/ml; BD Pharmingen), and VEGF (1 μg/ml; Avastin®, Roche Applied Science) and then exposed the cultures to AβOs (500 nm) or vehicle for 24 h. Representative DCF fluorescence images of neurons exposed to vehicle, AβOs, AβOs + MSCs, or AβOs + MSCs + cytokine-neutralizing antibodies, respectively, are shown in Fig. 7 (D–G). Consistent with the results described above, the large increase in ROS levels induced by AβOs was fully prevented when neurons were cocultured with MSCs (Fig. 7, E and F). However, neurons cocultured with MSCs in the presence of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 7G) presented ROS levels similar to those of cultures exposed to AβOs alone (Fig. 7H). We further asked whether the release of EVs by MSCs could constitute an additional protective mechanism against neuronal damage induced by AβOs. To investigate this possibility, we first characterized the EV population secreted by MSCs. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed different types of extracellular vesicles exhibiting different morphologies and size distributions. Most of the observed vesicles were small rounded vesicles ranging from ∼30 to 200 nm (Fig. 8, A–C), suggesting that these particles represent exosomes. A second/minor vesicular population with size ranging from ∼200 to 900 nm, consistent with microvesicles, was also detected (Fig. 8, D and E). Analysis of the frequency distribution of vesicle diameter in TEM images (n = 104 vesicles) indicated that most of the vesicles ranged between 30 and 200 nm (Fig. 8F). Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA; Fig. 8H) revealed that MSCs in culture secrete EVs (4.810 ± 1.39 particles/ml) with two populations of different sizes, with a mean particle diameter of 168.1 ± 5.3 nm and modal particle diameter of 97.8 ± 3.9 nm. The population exhibiting smaller mean diameter (85.7 ± 3.5 nm) corresponds to exosomes (ranging in dimeter from 30 to 200 nm), and the population exhibiting larger mean diameter (288.6 ± 15.6 nm) constitutes microvesicles (ranging in diameter from 100 to 1,000 nm). The distributions of particle diameters obtained from TEM and NTA analyses were in excellent agreement and indicated that EVs secreted by MSCs and isolated under our conditions comprised predominantly exosomes (consistent with dot blot analysis showing that EVs are immunoreactive for exosome-associated tetraspanins, CD81 and CD63, two typical exosome markers; Fig. 8G), with microvesicles corresponding to about 35% of the total population of secreted vesicles. The EVs released from MSCs were further characterized by flow cytometry using CD90.1 as a marker of MSC-derived microvesicles (28L Ramos T. Sánchez-Abarca L.I. Muntión S. Preciado S. Puig N.

Based on a total count of 106 particles detected, 10.1% were CD90.1-positive (Fig. 8, I–K), consistent with EVs comprising predominantly exosomes. An interesting property of EVs is their stability to cryopreservation. Because EVs have little water, they can be freeze/thawed without significant changes in their physical characteristics (29Sokolova V. Ludwig A.-K. Hornung S. Rotan O. Horn P.A. Epple M. Giebel B. Characterisation of exosomes derived from human cells by nanoparticle tracking analysis and scanning electron microscopy.Colloids Surfaces B Biointerfaces. 2011; 87 (21640565): 146-15010.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.05.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NTA results did not indicate any change in particle number when comparing fresh and frozen EVs (not shown). This indicates that EVs can be isolated from MSCs and cryopreserved for future use in neuroprotection. To determine whether EVs protected neurons against AβO-induced oxidative stress, two different doses of MSC-derived EVs (8 × 107 EV particles or 2.4 × 108 EV particles) were incubated with neurons (50,000 per coverslip) previously exposed to AβOs (500 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The lower dose of EVs used corresponds to the amount secreted by the MSCs used in coculture with neurons in the experiments described above. Four hours later, determination of neuronal ROS levels demonstrated that EVs completely restored basal levels of ROS, reversing the deleterious increase induced by AβOs (Fig. 9). We hypothesized that EVs could exert their protective action against neuronal oxidative stress via secretion of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. catalase). Indeed, we found that MSC-derived EVs harbor significant catalase activity (Fig. 10A). Nonetheless, it is well known that EVs may contain a large number of proteins, miRNAs, and metabolites. To determine whether catalase contained in MSC-derived EVs was directly involved in neuroprotection, we treated EVs with the membrane-permeant specific catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, prior to the addition of EVs to neuronal cultures. Control measurements confirmed that treatment with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole fully inhibited catalase activity in EVs (Fig. 10, B and C). Significantly, inhibition of catalase activity abrogated the capacity of MSC-derived EVs to protect neurons against AβO-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 10, D–H). Finally, we investigated whether MSC-released EVs could protect neurons against synapse damage induced by AβOs. MSC-derived EVs (2.4 × 108 particles) were incubated for 22 h with neurons (50,000 per coverslip) previously exposed to AβOs (500 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C, and cells were fixed for evaluation of synapse integrity (revealed by co-localization of synaptophysin and PSD-95–immunoreactive punctae). As shown in Fig. 11, EVs protected synapses from damage induced by AβOs. Several therapeutic strategies are under investigation to prevent or delay the neurodegenerative process that occurs in AD. Considerable evidence supports a central role of AβOs in triggering harmful events that initiate neuronal oxidative stress and synapse damage leading to cognitive decline in AD (5Ferreira S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2777833898,"Aims Cross-sectional studies demonstrated associations of several sociodemographic and psychosocial factors with generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents. However, little is known about factors affecting the change in child and adolescent HRQoL over time. This study investigates potential psychosocial risk and protective factors of child and adolescent HRQoL based on longitudinal data of a German population-based study. Methods Data from the BELLA study gathered at three measurement points (baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups) were investigated in n = 1,554 children and adolescents aged 11 to 17 years at baseline. Self-reported HRQoL was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-10 Index. We examined effects of sociodemographic factors, mental health problems, parental mental health problems, as well as potential personal, familial, and social protective factors on child and adolescent HRQoL at baseline as well as over time using longitudinal growth modeling. Results At baseline, girls reported lower HRQoL than boys, especially in older participants; low socioeconomic status and migration background were both associated with low HRQoL. Mental health problems as well as parental mental health problems were negatively, self-efficacy, family climate, and social support were positively associated with initial HRQoL. Longitudinal analyses revealed less increase of HRQoL in girls than boys, especially in younger participants. Changes in mental health problems were negatively, changes in self-efficacy and social support were positively associated with the change in HRQoL over time. No effects were found for changes in parental mental health problems or in family climate on changes in HRQoL. Moderating effects for self-efficacy, family climate or social support on the relationships between the investigated risk factors and HRQoL were not found. Conclusion The risk factor mental health problems negatively and the resource factors self-efficacy and social support positively affect the development of HRQoL in young people, and should be considered in prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2780911498,"ESBL-producing bacteria are present in wildlife and the environment might serve as a resistance reservoir. Wild gulls have been described as frequent carriers of ESBL-producing E. coli strains with genotypic characteristics similar to strains found in humans. Therefore, potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria between the human population and wildlife need to be further investigated. Occurrence and characterization of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish wild gulls were assessed and compared to isolates from humans, livestock and surface water collected in the same country and similar time-period. Occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is about three times higher in gulls compared to Swedish community carriers (17% versus 5%) and the genetic characteristics of the ESBL-producing E. coli population in Swedish wild gulls and Swedish human are similar. ESBL-plasmids IncF- and IncI1-type carrying ESBL-genes blaCTX-M-15 or blaCTX-M-14 were most common in isolates from both gulls and humans, but there was limited evidence of clonal transmission. Isolates from Swedish surface water harbored similar genetic characteristics, which highlights surface waters as potential dissemination routes between wildlife and the human population. Even in a low-prevalence country such as Sweden, the occurrence of ESBL producing E. coli in wild gulls and the human population appears to be connected and the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is likely a case of environmental pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2777094228,"DNA-binding proteins play pivotal roles in alternative splicing, RNA editing, methylating and many other biological functions for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes. Predicting the functions of these proteins from primary amino acids sequences is becoming one of the major challenges in functional annotations of genomes. Traditional prediction methods often devote themselves to extracting physiochemical features from sequences but ignoring motif information and location information between motifs. Meanwhile, the small scale of data volumes and large noises in training data result in lower accuracy and reliability of predictions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method to identify DNA-binding proteins from primary sequences alone. It utilizes two stages of convolutional neutral network to detect the function domains of protein sequences, and the long short-term memory neural network to identify their long term dependencies, an binary cross entropy to evaluate the quality of the neural networks. When the proposed method is tested with a realistic DNA binding protein dataset, it achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.2% at the Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.961. Compared with the LibSVM on the arabidopsis and yeast datasets via independent tests, the accuracy raises by 9% and 4% respectively. Comparative experiments using different feature extraction methods show that our model performs similar accuracy with the best of others, but its values of sensitivity, specificity and AUC increase by 27.83%, 1.31% and 16.21% respectively. Those results suggest that our method is a promising tool for identifying DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2778684696,"The liver plays a key role in maintaining physiological homeostasis and hepatocytes are largely responsible for this. The use of isolated primary hepatocytes has become an essential tool for the study of nutrient physiology, xenobiotic metabolism and several liver pathologies. Since hepatocytes are removed from their normal environment, the isolation procedure and in vitro culture of primary hepatocytes is partially known to induce undesired metabolic changes. We aimed to perform a thorough metabolic profiling of primary cells before, during and after isolation using state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive metabolite measurements using HPLC were performed in situ in the liver, during hepatocyte isolation using the two-step collagenase perfusion method and during in vitro cell culture for up to 48 hours. Assessment of mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ATP-linked respiration of isolated primary hepatocytes was performed using extracellular flux analysis. Primary hepatocytes displayed a drastic decrease in antioxidative-related metabolites (NADPH, NADP, GSH and GSSG) during the isolation procedure when compared to the in situ liver (P<0.001). Parallel assessment of citric acid cycle activity showed a significant decrease of up to 95% in Acetyl-CoA, Isocitrate/Citrate ratio, Succinate, Fumarate and Malate in comparison to the in situ liver (P<0.001). While the levels of several cellular energetic metabolites such as Adenosine, AMP, ADP and ATP were found to be progressively reduced during the isolation procedure and cell culture (P<0.001), higher ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge level were observed when primary cells were cultured in vitro compared to the in situ liver (P<0.05). In addition, a significant decrease in the respiratory capacity occurred after 24 hours in culture. Interestingly, this was not associated with a significant modification of ATP-linked respiration. In conclusion, major metabolic alterations occur immediately after hepatocytes are removed from the liver. These changes persist or increase during in vitro culture. These observations need to be taken into account when using primary hepatocytes for the study of metabolism or liver physiopathology."

Coiled aneurysms were classified into stable or recurrence groups according to follow-up angiogram findings. Morphological parameters, coil packing density, and hemodynamic variables were evaluated for their correlations with aneurysmal recurrence. We also calculated residual flow volumes (RFVs), a novel hemodynamic parameter used to quantify the residual aneurysm volume after simulated coiling, which has a mean fluid domain > 1.0 cm/s.Follow-up angiograms showed 24 aneurysms in the stable group and 13 in the recurrence group. Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated that maximum size, dome volume, neck width, neck area, and coil packing density were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). Among the hemodynamic parameters, aneurysms in the recurrence group had significantly larger inflow and outflow areas in the control CFD and larger RFVs in the porous media CFD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that RFV was the only independently significant factor (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.11; P = 0.016).The study findings suggest that RFV collected under porous media modeling predicts the recurrence of coiled aneurysms."
https://openalex.org/W2778249544,"Muscles produce force and power by utilizing chemical energy through ATP hydrolysis. During concentric contractions (shortening), muscles generate less force compared to isometric contractions, but consume greater amounts of energy as shortening velocity increases. Conversely, more force is generated and less energy is consumed during eccentric muscle contractions (lengthening). This relationship between force, energy use, and the velocity of contraction has important implications for understanding muscle efficiency, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood. Here we used spatially-explicit, multi-filament models of Ca2+-regulated force production within a half-sarcomere to simulate how force production, energy utilization, and the number of bound cross-bridges are affected by dynamic changes in sarcomere length. These computational simulations show that cross-bridge binding increased during slow-velocity concentric and eccentric contractions, compared to isometric contractions. Over the full ranges of velocities that we simulated, cross-bridge cycling and energy utilization (i.e. ATPase rates) increased during shortening, and decreased during lengthening. These findings are consistent with the Fenn effect, but arise from a complicated relationship between velocity-dependent cross-bridge recruitment and cross-bridge cycling kinetics. We also investigated how force production, power output, and energy utilization varied with cross-bridge and myofilament compliance, which is impossible to address under typical experimental conditions. These important simulations show that increasing cross-bridge compliance resulted in greater cross-bridge binding and ATPase activity, but less force was generated per cross-bridge and throughout the sarcomere. These data indicate that the efficiency of force production decreases in a velocity-dependent manner, and that this behavior is sensitive to cross-bridge compliance. In contrast, significant effects of myofilament compliance on force production were only observed during isometric contractions, suggesting that changes in myofilament compliance may not influence power output during non-isometric contractions as greatly as changes in cross-bridge compliance. These findings advance our understanding of how cross-bridge and myofilament properties underlie velocity-dependent changes in contractile efficiency during muscle movement."
https://openalex.org/W2780977711,"The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, usually accompanied by the presence of insulin resistance (IR) and a systemic subclinical inflammation state. Metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals seem to be protected against cardiometabolic complications. The aim of this work was to characterize phenotypically the low-grade inflammation and the IR in MHO individuals in comparison to obese individuals with MetS and control non obese. We studied two different populations: 940 individuals from the general population of Buenos Aires and 518 individuals from the general population of Venado Tuerto; grouped in three groups: metabolically healthy non-obese individuals (MHNO), MHO and obese individuals with MetS (MSO). Inflammation was measured by the levels of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C reactive protein), and we found that MHO presented an increase in inflammation when compared with MHNO (Buenos Aires: p<0.001; Venado Tuerto: p<0.001), but they did not differ from MSO. To evaluate IR we analyzed the HOMA (Homoeostatic Model Assessment) values, and we found differences between MHO and MSO (Buenos Aires: p<0.001; Venado Tuerto: p<0.001), but not between MHNO and MHO. In conclusion, MHO group would be defined as a subgroup of obese individuals with an intermediate phenotype between MHNO and MSO individuals considering HOMA, hs-CRP and central obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2776278428,"In recent years there have been major efforts to develop glycoconjugate vaccines based on the Vi polysaccharide that will protect against Salmonella enterica Typhi infections, particularly typhoid fever, which remains a major public health concern in low-income countries. The design of glycoconjugate vaccines influences the immune responses they elicit. Here we systematically test the response in mice to Vi glycoconjugates that differ in Vi chain length (full-length and fragmented), carrier protein, conjugation chemistry, saccharide to protein ratio and size. We show that the length of Vi chains, but not the ultimate size of the conjugate, has an impact on the anti-Vi IgG immune response induced. Full-length Vi conjugates, independent of the carrier protein, induce peak IgG responses rapidly after just one immunization, and secondary immunization does not enhance the magnitude of these responses. Fragmented Vi linked to CRM197 and diphtheria toxoid, but not to tetanus toxoid, gives lower anti-Vi antibody responses after the first immunization than full-length Vi conjugates, but antibody titres are similar to those induced by full-length Vi conjugates following a second dose. The chemistry to conjugate Vi to the carrier protein, the linker used, and the saccharide to protein ratio do not significantly alter the response. We conclude that Vi length and carrier protein are the variables that influence the anti-Vi IgG response to immunization the most, while other parameters are of lesser importance."
https://openalex.org/W2778645351,"One consequence of climate change is the alteration of global water fluxes, both in amount and seasonality. As a result, the seasonal difference between dry- (p < 100 mm/month) and wet-season (p > 100 mm/month) precipitation (p) has increased over land during recent decades (1980–2005). However, our analysis expanding to a 60-year period (1950–2009) showed the opposite trend. This is, dry-season precipitation increased steadily, while wet-season precipitation remained constant, leading to reduced seasonality at a global scale. The decrease in seasonality was not due to a change in dry-season length, but in precipitation rate; thus, the dry season is on average becoming wetter without changes in length. Regionally, wet- and dry-season precipitations are of opposite sign, causing a decrease in the seasonal variation of the precipitation over 62% of the terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, we found a high correlation (r = 0.62) between the change in dry-season precipitation and the trend in modelled net primary productivity (NPP), which is explained based on different ecological mechanisms. This trend is not found with wet-season precipitation (r = 0.04), These results build on the argument that seasonal water availability has changed over the course of the last six decades and that the dry-season precipitation is a key driver of vegetation productivity at the global scale."
https://openalex.org/W2781054980,"The distribution and accumulation of nanoparticle dosage in a tumor are important in evaluating the effectiveness of cancer treatment. The cell survival rate can quantify the therapeutic effect, and the survival rates after multiple treatments are helpful to evaluate the efficacy of a chemotherapy plan. We developed a mathematical tumor model based on the governing equations describing the fluid flow and particle transport to investigate the drug transportation in a tumor and computed the resulting cumulative concentrations. The cell survival rate was calculated based on the cumulative concentration. The model was applied to a subcutaneous tumor with heterogeneous vascular distributions. Various sized dextrans and doxorubicin were respectively chosen as the nanodrug carrier and the traditional chemotherapeutic agent for comparison. The results showed that: 1) the largest nanoparticle drug in the current simulations yielded the highest cumulative concentration in the well vascular region, but second lowest in the surrounding normal tissues, which implies it has the best therapeutic effect to tumor and at the same time little harmful to normal tissue; 2) on the contrary, molecular chemotherapeutic agent produced the second lowest cumulative concentration in the well vascular tumor region, but highest in the surrounding normal tissue; 3) all drugs have very small cumulative concentrations in the tumor necrotic region, where drug transport is solely through diffusion. This might mean that it is hard to kill tumor stem cells hiding in it. The current model indicated that the effectiveness of the anti-tumor drug delivery was determined by the interplay of the vascular density and nanoparticle size, which governs the drug transport properties. The use of nanoparticles as anti-tumor drug carriers is generally a better choice than molecular chemotherapeutic agent because of its high treatment efficiency on tumor cells and less damage to normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2776525133,"Recently two approaches were reported that addressed a vitally important problem in regenerative medicine, i. e. the successful treatment of wounds even under diabetic conditions. Accordingly, these studies with diabetic rabbits [Sarojini et al. PLoS One 2017, 12(4):e0174899] and diabetic mice [Müller et al. Polymers 2017, 9, 300] identified a novel (potential) target for the acceleration of wound healing in diabetes. Both studies propose a raise of the intracellular metabolic energy status via exogenous administration either of ATP, encapsulated into lipid vesicles, or of polyphosphate (polyP) micro-/nanoparticles. Recently this physiological polymer, polyP, was found to release metabolic energy in form of ATP into both the extra- and also intra-cellular space. In the present work the uptake mechanism of the amorphous polyP microparticles “Ca-polyP-MP” has been described and found to be a clathrin-dependent endocytosis import, based on inhibition studies with the inhibitor trifluoperazine, which blocks the clathrin-dependent endocytosis import. The experiments had been performed with SaOS-2 cells, by studying the uptake and distribution of the electron-dense particles into the cells, and with HUVEC cells, for analysis of the intracellular accumulation of polyP, visualized by fluorescent staining of polyP. Concurrently with the uptake of particular polyP the intracellular ATP level increased as well. In contrast to “Ca-polyP-MP” the soluble polyP, administered as “Na-polyP[Ca2+]”, did not cause an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level, suggesting a different mode of action of these two forms of polyP. Based on existing data on the effect of polyP and ATP on the induction of vascularization during wound repair, both groups (Sarojini et al. and Müller et al.) propose that the acceleration of wound repair is based on an increased metabolic energy supply directly to the regenerating wound area."

Whereas cytoplasmic pH is strongly dependent on glucose abundance and is regulated by both glucose-sensing pathways, ATP is largely unaffected and therefore cannot account for the changes in Pma1 activity. These data suggest that the pH is a second messenger of the glucose-sensing pathways. We show further that different sugars differ in their ability to control cellular acidification, in the manner of inverse agonists. We conclude that the sugar-sensing pathways act via Pma1 to invoke coordinated changes in cellular pH and metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2780211398,"HIV disease progresses more rapidly in children than adults with mortality rates exceeding 50% by 2 years of age without antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend universal treatment for all living persons with HIV, yet there is limited supporting evidence in pediatric populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether CD4 cell counts reflect immunological markers associated with disease progression in ART naïve perinatally-infected HIV+ children and adolescents and their response to ART.PBMC and plasma samples were collected from 71 HIV negative and 132 HIV+ children (65 ART naïve and 67 on ART) between ages 1-19 years from Mombasa, Kenya. Untreated HIV+ subjects were sub-categorized by high or low CD4 T cell counts. Immune activation markers CD38, HLA-DR and Ki67 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) was quantified by ELISA.HIV-infected children and adolescents with preserved CD4 cell counts had depleted CD4 percentages and CD4:CD8 ratios, and high immune activation levels. ART initiation rapidly and persistently reversed T cell activation, but failed to normalize CD4:CD8 ratios and plasma sCD14 levels.Diminished CD4 percentages and CD4:CD8 ratios along with profound immune activation occur independent of CD4 cell count thresholds in ART naïve HIV+ children and adolescents. Immediate ART initiation, as recommended in the most recent WHO guidelines may protect them from pathologic sequelae associated with persistent inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2778289551,"Many animals show altitudinal clines in size, shape and body colour. Increases in body size and reduction in the length of body appendices in colder habitats are usually attributed to improved heat conservation at lower surface-to-volume ratios (known as Bergmann's and Allen's rule, respectively). However, the patterns are more variable and sometimes reversed in small ectotherms that are affected by shortened growing seasons. Altitude can also affect colouration. The thermal melanism hypothesis predicts darker colours under cooler conditions because of a thermoregulatory advantage. Darker colours may also be favoured at high altitudes for reasons of UV protection or habitat-dependent crypsis. We studied altitudinal variation in morphology and colour in the colour-polymorphic meadow grasshopper Pseudochorthippus parallelus based on 563 individuals from 17 populations sampled between 450 and 2,500 m asl. Pronotum length did not change with altitude, while postfemur length decreased significantly in both sexes. Tegmen (forewing) length decreased in males, but not in females. The results indicate that while body size, as best quantified by pronotum length, was remarkably constant, extended appendices were reduced at high altitudes. The pattern thus follows Allen's rule, but neither Bergmann's nor converse Bergmann's rule. These results indicate that inference of converse Bergmann's rule based on measurements from appendices should be treated with some caution. Colour morph ratios showed significant changes in both sexes from lowland populations dominated by green individuals to high-altitude populations dominated by brown ones. The increase of brown morphs was particularly steep between 1,500 and 2,000 m asl. The results suggest shared control of colour in males and females and local adaptation along the altitudinal gradient following the predictions of the thermal melanism hypothesis. Interestingly, both patterns, the reduction of body appendices and the higher frequency of brown individuals, may be explained by a need for efficient thermoregulation under high-altitude conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2778795276,"Hyper activity of protooncogene c-Myc is one of the hallmarks of highly aggressive lymphomas. However, the mechanism of how c-Myc is subjected to activation and amplification is still not well defined. In this study, we use gene knockout strategy to show that targeted depletion of a well-conserved microRNA gene locus miR-144/451 initiates tumorigenesis including B-lymphoma development in aged mice. This is due, at least in part, to the direct activation of the c-Myc gene by loss of miR-144/451 expression in hematopoietic cells. Moreover, oncoprotein c-Myc inversely regulates miR-144/451 expression by directly binding to the miR-144/451 promoter region, forming a miRNA-Myc positive feedback loop to safeguard the high level of c-Myc in B-lymphocytes. We also demonstrate that this miRNA-Myc crosstalk is disrupted in human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with aberrant c-Myc expression. Therefore, our findings provide strong evidence, for the first time, that deficiency of miR-144/451 expression may play a bona fide role in derepression of silenced c-Myc, which contributes to tumor development including B-lymphomagenesis."

The use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome and more appropriate care and treatment. Methods We conducted a year-long exploratory study of fever syndrome among patients ≥ 1 year if age, presenting to clinical settings with an axillary temperature of ≥37.5°C and symptomatic onset of ≤5 days. Blood and naso-pharyngeal/oral-pharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected and analyzed, respectively, using AFI and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) for multi-pathogen detection of 57 potential causative agents. Furthermore, we examined numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness, and conducted demographic, clinical, and behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression to statistically establish associations with agent detection. Results From 15 September 2014–13 September 2015, 1007 febrile patients were enrolled, and 997 contributed an epidemiologic survey, including: 14% (n = 139) 1<5yrs, 19% (n = 186) 5-14yrs, and 67% (n = 672) ≥15yrs. AFI TAC and respiratory TAC were performed on 842 whole blood specimens and 385 NP/OP specimens, respectively. Of the 57 agents surveyed, Plasmodium was the most common agent detected. AFI TAC detected nucleic acid for one or more of seven microbial agents in 49% of AFI blood samples, including: Plasmodium (47%), Leptospira (3%), Bartonella (1%), Salmonella enterica (1%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Rickettsia (1%), and West Nile virus (1%). Respiratory TAC detected nucleic acid for 24 different microbial agents, including 12 viruses and 12 bacteria. The most common agents detected among our surveyed population were: Haemophilus influenzae (67%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Human Rhinovirus (25%), influenza A (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterovirus (15%) and group A Streptococcus (12%). Our epidemiologic investigation demonstrated both age and symptomatic presentation to be associated with a number of detected agents, including, but not limited to, influenza A and Plasmodium. Linear regression of fully-adjusted mean cycle threshold (Ct) values for Plasmodium also identified statistically significant lower mean Ct values for older children (20.8), patients presenting with severe fever (21.1) and headache (21.5), as well as patients admitted for in-patient care and treatment (22.4). Conclusions This study is the first to employ two syndromic TaqMan Array Cards for the simultaneous survey of 57 different organisms to better characterize the type and prevalence of detected agents among febrile patients. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the association between adjusted mean Ct values for Plasmodium and key clinical and demographic variables, which may further inform clinical decision-making based upon intensity of infection, as observed across endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2781015400,"The ‘weekend effect’ describes increased adverse outcomes after weekend hospitalization. We examined weekend-weekday differences in the outcome of 580 patients following renal transplantation (RTx, brain dead donors) between January 2007 and December 2014 at our center. 3-year patient and graft survival, incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejections and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, CKD-EPI) at 1 year as well as surgical complications were assessed. Of all 580 transplants, 416 (71.7%) were performed on weekdays (Monday-Friday) and 164 (28.3%) on weekends (Saturday-Sunday). 3-year patient and graft survival, frequencies of DGF, acute rejections and 1-year eGFR as well as length of hospital stay were similar between RTx patients transplanted on weekdays or weekends, respectively. However, a noticeable difference was detected with regard to surgical complications which were more frequent in RTx patients transplanted on weekends. All results remained consistent across all definitions of weekend status. Our results suggest that weekend transplant status does not affect functional short-term and long-term outcomes after RTx. The standardized protocols and operationalized processes applied in RTx might contribute to this finding and may provide a model for other medical procedures that are performed on weekends to improve efficiency and outcomes. The higher rate of surgical complications after weekend RTx needs further elaboration to fully assess the presence of a weekend effect in RTx."
https://openalex.org/W2779577500,"Müller cells are key to metabolic and ionic regulation in the retina. They also produce a number of inflammatory mediators and are significantly affected in diabetic retinopathy. To investigate the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in retinal Müller cells, we crossed TLR4 floxed with PDGFRα-Cre mice to eliminate TLR4 in retinal Müller cells. We performed Western blotting and ELISA analyses to determine whether loss of TLR4 affected myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88)-dependent or -independent signaling, leading to reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1β) in whole retinal lysates from the TLR4 floxed and TLR4-PDGFRα-Cre mice. Data show that TLR4-PDGFRα-Cre mice have reduced levels of both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. These studies confirm successful development of a Müller cell-specific TLR4 knockout mouse colony. These mice have reduced MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway proteins, as well as reduced TNFα and IL1β levels. These mice can be used to dissect TLR4 signaling in disorders affecting retinal Müller cells."

This paper provides empirical evidence of its effectiveness and of a limitation of neural networks for language engineering. Precisely, we demonstrate that a neural language model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) effectively reproduces Zipf's law and Heaps' law, two representative statistical properties underlying natural language. We discuss the quality of reproducibility and the emergence of Zipf's law and Heaps' law as training progresses. We also point out that the neural language model has a limitation in reproducing long-range correlation, another statistical property of natural language. This understanding could provide a direction for improving the architectures of neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W2776315213,"Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the serum brain derived neurotropic factor (BNDF) levels of patients with schizophrenia who had never received an antipsychotic treatment with those of a control group. Also, to analyze the relationship between the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scores and BDNF levels of the patients during the period they were drug-naive. Materials and methods The sample of the study comprised patients who presentedto the Psychiatry Clinic and were admitted after a distinctive schizophrenia diagnosis was made in accordance with the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis classification and who were not using and never had any antipsychotic medicine. A total of 160 participants were included in the study, 80 of whom had schizophrenia patients and 80 constituted the age- and sex-matched healthy control group. Before the start of the treatment, the serum samples to be checked for the BDNF levels were collected from the patients. Results The difference between the average BDNF levels of the groups were statistically significant (t = -5.25; p˂.001). An analysis as to whether there was a relation between the BDNF levels and the drug-naïve duration indicated no correlations. An examination of the relationship between PANSS scores and BDNF levels of the patients yielded no correlations. Discussion Serum BDNF levels seem to be one of the indicators of schizophrenia and its progress; nevertheless, we still do not have sufficient information about this neurotropic factor. In light of our study, the neurodevelopmental changes that occur at disease onset of the illness prominently affect the progress of the illness, which highlights the importance of the treatment in the early stages."
https://openalex.org/W2781316303,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer in men of average risk remains controversial. Patients’ ability to incorporate risk reduction data into their decision-making may depend on their numeracy. We assessed the impact of patients’ numeracy on their understanding of the risk reduction benefits of PSA screening. Men attending a general internal medicine clinic were invited to complete a survey. Four versions of the survey each included a three-item numeracy test and PSA risk reduction data, framed one of four ways: absolute (ARR) versus relative risk reduction (RRR), with or without baseline risk (BR). Respondents were asked to adjust their perceived risk of prostate-cancer mortality using the data presented. Accuracy of risk reduction was evaluated relative to how risk data were framed. Among a total of 200 respondents, a majority incorrectly answered one or more of the numeracy items. Overall accuracy of risk adjustment was only 20%. Accuracy varied with data framing: when presented with RRR, respondents were 13% accurate without BR and 31% accurate with BR; when presented with ARR, they were 0% accurate without BR and 35% accurate with BR. Including BR data significantly improved accuracy for both RRR (P = 0.03) and ARR groups (P < 0.01). Accuracy was significantly related to numeracy; numeracy scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were associated with accuracy rates of six, five, nine, and 36 percent, respectively (P < 0.01). Overall, numeracy was significantly associated with the accuracy of interpreting quantitative benefits of PSA screening. Alternative methods of communicating risk may facilitate shared decision-making in the use of PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2779717130,"There is a clear need for better biomarkers of drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI).We aimed to evaluate the possible prognostic value of ActiTest and FibroTest proteins apoliprotein-A1, haptoglobin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, in patients with DILI.We analyzed cases and controls included in the IMI-SAFE-T-DILI European project, from which serum samples had been stored in a dedicated biobank. The analyses of ActiTest and FibroTest had been prospectively scheduled. The primary objective was to analyze the performance (AUROC) of ActiTest components as predictors of recovery outcome defined as an ALT <2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), and BILI <2x ULN.After adjudication, 154 patients were considered to have DILI and 22 were considered to have acute liver injury without DILI. A multivariate regression analysis (ActiTest-DILI patent pending) combining the ActiTest components without BILI and ALT (used as references), apolipoprotein-A1, haptoglobin, alpha-2-macroglobulin and GGT, age and gender, resulted in a significant prediction of recovery with 67.0% accuracy (77/115) and an AUROC of 0.724 (P<0.001 vs. no prediction 0.500). Repeated apolipoprotein-A1 and haptoglobin remained significantly higher in the DILI cases that recovered (n = 65) versus those that did not (n = 16), at inclusion, at 4-8 weeks and at 8-12 weeks. The same results were observed after stratification on APAP cases and non-APAP cases.We identified that apolipoprotein-A1 and haptoglobin had significant predictive values for the prediction of recovery at 12 weeks in DILI, enabling the construction of a new prognostic panel, the DILI-ActiTest, which needs to be independently validated."
https://openalex.org/W2780514704,"Background and aim Overground gait assessment is limited by the analysis of multiple strides or both spatiotemporal gait characteristics, while fixed speed treadmill walking restricts natural gait speed variations. The Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL)-based 6-minute walk test (6MWT) enables 3D motion analysis and self-paced treadmill walking, and could provide insight in gait alterations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study is to compare spatiotemporal gait characteristics between patients with COPD and healthy elderly during the GRAIL-based 6MWT. Materials and methods Eighty COPD patients (60% male; 62±7 years; FEV1:56±19% predicted) and 38 healthy elderly (63% male; 62±6 years; FEV1:119±17% predicted) performed two GRAIL-based 6MWTs. Mean differences and coefficient of variation of spatiotemporal gait characteristics were calculated using the trial with the largest walk distance. Sub-analyses were conducted to account for walking speed differences between groups, and muscle strength and COPD severity within the patient group. Results COPD patients showed increased temporal gait characteristics, decreased stride and step lengths, and increased gait variability compared to healthy elderly (p<0.01). Stride length variability remained increased in COPD after correction for walking speed (MD:0.98%, CI:0.36–1.61, p = 0.003). Reduced quadriceps strength did not translate into altered gait characteristics, while COPD severity is associated with stride time (left MD:-0.02s, CI:-0.04–0.01, p = 0.003; right MD:-0.02s, CI:-0.04–0.01, p = 0.003). Discussion COPD patients performed the GRAIL-based 6MWT differently compared to healthy elderly. Further research should use other variability measures to investigate gait characteristics in COPD, to assess subtle alterations in gait and to enable development of rehabilitation strategies to improve gait, and possibly balance and fall risk in COPD. Other lower limb muscle groups should be considered when investigating gait alterations in COPD. Conclusion COPD patients have different gait characteristics compared to healthy elderly. Independent of walking speed, COPD patients demonstrate increased stride length variability during the GRAIL-based 6MWT compared to healthy elderly."

The valid assessment of reaction time (RT) and other well-documented risk factors for falls are mainly restricted to specialized clinics due to the equipment needed. The Nintendo Wii Balance Board has the potential to be a multi-modal test and intervention instrument for these risk factors, however, reference data are lacking.To provide RT reference data and to characterize the age-related changes in RT measured by the Nintendo Wii Balance Board.Healthy participants were recruited at various locations and their RT in hands and feet were tested by six assessors using the Nintendo Wii Balance Board. Reference data were analysed and presented in age-groups, while the age-related change in RT was tested and characterized with linear regression models.354 participants between 20 and 99 years of age were tested. For both hands and feet, mean RT and its variation increased with age. There was a statistically significant non-linear increase in RT with age. The averaged difference between male and female was significant, with males being faster than females for both hands and feet. The averaged difference between dominant and non-dominant side was non-significant.This study reported reference data with percentiles for a new promising method for reliably testing RT. The RT data were consistent with previously known effects of age and gender on RT."
https://openalex.org/W2778009052,"In animal cells, activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling generally occurs when the system’s cognate signal exceeds a threshold, whereas in plant cells, both the amount and the exposure time of at least one signal, D-glucose, are used toward activation. This unusual signaling property called Dose-Duration Reciprocity, first elucidated in the genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana, is achieved by a complex that is comprised of a 7-transmembrane REGULATOR OF G SIGNALING (RGS) protein (AtRGS1), a Gα subunit that binds and hydrolyzes nucleotide, a Gβγ dimer, and three WITH NO LYSINE (WNK) kinases. D-glucose is one of several signals such as salt and pathogen-derived molecular patterns that operates through this protein complex to activate G protein signaling by WNK kinase transphosphorylation of AtRGS1. Because WNK kinases compete for the same substrate, AtRGS1, we hypothesize that activation is sensitive to the AtRGS1 amount and that modulation of the AtRGS1 pool affects the response to the stimulant. Mathematical simulation revealed that the ratio of AtRGS1 to the kinase affects system sensitivity to D-glucose, and therefore illustrates how modulation of the cellular AtRGS1 level is a means to change signal-induced activation. AtRGS1 levels change under tested conditions that mimic physiological conditions therefore, we propose a previously-unknown mechanism by which plants react to changes in their environment."
https://openalex.org/W2779807874,"Rotavirus vaccines have been introduced into national immunization programmes to mitigate morbidity and mortality associated rotavirus diarrhoea. Lower vaccine effectiveness has however been noted in low-middle income countries, but little is known about the role of maternal components found in breast milk. This study assessed the effect of lactoferrin, lactadherin, and tenascin-c on rotavirus vaccine seroconversion.This was a retrospective cohort study of 128 infants who had been fully immunized with Rotarix™. Serum samples were collected from the infant at baseline and one month after second rotavirus vaccine dose. Breast milk samples were collected from mothers at baseline. Standard ELISA was used to determine titres of rotavirus-specific immunologlobulin G and A in breast milk and serum as well as concentrations of lactoferrin, lactadherin, and tenascin-c. Poisson regression model with robust standard error was used to estimate the effect of breast milk components on seroconversion. The components were modelled on log base 2 so that the effect would be interpreted as a doubling of the concentration.In a multivariable analysis adjusting for maternal age, maternal HIV status, seropositivity at baseline, sex, age of child at vaccination as well as breast milk IgA and IgG, we found evidence of independent effect of LA (Adjusted IRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91-0.99; P = 0.019) on seroconversion while there was no evidence for TNC (Adjusted IRR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.85-1.17; P = 0.967) and LF (Adjusted RR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.96-1.05); P = 0.802). We explored the joint effects of the three components but we found no evidence (Adjusted RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81; P = 0.535).High breast milk concentrations of lactadherin might play a role in infant's failure to seroconvert to rotavirus vaccines. Further research to understand this observed association is an important consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2780476510,"Three isolates APMV/gull/Kazakhstan/5976/2014, APMV/gull/Kazakhstan/ 5977/2014 and APMV/gull/Kazakhstan/5979/2014, were obtained from independent samples during annual surveillance for avian influenza and paramyxoviruses in wild birds from the Caspian Sea coast in Western Kazakhstan, and were initially identified as putative paramyxoviruses on the basis of electron microscopy. Hemagglutination Inhibition Assays with antisera to nine known APMV serotypes (APMV1-9) indicated no relation to any of them. Next generation sequencing of whole genome sequences indicated the three isolates were genetically identical, and had a nucleotide structure typical for all APMVs, consisting of six genes 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. Phylogenetic analyses, and assessment of amino acid identities, suggested the most closely related lineages to be APMV-2, 8, 10 and 15, but the novel isolate had less than 64% identity to them and all other known avian paramyxoviruses. This value was above levels considered to generally define other APMV serotypes. Estimates of the evolutionary divergence of the nucleotide sequences of the genomes of APMVs have shown that novel Kazakhstan APMV strain was closest to APMV-2, APMV-8, APMV-10 and APMV-15, with calculated distance values of 2.057, 2.058, 2.026 and 2.286 respectively, which is above values considered to differentiate other serotypes (observed minimum was 1.108 between APMV-1 and recently isolated APMV/UPO216/Korea). Together, the data suggest that isolate APMV/gull/Kazakhstan/5976/2014 and other two should be considered as the first representative of a novel APMV-20 group, and is the first time that avian paramyxoviruses have been found infecting members of the gull family, extending the known taxonomic host range."
https://openalex.org/W2777407765,"Background Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) caused by Leishmania infantum is endemic with an epidemiological profile of a paediatric disease in Tunisia. In the context of a high fatality rate, identifying risk factors for in-hospital mortality in children treated for ZVL is of major epidemiological importance. Design A retrospective (case-control) study included 230 immuno-competent children diagnosed and confirmed with primary ZVL in the paediatric department of the University Hospital of Kairouan between 2004 and 2014. Forty-seven per cent (47%) were children under 18 months of age, and with a male ⁄ female ratio of 1.01:1. Results The overall case-fatality was 6% (n = 14). The risk factors for in-hospital death identified by a multivariate analysis were: bleeding at admission (OR = 25.5, 95% CI: 2.26–287.4; p = 0.009), white cell count less than 4000/mm3 (OR = 5.66, 95% CI: 1.16–27.6; p = 0.032), cytolysis (OR = 28.13, 95% CI: 4.55–173.6; p < 0.001), and delay between onset of symptoms and admission ≥ 15 days (OR = 11, 95% CI: 1.68–72; p = 0.012). Conclusion The results strongly suggest that paediatric patients admitted 15 days after onset of symptoms, with bleeding, white cell counts below 4,000/mm3, and cytolysis at admission should be considered severe cases and subsequently, they are at high risk of mortality. A better understanding of factors associated with death of children from ZVL may contribute to decrease mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2780421702,"The selectivity of fishing gears with respect to fish species and size is important, both for fisheries management and fishing operations. Purse seining is an efficient, environmentally friendly fish capture methodology generally targeting single species aggregations, but once a fish school has been selected and surrounded by the seine, there is no selections for individual size, species or catch quantity. A common practice for evaluating the catch is to haul the seine to a point where physical samples or inspections of catch composition can be made. The release process is called slipping and may lead to mortality in the released fish. The objective of this study was to simulate a crowding situation and investigate how the behaviour was affected in response to increased fish density, decreased oxygen levels, or a combination of the two, and to see if there is a behavioural measure that can be used to set safe crowding limits. The experiment was conducted on Mackerel (Scomber scombrus) held in net pens. The volume of the net pen was reduced to increase fish density, and a tarpaulin bag was wrapped around the pen to reduce the oxygen levels. Oxygen, fish density and space occupancy was monitored during the experiment, and the behavioural reactions was assessed using an imaging sonar. The main result was that the schooling function, i.e. the response to a predator model, was significantly reduced during crowding but not in response to hypoxia. There were some indications of a slow recovery of the function post-treatment. We conclude that crowding causes behavioural responses that occur before densities that induce fish mortality. Consequently, there is a behavioural response that could be used as a proxy for setting safe crowding limits."

The distribution of IRSp53 at the PSD in cultured hippocampal neurons was examined under basal and excitatory conditions by immuno-electron microscopy. Under basal conditions, label for IRSp53 is concentrated at the PSD. Upon depolarization by application of a medium containing 90 mM K+, the intensity of IRSp53 label at the PSD increased by 36±7%. Application of NMDA (50 μM) yielded 53±1% increase in the intensity of IRSp53 label at the PSD compared to controls treated with APV, an NMDA antagonist. The accumulation of IRSp53 label upon application of high K+ or NMDA was prominent at the deeper region of the PSD (the PSD pallium, lying 40–120 nm from the postsynaptic plasma membrane). IRSp53 molecules that accumulate at the distal region of the PSD pallium under excitatory conditions are too far from the plasma membrane to fulfill the generally recognized role of the protein as an effector of membrane-bound small GTPases. Instead, these IRSp53 molecules may have a structural role organizing the Shank scaffold and/or linking the PSD to the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2776948689,"Pests in the home are a health risk because they can be vectors for infectious disease, contribute to allergies and cause damage to buildings. The aims of this study were to record which categories of pests were reported in homes and to use a social cognition model, the health belief model, to investigate which psychological factors influence householders' intentions to control pests. An online questionnaire was completed by 413 respondents between 11 September and 31 November 2015. A large majority of respondents reported pests in or around their home within the previous year. The prevalences were: flying insects 98%, crawling insects 85%, rodents 62%, birds 58%, and moles 20%. Regression analysis for the health belief model revealed that perceiving greater benefits and fewer barriers to pest control and expecting severe consequences of zoonotic infections predicted higher intention to control pests. Intentions towards pest control were not influenced by perceiving oneself as susceptible to catching a disease from pests or health motivation (striving towards a healthy lifestyle). Intentions to engage in pest control were lower for households reporting bird prevalence. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving the effectiveness of domestic pest control should focus on increasing the benefits that individuals associate with effective pest control, lowering barriers, and on underlining the severity of the diseases that pests may carry."

Although the sequence information of the HSPB-1 gene is available for many mammalian species, the HSPB-1 gene of Arabian camel (Arabian camel HSPB-1) has not yet been structurally characterized. We cloned and functionally characterized a full-length of Arabian camel HSPB-1 cDNA. It is 791 bp long, with a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 34 bp, a 3'-UTR of 151 bp with a poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 606 bp encoding a protein of 201 amino acids (accession number: MF278354). The tissue-specific expression analysis of Arabian camel HSPB-1 mRNA was examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); which suggested that Arabian camel HSPB-1 mRNA was constitutionally expressed in all examined tissues of Arabian camel, with the predominately level in the esophagus tissue. Peptide mass fingerprint-mass spectrometry (PMF-MS) analysis of the purified Arabian camel HSPB-1 protein confirmed the identity of this protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HSPB-1 protein of Arabian camel is grouped together with those of Bactrian camel and Alpaca. Comparing the modelled 3D structure of Arabian camel HSPB-1 protein with the available protein 3D structure of HSPB-1 from human confirmed the presence of α-crystallin domain, and high similarities were noted between the two structures by using super secondary structure prediction."

After adjusting for clinical characteristics by using the Cox hazard model, site 31 (relative risk, 8.929; 95% confidence interval, 3.433–23.22; P = 0.000) in the spacer domain and sites 529 (relative risk, 5.656; 95% confidence interval, 1.599–19.999; P = 0.007) and 1078 (relative risk, 3.442; 95% confidence interval, 1.070–11.068; P = 0.038) in the reverse transcriptase domain of hepatitis B virus polymerase were identified as independent predictors of postoperative survival in hepatitis B virus related hepatocellular carcinoma. The mutations at the 31 (Ser314Pro), 529 (Asp480Asn), and 1078 (Ser663Ala) sites all resulted in amino acid changes in hepatitis B virus polymerase and were associated with shortened life-span. The 31 and 529 sites were located in the overlapping region for the PreS and S genes but did not induce amino acid substitution in these two regions. Our finding of the correlation between hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase mutations and hepatocellular carcinoma survival will help identify the patients subgroup with poor prognosis, and help the clinicians to refine the therapeutic decision individualized."
https://openalex.org/W2775952067,The predicted world population increase along with climate changes threatens sustainable agricultural supply in the coming decades. It is therefore vital to understand crops diversity associated to abiotic stress response. Heat stress is considered one of the major constrains on crops productivity thus it is essential to develop new approaches for a precocious and rigorous evaluation of varietal diversity regarding heat tolerance. Plant cell membrane thermostability (CMS) is a widely used method for wheat thermotolerance assessment although its limitations require complementary solutions. In this work we used CMS assay and explored TdHSP101C genes as an additional tool for durum wheat screening. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of TdHSP101C genes were performed in varieties with contrasting CMS results and further correlated with heat stress tolerance during fertilization and seed development. Although the durum wheat varieties studied presented a very high homology on TdHSP101C genes (>99%) the transcriptomic assessment allowed the discrimination between varieties with good CMS results and its correlation with differential impacts of heat treatment during inflorescence emergence and seed development on grain yield. The evidences here reported indicate that TdHSP101C transcription levels induced by heat stress in fully expanded leaves may be a promising complementary screening tool to discriminate between durum wheat varieties identified as thermotolerant through CMS.
https://openalex.org/W2776075891,"Epithelial pancreatic acinar cells perform crucial functions in food digestion, and acinar cell homeostasis required for secretion of digestive enzymes relies on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. The ubiquitously expressed Sec1/Munc18 protein mammalian uncoordinated-18c (Munc18c) regulates membrane fusion by activating syntaxin-4 (STX-4) to bind cognate SNARE proteins to form a SNARE complex that mediates exocytosis in many cell types. However, in the acinar cell, Munc18c's functions in exocytosis and homeostasis remain inconclusive. Here, we found that pancreatic acini from Munc18c-depleted mice (Munc18c+/−) and human pancreas (lenti-Munc18c-shRNA–treated) exhibit normal apical exocytosis of zymogen granules (ZGs) in response to physiologic stimulation with the intestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK-8). However, when stimulated with supraphysiologic CCK-8 levels to mimic pancreatitis, Munc18c-depleted (Munc18c+/−) mouse acini exhibited a reduction in pathological basolateral exocytosis of ZGs resulting from a decrease in fusogenic STX-4 SNARE complexes. This reduced basolateral exocytosis in part explained the less severe pancreatitis observed in Munc18c+/− mice after hyperstimulation with the CCK-8 analog caerulein. Likely as a result of this secretory blockade, Munc18c-depleted acini unexpectedly activated a component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response that contributed to autophagy induction, resulting in downstream accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and autolysosomes. We conclude that Munc18c's role in mediating ectopic basolateral membrane fusion of ZGs contributes to the initiation of CCK-induced pancreatic injury, and that blockade of this secretory process could increase autophagy induction. Epithelial pancreatic acinar cells perform crucial functions in food digestion, and acinar cell homeostasis required for secretion of digestive enzymes relies on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. The ubiquitously expressed Sec1/Munc18 protein mammalian uncoordinated-18c (Munc18c) regulates membrane fusion by activating syntaxin-4 (STX-4) to bind cognate SNARE proteins to form a SNARE complex that mediates exocytosis in many cell types. However, in the acinar cell, Munc18c's functions in exocytosis and homeostasis remain inconclusive. Here, we found that pancreatic acini from Munc18c-depleted mice (Munc18c+/−) and human pancreas (lenti-Munc18c-shRNA–treated) exhibit normal apical exocytosis of zymogen granules (ZGs) in response to physiologic stimulation with the intestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK-8). However, when stimulated with supraphysiologic CCK-8 levels to mimic pancreatitis, Munc18c-depleted (Munc18c+/−) mouse acini exhibited a reduction in pathological basolateral exocytosis of ZGs resulting from a decrease in fusogenic STX-4 SNARE complexes. This reduced basolateral exocytosis in part explained the less severe pancreatitis observed in Munc18c+/− mice after hyperstimulation with the CCK-8 analog caerulein. Likely as a result of this secretory blockade, Munc18c-depleted acini unexpectedly activated a component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response that contributed to autophagy induction, resulting in downstream accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and autolysosomes. We conclude that Munc18c's role in mediating ectopic basolateral membrane fusion of ZGs contributes to the initiation of CCK-induced pancreatic injury, and that blockade of this secretory process could increase autophagy induction."
https://openalex.org/W2780534562,"Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases transmitted to mammalian hosts by sand fly vectors (Diptera: Psychodidae). Despite the increasing occurrence of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in urban centers, their transmission still occur primarily in wild environments and may be associated with professional activities and recreation, such as ecotourism. The Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Santuário do Caraça (RPPNSC) is one of the largest ecotourism attractions in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and comprises an area of environmental preservation with 11,233 hectares presenting a transitional vegetation between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. The present study describes the abundance of small mammals in RPPNSC, the isolation and identification of Leishmania in five wild animals. Small mammals were bimonthly trapped along 6 trails within the RPPNSC with 10 Tomahawk traps each. Two trails were located in peridomiciliary areas near tourist lodging facilities, and four trails were located at sites visited by tourists in forest areas. The most prevalent species were Akodon cursor, Cerradomys subflavus and Oligoryzomys nigripes. Six isolates of Leishmania were obtained from these animals and identified as Leishmania braziliensis through HSP70-PCR RFLP method. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected by kDNA-PCR method and isolated by biphasic culture. Studies point to some of the captured species as potential wild reservoirs of Leishmania, suggesting they may be involved in the transmission cycle in these wild environments."
https://openalex.org/W2780945898,"Background It has been suggested that the high incidence of ribotype 078 Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in the Netherlands is related to pig farming. Methods We used data of hospitalised CDI patients (>2yrs of age) diagnosed between May 2009 and May 2015 in 26 hospitals participating in a national sentinel surveillance. We compared clinical and geographical characteristics of 078 CDI to other CDI. We investigated the association between 078 CDI incidence and four indicators of pig farming (piglet, pig, piglet farm and pig farm density) by mixed-effects Poisson regression. We used a space-time permutation model to search for community-onset 078 CDI clusters (using SaTScan). Results A total of 4,691 CDI were identified. Ribotype 078 was isolated in 493 of 3,756 patients (13.1%) including a typing result. These patients had slightly higher community-onset disease and a 35% increase of 30-day mortality compared to non-078 CDI patients. The pooled overall and 078 incidence rates were 2.82 (95% CI, 2.42–3.29) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21–0.31) CDI per 10,000 patients-days respectively. Hospital 078 CDI incidence was not associated with provincial pig (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.08), piglet (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75–1.19), pig farm (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84–1.39), or piglet farm density (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.56–1.79). No clusters of community-onset ribotype 078 CDI were found. Conclusions Our results do not indicate that the ribotype 078 CDI incidence in hospitals is related to pig (farm) or piglet (farm) density. However, transmission beyond provincial borders or in non-hospitalised patients cannot be excluded."

Participants from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT Study) were linked to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register to detect the first THR or TKR due to primary OA. A mediation analysis was used to decompose the total effect of smoking into a direct and indirect effect. BMI was considered a mediator in the analysis. All effects were estimated as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The indirect effect of smoking mediated through BMI was expressed as a percentage (proportion*100). In total 55 188 participants were followed up during 17.2 years (median). We identified 1322 THRs and 754 TKRs. For men, the total effect of current vs. never smoking revealed a decreased risk of THR (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46–0.76) and TKR (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32–0.66). For women, current smoking increased the risk of THR (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11–1.60). For men, 6% and 7% of the risk reduction for THR and TKR, respectively, was mediated by BMI. We found a negative association between smoking and THR or TKR for men. On the contrary, smoking was associated with increased risk of THR for women. Most of the effect of smoking on joint replacement risk remained unexplained by BMI."

Unknown is how changes in these covariates after listing impact transplant outcomes.Two cohorts were created from the OPTN (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) database, one pre-KAS (new kidney allocation system) (10/01/2009-12/04/2013, n = 97,793) and one post-KAS (12/04/2014-06/17/2015, n = 13,113). Multi-state modeling provides transition probabilities between intermediate states (CPRA category/activity status combinations) and competing-risk outcomes: transplant (living), transplant (deceased), death, or other/well.Transition probabilities show chances of converting between intermediate states prior to a competing-risk outcome. One year transplant probabilities for post-KAS candidates with a CPRA of 0%(P, 0.123[95% CI, 0.117,0.129]), 1-79%(P, 0.125 [95% CI, 0.112,0.139]), 95-98%(P, 0.242[95% CI, 0.188, 0.295]) and 99-100%(P, 0.252 [95% CI, 0.195, 0.308]) were significantly higher than the pre-KAS cohort; they were lower for CPRA 80-89%(P, 0.152 [95% CI, 0.116,0.189]) and not statistically different for CPRA 90-94%(P, 0.180 [95% CI, 0.137,0.223]) candidates. Post-KAS, Whites had a statistically higher transplant probability only at a CPRA of 99-100%.Multi-state modeling provides transition probabilities between CPRA/activity status combinations, giving estimates on how changing patient characteristic's after listing impact outcomes. Preliminarily, across most CPRA categories, there was no statistical difference in transplant probabilities between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics following KAS implementation, however, this finding requires longer follow-up for validation."
https://openalex.org/W2778304184,"Reactive navigation is a well-known paradigm for controlling an autonomous mobile robot, which suggests making all control decisions through some light processing of the current/recent sensor data. Among the many advantages of this paradigm are: 1) the possibility to apply it to robots with limited and low-priced hardware resources, and 2) the fact of being able to safely navigate a robot in completely unknown environments containing unpredictable moving obstacles. As a major disadvantage, nevertheless, the reactive paradigm may occasionally cause robots to get trapped in certain areas of the environment—typically, these conflicting areas have a large concave shape and/or are full of closely-spaced obstacles. In this last respect, an enormous effort has been devoted to overcome such a serious drawback during the last two decades. As a result of this effort, a substantial number of new approaches for reactive navigation have been put forward. Some of these approaches have clearly improved the way how a reactively-controlled robot can move among densely cluttered obstacles; some other approaches have essentially focused on increasing the variety of obstacle shapes and sizes that could be successfully circumnavigated; etc. In this paper, as a starting point, we choose the best existing reactive approach to move in densely cluttered environments, and we also choose the existing reactive approach with the greatest ability to circumvent large intricate-shaped obstacles. Then, we combine these two approaches in a way that makes the most of them. From the experimental point of view, we use both simulated and real scenarios of challenging complexity for testing purposes. In such scenarios, we demonstrate that the combined approach herein proposed clearly outperforms the two individual approaches on which it is built."
https://openalex.org/W2779717468,"Two experiments examine how grammatical verb aspect constrains our understanding of events. According to linguistic theory, an event described in the perfect aspect (John had opened the bottle) should evoke a mental representation of a finished event with focus on the resulting object, whereas an event described in the imperfective aspect (John was opening the bottle) should evoke a representation of the event as ongoing, including all stages of the event, and focusing all entities relevant to the ongoing action (instruments, objects, agents, locations, etc.). To test this idea, participants saw rebus sentences in the perfect and imperfective aspect, presented one word at a time, self-paced. In each sentence, the instrument and the recipient of the action were replaced by pictures (John was using/had used a *corkscrew* to open the *bottle* at the restaurant). Time to process the two images as well as speed and accuracy on sensibility judgments were measured. Although experimental sentences always made sense, half of the object and instrument pictures did not match the temporal constraints of the verb. For instance, in perfect sentences aspect-congruent trials presented an image of the corkscrew closed (no longer in-use) and the wine bottle fully open. The aspect-incongruent yet still sensible versions either replaced the corkscrew with an in-use corkscrew (open, in-hand) or the bottle image with a half-opened bottle. In this case, the participant would still respond ""yes"", but with longer expected response times. A three-way interaction among Verb Aspect, Sentence Role, and Temporal Match on image processing times showed that participants were faster to process images that matched rather than mismatched the aspect of the verb, especially for resulting objects in perfect sentences. A second experiment replicated and extended the results to confirm that this was not due to the placement of the object in the sentence. These two experiments extend previous research, showing how verb aspect drives not only the temporal structure of event representation, but also the focus on specific roles of the event. More generally, the findings of visual match during online sentence-picture processing are consistent with theories of perceptual simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2777024611,"Background Short-term and long-term exposure to prolonged sitting is associated with excess food intake and weight gain in children. Interrupting prolonged sitting with low-intensity activity has been shown to not alter hunger, satiety, or food consumption in children, however it is unclear whether interrupting sitting with high-intensity activity will alter appetite regulation in children. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of interrupting prolonged sitting with intermittent activity performed at varying intensities on hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption (PFC), and food intake in preadolescent children. Methods Thirty-nine children (ages 7–11 years, 54% female, 33% overweight/obese) completed four experimental conditions in random order: 8 hours of sitting interrupted with 20, 2-minute low-, moderate-, or high-intensity activity breaks or 20, 2-minute sedentary screen time breaks. Exercise intensity corresponded with 25%, 50% and 75% of heart rate reserve, respectively. Hunger, satiety, and PFC were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale, at five time points (pre- and post-breakfast, pre- and post-lunch, and pre-dinner) during each experimental condition. Dietary compensation was assessed as total caloric intake during a post-condition dinner standardized to provide 70% of estimated daily energy requirements. Results There was a significant effect of time on hunger, satiety, and PFC throughout each condition day (p< 0.001). There were no differences across conditions for hunger (sedentary: 4.9±0.3 cm, low: 5.0±0.3 cm, moderate: 5.1±0.3 cm, high: 5.1±0.3 cm, p>0.05), satiety (sedentary: 4.7±0.3 cm, low: 4.4±0.3 cm, moderate: 4.6±0.3 cm, high: 4.2±0.3 cm, p>0.05), and PFC (sedentary: 4.9±0.3 cm, low: 4.7±0.3 cm, moderate: 4.9±0.3 cm, high: 5.0±0.3 cm, p>0.05). There were no significant differences in post-activity food intake across conditions (sedentary: 1071.9±53.6 kcals; low: 1092.6±43.4kcals; moderate: 996.2±54.6kcals; high: 1138.7±62.8kcals, p>0.05). However, there was a significant effect of condition on energy balance (sedentary: +61.4±65.9 kcals, low: +74.9±57.6 kcals, moderate: -58.3±62.8 kcals, high: -391.2±77.9 kcals; p<0.001). There were no significant effects of weight status on hunger, satiety, PFC, post-activity food intake, and mean energy balance across conditions (all p’s>0.05). Conclusions Interrupting prolonged sitting with physical activity of any intensity does not alter appetite sensations and subsequent food consumption in children. These data suggest that interventions targeting prolonged sitting with high-intensity intermittent activity may be an effective strategy to increase physical activity energy expenditure without increasing food intake, allowing for a short-term energy deficit in both healthy weight and overweight/obese children. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of interrupting prolonged sitting with activity on food consumption and weight status in preadolescent children."
https://openalex.org/W2779496457,"Pattern formation is one of the most fundamental yet puzzling phenomena in physics and biology. We propose that traveling front pinning into concave portions of the boundary of 3-dimensional domains can serve as a generic gradient-maintaining mechanism. Such a mechanism of domain polarization arises even for scalar bistable reaction-diffusion equations, and, depending on geometry, a number of stationary fronts may be formed leading to complex spatial patterns. The main advantage of the pinning mechanism, with respect to the Turing bifurcation, is that it allows for maintaining gradients in the specific regions of the domain. By linking the instant domain shape with the spatial pattern, the mechanism can be responsible for cellular polarization and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2781258560,"Studies on medication safety in pregnancy often rely on an oversimplification of medication use into exposed or non-exposed, without considering intensity and timing of use in pregnancy, or concomitant medication use. This study uses paracetamol in pregnancy as the motivating example to introduce a method of clustering medication exposures longitudinally throughout pregnancy. The aim of this study was to use hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to better identify clusters of medication exposure throughout pregnancy.Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study was used to identify subclasses of women using paracetamol during pregnancy. HCA with customized distance measure was used to identify clusters of medication exposures in pregnancy among children at 18 months.The pregnancies in the study (N = 9 778) were grouped in 5 different clusters depending on their medication exposure profile throughout pregnancy.Using HCA, we identified and described profiles of women exposed to different medications in combination with paracetamol during pregnancy. Identifying these clusters allows researchers to define exposure in ways that better reflects real-world medication usage patterns. This method could be extended to other medications and used as pre-analysis for identifying risks associated with different profiles of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2781325984,"Mutations in the cytochrome c gene (CYCS) cause autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia by an unknown mechanism. While attempting to generate megakaryoblastic cell lines exogenously expressing cytochrome c variants, we discovered that endogenous cytochrome c expression increased both upon induction of differentiation with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and as cell density increased. A concomitant increase in cytochrome c oxidase subunit II in response to PMA, but not cell higher cell density, suggests upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may be a specific feature of differentiation. These results highlight the likely importance of cytochrome c in both differentiating and proliferating cells, and illustrate the unsuitability of megakaryoblastic lines for modeling CYCS-associated thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2781074183,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is increasingly used in medicine and clinical research. Previous reliability studies have used small samples and focussed on limited aspects of variability; information regarding 1.5T versus 3T performance is lacking. The aim of the present work was to measure the inter-session, intra-session, inter-subject, within-brain and residual variance components using both 1.5T and 3T MR scanners.Eleven healthy volunteers were invited for MRSI scanning on three occasions at both 1.5T and 3T, with four scans acquired at each visit. We measured variance components, correcting for grey matter and white matter content of voxels, of metabolite peak areas and peak area ratios.Residual variance was in general the largest component at 1.5T (8.6-24.6%), while within-brain variation was the largest component at 3T (12.0-24.7%). Inter-subject variation was around 5%, while inter- and intra-session variance were both generally small.Multiple variance contributions associated with MRSI measurements were quantified and the performance of 1.5T and 3T MRI scanners compared using data from the same group of subjects. Residual error is much lower at 3T, but other variance components remain important."
