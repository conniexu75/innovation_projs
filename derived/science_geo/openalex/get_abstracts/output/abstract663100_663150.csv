https://openalex.org/W3104364663,"Quantum particles on a lattice with competing long-range interactions are ubiquitous in physics. Transition metal oxides, layered molecular crystals and trapped ion arrays are a few examples out of many. In the strongly interacting regime, these systems often exhibit a rich variety of quantum many-body ground states that challenge theory. The emergence of transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e heterostructures provides a highly controllable platform to study long-range electronic correlations. Here we report an observation of nearly two-dozen correlated insulating states at fractional fillings of a WSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ moir\'e heterostructure. The discovery is enabled by a new optical sensing technique that is built on the sensitivity to dielectric environment of the exciton excited states in single-layer semiconductor WSe$_{2}$. The cascade of insulating states exhibits an energy ordering which is nearly symmetric about filling factor of half electron (or hole) per superlattice site. We propose a series of charge-ordered states at commensurate filling fractions that range from generalized Wigner crystals to charge density waves. Our study lays the groundwork for utilizing moir\'e superlattices to simulate a wealth of quantum many-body problems that are described by the two-dimensional t-V model or spin models with long-range charge-charge and exchange interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3104088357,"The serum metabolome contains a plethora of biomarkers and causative agents of various diseases, some of which are endogenously produced and some that have been taken up from the environment1. The origins of specific compounds are known, including metabolites that are highly heritable2,3, or those that are influenced by the gut microbiome4, by lifestyle choices such as smoking5, or by diet6. However, the key determinants of most metabolites are still poorly understood. Here we measured the levels of 1,251 metabolites in serum samples from a unique and deeply phenotyped healthy human cohort of 491 individuals. We applied machine-learning algorithms to predict metabolite levels in held-out individuals on the basis of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters, diet, lifestyle and anthropometric measurements, and obtained statistically significant predictions for more than 76% of the profiled metabolites. Diet and microbiome had the strongest predictive power, and each explained hundreds of metabolites-in some cases, explaining more than 50% of the observed variance. We further validated microbiome-related predictions by showing a high replication rate in two geographically independent cohorts7,8 that were not available to us when we trained the algorithms. We used feature attribution analysis9 to reveal specific dietary and bacterial interactions. We further demonstrate that some of these interactions might be causal, as some metabolites that we predicted to be positively associated with bread were found to increase after a randomized clinical trial of bread intervention. Overall, our results reveal potential determinants of more than 800 metabolites, paving the way towards a mechanistic understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to designing interventions for manipulating the levels of circulating metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W3103804121,"Despite its success in achieving the long-term survival of 10–30% of treated individuals, immune therapy is still ineffective for most patients with cancer1,2. Many efforts are therefore underway to identify new approaches that enhance such immune ‘checkpoint’ therapy3–5 (so called because its aim is to block proteins that inhibit checkpoint signalling pathways in T cells, thereby freeing those immune cells to target cancer cells). Here we show that inhibiting PCSK9—a key protein in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism6–8—can boost the response of tumours to immune checkpoint therapy, through a mechanism that is independent of PCSK9’s cholesterol-regulating functions. Deleting the PCSK9 gene in mouse cancer cells substantially attenuates or prevents their growth in mice in a manner that depends on cytotoxic T cells. It also enhances the efficacy of immune therapy that is targeted at the checkpoint protein PD1. Furthermore, clinically approved PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies synergize with anti-PD1 therapy in suppressing tumour growth in mouse models of cancer. Inhibiting PCSK9—either through genetic deletion or using PCSK9 antibodies—increases the expression of major histocompatibility protein class I (MHC I) proteins on the tumour cell surface, promoting robust intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Mechanistically, we find that PCSK9 can disrupt the recycling of MHC I to the cell surface by associating with it physically and promoting its relocation and degradation in the lysosome. Together, these results suggest that inhibiting PCSK9 is a promising way to enhance immune checkpoint therapy for cancer. Inhibiting the PCSK9 protein, a regulator of cholesterol metabolism, enhances immune checkpoint therapy in mouse models of cancer, in a manner that depends on the regulation of antigen-presenting MHC I molecules."

https://openalex.org/W3098524589,"Perisynaptic astrocytic processes are an integral part of central nervous system synapses1,2; however, the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte–synapse adhesions and how astrocyte contacts control synapse formation and function are largely unknown. Here we use an in vivo chemico-genetic approach that applies a cell-surface fragment complementation strategy, Split-TurboID, and identify a proteome that is enriched at astrocyte–neuron junctions in vivo, which includes neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM). We find that NRCAM is expressed in cortical astrocytes, localizes to perisynaptic contacts and is required to restrict neuropil infiltration by astrocytic processes. Furthermore, we show that astrocytic NRCAM interacts transcellularly with neuronal NRCAM coupled to gephyrin at inhibitory postsynapses. Depletion of astrocytic NRCAM reduces numbers of inhibitory synapses without altering glutamatergic synaptic density. Moreover, loss of astrocytic NRCAM markedly decreases inhibitory synaptic function, with minor effects on excitation. Thus, our results present a proteomic framework for how astrocytes interface with neurons and reveal how astrocytes control GABAergic synapse formation and function. A cell-surface fragment complementation strategy is used to identify the proteome at the junction of astrocytes and synapses in vivo, and shows that NRCAM expressed in astrocytes has a key role in regulating inhibitory synapse function."

https://openalex.org/W3101518221,"Gene-expression programs define shared and species-specific phenotypes, but their evolution remains largely uncharacterized beyond the transcriptome layer1. Here we report an analysis of the co-evolution of translatomes and transcriptomes using ribosome-profiling and matched RNA-sequencing data for three organs (brain, liver and testis) in five mammals (human, macaque, mouse, opossum and platypus) and a bird (chicken). Our within-species analyses reveal that translational regulation is widespread in the different organs, in particular across the spermatogenic cell types of the testis. The between-species divergence in gene expression is around 20% lower at the translatome layer than at the transcriptome layer owing to extensive buffering between the expression layers, which especially preserved old, essential and housekeeping genes. Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global dosage reductions during the evolution of sex chromosomes and the effects of meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis. Despite the overall prevalence of buffering, some genes evolved faster at the translatome layer—potentially indicating adaptive changes in expression; testis tissue shows the highest fraction of such genes. Further analyses incorporating mass spectrometry proteomics data establish that the co-evolution of transcriptomes and translatomes is reflected at the proteome layer. Together, our work uncovers co-evolutionary patterns and associated selective forces across the expression layers, and provides a resource for understanding their interplay in mammalian organs. An analysis using ribosome-profiling and matched RNA-sequencing data for three organs across five mammalian species and a bird enables the comparison of translatomes and transcriptomes, revealing patterns of co-evolution of these two expression layers."
https://openalex.org/W3105037260,"Light elements were produced in the first few minutes of the Universe through a sequence of nuclear reactions known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)1,2. Among the light elements produced during BBN1,2, deuterium is an excellent indicator of cosmological parameters because its abundance is highly sensitive to the primordial baryon density and also depends on the number of neutrino species permeating the early Universe. Although astronomical observations of primordial deuterium abundance have reached percent accuracy3, theoretical predictions4–6 based on BBN are hampered by large uncertainties on the cross-section of the deuterium burning D(p,γ)3He reaction. Here we show that our improved cross-sections of this reaction lead to BBN estimates of the baryon density at the 1.6 percent level, in excellent agreement with a recent analysis of the cosmic microwave background7. Improved cross-section data were obtained by exploiting the negligible cosmic-ray background deep underground at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy)8,9. We bombarded a high-purity deuterium gas target10 with an intense proton beam from the LUNA 400-kilovolt accelerator11 and detected the γ-rays from the nuclear reaction under study with a high-purity germanium detector. Our experimental results settle the most uncertain nuclear physics input to BBN calculations and substantially improve the reliability of using primordial abundances to probe the physics of the early Universe. High-precision cross-sections of the nuclear reaction that burns deuterium to create helium-3 are used to produce theoretical estimates of the primordial baryon density that are in agreement with recent astronomical observations."
https://openalex.org/W3099573950,"When a hurricane strikes land, the destruction of property and the environment and the loss of life are largely confined to a narrow coastal area. This is because hurricanes are fuelled by moisture from the ocean1-3, and so hurricane intensity decays rapidly after striking land4,5. In contrast to the effect of a warming climate on hurricane intensification, many aspects of which are fairly well understood6-10, little is known of its effect on hurricane decay. Here we analyse intensity data for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes11 over the past 50 years and show that hurricane decay has slowed, and that the slowdown in the decay over time is in direct proportion to a contemporaneous rise in the sea surface temperature12. Thus, whereas in the late 1960s a typical hurricane lost about 75 per cent of its intensity in the first day past landfall, now the corresponding decay is only about 50 per cent. We also show, using computational simulations, that warmer sea surface temperatures induce a slower decay by increasing the stock of moisture that a hurricane carries as it hits land. This stored moisture constitutes a source of heat that is not considered in theoretical models of decay13-15. Additionally, we show that climate-modulated changes in hurricane tracks16,17 contribute to the increasingly slow decay. Our findings suggest that as the world continues to warm, the destructive power of hurricanes will extend progressively farther inland."

https://openalex.org/W3103106823,"The selectivity of neuronal responses arises from the architecture of excitatory and inhibitory connections. In the primary visual cortex, the selectivity of a neuron in layer 2/3 for stimulus orientation and direction is thought to arise from intracortical inputs that are similarly selective1-8. However, the excitatory inputs of a neuron can have diverse stimulus preferences1-4,6,7,9, and inhibitory inputs can be promiscuous10 and unselective11. Here we show that the excitatory and inhibitory intracortical connections to a layer 2/3 neuron accord with its selectivity by obeying precise spatial patterns. We used rabies tracing1,12 to label and functionally image the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to individual pyramidal neurons of layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. Presynaptic excitatory neurons spanned layers 2/3 and 4 and were distributed coaxial to the preferred orientation of the postsynaptic neuron, favouring the region opposite to its preferred direction. By contrast, presynaptic inhibitory neurons resided within layer 2/3 and favoured locations near the postsynaptic neuron and ahead of its preferred direction. The direction selectivity of a postsynaptic neuron was unrelated to the selectivity of presynaptic neurons, but correlated with the spatial displacement between excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic ensembles. Similar asymmetric connectivity establishes direction selectivity in the retina13-17. This suggests that this circuit motif might be canonical in sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W3102239735,"The role of gene expression during learning and in short-term memories has been studied extensively1-3, but less is known about remote memories, which can persist for a lifetime4. Here we used long-term contextual fear memory as a paradigm to probe the single-cell gene expression landscape that underlies remote memory storage in the medial prefrontal cortex. We found persistent activity-specific transcriptional alterations in diverse populations of neurons that lasted for weeks after fear learning. Out of a vast plasticity-coding space, we identified genes associated with membrane fusion that could have important roles in the maintenance of remote memory. Unexpectedly, astrocytes and microglia also acquired persistent gene expression signatures that were associated with remote memory, suggesting that they actively contribute to memory circuits. The discovery of gene expression programmes associated with remote memory engrams adds an important dimension of activity-dependent cellular states to existing brain taxonomy atlases and sheds light on the elusive mechanisms of remote memory storage."
https://openalex.org/W3103820312,"Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we found that 3 of the drugs fulfils the criterions well among which the antiretroviral drug Amprenavir (DrugBank ID–DB00701) would probably be the most effective drug based on the selected criterions. Conclusions Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications."
https://openalex.org/W3103379319,"Genome introgressions drive evolution across the animal1, plant2 and fungal3 kingdoms. Introgressions initiate from archaic admixtures followed by repeated backcrossing to one parental species. However, how introgressions arise in reproductively isolated species, such as yeast4, has remained unclear. Here we identify a clonal descendant of the ancestral yeast hybrid that founded the extant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alpechin lineage5, which carries abundant Saccharomyces paradoxus introgressions. We show that this clonal descendant, hereafter defined as a 'living ancestor', retained the ancestral genome structure of the first-generation hybrid with contiguous S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus subgenomes. The ancestral first-generation hybrid underwent catastrophic genomic instability through more than a hundred mitotic recombination events, mainly manifesting as homozygous genome blocks generated by loss of heterozygosity. These homozygous sequence blocks rescue hybrid fertility by restoring meiotic recombination and are the direct origins of the introgressions present in the Alpechin lineage. We suggest a plausible route for introgression evolution through the reconstruction of extinct stages and propose that genome instability allows hybrids to overcome reproductive isolation and enables introgressions to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W3103006683,"Serological surveys have been conducted to establish prevalence for COVID-19 antibodies in various cohorts and communities, reporting a wide range of outcomes. The prevalence of such antibodies among healthcare workers, presumed at higher risk for infection, has been increasingly investigated, more studies are needed to better understand the risks and infection transmission in different healthcare settings. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race ( p = .037), presence of fever ( p &lt; .001), and loss of smell ( p &lt; .001), but not for occupations ( p = .710). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital’s timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage, and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity, as recently described, may possibly play a greater role in healthcare workers than in the general population."

https://openalex.org/W3100753213,"As a glass-forming liquid is cooled, the dynamics of its constituent particles changes from being liquid-like to more solid-like. The solidity of the resulting glassy material is believed to be due to a cage-formation process, whereby the motion of individual particles is increasingly constrained by neighbouring particles. This process begins at the temperature (or particle density) at which the glass-forming liquid first shows signs of glassy dynamics; however, the details of how the cages form remain unclear1–4. Here we study cage formation at the particle level in a two-dimensional colloidal suspension (a glass-forming liquid). We use focused lasers to perturb the suspension at the particle level and monitor the nonlinear dynamic response of the system using video microscopy. All observables that we consider respond non-monotonically as a function of the particle density, peaking at the density at which glassy dynamics is first observed. We identify this maximum response as being due to cage formation, quantified by the appearance of domains in which particles move in a cooperative manner. As the particle density increases further, these local domains become increasingly rigid and dominate the macroscale particle dynamics. This microscale rheological deformation approach demonstrates that cage formation in glass-forming liquids is directly related to the merging of such domains, and reveals the first step in the transformation of liquids to glassy materials1,5. The onset of rigidity in a two-dimensional colloidal glass-forming system is identified by the formation and merging of locally rigid domains in which particles move in a cooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W3106536045,"Introduction Police employees undertake challenging duties which may adversely impact their health. This study explored the prevalence of and risk factors for probable mental disorders amongst a representative sample of UK police employees. The association between mental illness and alterations in blood pressure was also explored. Methods Data were used from the Airwave Health Monitoring Study which was established to monitor the possible physical health impacts of a new communication system on police employees. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and blood pressure. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the prevalence of probable mental disorders and associated factors. Stepwise linear regression was conducted, controlling for confounding variables, to examine associations between mental disorders and blood pressure. Results The sample included 40,299 police staff, police constable/sergeants and inspectors or above. Probable depression was most frequently reported (9.8%), followed by anxiety (8.5%) and PTSD (3.9%). Groups at risk for probable mental disorders included police staff, and police employees who reported drinking heavily. Police employees exposed to traumatic incidents in the past six months had a doubling in rates of anxiety or depression and a six-fold increase in PTSD compared to those with no recent trauma exposure. Adjusted logistic regression models did not reveal any significant association between probable mental disorders and systolic blood pressure but significantly elevated diastolic blood pressure (≈1mmHg) was found across mental disorders. Conclusions These results show lower rates of probable mental disorders, especially PTSD, than reported in other studies focusing on police employees. Although mental ill health was associated with increased diastolic blood pressure, this was unlikely to be clinically significant. These findings highlight the importance of continued health monitoring of members of the UK police forces, focusing on employees recently exposed to traumatic incidents, heavy drinkers and police staff."
https://openalex.org/W3100215476,"It has been two months since Wuhan eased the lockdown and the people of Wuhan have been under great pressure during COVID-19. The psychological status among healthcare workers and residents were barely know due to the lack of research after Wuhan eased of the lockdown. The purpose of this study was to assess people’s mental health and the changes after Wuhan eased the lockdown. A cross-sectional online study among citizens in Wuhan was conducted. Among 1417 participants, 387(27.0%) were frontline healthcare workers and 1035(73.0%) were residents from the general public. Their COVID-19 psychological status was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Results show that 16.1%,22.3% and 17.2% healthcare workers and 21.2%, 16.7% and 17.2% general public had symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD ranging from moderate to severe. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between healthcare workers and the general public. The decreased income and the frequent social media exposure are the risk factors for general public. Compared to the early COVID-19 epidemic period, the proportion of anxiety and depression among both the general public and health workers decreased after Wuhan eased the lockdown. Our finding can be used to help the government of Wuhan to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of the population and work as a reference of public health guidelines for other cities with severe COVID-19 outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3100935291,"Background Emergency responders are routinely exposed to traumatic critical incidents and other occupational stressors that place them at higher risk of mental ill health compared to the general population. There is some evidence to suggest that resilience training may improve emergency responders’ wellbeing and related health outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a tertiary service resilience intervention compared to psychoeducation for improving psychological outcomes among emergency workers. Methods We conducted a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Minim software was used to randomly allocate police, ambulance, fire, and search and rescue services personnel, who were not suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, to Mind’s group intervention or to online psychoeducation on a 3:1 basis. The resilience intervention was group-based and included stress management and mindfulness tools for reducing stress. It was delivered by trained staff at nine centres across England in six sessions, one per week for six weeks. The comparison intervention was psychoeducation about stress and mental health delivered online, one module per week for six weeks. Primary outcomes were assessed by self-report and included wellbeing, resilience, self-efficacy, problem-solving, social capital, confidence in managing mental health, and number of days off work due to illness. Follow-up was conducted at three months. Blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment was not possible due to the type of interventions. Results A total of 430 participants (resilience intervention N = 317; psychoeducation N = 113) were randomised and included in intent-to-treat analyses. Linear Mixed-Effects Models did not show a significant difference between the interventions, at either the post-intervention or follow-up time points, on any outcome measure. Conclusions The limited success of this intervention is consistent with the wider literature. Future refinements to the intervention may benefit from targeting predictors of resilience and mental ill health. Trial registration ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN79407277 ."
https://openalex.org/W3099265977,"Background Extended spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpC) are the common enzymes produced by gram negative bacilli, which are their main mechanisms of resistance to all generations of cephalosporins. Hence, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of ESBLs and AmpC producing gram negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from clinical specimens at International clinical Laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted from January to May 2018. From different clinical specimens, 338 GNB were isolated and characterized. Bacterial species identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screening for ESBLs and AmpC production were performed using Phoenix automated system (BD phoenix 100 ). ESBLs production was confirmed using a combination disc method. All Cefoxitin resistant and confirmed ESBLs producing GNB were confirmed for AmpC beta-lactamases production by AmpC confirmatory Neo-Sensitabs discs (ROSCO tablet). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Results E . coli 66.0% (224/338) followed by K . pneumoniae 12.1% (41/338) were GNB most frequently isolated. The overall magnitude of ESBLs producing GNB was 38.8% (131/338) and the extent of AmpC beta-lactamase producing GNB was 2.4% (8/338). Majority of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases producing GNB were isolated from urine specimens 47.5% (116/338). Ampicillin (75.4%), amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (64.0%) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (55.6%) were most the antibiotics to which resistance was most commonly found. The multidrug resistance (MDR) level of GNB was 74.0% (250/338). Of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases producing GNB, 99.3% were MDR (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The high magnitude of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases producing GNB calls the needs of strong intervention to minimize further occurrence and spread of such GNB. More importantly, the MDR level was high which suggests continuous monitoring &amp; reviewing of antimicrobial policy in hospitals and the country at large."
https://openalex.org/W3105554031,"Background Low national immunization coverage (44.64%) requires strengthening the vaccination campaign to improve knowledge about HPV and its vaccine among adolescents and parents/guardians. Our aim is to evaluate factors related to knowledge about HPV, its vaccine, acceptability and divergences among Brazilian adolescents and parents/guardians. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed at a health unit of Sao Paulo University, Brazil, from 2015 to 2016. The convenience sample comprised 1047 individuals, including 74% (n = 776) adolescents and 26% (n = 271) parents/guardians, who answered a survey (knowledge about HPV, its vaccine, barriers and acceptability). Results The main source of information for adolescents was school (39%, n = 298); for parents/guardians, it was health professionals (55%, n = 153). Parents/guardians were 2.48 times more likely than adolescents to know that HPV caused changes in the Pap smear test [RR 2.48, 95% CI 2.03–3.01 (p &lt; 0.001)], 1.43 times likely to be aware that HPV was a sexually transmitted infection [RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22–1.68 (p &lt; 0.001)], and 2.77 times likely to be informed that the HPV vaccine decreased the chance of having genital warts [RR 2.77, 95% CI 2.22–2.47 (p &lt; 0.001)]. Girls knew more about the topic than boys (RR 1.67; 95% CI 1.10–2.60); education increased parents’ knowledge [(RR 3.38; 95% CI 1.71–6.69)]. Conclusion Female adolescents and parents/guardians with a higher level of education are factors related to suitable knowledge about HPV and its vaccine among Brazilian respondents. There were differences between parents/guardians and adolescents in HPV awareness, clinical implications, vaccine knowledge and vaccine acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3104612585,"Background Renal transplantation access and outcome differ between men and women, but no analysis has considered all transition phases and transplant outcome using the same data set. We analyzed sex disparities in all phases of patients’ clinical path (progression to dialysis, waitlisting, transplantation, graft failure/death). Methods In a population based approach using health insurance data (2005–2013) we examined patients’ risk of changing from one phase to another applying Cox Proportional Hazards model. Results After adjusting for age and comorbidities, women had a 16% lower risk of progression to ESRD (HR/95%-CI: 0.84/0.79–0.88). Access to the waitlist was lowered by 18% in women compared to men (HR/95%-CI: 0.82/0.70–0.96). An age stratified analysis did not reveal differences in any age group. Once waitlisted, the chance to receive a transplant was identical (HR/95%-CI: 0.96/0.81–1.15). The risk of transplant failure/death was identical for both sexes (HR/95%-CI: 0.99/0.73–1.35), but the effect was modified by age: in younger women (18–45 years) the risk was twice as high compared to men (HR/95%-CI: 2.08/1.04–4.14), whereas the risk in elderly women (&gt; 65 years) was only half the risk of men (HR/95%-CI: 0.47/0.24–0.93). Conclusion Sex disparities occurred at different steps in the history of patients with renal disease and affected progression to dialysis, waitlisting and transplantation outcome in a population with equal access to medical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3098925620,"This study aimed to evaluate the quality of seeds of RR and RR2 PRO soybean cultivars stored in ambient air with raffia packaging (ANER), ambient air with laminated packaging (ANEL), modified atmosphere with polyethylene packaging (AMEP), refrigerated atmosphere (1 to 3°C) with raffia packaging (ARER), refrigerated atmosphere (1 to 3°C) with laminated packaging (AREL), and modified (-14 PSI) and refrigerated (1 to 3°C) atmosphere with polyethylene packaging (AMREP), over 6 months of storage. Results showed that the seeds of cultivar RR2 were preserved with better physiological quality. Raffia and polyethylene packaging under natural storage conditions, in a refrigerated and modified atmosphere, did not preserve the seed quality over the storage period. The conditions of storage in ambient air with laminated packaging (ANEL) and in a refrigerated atmosphere with laminated packaging (AREL) reduced the environmental effects of temperature and relative humidity, leading to better results of physiological quality of the seeds. Storage time negatively influenced the physiological quality of seeds, except for AREL and ANEL, which maintained the quality close to that of the initial conditions, over the 6 months of storage. The best alternatives for soybean seeds storage over 6 months are the laminated packaging in a natural environment, matching the refrigerated conditions. The technological laminated packaging can be used as a new alternative for conserving soybean seeds in processing and storage units."
https://openalex.org/W3100087714,"Superinfection exclusion (SIE) is a process by which a virally infected cell is protected from subsequent infection by the same or a closely related virus. By preventing cell coinfection, SIE favors preservation of genome integrity of a viral strain and limits its recombination potential with other viral genomes, thereby impacting viral evolution. Although described in virtually all viral families, the precise step(s) impacted by SIE during the viral life cycle have not been systematically explored. Here, we describe for the first time SIE triggered by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of public health importance. Using single-cell technologies, we demonstrate that CHIKV excludes subsequent infection with: CHIKV; Sindbis virus, a related alphavirus; and influenza A, an unrelated RNA virus. We further demonstrate that SIE does not depend on the action of type I interferon, nor does it rely on host cell transcription. Moreover, exclusion is not mediated by the action of a single CHIKV protein; in particular, we observed no role for non-structural protein 2 (nsP2), making CHIKV unique among characterized alphaviruses. By stepping through the viral life cycle, we show that CHIKV exclusion occurs at the level of replication, but does not directly influence virus binding, nor viral structural protein translation. In sum, we characterized co-infection during CHIKV replication, which likely influences the rate of viral diversification and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3099878426,"Most feature extraction algorithms for music audio signals use Fourier transforms to obtain coefficients that describe specific aspects of music information within the sound spectrum, such as the timbral texture, tonal texture and rhythmic activity. In this paper, we introduce a new method for extracting features related to the rhythmic activity of music signals using the topological properties of a graph constructed from an audio signal. We map the local standard deviation of a music signal to a visibility graph and calculate the modularity ( Q ), the number of communities ( Nc ), the average degree (〈 k 〉), and the density (Δ) of this graph. By applying this procedure to each signal in a database of various musical genres, we detected the existence of a hierarchy of rhythmic self-similarities between musical styles given by these four network properties. Using Q , Nc , 〈 k 〉 and Δ as input attributes in a classification experiment based on supervised artificial neural networks, we obtained an accuracy higher than or equal to the beat histogram in 70% of the musical genre pairs, using only four features from the networks. Finally, when performing the attribute selection test with Q , Nc , 〈 k 〉 and Δ, along with the main signal processing field descriptors, we found that the four network properties were among the top-ranking positions given by this test."
https://openalex.org/W3105662608,"This study analyzes the performance of two PV modules, amorphous silicon (a-Si) and crystalline silicon (c-Si) and predicts energy yield, which can be seen as facilitation to achieve the target of 35% reduction of greenhouse gases emission by 2030. Malaysia Energy Commission recommends crystalline PV modules for net energy metering (NEM), but the climate regime is a concern for output power and efficiency. Based on rainfall and irradiance data, this study aims to categorize the climate of peninsular Malaysia into rainy and dry seasons; and then the performance of the two modules are evaluated under the dry season. A new mathematical model is developed to predict energy yield and the results are validated through experimental and systematic error analysis. The parameters are collected using a self-developed ZigBeePRO-based wireless system with the rate of 3 samples/min over a period of five days. The results unveil that efficiency is inversely proportional to the irradiance due to negative temperature coefficient for crystalline modules. For this phenomenon, efficiency of c-Si (9.8%) is found always higher than a-Si (3.5%). However, a-Si shows better shadow tolerance compared to c-Si, observed from a lesser decrease rate in efficiency of the former with the increase in irradiance. Due to better spectrum response and temperature coefficient, a-Si shows greater performance on output power efficiency (OPE), performance ratio (PR), and yield factor. From the regression analysis, it is found that the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) is between 0.7179 and 0.9611. The energy from the proposed model indicates that a-Si yields 15.07% higher kWh than c-Si when luminance for recorded days is 70% medium and 30% high. This study is important to determine the highest percentage of energy yield and to get faster NEM payback period, where as of now, there is no such model to indicate seasonal energy yield in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W3105757429,"Introduction End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is the ultimate result of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In Palestine, the prevalence of ESRD was 240.3 PMP which is comparable with the nearby countries. Accelerated bone loss among ESRD patients is attributed to abnormal bone turn over that leads to osteoporosis and osteopenia. The risk of fractures is increased four-fold in men and women on hemodialysis, which explains the importance of assessing the bone mineral density among these population. The goals of this study were to find the prevalence of osteoporosis in ESRD patients as determined by bone mineral density (BMD) at different sites and to determine whether BMD correlates with many other clinical parameters. Methods A cross-sectional study of 194 ESRD patients were recruited from the dialysis unit in An-Najah National University Hospital, Nablus, Palestine. The patients were on regular hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and the hip using the dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and the value is expressed as T-score. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 26. The relationship between BMD and the clinical and biochemical parameters among the ESRD patients was assessed. Results We found that 42.8% of ESRD patient had osteoporosis and 40.2% had osteopenia. There were significantly higher proportions of osteoporosis and osteopenia among patients &gt;60 years of age (p&lt;0.005). Patients with osteoporosis and osteopenia had significantly higher serum levels of PTH (792.9 and 469.7) (p&lt;0.05). BMD decreases as the duration of dialysis (39.0 months Vs. 56.8 months), (p&lt;0.05). We found no significant difference between patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion This study showed that Palestinian patients with ESRD have low BMD at the hip and spine. The observed high serum level of PTH was associated with low BMD. Those patients should be closely monitored especially those with more than one risk factor. Moreover, more attention should be paid for these category of patients to decrease the incidence of falling down and the resulting fractures that might lead to mortality and morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3098982542,"Objectives To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcome of low-demand patients with massive rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic debridement in mid- and long-term follow-up, as well as the rate of conversion to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 19 patients with a mean age at surgery of 68 years (range, 55–80 years) from a previously described consecutive cohort and after a mean follow up of 47 month (FU1) and 145 month (FU2). The functional outcome was evaluated with the VAS score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and the age- and gender-adjusted Constant (aCS) score. The radiographic outcome was classified according to the Hamada classification. Non-parametric analyses were carried out with the Mann-Whitney U for independent samples and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for related samples. Results Five patients (26%) developed symptomatic cuff tear arthropathy and underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty after a mean time of 63 months (range, 45–97 months). These patients were excluded from further analyses. The mean VAS score of the remaining 14 patients at FU1 was significantly lower compared to preoperatively (P = .041), while there were no significant differences between the VAS score at FU1 and FU2 (P = 1.0). The ASES score of the affected shoulder at FU1 was significantly higher compared to prior to surgery (P = .028), while there were no significant differences between the scores of the affected shoulder between FU1 and FU2 (P = .878). While the ASES score of the contralateral shoulder at FU1 was significantly higher than the score of the affected shoulder (P = .038), there were no significant differences in the ASES scores of the affected and the healthy shoulder at FU2 (P = .575). The evaluation of the aCS produced similar results. A progression of the Hamada grade was documented in 6 patients. Conclusions Arthroscopic debridement is a safe and valid option for low-demand middle-age or elderly patients with symptomatic massive rotator cuff tears, leading to a significant pain relief and significantly improved functional outcome at mid- and long-term follow up. However, about a quarter of the patients in our cohort had to undergo reverse shoulder arthroplasty due to symptomatic cuff tear arthropathy. Furthermore, some of the remaining patients continued to undergo radiographic progression. This might be due to the natural history of their disease and/or the surgical procedure, and the clinical relevance of this finding should be evaluated in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3099178389,"The proto-oncogene Src is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in cellular differentiation. However, the role of Src in embryonic stem (ES) cell osteogenic differentiation is largely unknown. Using the small molecule inhibitor PP2, c-Src specific siRNAs, and tet-inducible lentiviral vectors overexpressing active c-Src, we delineated an inhibitory role of c-Src in osteogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse MC3T3-E1s preosteoblasts. Active c-Src was shown to restrict the nuclear residency of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and its transcriptional activity with no detectable effect on Runx2 expression level. Furthermore, we showed Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) was indispensable to the inhibitory role of c-Src on Runx2 nuclear localization. Specifically, higher levels of active c-Src increased STAT1 half-life by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, thereby increasing the cytoplasmic abundance of STAT1. More abundant cytoplasmic STAT1 bound and anchored Runx2, which restricted its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and ultimately reduced Runx2 transcriptional activity. Collectively, this study has defined a new mechanism by which c-Src inhibits the transcriptional regulation of osteogenesis from mESCs in vitro ."
https://openalex.org/W3104789663,"The dietary supplement industry is rapidly growing yet, a recent study revealed that up to 60% of supplements may have substituted ingredients, some of which can be harmful contaminants or additives. When ingredients cannot be verified morphologically or biochemically, DNA barcoding complemented with a molecular phylogenetic analysis can be a powerful method for species authentication. We employed a molecular phylogenetic analysis for species authentication of the commonly used fungal supplement, reishi ( Ganoderma lingzhi ), by amplifying and sequencing the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) with genus-specific primers. PCR of six powdered samples and one dried sample all sold as G . lucidum representing independent suppliers produced single, strong amplification products in the expected size-range for Ganoderma . Both best-hit BLAST and molecular phylogenetic analyses clearly identified the presence of G . lingzhi DNA in all seven herbal supplements. We detected variation in the ITS sequences among our samples, but all herbal supplement samples fall within a large clade of G . lingzhi ITS sequences. ITS-based phylogenetic analysis is a successful and cost-effective method for DNA-based species authentication that could be used in the herbal supplement industry for this and other fungal and plant species that are otherwise difficult to identify."
https://openalex.org/W3045598528,"This paper discusses the prediction of hierarchical time series, where each upper-level time series is calculated by summing appropriate lower-level time series. Forecasts for such hierarchical time series should be coherent, meaning that the forecast for an upper-level time series equals the sum of forecasts for corresponding lower-level time series. Previous methods for making coherent forecasts consist of two phases: first computing base (incoherent) forecasts and then reconciling those forecasts based on their inherent hierarchical structure. With the aim of improving time series predictions, we propose a structured regularization method for completing both phases simultaneously. The proposed method is based on a prediction model for bottom-level time series and uses a structured regularization term to incorporate upper-level forecasts into the prediction model. We also develop a backpropagation algorithm specialized for application of our method to artificial neural networks for time series prediction. Experimental results using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3100872030,"Infectious diseases are still a major global burden for modern society causing 13 million deaths annually. One way to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates from infectious diseases is through preventative or targeted vaccinations. Current vaccination strategies, however, rely on the highly specific individual contact information that is difficult and costly to obtain, in order to identify influential spreading individuals. Current approaches also focus only on direct contacts between individuals for spreading, and disregard indirect transmission where a pathogen can spread between one infected individual and one susceptible individual that visit the same location within a short time-frame without meeting. This paper presents a novel vaccination strategy that relies on coarse-grained contact information, both direct and indirect, that can be easily and efficiently collected. Rather than tracking exact contact degrees of individuals, our strategy uses the types of places people visit to estimate a range of contact degrees for individuals, considering both direct and indirect contacts. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our strategy in comparison to the state of the art's vaccination strategies. Results show that our strategy achieves comparable performance to the oracle approach and outperforms all existing strategies when considering indirect links."

This study sought to identify and prioritize unmet clinical needs for COVID-19 tests across different settings within the UK health and social care sector via an online survey of health and social care professionals and policymakers. Four hundred and forty-seven responses were received between 22nd May and 15th June 2020. Hospitals and care homes were recognized as the settings with the greatest unmet clinical need for COVID-19 diagnostics, despite reporting more access to laboratory molecular testing than other settings. Hospital staff identified a need for diagnostic tests for symptomatic workers and patients. In contrast, care home staff expressed an urgency for screening at the front door to protect high-risk residents and limit transmission. The length of time to test result was considered a widespread problem with current testing across all settings. Rapid tests for staff were regarded as an area of need across general practice and dental settings alongside tests to limit antibiotics use."
https://openalex.org/W3099566320,"Triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) are the insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas disease. The gut bacterial communities affect the development of T . cruzi inside the vector, making the characterization of its composition important in the understanding of infection development. We collected 54 triatomine bugs corresponding to four genera in different departments of Colombia. DNA extraction and PCR were performed to evaluate T . cruzi presence and to determine the discrete typing unit (DTU) of the parasite. PCR products of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were pooled and sequenced. Resulting reads were denoised and QIIME 2 was used for the identification of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Diversity (alpha and beta diversity) and richness analyses, Circos plots, and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed. The overall T . cruzi infection frequency was 75.9%, with TcI being the predominant DTU. Approximately 500,000 sequences were analyzed and 27 bacterial phyla were identified. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (33.9%), Actinobacteria (32.4%), Firmicutes (19.6%), and Bacteroidetes (7.6%), which together accounted for over 90% of the gut communities identified in this study. Genera were identified for these main bacterial phyla, revealing the presence of important bacteria such as Rhodococcus , Serratia , and Wolbachia . The composition of bacterial phyla in the gut of the insects was significantly different between triatomine species, whereas no significant difference was seen between the state of T . cruzi infection. We suggest further investigation with the evaluation of additional variables and a larger sample size. To our knowledge, this study is the first characterization of the gut bacterial structure of the main triatomine genera in Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W3100556461,"Introduction Eculizumab is a licensed treatment for several rare, complement-mediated diseases. Eculizumab use is associated with an approximately 2,000-fold increased meningococcal disease risk. In the United States, meningococcal vaccines are recommended for eculizumab recipients but there are no recommendations on use of long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. We describe characteristics of and meningococcal vaccine and antibiotic receipt in U.S. eculizumab recipients to inform meningococcal disease prevention strategies. Methods Persons in the IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases with ≥1 claim for eculizumab injection during 2007–2017 were included. Indication for eculizumab use, meningococcal vaccine receipt, and antibiotic receipt were assessed using International Classification of Diseases-9/10 diagnosis codes, vaccine administration procedure codes, and antibiotic codes from pharmacy claims, respectively. Results Overall 696 persons met the inclusion criteria. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) were the most common indications for eculizumab use (41% and 37%, respectively); 20% had an undetermined indication. From June 2015 through December 2017, 28% (41/148) of continuously-enrolled patients received ≥1 serogroup B vaccine dose. For serogroup ACWY conjugate vaccine, 45% (91/201) of patients received ≥1 dose within five years of their most recent eculizumab dose, as recommended. Of eculizumab recipients with outpatient prescription data, 7% (41/579) received antibiotics for ≥50% of the period of increased risk for meningococcal disease. Conclusion Many eculizumab recipients had an undetermined indication for eculizumab use; few were up-to-date for recommended meningococcal vaccines or were prescribed antibiotics long-term. These findings can inform further investigation of how to best protect this population from meningococcal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3101849764,"Severe chronic postsurgical pain has a prevalence of 4–10% in the surgical population. The underlying nociceptive mechanisms have not been well characterized. Following the late resolution phase of an inflammatory injury, high-dose μ-opioid-receptor inverse agonists reinstate hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. This unmasking of latent pain sensitization has been a consistent finding in rodents while only observed in a limited number of human volunteers. Latent sensitization could be a potential triggering venue in chronic postsurgical pain. The objective of the present trial was in detail to examine the association between injury-induced secondary hyperalgesia and naloxone-induced unmasking of latent sensitization. Healthy volunteers (n = 80) received a cutaneous heat injury (47°C, 420 s, 12.5 cm 2 ). Baseline secondary hyperalgesia areas were assessed 1 h post-injury. Utilizing an enriched enrollment design, subjects with a magnitude of secondary hyperalgesia areas in the upper quartile (‘high-sensitizers’ [n = 20]) and the lower quartile (‘low-sensitizers’ [n = 20]) were selected for further study. In four consecutive experimental sessions (Sessions 1 to 4), the subjects at two sessions (Sessions 1 and 3) received a cutaneous heat injury followed 168 h later (Sessions 2 and 4) by a three-step target-controlled intravenous infusion of naloxone (3.25 mg/kg), or normal saline. Assessments of secondary hyperalgesia areas were made immediately before and stepwise during the infusions. Simple univariate statistics revealed no significant differences in secondary hyperalgesia areas between naloxone and placebo treatments (P = 0.215), or between ‘high-sensitizers’ and ‘low-sensitizers’ (P = 0.757). In a mixed-effects model, secondary hyperalgesia areas were significantly larger following naloxone as compared to placebo for ‘high-sensitizers’ (P &lt; 0.001), but not ‘low-sensitizers’ (P = 0.651). Although we could not unequivocally demonstrate naloxone-induced reinstatement of heat injury-induced hyperalgesia, further studies in clinical postsurgical pain models are warranted."

Five groups of rats were treated for 4 consecutive weeks with vehicle (groups I &amp; II), or OMG (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day, po; groups III, IV &amp; V, respectively). After twenty-four hours, the last four groups were injected with DOX (200 mg/kg, ip). In DOX-treated rats, the altered ECG, serum cardiac and renal function biomarkers, and histopathological features indicated the induction of cardiorenal toxicity. Increased oxidative and apoptotic markers in both organs was observed, with elevated renal contents of NADPH-oxidase-4 (Nox4) and renin. OMG pretreatment improved those DOX-induced impairments in a dose-dependent manner, and showed antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects with regulation of renal Nox4 expression. The in-vitro study showed preservation of the cytotoxic activity of DOX on MCF7 cell line in the presence of OMG. The data suggests OMG for protection against acute DOX‐induced cardiorenal damage without affecting the latter antitumor activity. It proposes regulation of oxidative stress, Nox4 activity and apoptosis as contributing protective mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3105664326,"Emerging research on how suspects perceive the physical environment during investigative interviews yields contrasting findings. While previous studies have suggested that a room made to be physically comfortable may be optimal for interviewing suspects, another study found it can instead lead to higher suspicion of the investigator’s intentions. The current study examined current detainees’ and general population participants’ beliefs about a room that resembled a “typical” interview room, and one decorated to be warm, inviting, and comfortable. Participants also provided descriptive information about their perceptions of police interview environments (e.g., preferences, expectations). We hypothesized that the decorated room would elicit higher ratings of suspicion and wariness compared to the “typical” room. Our findings showed that, overall, participants expected to be interviewed in the “typical” room but preferred the decorated one. Contrary to our expectations, they rated the “typical” room higher on feelings of suspicion than the decorated room. The decorated room also corresponded with what participants reported to be an environment that promotes disclosure. These results bode well for conducting investigative interviews in comfortable environments."
https://openalex.org/W3102965483,"A severe hemorrhage can result in death within minutes, before professional first responders have time to arrive. Thus, intervention by bystanders, who may lack medical training, may be necessary to save a victim’s life in situations with bleeding injuries. Proper intervention requires that bystanders accurately assess the severity of the injury and respond appropriately. As many bystanders lack tools and training, they are limited in terms of the information they can use in their evaluative process. In hemorrhage situations, visible blood loss may serve as a dominant cue to action. Therefore, understanding how medically untrained bystanders (i.e., laypeople) perceive hemorrhage is important. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ability of laypeople to visually assess blood loss and to examine factors that may impact accuracy and the classification of injury severity. A total of 125 laypeople watched 78 short videos each of individuals experiencing a hemorrhage. Victim gender, volume of blood lost, and camera perspective were systematically manipulated in the videos. The results revealed that laypeople overestimated small volumes of blood loss (from 50 to 200 ml), and underestimated larger volumes (from 400 to 1900 ml). Larger volumes of blood loss were associated with larger estimation errors. Further, blood loss was underestimated more for female victims than male victims and their hemorrhages were less likely to be classified as life-threatening. These results have implications for training and intervention design."
https://openalex.org/W3103695845,"The unique cellular organization and transparent function of the ocular lens depend on the continuous differentiation of immature epithelial cells on the lens anterior surface into mature elongated fiber cells within the lens core. A ubiquitous event during lens differentiation is the complete elimination of organelles required for mature lens fiber cell structure and transparency. Distinct pathways have been identified to mediate the elimination of non-nuclear organelles and nuclei. Recently, we reported the discovery of a unique structure in developing fiber cells of the chick embryo lens, called the Nuclear Excisosome, that is intractably associated with degrading nuclei during lens fiber cell differentiation. In the chick lens, the Nuclear Excisosome is derived from projections of adjacent cells contacting the nuclear envelope during nuclear elimination. Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to the avian model, Nuclear Excisosomes in a primate model, Galago (bush baby) monkeys, are derived through the recruitment of mitochondria to form unique linear assemblies that define a novel primate Nuclear Excisosome. Four lenses from three monkeys aged 2-5 years were fixed in formalin, followed by paraformaldehyde, then processed for Airyscan confocal microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. For confocal imaging, fluorescent dyes labelled membranes, carbohydrate in the extracellular space, filamentous actin and nuclei. Fiber cells from Galago lenses typically displayed prominent linear structures within the cytoplasm with a distinctive cross-section of four membranes and lengths up to 30 μm. The outer membranes of these linear structures were observed to attach to the outer nuclear envelope membrane to initiate degradation near the organelle-free zone. The origin of these unique structures was mitochondria in the equatorial epithelium (not from plasma membranes of adjacent cells as in the chick embryo model). Early changes in mitochondria appeared to be the collapse of the cristae and modification of one side of the mitochondrial outer membrane to promote accumulation of protein in a dense cluster. As a mitochondrion surrounded the dense protein cluster, an outer mitochondrial membrane enclosed the protein to form a core and another outer mitochondrial membrane formed the outermost layer. The paired membranes of irregular texture between the inner core membrane and the outer limiting membrane appeared to be derived from modified mitochondrial cristae. Several mitochondria were involved in the formation and maturation of these unique complexes that apparently migrated around the fulcrum into the cytoplasm of nascent fiber cells where they were stabilized until the nuclear degradation was initiated. Thus, unlike in the chick embryo, the Galago lenses degraded nuclear envelopes with a Nuclear Excisosome derived from multiple mitochondria in the epithelium that formed novel linear assemblies in developing fiber cells. These findings suggest that recruitment of distinct structures is required for Nuclear Excisosome formation in different species."

We recruited 300 adults in China and asked them to complete an Interest in Infants questionnaire and a Bem Sex Role Inventory and then administered a behavioral assessment that used unfamiliar infant faces with varying expressions (laughing, neutral, and crying) as stimuli to gauge three components of motivation towards infants (i.e., liking, representational responding, and evoked responding). The results demonstrated that sex differences emerged only in self-reported interest in infants, but no difference was found between the sexes in terms of their hedonic reactions to infant faces. Furthermore, femininity was found to correlate with preferences for infants in both verbal and visual tests, but significant interactive effects of feminine traits and sex were found only in the behavioral test. The findings indicated that men’s responses to infants were influenced more by their feminine traits than were women’s responses, potentially explaining the greater extent to which paternal (vs. maternal) investment is facultative."
https://openalex.org/W3106012238,"Background and objective The relationship between antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) levels and the severity or prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is unclear. This study explored the clinical significance of serum IgG antimitochondrial M2 antibody (IgG-M2) levels. Methods From 2008 to 2017, a retrospective analysis was conducted with PBC patients who had available quantitative values of serum IgG-M2 levels obtained with ELISA based on triple expression hybrid clones. The patients were divided into two groups based on high and low concentrations of IgG-M2. Baseline parameters, the incidence of adverse events, and prognosis were compared. Results Among the 530 PBC patients, the levels of albumin, cholinesterase, hemoglobin, fibrinogen and triglycerides and the red blood cell count were significantly lower in the high-concentration group than in the low-concentration group (n = 263, 49.6%). The red cell distribution width (RDW) and levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM and IgA were significantly higher in the high-concentration group than in the low-concentration group. Spearman’s correlation analysis suggested that the correlation between the above baseline indicators and IgG-M2 levels was statistically significant but weak (r &lt; 0.2, P &lt; 0.05). In total, 203 patients were followed up, of whom 87 (42.9%) were in the high-concentration group. During the median follow-up period of 52 months (range: 28–75), 121 (59.6%) experienced hepatic decompensation, and 37 (18.2%) died or underwent liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications or survival (log-rank test: P = 0.079) between the two groups. One year after ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, the two groups had similar responses. In addition, the levels of IgG-M2 did not fluctuate significantly during treatment. Conclusion IgG-M2 levels were not related to the disease severity, prognosis or efficacy of UDCA. The levels of IgG-M2 did not change significantly during treatment."

The aim of this study was to test different methods of sampling strategies to quantify the HFF in healthy cats during body weight gain. Twelve healthy adult male cats were examined in a 3 Tesla MRI unit. Sequences included morphological images, and multiple echo GRE sequence. Cats were scanned at the beginning of the study and twice, each 20 weeks apart during body weight gain. HFF was calculated with 5 different methods of sampling on the multiple echo GRE sequence with different number, size and position of regions of interest (ROIs) and by 2 operators. Results indicated that HFF increased with increasing body weight, and the increase was appreciated with all the 5 methods. There was overall excellent agreement (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.820 (95% confidence interval:0.775–0.856)) between the 2 operators. HFF in the left lateral hepatic lobe was lower than in the other analyzed lobes. HFF measured on large free-hand drawn ROIs was higher than HFF measured with smaller ROIs size. This study proves that different sampling methods for quantification of HFF on multiple echo GRE sequence have overall excellent repeatability and ability to appreciate increased HFF."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the link between markers of oxidative stress and some risk factors for NCDs in a Zambian cohort. Methods We assessed oxidative stress by measuring 8-isoprostane (lipid oxidative stress) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (DNA oxidative stress). In addition, we measured mycotoxins (aflatoxin M1 and ochratoxin A), salt intake estimated from 24-hour sodium excretion calculated using the Tanaka and Kawaski formulae, and 1-hydroxypyrene (a metabolite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Data on lifestyle risk factors were collected using questionnaires. Results Included were 244 participants; 128 (52%) were female and the median age was 48 years (IQR 39–58). The median level of 8-isoprostane was 0.13 ng/mg creatinine (IQR 0.08–0.23) while that of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was 4 ng/mg creatinine (IQR 2–10). The median 24-hour sodium excretion was 21 g (IQR 16–25 g), with none being less than the 5 g recommended by WHO. Unadjusted urinary levels of 8-isoprostane were moderately correlated with 1-hydroxypyrene (Spearman r = 0.30, p &lt;0.001) and estimated 24-hour urine sodium (Spearman r = 0.38, p &lt;0.001). Urinary levels of 8-OHdG were not correlated with 1-hydroxypyrene, estimated 24-hour urine sodium, aflatoxin M1 or ochratoxin A (all p -values &gt;0.05). Using logistic regression, adjusted and unadjusted 8-isoprostanes levels were associated with 1-hydroxypyrene ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.001 respectively) and estimated 24-hour urine sodium method ( p = 0.003 and p &lt;0.001 respectively). However, only unadjusted 8-OHdG was associated with 1-hydroxypyrene ( p = 0.03) and age ( p = 0.007). Conclusions Estimated 24-hour urinary sodium is high among Zambians and it is associated with lipid but not DNA oxidative stress. High exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is also associated with oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3015213629,"Scholars frequently cite fuel scarcity after deforestation as a reason for the abandonment of most of the Roman iron smelting sites on Elba Island (Tuscan Archipelago, Italy) in the 1st century bce . Whereas the archaeological record clearly indicates the decrease in smelting activities, evidence confirming the ‘deforestation narrative’ is ambiguous. Therefore, we employed a stochastic, spatio-temporal model of the wood required and consumed for iron smelting on Elba Island in order to assess the availability of fuelwood on the island. We used Monte Carlo simulations to cope with the limited knowledge available on the past conditions on Elba Island and the related uncertainties in the input parameters. The model includes both, wood required for the furnaces and to supply the workforce employed in smelting. Although subject to high uncertainties, the outcomes of our model clearly indicate that it is unlikely that all woodlands on the island were cleared in the 1st century bce . A lack of fuel seems only likely if a relatively ineffective production process is assumed. Therefore, we propose taking a closer look at other reasons for the abandonment of smelting sites, e.g. the occupation of new Roman provinces with important iron ore deposits; or a resource-saving strategy in Italia . Additionally, we propose to read the development of the ‘deforestation narrative’ originating from the 18th/19th century in its historical context."

Consequently, many institutions have begun active surveillance, but in non-research settings, the resulting data are often incomplete and may include non-random testing, making conventional epidemiological analysis problematic. We describe a mathematical model and inference method for in-hospital bacterial colonization and transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that is tailored for analysis of active surveillance data with incomplete observations. The model and inference method make use of the full detailed state of the hospital unit, which takes into account the colonization status of each individual in the unit and not only the number of colonized patients at any given time. The inference method computes the exact likelihood of all possible histories consistent with partial observations (despite the exponential increase in possible states that can make likelihood calculation intractable for large hospital units), includes techniques to improve computational efficiency, is tested by computer simulation, and is applied to active surveillance data from a 13-bed rehabilitation unit in New York City. The inference method for exact likelihood calculation is applicable to other Markov models incorporating incomplete observations. The parameters that we identify are the patient–patient transmission rate, pre-existing colonization probability, and prior-to-new-patient transmission probability. Besides identifying the parameters, we predict the effects on the total prevalence (0.07 of the total colonized patient-days) of changing the parameters and estimate the increase in total prevalence attributable to patient–patient transmission (0.02) above the baseline pre-existing colonization (0.05). Simulations with a colonized versus uncolonized long-stay patient had 44% higher total prevalence, suggesting that the long-stay patient may have been a reservoir of transmission. High-priority interventions may include isolation of incoming colonized patients and repeated screening of long-stay patients."
