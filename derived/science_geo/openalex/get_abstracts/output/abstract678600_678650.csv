https://openalex.org/W3190635837,"Background While multiple studies have examined the brain functional correlates of reward, meta-analyses have either focused on studies using the monetary incentive delay (MID) task, or have adopted a broad strategy, combining data from studies using both monetary and non-monetary reward, as probed using a wide range of tasks. Objective To meta-analyze fMRI studies that used monetary reward and in which there was a definable cue-reward contingency. Studies were limited to those using monetary reward in order to avoid potential heterogeneity from use of other rewards, especially social rewards. Studies using gambling or delay discounting tasks were excluded on the grounds that reward anticipation is not easily quantifiable. Study eligibility English-language fMRI studies (i) that reported fMRI findings on healthy adults; (ii) that used monetary reward; and (iii) in which a cue that was predictive of reward was compared to a no win (or lesser win) condition. Only voxel-based studies were included; those where brain coverage was incomplete were excluded. Data sources Ovid, Medline and PsycInfo, from 2000 to 2020, plus checking of review articles and meta-analyses. Data synthesis Data were pooled using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI). Heterogeneity among studies was examined using the I 2 statistic. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots and statistical examination of asymmetries. Moderator variables including whether the task was pre-learnt, sex distribution, amount of money won and width of smoothing kernel were examined. Results Pooled data from 45 studies of reward anticipation revealed activations in the ventral striatum, the middle cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area and the insula. Pooled data from 28 studies of reward delivery again revealed ventral striatal activation, plus cortical activations in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. There was relatively little evidence of publication bias. Among moderating variables, only whether the task was pre-learnt exerted an influence. Conclusions According to this meta-analysis monetary reward anticipation and delivery both activate the ventral but not the dorsal striatum, and are associated with different patterns of cortical activation."
https://openalex.org/W3188598237,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a major public health concern spanning from healthy carriers to patients with life-threatening conditions. Although most of COVID-19 patients have mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms, some patients have severe pneumonia leading to death. Therefore, the early prediction of disease prognosis and severity is crucial in COVID-19 patients. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the haemocytometric parameters and identify severity score associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Clinical and laboratory records were retrospectively reviewed from 97 cases of COVID-19 admitted to hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey. The patient groups were subdivided into three major groups: Group 1 (Non-critical): 59 patients, Group 2 (Critical-Survivors): 23 patients and Group 3 (Critical-Non-survivors):15 patients. These data was tested for correlation, including with derived haemocytometric parameters. The blood analyses were performed the Sysmex XN-series automated hematology analyser using standard laboratory protocols. All statistical testing was undertaken using Analyse-it software. Results 97 patients with COVID-19 disease and 935 sequential complete blood count (CBC-Diff) measurements (days 0–30) were included in the final analyses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) (&gt;13.7), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (4.4), Hemoglobin (Hgb) (&lt;11.4 gr/dL) and monocyte to neutrophil ratio (MNR) (0.084) had the highest area under curve (AUC) values, respectively in discrimination critical patients than non-critical patients. In determining Group 3, MNR (&lt;0.095), NLR (&gt;5.2), Plateletcount (PLT) (&gt;142 x10 3 /L) and RDW (&gt;14) were important haemocytometric parameters, and the mortality risk value created by their combination had the highest AUC value (AUC = 0.911, 95% CI, 0886–0.931). Trend analysis of CBC-Diff parameters over 30 days of hospitalization, NLR on day 2, MNR on day 4, RDW on day 6 and PLT on day 7 of admission were found to be the best time related parameters in discrimination non-critical (mild-moderate) patient group from critical (severe and non-survivor) patient group. Conclusion NLR is a strong predictor for the prognosis for severe COVID-19 patients when the cut-off chosen was 4.4, the combined mortality risk factor COVID-19 disease generated from RDW-CV, NLR, MNR and PLT is best as a mortality haematocytometric index."
https://openalex.org/W3191117541,"Background Novel virus outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase psychological distress among frontline workers. Psychological distress may lead to reduced performance, reduced employability or even burnout. In the present study, we assessed experienced psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic from a self-determination theory perspective. Methods This mixed-methods study, with repeated measures, used surveys (quantitative data) combined with audio diaries (qualitative data) to assess work-related COVID-19 experiences, psychological need satisfaction and frustration, and psychological distress over time. Forty-six participants (nurses, junior doctors, and consultants) completed 259 surveys and shared 60 audio diaries. Surveys and audio diaries were analysed separately. Results Quantitative results indicated that perceived psychological distress during COVID-19 was higher than pre-COVID-19 and fluctuated over time. Need frustration, specifically autonomy and competence, was positively associated with psychological distress, while need satisfaction, especially relatedness, was negatively associated with psychological distress. In the qualitative, thematic analysis, we observed that especially organisational logistics (rostering, work-life balance, and internal communication) frustrated autonomy, and unfamiliarity with COVID-19 frustrated competence. Despite many need frustrating experiences, a strong connection with colleagues and patients were important sources of relatedness support (i.e. need satisfaction) that seemed to mitigate psychological distress. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase of psychological distress among frontline workers. Both need frustration and need satisfaction explained unique variance of psychological distress, but seemed to originate from different sources. Challenging times require healthcare organisations to better support their professionals by tailored formal and informal support. We propose to address both indirect (e.g. organisation) and direct (e.g. colleagues) elements of the clinical and social environment in order to reduce need frustration and enhance need satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3155875153,"In response to the soaring needs of human mobility data, especially during disaster events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated big data challenges, we develop a scalable online platform for extracting, analyzing, and sharing multi-source multi-scale human mobility flows. Within the platform, an origin-destination-time (ODT) data model is proposed to work with scalable query engines to handle heterogenous mobility data in large volumes with extensive spatial coverage, which allows for efficient extraction, query, and aggregation of billion-level origin-destination (OD) flows in parallel at the server-side. An interactive spatial web portal, ODT Flow Explorer, is developed to allow users to explore multi-source mobility datasets with user-defined spatiotemporal scales. To promote reproducibility and replicability, we further develop ODT Flow REST APIs that provide researchers with the flexibility to access the data programmatically via workflows, codes, and programs. Demonstrations are provided to illustrate the potential of the APIs integrating with scientific workflows and with the Jupyter Notebook environment. We believe the platform coupled with the derived multi-scale mobility data can assist human mobility monitoring and analysis during disaster events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and benefit both scientific communities and the general public in understanding human mobility dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3191594409,"In filamentous fungi, gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) shapes many biological processes, including pathogenicity. Recently, fungal small RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to act as effectors that disrupt gene activity in interacting plant hosts, thereby undermining their defence responses. We show here that the devastating mycotoxin-producing ascomycete Fusarium graminearum ( Fg ) utilizes DICER-like (DCL)-dependent sRNAs to target defence genes in two Poaceae hosts, barley ( Hordeum vulgare , Hv ) and Brachypodium distachyon ( Bd ). We identified 104 Fg -sRNAs with sequence homology to host genes that were repressed during interactions of Fg and Hv , while they accumulated in plants infected by the DCL double knock-out (dKO) mutant PH1- dcl1/2 . The strength of target gene expression correlated with the abundance of the corresponding Fg -sRNA. Specifically, the abundance of three tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) targeting immunity-related Ethylene overproducer 1-like 1 ( HvEOL1) and three Poaceae orthologues of Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 ( HvBAK1 , HvSERK2 and BdSERK2 ) was dependent on fungal DCL. Additionally, RNA-ligase-mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE) identified infection-specific degradation products for the three barley gene transcripts, consistent with the possibility that tRFs contribute to fungal virulence via targeted gene silencing."

Firstly, the crawler software is used to crawl the recruitment information about ""big data"" on the zhaopin.com recruitment website. Then, Jieba word segmentation and K-means text clustering are used to cluster big data recruitment positions, and the number of clustering was determined by the average sum of squares within the group. Finally, big data jobs are divided into 10 categories, and the urban distribution, salary level, education requirements, and experience requirements of big data jobs are discussed and analyzed from the perspectives of the overall data set and clustering results, to clarify the characteristics of big data job demands. The analysis results show that the job demands of big data are mainly distributed in first-tier cities and new first-tier cities. Enterprises are more inclined to job seekers with a college degree or bachelor’s degree and more than one year’s relevant experience. There are wage differences among different types of jobs. The higher the position, the higher the requirement for education and experience will be."
https://openalex.org/W3189444376,"Objective To investigate the relationship between sitting balance, trunk control, and mobility, as well as whether the sitting balance and trunk control can predict mobility level in sub-acute stroke survivors. Methods This is a observational and cross-sectional study. Fifty-five hemiplegic stroke survivors were participated in this study. The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) was used to estimate mobility, and the Sitting Balance Scale (SBS) was used to examining sitting balance. The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Trunk Control Test (TCT), and Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke-trunk control (PASS-TC) were used for examining the trunk control. Spearman’s correlation was used to analyze the relationship between TUG, SBS, TIS, TCT, and PASS-TC. Results The TUG is significantly correlated with SBS (r = -0.78), TIS (r = -0.76), TCT (r = -0.65), and PASS-TC (r = -0.67). In addition, the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve showed as cut-off value of SBS as &gt;28.5, TIS &gt; 16.5, TCT &gt;82, and PASS-TC &gt;10.5. The area under the ROC curve in each of the four tests is moderately accurate for predicting the mobility of sub-acute stroke survivors (0.84 ~0.90) (0.7 &lt; AUC ≤ 9 (moderate informative)). Implications The SBS showed the highest correlation for mobility using TUG in the hemiplegic stroke survivors. Also, SBS was revealed as the most dominant examination tool predicting the mobility by TUG, it can be explained the sitting postural balance is the variable predicting the mobility in survivors of sub-acute stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3191770613,"The yield and quality of an annual crop are highly dependent on uniform and rapid germination of the seeds. In case of bitter gourd ( Momordica charantia) , the germination and field emergence is always a problem as seeds have thick and hard seed coat. Pre-sowing hydro-priming is one of the most suitable, affordable, easily available, and cost-effective techniques in breaking down seed dormancy to enhance germination. Hence, a field experiment was conducted in Surkhet district of Nepal 2020 to assess the effect of different hydro-priming duration on germination and seedling growth of bitter gourd. The experiment was laid out in single factor Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications and seven treatments including different hydro-priming durations (T 0 : control, T 1 : 6 hours, T 2 : 12 hours, T 3 : 18 hours, T 4 : 24 hours, T 5 : 36 hours and T 6 : 48 hours) of bitter gourd seeds of Palee variety, the most popular variety among the farmers. The highest water uptake and germination were found in 48 hours of seed hydro-primed seeds whereas the lowest water uptake and germination were observed on non-primed seeds. Similarly, the tallest seedling , most vigorous seedling in terms of seedling vigour index I and II was observed in 48 hours hydro-primed seeds followed by 36 hours of seed hydro-priming and shortest seedling and the least vigorous seedling in control. Thus 48 hours of seed hydro-priming was found to be effective for increasing germination and seedling growth in bitter gourd, which needs to be further investigated under large, open-field conditions with different varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3190673750,"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a diagnostic modality used during percutaneous coronary intervention. However, specialist skills are required to interpret IVUS images. To address this issue, we developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) program that categorizes vessel components, including calcification and stents, seen in IVUS images of complex lesions. When developing our AI using U-Net, IVUS images were taken from patients with angina pectoris and were manually segmented into the following categories: lumen area, medial plus plaque area, calcification, and stent. To evaluate our AI’s performance, we calculated the classification accuracy of vessel components in IVUS images of vessels with clinically significantly narrowed lumina (&lt; 4 mm 2 ) and those with severe calcification. Additionally, we assessed the correlation between lumen areas in manually-labeled ground truth images and those in AI-predicted images, the mean intersection over union (IoU) of a test set, and the recall score for detecting stent struts in each IVUS image in which a stent was present in the test set. Among 3738 labeled images, 323 were randomly selected for use as a test set. The remaining 3415 images were used for training. The classification accuracies for vessels with significantly narrowed lumina and those with severe calcification were 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. Additionally, there was a significant correlation in the lumen area between the ground truth images and the predicted images (ρ = 0.97, R 2 = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001). However, the mean IoU of the test set was 0.66 and the recall score for detecting stent struts was 0.64. Our AI program accurately classified vessels requiring treatment and vessel components, except for stents in IVUS images of complex lesions. AI may be a powerful tool for assisting in the interpretation of IVUS imaging and could promote the popularization of IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3191941794,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is one of the key targets for atherosclerosis drug development as its binding with low-density lipoprotein receptor leads to atherosclerosis. The protein-ligand interaction helps to understand the actual mechanism for the pharmacological action. This research aims to discover the best inhibitory candidates targeting PCSK9. To start with, reported ACE inhibitors were incorporated into pharmacophore designing using PharmaGist to produce pharmacophore models. Selected models were later screened against the ZINC database using ZINCPHARMER to define potential drug candidates that were docked with the target protein to understand their interactions. Molecular docking revealed the top 10 drug candidates against PCSK9, with binding energies ranging from -9.8 kcal·mol -1 to -8.2 kcal·mol -1 , which were analyzed for their pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. Some compounds were identified as plant-derived compounds like (S)-canadine, hesperetin or labetalol (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics results showed that these substances formed stable protein-ligand complexes. (S)-canadine-PCSK9 complex was the most stable with the lowest RMSD. It was concluded that (S)-canadine may act as a potential inhibitor against atherosclerosis for the development of new PCSK9 inhibitory drugs in future in vitro research."
https://openalex.org/W3187383960,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular technique that has been used for manipulating brain oscillations and inferring causality regarding the brain-behaviour relationship. Although it is a promising tool, the variability of tACS results has raised questions regarding the robustness and reproducibility of its effects. Building on recent research using tACS to modulate visuospatial attention, we here attempted to replicate findings of lateralized parietal tACS at alpha frequency to induce a change in attention bias away from the contra- towards the ipsilateral visual hemifield. 40 healthy participants underwent tACS in two separate sessions where either 10 Hz tACS or sham was applied via a high-density montage over the left parietal cortex at 1.5 mA for 20 min, while performance was assessed in an endogenous attention task. Task and tACS parameters were chosen to match those of previous studies reporting positive effects. Unlike these studies, we did not observe lateralized parietal alpha tACS to affect attention deployment or visual processing across the hemifields as compared to sham. Likewise, additional resting electroencephalography immediately offline to tACS did not reveal any notable effects on individual alpha power or frequency. Our study emphasizes the need for more replication studies and systematic investigations of the factors that drive tACS effects."
https://openalex.org/W3189672702,"Aims This study aims to identify critically important features of digital type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention interventions. Methods A stakeholder mapping exercise was undertaken to identify key end-user and professional stakeholders, followed by a three-round Delphi procedure to generate and evaluate evidence statements related to the critical elements of digital T2DM prevention interventions in terms of product (intervention), price (funding models/financial cost), place (distribution/delivery channels), and promotion (target audiences). Results End-user (n = 38) and professional (n = 38) stakeholders including patients, dietitians, credentialed diabetes educators, nurses, medical doctors, research scientists, and exercise physiologists participated in the Delphi study. Fifty-two critical intervention characteristics were identified. Future interventions should address diet, physical activity, mental health (e.g. stress, diabetes-related distress), and functional health literacy, while advancing behaviour change support. Programs should be delivered digitally or used multiple delivery modes, target a range of population subgroups including children, and be based on collaborative efforts between national and local and government and non-government funded organisations. Conclusions Our findings highlight strong support for digital health to address T2DM in Australia and identify future directions for T2DM prevention interventions. The study also demonstrates the feasibility and value of stakeholder-led intervention development processes."
https://openalex.org/W3190988704,"Introduction Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 aims to coordinate international efforts toward “clean water and sanitation.” However, water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria or thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) will not achieve the SDG target of clean water in the lives of people around the world. The aim of this study is to assess the water quality parameters of basic water services in Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia as well as the role and importance of local managerial committees in ensuring basic water functionality. Methods This mixed methods research, conducted in January-June 2019, sampled 22 districts from food-insecure areas in the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia. From the 22 districts, which represent nearly one third of all districts in each region, 111 water services classified as “basic” were randomly selected. For each selected water service, research included: water quality sample testing, visual observation of water services, interviews and focus group discussions with the associated water managerial committee members. Descriptive statistics frequency, percent, mean, median, standard deviations, normal tables, cross-tables and graphs are used to present the data. Results Although the international water standard for thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels is 0 CFU/100ml, in our sample of 111 water services, the maximum TTC counts were 71 CFU/100 ml and the mean was 4 CFU/100 ml. Thermotolerant coliform counts were above the permissible standard values for nearly 40% (n = 111) of the basic water services. TTC was detected in 44 (39.64%) (n = 111) basic water services. Of these, 38 (34.23%) were operationally functional while 6 (5.41%) were not functional. Approximately one third of the basic water services sampled, deemed “functional” by international standards, do not provide potable water due to thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels. Conclusion Our findings from the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia demonstrate that water quality parameters are not currently considered in classifying basic water services. This suggests that international efforts to address SDG 6 should incorporate water quality as a key parameter to better track international progress toward “clean water and sanitation” efforts. We discuss two potential pathways for stronger inclusion of water quality parameters in international definitions: (1) to mandate water quality within “functional” and “non-functional” definitions or (2) to add a ladder rung titled “safe basic water services” to the international drinking water ladder. Our findings from Ethiopia suggest that additional research should be undertaken in development contexts to assess whether or not “functional” basic water services provide safe drinking water to users."
https://openalex.org/W3191840902,"Natural background radiation is a permanent multicomponent factor. It has an influence on biological organisms, but effects of its deprivation still remain unclear. The aim of our work was to study for the first time responses of D . melanogaster to conditions of the Deep Underground Low-Background Laboratory DULB-4900 (BNO, INR, RAS, Russia) at the transcriptome level by RNA-seq profiling. Overall 77 transcripts demonstrated differential abundance between flies exposed to low and natural background radiation. Enriched biological process functional categories were established for all genes with differential expression. The results showed down-regulation of primary metabolic processes and up-regulation of both the immune system process and the response to stimuli. The comparative analysis of our data and publicly available transcriptome data on D . melanogaster exposed to low and high doses of ionizing radiation did not reveal common DEGs in them. We hypothesize that the observed changes in gene expression can be explained by the influence of the underground conditions in DULB-4900, in particular, by the lack of stimuli. Thus, our study challenges the validity of the LNT model for the region of background radiation doses below a certain level (~16.4 nGy h -1 ) and the presence of a dose threshold for D . melanogaster ."
https://openalex.org/W3188223044,"Since water supply association analysis plays an important role in attribution analysis of water supply fluctuation, how to carry out effective association analysis has become a critical problem. However, the current techniques and methods used for association analysis are not very effective because they are based on continuous data. In general, there is different degrees of monotone relationship between continuous data, which makes the analysis results easily affected by monotone relationship. The multicollinearity between continuous data distorts these analytical methods and may generate incorrect results. Meanwhile, we cannot know the association rules and value interval between features and water supply. Therefore, the lack of an effective analysis method hinders the water supply association analysis. Association rules and value interval of features obtained from association analysis are helpful to grasp cause of water supply fluctuation and know the fluctuation interval of water supply, so as to provide better support for water supply dispatching. But the association rules and value interval between features and water supply are not fully understood. In this study, a data mining method coupling kmeans clustering discretization and apriori algorithm was proposed. The kmeans was used for data discretization to obtain the one-hot encoding that can be recognized by apriori, and the discretization can also avoid the influence of monotone relationship and multicollinearity on analysis results. All the rules eventually need to be validated in order to filter out spurious rules. The results show that the method in this study is an effective association analysis method. The method can not only obtain the valid strong association rules between features and water supply, but also understand whether the association relationship between features and water supply is direct or indirect. Meanwhile, the method can also obtain value interval of features, the association degree between features and confidence probability of rules."
https://openalex.org/W3189981826,"Background Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is a systemic autoinflammatory disease in which danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)-mediated inflammasome activation seems to be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) belongs to a family of cold-shock proteins that respond to cellular stress and has been identified as a DAMP that triggers the inflammatory response. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical significance of serum CIRP levels in AOSD. Methods Serum samples were obtained from 44 patients with active AOSD or 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 15 healthy control patients (HCs). Serum levels of CIRP and IL-18 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared among AOSD patients, RA patients, SLE patients and HCs. Results were also analyzed according to the clinical features of AOSD. Results Serum CIRP levels were significantly higher in AOSD patients compared with RA patients (median: 9.6 ng/mL, IQR [5.7–14.4] versus 3.2 ng/mL, IQR [1.9–3.8]; p &lt; 0.001) and with HCs (2.8 ng/mL, [IQR; 1.4–4.9], p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between serum CIRP levels and AOSD disease activity score (Pouchot’s score r = 0.45, p = 0.003) as well as between AOSD-specific biomarkers ferritin and IL-18. However, there was no significant difference in the serum CIRP levels among AOSD patients with three different disease phenotypes. Conclusions These results suggest that CIRP may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of AOSD and could be a potential biomarker for monitoring the disease activity of AOSD."
https://openalex.org/W3190029610,"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main malaria vector control strategies in Mozambique alongside the distribution of insecticide treated nets. As part of the national insecticide resistance management strategy, Mozambique introduced SumiShield™ 50WG, a third generation IRS product, in 2018. Its residual efficacy was assessed in southern Mozambique during the 2018-2019 malaria season. Using a susceptible Anopheles arabiensis strain, residual efficacy was assessed on two different wall surfaces, cement and mud-plastered walls, using standard WHO (World Health Organization) cone bioassay tests at three different heights. Female mosquitoes of two age groups (2-5 and 13-26 day old) were exposed for 30 minutes, after which mortality was observed 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h and 120h post-exposure to assess (delayed) mortality. Lethal times (LT) 90, LT50 and LT10 were estimated using Bayesian models. Mortality 24h post exposure was consistently below 80%, the current WHO threshold value for effective IRS, in both young and old mosquitoes, regardless of wall surface type. Considering delayed mortality, residual efficacies (mosquito mortality equal or greater than 80%) ranged from 1.5 to ≥12.5 months, with the duration depending on mortality time post exposure, wall type and mosquito age. Looking at mortality 72h after exposure, residual efficacy was between 6.5 and 9.5 months, depending on wall type and mosquito age. The LT50 and LT10 (i.e. 90% of the mosquitoes survive exposure to the insecticides) values were consistently higher for older mosquitoes (except for LT10 values for 48h and 72h post-exposure mortality) and ranged from 0.9 to 5.8 months and 0.2 to 7.8 months for LT50 and LT10, respectively. The present study highlights the need for assessing mosquito mortality beyond the currently recommended 24h post exposure. Failure to do so may lead to underestimation of the residual efficacy of IRS products, as delayed mortality will lead to a further reduction in mosquito vector populations and potentially negatively impact disease transmission. Monitoring residual efficacy on relevant wall surfaces, including old mosquitoes that are ultimately responsible for malaria transmission, and assessing delayed mortalities are critical to provide accurate and actionable data to guide vector control programmes."

https://openalex.org/W3187870714,"Passengers’ requirements in relation to the Airport Service Quality is rapidly increasing and forcing companies and airport management to improve the services performances. It is clear that this enhancement can not overlook the implication of competitive issues and economic concerns. In this paper the authors deal with the optimization of the check-in area management in the international airport of Lisbon. The proposed bi-criteria objective function minimizes the operational costs plus the costs measuring the passengers’ discomfort in terms of waiting time in line. The quality of the supplied check-in service is measured and mapped into the Levels of Service system standardized by the International Air Transport Association. The type of passengers and their stochastic behavior and preferences are simulated by a discrete event model. The operational costs and the passengers’ satisfaction are optimized by an algorithm based on the Surrogate Method, the performance of which are compared to those of a greedy heuristic and of a genetic algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3191704786,"Estimating parameters accurately in groundwater models for aquifers is challenging because the models are non-explicit solutions of complex partial differential equations. Modern research methods, such as Monte Carlo methods and metaheuristic algorithms, for searching an efficient design to estimate model parameters require hundreds, if not thousands of model calls, making the computational cost prohibitive. One method to circumvent the problem and gain valuable insight on the behavior of groundwater is to first apply a Galerkin method and convert the system of partial differential equation s governing the flow to a discrete problem and then use a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to project the high-dimensional model space of the original groundwater model to create a reduced groundwater model with much lower dimensions. The reduced model can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than the full model and able to provide an accurate estimate of the full model. The task is still challenging because the optimization problem is non-convex, non-differentiable and there are continuous variables and integer-valued variables to optimize. Following convention, heuristic algorithms and a combination is used search to find efficient designs for the reduced groundwater model using various optimality criteria. The main goals are to introduce new design criteria and the concept of design efficiency for experimental design research in hydrology. The two criteria have good utility but interestingly, do not seem to have been implemented in hydrology. In addition, design efficiency is introduced. Design efficiency is a method to assess how robust a design is under a change of criteria. The latter is an important issue because the design criterion may be subjectively selected and it is well known that an optimal design can perform poorly under another criterion. It is thus desirable that the implemented design has relatively high efficiencies under a few criteria. As applications, two heuristic algorithms are used to find optimal designs for a small synthetic aquifer design problem and a design problem for a large-scale groundwater model and assess their robustness properties to other optimality criteria. The results show the proof of concept is workable for finding a more informed and efficient model-based design for a water resource study."

These effects may not be mutually exclusive. Using detailed data from 99 turbines at two wind farms in central Scotland and thousands of GPS-telemetry data from dispersing golden eagles, we tested three hypotheses. Before-and-after-operation analyses supported the hypothesis of avoidance: displacement was reduced at turbine locations in more preferred habitat and with more preferred habitat nearby. After-operation analyses (i.e. from the period when turbines were operational) showed that at higher wind speeds and in highly preferred habitat eagles were less wary of turbines with motionless blades: rejecting our second hypothesis. Our third hypothesis was supported, since at higher wind speeds eagles flew closer to operational turbines; especially–once more–turbines in more preferred habitat. After operation, eagles effectively abandoned inner turbine locations, and flight line records close to rotor blades were rare. While our study indicated that whole-wind farm functional habitat loss through avoidance was the substantial adverse impact, we make recommendations on future wind farm design to minimise collision risk further. These largely entail developers avoiding outer turbine locations which are in and surrounded by swathes of preferred habitat. Our study illustrates the insights which detailed case studies of large raptors at wind farms can bring and emphasises that the balance between avoidance and collision can have several influences."
https://openalex.org/W3187458179,"Background Hyperbilirubinemia is a devastating complication in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score classifies hyperbilirubinemia without further detailed analyses for bilirubin increase above 12 mg/dL. We evaluated whether the level of bilirubin increase in patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin ≥ 12 mg/dL) affects and also helps estimate mortality or recovery. Methods A retrospective cohort analysis comprising 427 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia admitted to the ICU of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between 2011 and 2015 was conducted. Extreme hyperbilirubinemia was classified into four grades: grade 1 (12–14.9 mg/dL), grade 2 (15–19.9 mg/dL), grade 3 (20–29.9 mg/dL), and grade 4 (≥ 30 mg/dL). These grades were then assessed for their association with hospital mortality and recovery from hyperbilirubinemia to SOFA grade (point) 2 or below (total bilirubin &lt; 6 mg/dL). The influences of various factors, some of which caused extreme hyperbilirubinemia, while others induced bilirubin recovery, were assessed. Results A total of 427 patients (mean age: 59.8 years, male: 67.0%) were evaluated, and the hospital mortality for these patients was very high (76.1%). Extreme hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 111 (grade 1, 26.0%), 99 (grade 2, 23.2%), 131 (grade3, 30.7%), and 86 (grade 4, 20.1%) patients with mortality rates of 62.2%, 71.7%, 81.7%, and 90.7%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The peak bilirubin value correlated with the mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.15, p &lt; 0.001). Compared to those with grade 1 extreme hyperbilirubinemia, the mortality rate gradually increased as the grade increased (OR [95% CI]: 1.92 [0.70–5.28], 3.55 [1.33–9.48], and 12.47 [3.07–50.59] for grades 2, 3 and 4, respectively). The main causes of extreme hyperbilirubinemia were infection including sepsis and hypoxic hepatitis. The recovery from hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 110 (25.8%) patients. Mortality was lower for those who recovered from hyperbilirubinemia than for those who did not (29.1% vs. 92.4%, p &lt; 0.001). The favorable factors of bilirubin recovery were albumin and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Conclusions This study determined that the level of extreme hyperbilirubinemia is an important prognostic factor in critically ill patients. We expect the results of this study to help predict the clinical course of and determine the optimal treatment for extreme hyperbilirubinemia."
https://openalex.org/W3187525558,"Background Hybrid methods of dietary patterns analysis have emerged as a unique and informative way to study diet-disease relationships in nutritional epidemiology research. Objective To identify an obesogenic dietary pattern using weighted partial least squares (wPLS) in nationally representative Canadian survey data, and to identify key foods and/or beverages associated with the defined dietary pattern. Design Data from one 24-hr dietary recall data from the cross-sectional Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition (CCHS) 2015 ( n = 12,049) were used. wPLS was used to identify an obesogenic dietary pattern from 40 standardized food and beverage categories using the variables energy density, fibre density, and total fat as outcomes. The association between the derived dietary pattern and likelihood of obesity was examined using weighted multivariate logistic regression. Key dietary components highly associated with the derived pattern were identified. Results Compared to quartile one (i.e. those least adherent to an obesogenic dietary pattern), those in quartile four had 2.40-fold increased odds of being obese (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.91, 3.02, P-trend&lt; 0.0001) with a monotonically increasing trend. Using a factor loading significance cut-off of ≥|0.17|, three food/beverage categories loaded positively for the derived obesogenic dietary pattern: fast food (+0.32), carbonated drinks (including energy drinks, sports drinks and vitamin water) (+0.30), and salty snacks (+0.19). Seven categories loaded negatively (i.e. in the protective direction): whole fruits (-0.40), orange vegetables (-0.32), “other” vegetables (-0.32), whole grains (-0.26), dark green vegetables (-0.22), legumes and soy (-0.18) and pasta and rice (-0.17). Conclusion This is the first study to apply weighted partial least squares to CCHS 2015 data to derive a dietary pattern associated with obesity. The results from this study pinpoint key dietary components that are associated with obesity and consumed among a nationally representative sample of Canadians adults."
https://openalex.org/W3188332151,"Relational bullying in schools is one of the most frequent forms of violence and can have severe negative health impact, e.g. depression. Social exclusion is the most prominent form of relational bullying that can be operationalized experimentally. The present study used MR-based perfusion imaging (pCASL) to investigate the neural signatures of social exclusion and its relationship with individually different extent of previous bullying experience. Twenty-four teenagers reporting bullying experience at different extent were scanned during a virtual ball-tossing (Cyberball game). Our findings showed that social exclusion (relative to social inclusion) activated frontal brain areas: sub- and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (sg/pgACC), left inferior frontal cortex (IFG), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Positive relationship between exclusion-specific signal increase and individually different extents of prior bullying experience was for the first time observed in left IFG and sgACC. This suggests that more frequent prior experience has conditioned greater mentalizing and/or rumination, in order to cope with the situation. While this interpretation remains speculative, the present data show that the experience of being bullied partly sensitizes the neural substrate relevant for the processing of social exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3188950434,"Advances in intravital microscopy (IVM) have enabled the studies of cellular organization and dynamics in the native microenvironment of intact organisms with minimal perturbation. The abilities to track specific cell populations and monitor their interactions have opened up new horizons for visualizing cell biology in vivo , yet the success of standard fluorescence cell labeling approaches for IVM comes with a “dark side” in that unlabeled cells are invisible, leaving labeled cells or structures to appear isolated in space, devoid of their surroundings and lacking proper biological context. Here we describe a novel method for “filling in the void” by harnessing the ubiquity of extracellular (interstitial) fluid and its ease of fluorescence labelling by commonly used vascular and lymphatic tracers. We show that during routine labeling of the vasculature and lymphatics for IVM, commonly used fluorescent tracers readily perfuse the interstitial spaces of the bone marrow (BM) and the lymph node (LN), outlining the unlabeled cells and forming negative contrast images that complement standard (positive) cell labeling approaches. The method is simple yet powerful, offering a comprehensive view of the cellular landscape such as cell density and spatial distribution, as well as dynamic processes such as cell motility and transmigration across the vascular endothelium. The extracellular localization of the dye and the interstitial flow provide favorable conditions for prolonged Intravital time lapse imaging with minimal toxicity and photobleaching."

The contact point of all ATM machines is the hand which on their own are ‘vaults’ of microorganisms. An elaborate survey was taken for complete assessment of possible microbial contamination in the Federal Polytechnic Ede campus. Selected ATM machines on campus were used as case study to characterize, identify and determine the degree of bacterial contamination of microorganisms and their potential as reservoir of microbes. Swabs were collected from each ATM screen, buttons, floor, user’s hand, and exposure of plates. After collection of the samples, they were plated in nutrient agar. The results showed the presence of increased bacterial count subsequently, most pathogens on characterization revealed the genus of the particular organisms E . coli , Pseudomonas , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella , Micrococcus , Salmonella and Serratia . The study showed the potential hazard inherent in ATM machine usage and draws attention to our level of hand hygiene compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3191538240,"In this study, single-SNP GWAS analyses were conducted to find regions affecting tolerance against trypanosomosis and morphometrics traits in purebred and crossbred Baoulé cattle of Burkina Faso. The trypanosomosis status (positive and negative) and a wide set of morphological traits were recorded for purebred Baoulé and crossbred Zebu x Baoulé cattle, and genotyped with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip. After quality control, 36,203 SNPs and 619 animals including 343 purebred Baoulé and 279 crossbreds were used for the GWAS analyses. Several important genes were found that can influence morphological parameters. Although there were no genes identified with a reported strong connection to size traits, many of them were previously identified in various growth-related studies. A re-occurring theme for the genes residing in the regions identified by the most significant SNPs was pleiotropic effect on growth of the body and the cardiovascular system. Regarding trypanosomosis tolerance, two potentially important regions were identified in purebred Baoulé on chromosomes 16 and 24, containing the CFH, CRBN, TRNT1 and, IL5RA genes, and one additional genomic region in Baoulé, x Zebu crossbreds on chromosome 5, containing MGAT4C and NTS. Almost all of these regions and genes were previously related to the trait of interest, while the CRBN gene was to our knowledge presented in the context of trypanosomiasis tolerance for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W3191908330,"Background In tropical and subtropical countries, tick infestation causes major public health problems and considerable financial losses to the livestock industry. This study was aimed to assess the species composition of richness and analyze the phylogeny of Rhipicephalus microplus in the District Bannu of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Methods Collected ticks were identified morphologically and DNA extracted from R . microplus was amplified and subjected to sequencing. Results A total of 3,600 animals were examined among them 1,494 animals were found to be infested with ticks, including 669 cows, 476 buffaloes, 163 goats, and 186 sheep ( p = 0.001). Tick infestation was significantly high (43.58%) in animals of age group (&lt;1 year) ( p- value = 0.027). Female animals were more (44.05%) infested with ticks than males (34.43%) ( p = 0.001). The intensity of infestation was significantly higher in summer (77.49%) ( p = 0.001). A total of 5,557 ticks were collected comprising three genera and six species. R . microplus was predominantly prevalent (n = 1,474; 26.52%), followed by Rhipicephalus annulatus ( n = 1,215; 21.86%), Hyalomma anatolicum (n = 1,139; 20.49%), Hyalomma marginatum (n = 1,086; 19.54%), and Rhipicephalus turanicus (n = 761; 13.69%), while the least common was Haemaphysalis aciculifer (n = 80; 1.43%) ( p = 0.001). Morphologically identified R . microplus species were also analyzed genetically by using two genetic markers 16S ribosomal RNA ( 16S rRNA ) and internal transcribed spacer 2 ( ITS2 ) genes. The phylogenetic study revealed that R . microplus is genetically diversified and clustered in clade B with R . microplus species from China, India, and Pakistan. Conclusion Ticks infestation was significantly correlated with various factors including age, sex, season, and animal type. R . microplus genetically resembled species reported from India and China. However, major knowledge gaps concerning various species of ticks exist and many areas are still unexplored in Pakistan. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the epidemiological and molecular aspects of various tick species in other regions of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa."
https://openalex.org/W3187161280,"More than 450 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, or 1 in 11 people. Chronic hyperglycemia degrades patients’ quality of life and the development of neuropathic pain contributes to the burden of this disease. In this study, we used the mouse model of streptozocin-induced diabetic type 1 neuropathy to assess the analgesic potential of etifoxine. Etifoxine is a prescribed anxiolytic that increases GABAAA receptor function through a direct positive allosteric modulation effect and, indirectly, by stimulating the production of endogenous GABAA receptor positive modulators such as allopregnanolone-type neurosteroids. We show that a post-symptomatic or preventive treatment strongly and durably reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and anxiety in diabetic neuropathic mice. This analgesic and neuroprotective effect on painful symptoms and emotional comorbidities is promising and should now be clinically evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W3188804690,"We aimed to examine rates of breast and cervical cancer screening in women with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) versus a matched cohort with IMID; and examine the association of psychiatric comorbidity with screening in these populations. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Manitoba, Canada using administrative data. We identified women with IBD, MS and RA, and controls without these IMID matched on age and region. Annually, we identified individuals with any active mood/anxiety disorder. Using physician claims, we determined the proportion of each cohort who had cervical cancer screening within three-year intervals, and mammography screening within two-year intervals. We modeled the difference in the proportion of the IMID and matched cohorts who underwent mammography; and pap tests using log-binomial regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbidity and immune therapy use. We tested for additive interactions between cohort and mood/anxiety disorder status. During 2006–2016, we identified 17,230 women with IMID (4,623 with IBD, 3,399 with MS, and 9,458 with RA) and 85,349 matched controls. Having an IMID was associated with lower (-1%) use of mammography; however, this reflected a mixture of more mammography in the IBD cohort (+2.9%) and less mammography in the MS (-4.8 to -5.2%) and RA (-1.5%) cohorts. Within the IBD, MS and RA cohorts, having an active mood/anxiety disorder was associated with more mammography use than having an inactive mood/anxiety disorder. The MS and RA cohorts were less likely to undergo Pap testing than their matched cohorts. In the absence of an active mood/anxiety disorder, the IBD cohort was more likely to undergo Pap testing than its matched cohort; the opposite was true when an active mood/anxiety disorder was present. Among women with an IMID, mood/anxiety disorder influence participation in cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3189374007,"Inter-individual variability in quantitative traits is believed to potentially inflate the quality of results in animal experimentation. Yet, to our knowledge this effect has not been empirically tested. Here we test whether inter-individual variability in emotional response within mouse inbred strains affects the outcome of a pharmacological experiment. Three mouse inbred strains (BALB/c, C57BL/6 and 129S2) were behaviorally characterized through repeated exposure to a mild aversive stimulus (modified Hole Board, five consecutive trials). A multivariate clustering procedure yielded two multidimensional response types which were displayed by individuals of all three strains. We show that systematic incorporation of these individual response types in the design of a pharmacological experiment produces different results from an experimental pool in which this variation was not accounted for. To our knowledge, this is the first study that empirically confirms that inter-individual variability affects the interpretation of behavioral phenotypes and may obscure experimental results in a pharmacological experiment."
https://openalex.org/W3190344525,"Background Poor healthcare-seeking behaviour is a major contributing factor for increased morbidity and mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. This study assessed the individual and community level factors associated with healthcare-seeking behaviour for childhood illnesses among mothers of children under five in Chad. Methods The study utilized data from the 2014–2015 Chad Demographic and Health Survey. A total of 5,693 mothers who reported that their children under five had either fever accompanied by cough or diarrhea or both within the two weeks preceding the survey were included in this study. The outcome variable for the study was healthcare-seeking behaviour for childhood illnesses. The data were analyzed using Stata version 14.2. Multilevel binary logistic regression model was employed due to the hierarchical nature of the dataset. Results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Out of the 5,693 mothers who reported that their children under five had either fever accompanied by cough, diarrhea or both at any time in the 2 weeks preceding the survey, 79.6% recalled having sought treatment for their children’s illnesses. In terms of the individual level factors, mothers who faced financial barriers to healthcare access were less likely to seek healthcare for childhood illnesses, relative to those who faced no financial barrier (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65–0.99). Mothers who reported that distance to the health facility was a barrier were less likely to seek healthcare for childhood illnesses, compared to those who faced no geographical barrier to healthcare access (aOR = 79, 95% CI = 0.65–0.95). Mothers who were cohabiting were less likely to seek healthcare for childhood illnesses compared to married mothers (aOR = 0.62 95% CI = 0.47–0.83). Lower odds of healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses was noted among mothers who did not listen to radio at all, relative to those who listened to radio at least once a week (aOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55–0.91). Mothers who mentioned that their children were larger than average size at birth had a lesser likelihood of seeking childhood healthcare, compared to those whose children were of average size (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66–0.95). We further noted that with the community level factors, mothers who lived in communities with medium literacy level were less likely to seek childhood healthcare than those in communities with high literacy (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.53–0.99). Conclusion The study revealed that both individual (financial barriers to healthcare access, geographical barriers to healthcare access, marital status, frequency of listening to radio and size of children at birth) and community level factors (community level literacy) are associated with healthcare-seeking behaviour for childhood illnesses in Chad. The government of Chad, through multi-sectoral partnership, should strengthen health systems by removing financial and geographical barriers to healthcare access. Moreover, the government should create favourable conditions to improve the status of mothers and foster their overall socio-economic wellbeing and literacy through employment and education. Other interventions should include community sensitization of cohabiting mothers and mothers with children whose size at birth is large to seek healthcare for their children when they are ill. This can be done using radio as means of information dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W3192994914,"Workplace discrimination may affect the health of the exposed employees, but it is not known whether workplace discrimination is also associated with an increased risk of long-term sickness absence. The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal associations of changes in and onset of workplace discrimination with the risk of long-term sickness absence. Data on workplace discrimination were obtained from 29,597 employees participating in survey waves 2004, 2006, 2008 and/or 2010 of the Finnish Public Sector Study. Four-year changes in long-term sickness absence (≥10 days of medically certified absence with a mental or non-mental diagnosis) were assessed. This covered successive study waves in analyses of onset of workplace discrimination as well as fixed effect analyses of change in workplace discrimination (concurrent i.e. during the exposure year and 1-year lagged i.e. within one year following exposure), by using each employee as his/her own control. The risk of long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders was greater for employees with vs. without onset of workplace discrimination throughout the 4-year period, reaching a peak at the year when the onset of discrimination was reported (adjusted risk ratio 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-2.52). The fixed effects analyses showed that workplace discrimination was associated with higher odds of concurrent, but not 1-year lagged, long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders (adjusted odds ratio 1.61; 95% CI 1.33-1.96 and adjusted odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.25, respectively). Long-term sickness absence due to non-mental conditions was not associated with workplace discrimination. In conclusion, these findings suggest that workplace discrimination is associated with an elevated risk of long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders. Supporting an acute effect, the excess risk was confined to the year when workplace discrimination occurred."

Trained interviewers applied the standardized questionnaire to 450 participants. Sociodemographic, health, income and work characteristics were investigated. The tracking of alcohol misuse was done using the CAGE questionnaire (Cut down, Annoyed by criticism, Guilty and Eye-opener), being the cut-off point ≥ 2. Poisson Regression was applied with robust estimation to verify the reasons of prevalence (RP) in bivariate and multivariate analysis. The prevalence of alcohol abuse among farmers was 32% (95% CI 27.8-36.4). Factors such as being male, having a diagnosis of mental disorder in the family, being a smoker, and using drugs were associated with the higher prevalence of the outcome. Being 60 years old or older was associated with a lower prevalence of alcohol abuse. These results indicate the need for social support to this group of workers in the context of occupational health."
https://openalex.org/W3137778671,"Objective Although mental disorder is one of the most common comorbidities of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is known as a critical influence on RA remission rates, there is little knowledge regarding a possible therapeutic strategy for depression or anxiety in a RA population. Most recently, clinical evidence of dietary improvement for depression has emerged in a general population, but the relationship between dietary habits and mental disorder has not been investigated in RA. The purpose of this study is to elucidate clinical associations between mental disorder (depression/anxiety), dietary habits and disease activity/physical function in patients with RA. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed with 267 female outpatients from the KURAMA database. Using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), we classified the participants into three groups by depression state, and their characteristics were compared. Using the 20-items on the self-reported food frequency questionnaire, we investigated the relationship between dietary habits and depression or anxiety, adopting a trend test and a multivariate standardized linear regression analysis for the HADS score of depression or that of anxiety as a dependent variable. Results According to the classified stage of depression, current disease activity (DAS28-CRP: 28-Joint RA Disease Activity Score-C-reactive protein) and the health assessment questionnaire disability Index (HAQ-DI) were significantly increased. Trend analyses revealed that the depression score was inversely associated with the consumption of three food (fish, vegetables and fruit) out of twenty as was the anxiety score with only fish intake. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the depression score was negatively associated with frequent fish intake (≥ 3 times per week) (Estimate -0.53, p = 0.033), HAQ-DI score within normal range (Estimate -0.88, p ≤ 0.001) and MTX use (Estimate -0.60, p ≤ 0.023). For the anxiety score, multivariate analysis showed similar but not significant associations with variables except for HAQ-DI score. Conclusions In a RA population, both depression and anxiety had a significant and negative association with HAQ-DI score, and depression rather than anxiety had negative association with frequent fish intake. Modification of dietary habits such as increased fish consumption may have a beneficial effect on the depression state in RA patients."

However, whether MFs could increase blood flow leading to muscle fatigue recovery has not been sufficiently tested. We investigated the acute effects of a 50 Hz sinusoidal MF at B max 180 mT on hemodynamics, electrocardiogram, and vascular endothelial function in healthy young men. Three types of regional exposures to a 50 Hz MF, i.e., forearm, upper arm, or neck exposure to MF were performed. Participants who received three types of real MF exposures had significantly increased ulnar arterial blood flow velocity compared to the sham exposures. Furthermore, after muscle loading exercise, MF exposure recovered hemoglobin oxygenation index values faster and higher than sham exposure from the loading condition. Moreover, participants who received real MF exposure in the neck region had significantly increased parasympathetic high-frequency activity relative to the sham exposure. The MF exposure in the upper arm region significantly increased the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation compared to the sham exposure. Computer simulations of induced in situ electric fields indicated that the order-of-magnitude estimates of the peak values were 100–500 mV/m, depending on the exposure conditions. This study provides the first evidence that a 50 Hz MF can activate parasympathetic activity and thereby lead to increase vasodilation and blood flow via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W3190935597,"Background Access to health services across the continuum of care improves maternal and newborn health outcomes. Ethiopia launched the Community-Based Newborn Care programme in 2013 to increase the coverage of antenatal care, institutional delivery, postnatal care and newborn care. The programme also introduced gentamicin and amoxicillin treatment by health extension workers for young infants with possible serious bacterial infection when referral was not possible. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the coverage of health services for mothers and their young infants increased after the initiation of the programme. Methods A baseline survey was conducted in October-December 2013 and a follow-up survey four years later in November-December 2017. At baseline, 10,224 households and 1,016 women who had a live birth in the 3–15 months prior to the survey were included. In the follow-up survey, 10,270 households and 1,057 women with a recent live birth were included. Women were asked about their experience of care during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum periods, as well as the treatment provided for their child’s illness in the first 59 days of life. Results Between baseline and follow-up surveys the proportion of women reporting at least one antenatal care visit increased by 15 percentage points (95% CI: 10,19), four or more antenatal care visits increased by 17 percentage points (95%CI: 13,22), and institutional delivery increased by 40 percentage points (95% CI: 35,44). In contrast, the proportion of newborns with a postnatal care visit within 48 hours of birth decreased by 6 percentage points (95% CI: -10, -3) for home deliveries and by 14 percentage points (95% CI: -21, -7) for facility deliveries. The proportion of mothers reporting that their young infant with possible serious bacterial infection received amoxicillin for seven days increased by 50 percentage points (95% CI: 37,62) and gentamicin for seven days increased by 15 percentage points (95% CI: 5,25). Concurrent use of both antibiotics increased by 12 percentage points (95% CI: 4,19). Conclusion The Community-Based Newborn Care programme was an ambitious initiative to enhance the access to services for pregnant women and newborns. Major improvements were seen for the number of antenatal care visits and institutional delivery, while postnatal care remained alarmingly low. Antibiotic treatment for young infants with possible serious bacterial infection increased, although most treatment did not follow national guidelines. Improving postnatal care coverage and using a simplified antibiotic regimen following recent World Health Organization guidelines could address gaps in the care provided for sick young infants."
https://openalex.org/W3192260090,"Due to the complexity of socio-economic-related issues, people thought of housing market as a chaotic nucleus situated at the intersection of neighboring sciences. It has been known that the dependence of house features on the residential property value can be estimated employing the well-established hedonic regression analysis method in teams of location characteristic, neighborhood characteristic and structure characteristic. However, to further assess the roles of urban infrastructures in housing markets, we proposed a new kind of volatility measure for house prices utilizing the Lie symmetry analysis of quantum theory based on Schrödinger equation, mainly focusing on the effects of transportation systems and public parks on residential property values. Based on the municipal open government data regularly collected for four cities, including Boston, Milwaukee, Taipei and Tokyo, and all spatial sampling sites were featured by United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Map, transportation and park were modelled as perturbations to the quantum states generated by the feature space in response to the environmental amenities with different spatial extents. In an attempt to ascertain the intrinsic impact of the location-dependent price information obtained, the similarity functions associated with the Schrödinger equation were considered to facilitate revealing the city amenities capitalizing into house prices. By examining the spatial spillover phenomena of house prices in the four cities investigated, it was found that the mass transit systems and the public green lands possessed the infinitesimal generators of Lie point symmetries Y 2 and Y 5 , respectively. Compared statistically with the common performance criteria, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and, root mean squared error (RMSE) obtained by hedonic pricing model, the Lie symmetry analysis of the Schrödinger equation approach developed herein was successfully carried out. The invariant-theoretical characterizations of economics-related phenomena are consonant with the observed residential property values of the cities internationally, ultimately leading to develop a new perspective in the global financial architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3187478455,"Due to the rapid growth of information available about individual patients, most physicians suffer from information overload and inefficiencies when they review patient information in health information technology systems. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid dynamic and multi-collaborative filtering method to improve information retrieval from electronic health records. This method recommends relevant information from electronic health records to physicians during patient visits. It models information search dynamics using a Markov model. It also leverages the key idea of collaborative filtering, originating from Recommender Systems, for prioritizing information based on various similarities among physicians, patients and information items. We tested this new method using electronic health record data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care, a large, inter-organizational clinical data repository maintained by the Indiana Health Information Exchange. Our experimental results demonstrated that, for top-5 recommendations, our method was able to correctly predict the information in which physicians were interested in 46.7% of all test cases. For top-1 recommendations, the corresponding figure was 24.7%. In addition, the new method was 22.3% better than the conventional Markov model for top-1 recommendations."

Peak oxygen uptake (VO2), body mass index (BMI), resting systolic blood pressure (BPsys), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were assessed before CR (T0), at termination of CR (T1), and 12 months after start of CR (T2). Predictors for changes were identified by multivariate regression models.Data was available from 1241 out of 1633 EU-CaRE patients. The strongest predictor for improvement in peak VO2 was open chest surgery, with a nearly four-fold increase in surgery compared to non-surgery patients. In patients after surgery, age, female sex, physical inactivity and time from index event to T0 were negative predictors for improvement in peak VO2. In patients without surgery, previous acute coronary syndrome and higher exercise capacity at T0 were the only negative predictors. Neither number of attended training sessions nor duration of CR were significantly associated with change in peak VO2. Non-surgery patients were more likely to achieve risk factor targets (BPsys, LDL-C, BMI) than surgery patients.In a previously understudied population of elderly CR patients, time between index event and start of CR in surgery and disease severity in non-surgery patients were the most important predictors for long-term improvement of peak VO2. Non-surgery patients had better CVRF control."
https://openalex.org/W3187335066,"MTS-810 material testing machine and acoustic emission signal analyzer were adopted to explore the mechanical behavior of concrete beams broken by the static load and the nonlinear cumulative damage law of concrete beams broken by fatigue bending from single-stage loading. Then, by introducing the Ramesh Talreja’s Damage Criterion, the damage rule of single-stage loading was extended to the damage accumulation rule under multi-stage loading, and the results were verified by the results of two-stage and three-stage fatigue loading tests. Two main conclusions are achieved: first, affected by four-point bending load, the fatigue life of the concrete specimen is in line with the law of the two-parameter Weibull distribution, namely the higher the stress level is, the shorter the fatigue life is. Second, an obvious nonlinear relationship was discovered in the damage of concrete. The model deduced in this paper and the Palmgren-Miner linear damage accumulation model were adopted to compare the test results of flexural fatigue under single, two and three stage loads. The calculation results of this model were more reliable."
https://openalex.org/W3187429756,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) cases involving recantation invoke concerns about children’s reliability. Expert testimony can help explain the complexities of these cases. Experts have historically relied on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS), yet this is not science-based. In a CSA case involving recantation, how would evidence-based testimony affect perceptions of child credibility when compared to CSAAS? Across 2 studies, we test the effects of expert testimony based on evidence-based science, nonscientific evidence, and experience-based evidence on outcomes in CSA cases involving recantation. Evidence-based testimony led to higher perceptions of credibility and scientific rigor of the evidence when compared to CSAAS testimony. Evidence-based testimony also led to more guilty verdicts when compared to the control. In sum, jurors had some ability to detect evidence strength, such that evidence-based expert testimony was superior to CSAAS testimony in many respects, and consistently superior to experience-based testimony in these cases."
https://openalex.org/W3187962852,"Introduction Urinary excretion of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), iodine and fluoride is used to assess their statuses and/or the existence of metabolic abnormalities. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the urinary concentration of these minerals among children have not been documented. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study, including 593 subjects (232 boys and 361 girls), was conducted among healthy 6 to 11-year-old Emirati children living in Dubai. Non-fasting morning urine samples and anthropometrical measurements were collected and analyzed. Results were expressed as per mg of creatinine (Cr). Results On average, estimated Cr excretion was 17.88±3.12 mg/kg/d. Mean urinary Ca/Cr, Mg/Cr and P/Cr excretions were 0.08±0.07 mg/mg, 0.09±0.04 mg/mg, and 0.57±0.26 mg/mg respectively. Urinary excretion of Ca, Mg and P were found to decrease as age increased. Urinary excretion and predicted intake of fluoride were lower than 0.05 mg/kg body weight per day. Surprisingly, more than 50% of the children were found to have urinary iodine excretion level above adequate. Conclusion The Emirati schoolchildren had comparable levels of urinary Ca, Mg and P excretion to other countries. The 95% percentile allows the use of the current data as a reference value for the detection of mineral abnormalities. Fluoride excretion implies that Emirati children are at low risk of fluorosis. The level of urinary iodine excretion is slightly higher than recommended and requires close monitoring of the process of salt iodization to avoid the harmful impact of iodine overconsumption."
https://openalex.org/W3189019920,"Background Recent studies in the Sub-Saharan countries in Africa have indicated gaps and challenges for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) quality of service. Less has focused on the changes in quality of service after implementation of continuous quality improvement (CQI) action plans. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of coaching, provision of standard operating procedures (SOPS) and guidelines, mentoring and on-site in-service training in improving quality of VMMC services across four Right to Care (RTC) supported provinces in South Africa. Method This was a pre- and post-interventional study on RTC supported VMMC sites from July 2018 to October 2019. All RTC-supported sites that were assessed at baseline and post-intervention were included in the study. Data for baseline CQI assessment and re-assessments was collected using a standardized National Department of Health (NDoH) CQI assessment tool for VMMC services from routine RTC facility level VMMC programme data. Quality improvement support was provided through a combination of coaching, provision of standard operating procedures and guidelines, mentoring and on-site in-service training on quality improvement planning and implementation. The main outcome measure was quality of service. A paired sample t-test was used to compare the difference in mean quality of service scores before and after CQI implementation by quality standard. Results A total of 40 health facilities were assessed at both baseline and after CQI support visits. Results showed significant increases for the overall changes in quality of service after CQI support intervention of 12% for infection prevention (95%CI: 7–17; p&lt;0.001) and 8% for male circumcision surgical procedure, (95%CI: 3–13; p&lt;0.01). Similarly, individual counselling, and HIV testing increased by 14%, (95%CI: 7–20; p&lt;0.001), group counselling, registration and communication by 8%, (95%CI: 3–14; p&lt;0.001), and 35% for monitoring and evaluation, (95%CI: 28–42; p&lt;0.001). In addition, there were significant increases for management systems of 29%, (95%CI: 22–35; p&lt;0.001), leadership and planning 23%, (95%CI: 13–34; p&lt;0.001%) and supplies, equipment, environment and emergency 5%, (95%CI: 1–9; p&lt;0.01). The overall quality of service performance across provinces increased by 18% (95%CI: 14–21; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The overall quality of service performance across provinces was significantly improved after implementation of CQI support intervention program. Regular visits and intensive CQI support are required for sites that will be performing below quality standards."
https://openalex.org/W3190950895,"Objectives Many studies have investigated the surgical outcome and predictive factors of acoustic neuroma using different approaches. The present study focused on large tumors due to the greater likelihood of internal acoustic meatus involvement and the greater application of surgical intervention than radiosurgery. There have been no previous reports on outcomes of internal acoustic meatus tumor removal. We investigated the impact of the extent of internal acoustic meatus tumor removal using a translabyrinthine approach for large acoustic neuroma surgery and predictive factors of tumor control. Methods This retrospective study reviewed 104 patients with large cerebellopontine angle tumor &gt;3 cm treated by translabyrinthine approach microsurgery. Predictive factors of postoperative facial palsy, tumor control, and extent of internal acoustic meatus tumor removal were assessed. Results The mean tumor size was 38.95 ± 6.83 mm. Postoperative facial function showed 76.9% acceptable function (House–Brackmann grade 1 or 2) six months after surgery. The extent of internal acoustic meatus tumor removal was a statistically significant predictor factor of poor postoperative facial function. Younger age, larger tumor size needing radiosurgery, and more extensive removal of tumor were associated with better tumor control. Conclusion More extensive internal acoustic meatus tumor removal was associated with poor postoperative facial function and better tumor control."
https://openalex.org/W3192770545,"People living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death, with greater burdens of both HIV and CVD in lower-middle income countries. Treating prehypertension in PLWH may reduce progression to hypertension, CVD risk and potentially mortality. However, no trial has evaluated earlier blood pressure treatment for PLWH. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, benefits, and risks of initiating antihypertensive treatment among PLWH with prehypertension, comparing prehypertension treatment to standard of care following current WHO guidelines.A total of 250 adults 18-65 years and living with HIV (PLWH) with viral suppression in the past 12 months, who have prehypertension will be randomized to prehypertension treatment versus standard of care. Prehypertension is defined as having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 120-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 80-89 mmHg. In the prehypertension treatment arm, participants will initiate amlodipine 5 mg daily immediately. In the standard of care arm, participants will initiate amlodipine only if they develop hypertension defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. The primary outcome is the difference in mean change of SBP from enrollment to 12 months. Secondary outcomes include feasibility, acceptability, adverse effects, HIV viral suppression, and medication adherence. Qualitative in-depth interviews with providers and participants will explore attitudes about initiating amlodipine, satisfaction, perceived CVD risk, and implementation challenges.PLWH have a higher CVD risk and may benefit from a lower BP threshold for initiation of antihypertensive treatment.Clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT04692467, registration date December 15, 2020, protocol ID 20-03021735."
https://openalex.org/W3188117766,"Objective To explore the awareness and knowledge of applicable guidelines on acute cough among general practitioners, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians and to compare their recommendation behavior and clinical decision making to the evidence-based recommendation in the applicable guidelines. Methods An anonymous online survey was performed among 303 members of an existing panel of healthcare professionals (HCPs). They were presented with a hypothetical case vignette representative of their daily practice and asked for their treatment recommendations. After being shown an excerpt from the applicable guidelines, these questions were repeated. Results Forty-six % of participants reported to seek information on cough and respiratory conditions very often or often. Among 12 non-prescription treatments-commonly used over-the-counter-products for acute cough, HCPs most often recommended various plant extract-based products (phytotherapeutic remedies) for the acute cough case, whereas chemically defined options such as ambroxol or N-acetyl-cysteine were recommended less often. Following presentation of the guidelines excerpt, recommendations of the phytotherapeutic remedies decreased moderately whereas that of the guideline-recommended ambroxol more than doubled. Among stated reasons for the recommendation guideline conformity increased from 5% to 35% among the top-3 reasons. Conclusions The recommendations for the treatment of acute cough by professionals involved in primary healthcare deviated considerably from the applicable guideline recommendation but changed after presentation of a guidelines excerpt and knowledge thereof. We conclude that dissemination of applicable guideline knowledge is relevant to improve evidence-based healthcare and clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3189282594,"It is an effective expansion of the research on the Board of Directors to do the research based on different board meeting forms and their effects sampling A-share companies listed in 2007–2017, the article empirically tests the impact of the times of board meetings, the proportion of on-site board meetings on listed companies’ over-investment. Consequently and significantly, the times of board meetings is positively correlated with over-investment, while the proportion of on-site board meetings is negatively correlated with over-investment. That is, the on-site meeting for the Board decision-making will better inhibit the enterprises’ over-investment behaviors. Further research shows that when there is a controlling shareholder in the company or in a dual position, the on-site board meeting no longer has a significant inhibitory effect on over-investment. By research on the independence of the Board of Directors, it is found that when selecting on-site board decision-making, the existence of independent directors has an over-investment suppression effect, and the higher the proportion of independent directors, the more obvious the inhibitory effect is. The samples are divided into state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, the study found that when choosing on-site board meetings, state-owned enterprises have a greater inhibitory effect on over-investment than private enterprises. The findings of this study will enrich the research of the board meeting and provide a new testing method for the relevant research of the Board of Directors."
https://openalex.org/W3189890757,"Background Exposure to tobacco imagery in films causes young people to start smoking. Popular Indian films contain high levels of tobacco imagery, but those that do are required by law to display onscreen health warnings when smoking imagery occurs and to include other health promotion messaging before and during the film. We report a prospective cohort study of incident smoking in relation to exposure to film tobacco imagery and anti-tobacco messaging in a cohort of children in southern India. Methods We carried out a one-year longitudinal follow up questionnaire survey in 2018 of a cohort of 39,282 students in grades 6, 7 and 8 (aged between 10 and 15 years) in schools in the Udupi district of Karnataka State in India who participated in a 2017 cross-sectional study of exposure to smoking in films and ever smoking status. Results We obtained usable linked data in 2018 from 33,725 of the 39,282 (86%) participants with data from 2017. Incident smoking was reported by 382 (1.1%) participants. After adjusting for age, sex and common confounders significantly associated with incident smoking there was no significant independent effect of exposure to film smoking, either as a binary (Odds Ratio 1.6, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.5 to 4.9) or as a graded variable, on smoking uptake. An exploratory analysis indicated that the presence of on-screen health warnings that complied fully with Indian law was associated with a significantly lower odds of smoking uptake (Odds Ratio 0.8 (0.6 to 1.0, p = 0.031) relative to the same exposure sustained in absence of compliant warnings. Conclusion Exposure to tobacco imagery in Indian films was not associated with a significantly increased risk of incident smoking in South Indian children. While it is possible that this finding is a false negative, it is also possible that the effect of film exposure has been attenuated by the presence of on-screen health warnings or other Indian tobacco-free film rules. Our findings therefore support the wider implementation of similar tobacco-free film measures in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W3192062475,"Background Hemodialysis is a life-saving renal replacement treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease, but various complications occur during hemodialysis and associated procedures. This study was conducted to analyze the specific characteristics of hemodialysis-related complications and malpractice that have led to legal disputes. Methods Judgments from cases litigated between 1991 and 2019 due to complications related to hemodialysis or vascular access were analyzed using the database of the Korean Supreme Court Judgment System. Results Of 32 dialysis-related litigation cases, 14 cases were dismissed and malpractice was recognized in 18 cases. Among all cases and those in which malpractice was recognized, the most common clinical complication was associated with central venous catheter (CVC) insertion (25.0% and 42.9%, respectively). In 22 of 32 (68.8%) cases, complications occurred before or after (not during) dialysis, and performance error was the most common clinical error leading to legal disputes (58.3%). Complications resulted in death in 59.4% of cases, and CVC-related complications were associated with the largest proportion (63.2%) of deaths. Conclusions Hemodialysis was implicated in various medical disputes, and CVC-related complications were the most common and serious adverse events. Clinicians’ awareness of the incidence and severity of possible complications of hemodialysis procedures should be increased."
