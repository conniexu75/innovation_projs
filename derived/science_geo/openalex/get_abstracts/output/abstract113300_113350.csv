https://openalex.org/W2000082154,"The Elk-1 and SRF transcription factors form a ternary complex at the c-fos serum response element (SRE). Growth factor stimulation rapidly induces a reversible change in the electrophoretic mobility of the ternary complex, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the Elk-1 C-terminal region and by the activation of a 42 kd cellular Elk-1 kinase. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 in vitro by partially purified p42/p44 MAP kinase induces a similar reduction in ternary complex mobility but has little effect on the efficiency of its formation. In vitro, MAP kinase phosphorylates the Elk-1 C-terminal region at multiple sites, which are also phosphorylated following growth factor stimulation in vivo. The Elk-1 C-terminal region functions as a regulated transcriptional activation domain whose activity in vivo is dependent on the integrity of the MAP kinase sites. These findings directly link transcriptional activation by the SRE to the growth factor-regulated phosphorylation of an SRE-binding protein"

https://openalex.org/W2037908014,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent regulator of oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro, but its effect on myelination in vivo has never been tested directly. Therefore, we examined brain growth and myelination in a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses IGF-I. By postnatal day 55, when brain growth and myelination are essentially complete in normal mice, the brains of transgenic mice were 55% larger than those of controls owing to an increase in cell size and apparently in cell number. Most or all brain structures appeared to be affected. At the same time, total myelin content of the transgenic mice was 130% greater than that of controls. Oligodendrocyte number as a percentage of total cell number was not increased in the transgenic mouse brains; the increase in myelin content was primarily the result of an increase in myelin production per oligodendrocyte. These findings indicate that IGF-I is a potent inducer of brain growth and myelination in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518153787,"Abstract Specific antisera were produced to peptides representing the carboxyl termini of three subtypes of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) beta which have been identified by isolation of cDNAs (Kriz, R., Lin, L., Sultzman, L., Ellis, C., Heldin, C., Pawson, T., and Knopf, J. (1990) Ciba Found. Symp. 150, 112-127). Screening with the antisera indicates that PIPLC beta 3 is present in a variety of cell lines and rat tissues, whereas the distribution of PIPLC beta 1 and beta 2 is more restricted. A combination of conventional and immunoaffinity chromatographic techniques was used to purify PIPLC beta 1 and beta 3 from rat brain membranes. PIPLC beta 2 was purified from cytosol of HL60 cells. All three subtypes were activated by purified G protein alpha q/11 subunits with the following relative efficacies: PIPLC beta 3 > or = PIPLC beta 1 > PIPLC beta 2. All three PIPLC subtypes were also activated by G protein beta gamma subunits with varying efficacies. The presence of beta gamma subunits depressed the ability of alpha q/11 to activate PIPLC beta 1 and beta 3 at low Mg2+ concentrations (1 mM). At higher concentrations of Mg2+ (2 mM or greater), activation of PIPLC beta 3, but not PIPLC beta 1, by beta gamma and alpha q/11 became additive. PIPLC beta 3 was activated by alpha q/11 even in the presence of a saturating concentration of beta gamma subunits. This indicates that there are separate sites for interaction of PIPLCs with G protein subunits and that this interaction differs depending on the enzyme subtype and the concentration of Mg2+."

https://openalex.org/W1963851776,"Adaptation of single cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels was demonstrated by application of the caged calcium ion (Ca2+) methodology. In contrast to conventional desensitization found in surface membrane ligand-gated channels, single cardiac RyR channels adapted to maintained Ca2+ stimuli, preserving their ability to respond to a second (larger) Ca2+ stimulus. RyR adaptation may represent a molecular control mechanism for smoothly graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release in heart and may be a fundamental feature of channels, including the inositol triphosphate receptor, that are involved in intracellular Ca2+ signaling in many cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2073141866,"The bloodsucking bug Rhodnius prolixus has a salivary vasodilator, previously characterized as a nitrovasodilator, with salivary smooth muscle-relaxing and antiplatelet activity. Rhodnius salivary glands are bright red owing to the abundance of heme proteins. Electron paramagnetic resonance and optical spectroscopic experiments indicated that the salivary vasodilator is a nitrosylheme protein with an Fe(III) heme that binds nitric oxide (NO) reversibly. Dilution of the protein in neutral pH promoted NO release. This protein thus appears to be the NO carrier that helps R. prolixus to feed on blood."
https://openalex.org/W2136065229,"The complete amino acid sequence of a rabbit brain calcium channel (BIII) has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the cDNA. The open reading frame encodes 2339 amino acids, which corresponds to an M(r) of 261,167. A phylogenetic tree representing evolutionary relationships indicates that BIII is grouped together with the other rabbit brain calcium channels, BI and BII, into a subfamily that is distinct from the dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type subfamily. Transient expression in cultured skeletal muscle myotubes derived from muscular dysgenic mice demonstrates that the BIII channel mediates an omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium current with kinetics and voltage dependence like those previously reported for whole-cell N-type current. Cell-attached patch recordings, with isotonic barium as the charge carrier, revealed distinct single channels with an average slope conductance of 14.3 pS."
https://openalex.org/W1572746674,"We recently characterized the association of the 44-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase, also known as extracellular-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), with the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90rsk), one of its putative substrates in intact PC12 cells. Using antibodies to ERK1 that precipitate a functional ERK1.pp90rsk phosphoprotein complex, we demonstrate here the regulation of both kinases by various stimuli. In mouse fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors, insulin and vanadate swiftly stimulated ERK1 activity within 5 min. While the hormonal effect was short-lived, vanadate led to a first peak followed by a progressively increasing second phase. In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor, which is a growth promoting factor, provokes a rapid but evanescent activation of ERK1. In contrast, nerve growth factor (NGF), which acts as a neuronal differentiation factor for PC12 cells, induced a swift monophasic response followed by a sustained second phase. This strikingly different pattern of ERK1 stimulation by NGF and epidermal growth factor was associated to a contrasting effect on ERK1 cellular translocation. Thus, NGF induced a nuclear translocation of ERK1, while epidermal growth factor was without noticeable effect on ERK1 localization. In both cell systems all effectors tested stimulated ERK1 phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in an 1:1 ratio. During ERK1 inactivation, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were dephosphorylated in a similar fashion. Concurrent with ERK1 activation was the de novo appearance of phosphothreonine and an increase in phosphoserine on pp90rsk. The pp90rsk phosphothreonine content paralleled the ERK1 activity more closely than the phosphoserine level. These results provide compelling evidence that in fibroblasts and PC12 cells ERK1 plays a direct role in the phosphorylation of pp90rsk and that pp90rsk represents a physiologically relevant substrate of extracellular-regulated kinases. Finally, we would like to suggest that the differentiating action of NGF in PC12 cells might be due, at least in part, to the conjunction of its sustained and robust stimulation of ERK1 and pp90rsk, and of its induction of ERK1 nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1525062280,"It has previously been shown that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enhances the binding of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to HepG2 cells and fibroblasts, up to 80-fold. This increase in binding is LDL receptor-independent and is due to a bridging of LPL between extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and the lipoproteins. In the present paper, we show that preincubation of the cells with LPL, followed by washing prior to the binding experiment, increased binding to the same extent as occurs when the binding is performed in the presence of LPL. This indicates that the formation of a complex of LPL with the lipoproteins is not a prerequisite of binding. Binding curves and Scatchard analyses reveal that both the number of binding sites and the affinity of the binding are increased 20-30-fold by the addition of 3.4 μg/ml LPL. The addition of LPL also resulted in an enhanced uptake and subsequent lysosomal degradation of both LDL and VLDL when compared with binding, although to a lesser extent (up to 25-fold when measured after 5 h at 37 °C). Strikingly, enhanced uptake did not occur in LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts. In addition, down- regulation of the LDL receptor activity by preincubation of the cells for 48 h with either LDL or β-VLDL resulted in a parallel decrease in the uptake of LPL-mediated HSPG-bound LDL, whereas the LPL-mediated binding itself was not diminished. These observations indicate that the uptake of LPL-mediated HSPG- bound LDL and VLDL mainly proceeds via the LDL receptor. Binding of labeled LDL to the cells at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a chase period at 37 °C revealed that in absolute terms, the initial rate of internalization of HSPG- bound LDL is comparable with that of LDL receptor-bound LDL (0.58 and 0.44 ng/min/mg of cell protein, respectively). We conclude that in LDL receptor- positive cells, the LPL-mediated binding of LDL and VLDL to HSPG is followed by internalization of the lipoproteins mainly through the rapid process of the classical LDL receptor recycling system, whereas only a minor portion is internalized via the much slower process of HSPG uptake.

https://openalex.org/W1499987944,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) induces mitogenesis and cell dissociation upon binding to the protein-tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the MET proto-oncogene (p190MET). The signal transduction pathways downstream from the receptor activation are largely unknown. We show that HGF/SF activates Ras protein. HGF/SF stimulation of metabolically labeled A549 cells raised the amount of Ras-bound radiolabeled guanine nucleotides by over 5-fold. Furthermore, following HGF/SF stimulation of these cells, 50% of Ras was in the GTP-bound active state. The uptake by Ras of radiolabeled GTP was also increased by 5-fold following HGF/SF stimulation in digitonin-permeabilized A549 cells. Moreover, HGF/SF treatment of A549 cells leads to stimulation of the cytosolic Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange activity, measured as accelerated release of [3H]GDP from purified recombinant Ras protein in vitro, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Likewise, treatment with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor 3-(1',4'-dihydroxytetralyl)methylene-2-oxindole of GTL-16 cells (featuring a p190MET receptor constitutively active) significantly decreased the cytosolic Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange activity. These data demonstrate that HGF/SF activates Ras protein by shifting the equilibrium toward the GTP-bound state and increases the uptake of guanine nucleotides by Ras, through mechanism(s) including the activation of a Ras-guanine nucleotide exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1966547075,"Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), one of several inheritable myotonic diseases, results from genetic defects in the human skeletal muscle Na+ channel. In some pedigrees, HYPP is correlated with a single base pair substitution resulting in a Met replacing Thr704 in the fifth transmembrane segment of the second domain. This region is totally conserved between the human and rat channels. We have introduced the human mutation into the corresponding region of the rat muscle Na+ channel cDNA and expressed it in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Patch-clamp recordings show that this mutation shifts the voltage dependence of activation by 10–15 mV in the negative direction. The shift results in a persistent Na+ current that activates near −70 mV; this phenomenon could underlie the abnormal muscle activity observed in patients with HYPP."
https://openalex.org/W1551318353,"When steroid hormone antagonists have inappropriate agonist effects, the clinical consequences are grave. Progesterone antagonists bind to two naturally occurring isoforms of human progesterone receptors (hPR), hPRB and the NH2-terminally truncated hPRA, and usually inhibit agonist-stimulated transcription. It is shown here that elevation of cAMP levels in a human breast cancer cell line leads to the functional reversal of progesterone antagonist action. While hPR occupied by the antagonists RU486 and ZK112993 are transcriptionally inactive, the antagonist-occupied receptors become strong activators of transcription in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. However, this functional switch does not occur with the progesterone antagonist ZK98299, which, unlike RU486 and ZK112993, is unable to induce hPR binding to DNA. This suggests that the 8-Br-cAMP-induced transcriptional reversal requires that the antagonist-occupied receptors be bound to DNA. Even with agonist-occupied hPR, addition of 8-Br-cAMP results in a synergistic increase in transcriptional activity. When hPRA alone are transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, transcription of a reporter gene is stimulated by the agonist R5020 and by 8-Br-cAMP and is synergistic when both are present; but the 8-Br-cAMP-dependent component of transcription proceeds in the absence of hPRA, in the absence of the progesterone response element, and in the presence of a DNA-binding domain mutant of hPRA that cannot bind to the progesterone response element. Additionally, under the intracellular conditions in which 8-Br-cAMP activates antagonist-hPR complexes, there is no protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the receptors. We discuss a model in which a gene that is independently transcribed by cAMP-responsive factors and by hPR can be selected for positive or negative regulation on the transcription complex due to additive or cooperative interactions between the two DNA-bound factors."
https://openalex.org/W1492933791,"We recently identified two isoforms of mouse prostaglandin (PG) E receptor EP3 subtype, EP3 alpha and EP 3 beta, which are produced by alternative splicing and different only in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Sugimoto, Y., Negishi, M., Hayashi, Y., Namba, Y., T., Honda, A., Watabe, A., Hirata, M., Narumiya, S., and Ichikawa, A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2712-2718). We examined here agonist-induced desensitization of the two isoforms using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing these isoforms. Exposure of the EP3 alpha isoform to PGE2 for 30 min did not change maximal response but increased PGE2 concentration needed to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in the cells. Further exposure of this isoform to PGE2 suppressed the maximal response as well as sensitivity to PGE2 in a time-dependent manner; after 24-h exposure, it elicited only 50% of the maximal response of the control cells. Consistent with these results, short term exposure sequestered the EP3 alpha isoform away from the cell surface and long term incubation decreased the total receptor number in the cells. In contrast, exposure of the EP3 beta isoform to PGE2 did not affect its dose-response curve for PGE2, and no sequestration or decrease in the receptor number was observed in this isoform. Thus, alternative splicing produced the two isoforms with different carboxyl-terminal domains, which are different in sensitivity to agonist-induced desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1976747478,"The specific routing of retinal ganglion cell axons at the mammalian optic chiasm into the ipsilateral or contralateral optic tracts results from axon pathfinding. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that encounters between axons from opposite eyes at the chiasm induce axon turning, but do not always aim retinal axons into the optic tracts. Following removal of one eye before retinal axons have invaded the chiasm, axons from the remaining eye are still routed into the correct optic tracts. Ipsilaterally projecting axons make turning decisions without pausing over 10–20 min, whereas contralaterally projecting axons occasionally pause before crossing the midline. Thus, initial pathfinding at the chiasm does not depend on binocular axon interactions, but on local cues that trigger differential growth cone responses."

https://openalex.org/W1606746692,"A multiprotein complex, referred to as the mu particle, was purified to apparent homogeneity from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. This multiprotein complex has no protease activity, but it can be incorporated into an even larger multiprotein complex which exhibits strong and selective protease activity, i.e. it degrades only ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Incorporation of the mu particle into the ubiquitin conjugate-degrading larger complex is absolutely ATP-dependent. On these criteria the larger complex corresponds to the 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex partially purified and characterized from reticulocytes. A procedure is described for the purification of the Drosophila 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex. It was found to be a stoichiometric complex of the mu particle and the 20 S proteosome. Although no other polypeptide was present in stoichiometric amount in the 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex besides the mu particle and the 20 S proteosome, an additional protein factor(s) is required for its assembly, the ubiquitin conjugate-degrading activity cannot be reconstituted from the purified mu particle and the 20 S proteosome. Synthesis of the mu particle is developmentally regulated; its concentration is highest in embryos. This is probably connected with massive degradation of yolk proteins during embryogenesis. In chicken, rabbit and human cells a high molecular weight multiprotein complex can be detected, which is immunologically related to the Drosophila mu particle."

https://openalex.org/W2088378593,Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa channels) have to be colocalized with Ca2+ channels to be involved in nerve cell firing regulation. KCa channels were detected in cell-attached patches performed in voltage-clamped Helix neurons. This technique allowed Ca2+ entry to occur either within or around the patch. We observed that the submembrane Ca2+ diffusion was sufficiently limited to prevent the KCa channels from being opened by remote Ca2+ entry. The KCa channels located in areas devoid of Ca2+ channels remained quiescent during cell firing. These crypto channels were detected following either patch excision or intracellular Ca2+ injection. These data provide direct evidence for the existence of functional Ca2+ domains in a nonspecialized neural membrane.
https://openalex.org/W1489414711,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are members of a 40-45-kDa family of serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate several substrates including microtubule-associated protein-2, S6 kinase, and myelin basic protein. Activity of MAP kinases is regulated by growth factors that stimulate the phosphorylation of threonine 188 and tyrosine 190 in the kinase. In this paper direct evidence is presented for tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of MAP kinase in concert with elevated activity in response to vasopressin in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells. Activation of MAP kinase is correlated with activation of S6 kinase activity related to S6 kinase II. Data support the concept that the activation of MAP kinase by vasopressin is mediated by pertussis toxin-independent biochemical pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1533465487,"Myf-5 and MyoD are members of a family of muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that are fundamental for myogenic cell differentiation and transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes. Here we report that elevated levels of the intracellular signaling molecule cAMP and overexpression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibit myogenic differentiation. PKA represses the transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes by the myogenic regulators Myf-5 and MyoD. The repression is directed at the basic HLH domain and is mediated through the E-box DNA consensus motif to which these proteins bind. However, phosphorylation of Myf-5 and MyoD by PKA in vitro does not affect their ability to bind to DNA. PKA specifically inhibits the activity of myogenic bHLH proteins, but not of other HLH proteins, such as the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products E12 and E47 (E2-5). Our results demonstrate that PKA mediates the cAMP-induced inhibition of muscle cell differentiation by repressing the activity of Myf-5 and MyoD. The inhibition by PKA occurs post-translationally and presumably affects the transactivation process at a step following DNA-binding. The regulation of Myf-5 and MyoD function by a cAMP-dependent pathway may partly explain how external signals generated by serum and certain peptide growth factors can be transduced to the nucleus and inhibit dominant-acting factors that are responsible for myoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1501475405,"A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase V) from rat cerebrum was purified. This kinase phosphorylates the synthetic peptide substrate syntide-2. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 41 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient were 31.8 A and 2.83 S, respectively. An approximate molecular mass of 37 kDa was calculated for the native enzyme, and a monomeric structure of the enzyme was suggested. Expression of the enzymatic activity required the presence of both Ca2+ and calmodulin (apparent Ka = 24 +/- 7 nM). The CaM kinase V had an apparent Km for ATP of 75 +/- 11 microM and for syntide-2 of 20 +/- 4 microM. CaM kinase V undergoes autophosphorylation in response to Ca2+ and calmodulin. CaM kinase V was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the partial amino acid sequence was determined. A computer homology search revealed no identical protein. KN-62, a selective inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, inhibited CaM kinase V, with a Ki of 0.8 microM. CaM kinase V phosphorylates a number of endogenous proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2033209566,"Changes in cAMP levels are often associated with the modulation of neuronal function. The CREM gene encodes both antagonists and activators of the cAMP-dependent transcriptional response by alternative splicing. CREM transcripts in rat brain show a characteristic pattern of expression, being specific for the inner layer of the cerebral cortex, anterior thalamus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Strikingly, the CREM transcripts correspond to the antagonist isoforms in these areas, suggesting a down-regulatory role for CREM in brain; in contrast, the expression of CREMτ and CREB activators is more diffuse and generalized. In the supraoptic nucleus, CREM expression is induced after osmotic stimulus. Importantly, this demonstrates physiological inducibility of CREM, which is novel within the CRE/ATF family."
https://openalex.org/W1604739675,"Abstract Topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage has previously been demonstrated to require interaction of the enzyme with a DNA duplex region encompassing the cleavage site (Svejstrup, J. Q., Christiansen, K., Andersen, A. H., Lund, R., and Westergaard, O (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12529-12535). The required region, designated region A, includes positions -5 through -1 on the noncleaved strand and positions -7 through +2 on the scissile strand, relative to the cleavage site. Utilizing defined DNA substrates in topoisomerase I cleavage assays we show that efficient cleavage within region A requires additional interaction of the enzyme with duplex DNA on the side holding the 5'-OH end generated by cleavage. By analyzing the interaction of topoisomerase I with DNA substrates varying by single nucleotides on either strand outside region A, an additional duplex region, designated region B, was delimited to positions 6-11. The ability of topoisomerase I to interact separately with regions A and B was assayed on sets of DNA substrates containing a nested series of single-stranded branch sites. The obtained results demonstrate that the normal reversible cleavage/religation equilibrium established by topoisomerase I on continuous duplex DNA is replaced by irreversible cleavage on DNA substrates containing branch sites between the cleavage site and region B as these DNA substrates allow cleavage but prevent religation due to release of the incised strands. The intramolecular bipartite interaction mode of topoisomerase I during the cleavage reaction is thus indicated by both the absence of enzyme-mediated duplex stabilization and the wide tolerance for protruding strands between the cleavage site and region B. Since the irreversibly cleaved topoisomerase I-DNA complexes are kinetically competent to ligate added DNA fragments carrying free 5'-OH ends, the results suggest a role of topoisomerase I in illegitimate recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2032226112,"An electrogenic serotonin (5-HT) uptake process was characterized in the serotonergic Retzius-P cell synapse of the leech, and the simultaneous activation of this presynaptic reuptake and the postsynaptic response was monitored during evoked transmitter release. A presynaptic, Na(+)-dependent inward current upon application of 5-HT was isolated at membrane potentials between -80 and +60 mV. Its identification as a transmitter uptake current was confirmed by monitoring accumulation of the autofluorescent 5-HT analog 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine during activation of this current. To study the kinetics of 5-HT reuptake in functional synapses, transmitter release was stimulated by flash photolysis of the Ca(2+)-caging DM-nitrophen. The results demonstrate that reuptake activates with a minimal delay of less than a millisecond during synaptic transmission. It acts as a rapid transmitter removal system to determine the time course of the postsynaptic response and monitors the kinetics of transmitter clearance at the synaptic site."

In contrast to transcriptional control of gene expression of acetylcholine receptor subunits during differentiation, Ache mRNA levels increase through stabilization of the transcript. The transcriptional rate remains unchanged during Ache mRNA accumulation, whereas transcription rate increase for the receptor subunits. Inhibition of protein synthesis produces a dramatic superinduction of Ache mRNA in undifferentiated cells without affecting transcription rates, suggesting the presence of labile proteins that uniquely destabilize the mRNA. Hence, Ache mRNA in myoblasts shows rapid turnover, and upon differentiation, its level is increased by slowing the rate of mRNA degradation."

Mutant and wild-type clones were chosen expressing similar numbers of receptors and Scatchard analysis of 125I-EGF binding showed high and low affinity binding of equal affinities for both receptor types. EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins to a much lesser degree in cells expressing 5F-EGFR relative to cells expressing WT-EGFR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 5F-EGFR was 2-4% of WT-EGFR. Surprisingly, cells expressing WT-EGFR or 5F-EGFR showed little difference in dose response of EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation or EGF stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. However, EGF did not induce anchorage-independent growth of cells expressing 5F-EGFR to the same extent as it did for cells expressing WT-EGFR. EGF treatment of 5F-EGFR cells failed to elicit an increase in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity or to stimulate hydrolysis of phosphoinositides or tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1. These data suggest that a significant proportion of EGF receptor signaling can occur through receptors with altered capacity to interact with src homology 2 domain-containing proteins."

Repair synthesis with irradiated chromosomes was dependent on the dose of ultraviolet light, but naked viral DNA irradiated at the same doses showed significantly higher template activity. The reactions absolutely required the presence of cell extract, but an extract from Chinese hamster cells was as active as those from human cells. The repair activity was apparently stimulated by the addition of unirradiated plasmid DNA, which did not affect the nucleosome density of the viral chromosomes. ATP and its regenerating system were required for the reaction, but total repair synthesis was little affected by exogenous addition of substrates for RNA synthesis and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Most of the repaired viral chromosomal DNA was in the supercoiled, closed circular form, suggesting that excision repair reactions proceeded to the stage of ligation in the present cell-free system."

Fusion was monitored by the redistribution of lipid and cytoplasmic dyes between fluorescently labeled erythrocytes and HA-expressing CV-1 cells using spectrofluorometry and fluorescence microscopy. The kinetics of lipid redistribution after lowering the pH showed the same pattern for wild type HA and nonlethal mutants, although there were shifts in the pH threshold. The time for commitment to the fusogenic state and the temperature dependence of the processes leading to HA-mediated fusion were also the same for wild type and nonlethal mutants. However, striking differences were observed between wild type HA and the nonlethal mutants in their ability to induce pH-dependent redistribution from erythrocytes to HA-expressing cells of large molecular weight (M(r) > 10,000) fluorescently labeled dextran molecules. The data indicate that the kinetic processes which are measurable in the time range of seconds are insensitive to the structure of the fusion peptide. Surprisingly, however, the fusion peptide plays an important role in later processes related to pore widening which eventually results in delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2101370799,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family member that acts specifically on cells of epithelial origin. Its receptor (KGFR) is a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase, which also binds acidic FGF (aFGF) with equally high affinity, and basic FGF (bFGF) with much lower affinity. The KGFR is encoded by the bek/FGFR-2 gene, whose alternative transcript specifies a receptor with high affinity for aFGF and bFGF, but no detectable binding of KGF. The only structural difference between these two receptors is a 49-amino acid segment in the extracellular domain that is determined by single alternative exons. We report that a synthetic peptide (NH2-His199...Tyr223-COOH) corresponding to part of the predicted sequence of the KGFR alternative exon blocks KGF mitogenic activity and the interaction between KGF and its receptor. The peptide also blocks the interaction between KGF and a neutralizing monoclonal antibody raised against this growth factor. These results demonstrate that the peptide binds directly and specifically to KGF and argue that this region of the receptor constitutes part or all of the KGF binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1577183161,"cDNA clones of the gamma subunit of the skeletal muscle 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel were isolated from a human fetal skeletal muscle cDNA library using the rabbit gamma cDNA as a probe. The DNA sequence of the entire human cDNA was determined. Cosmids that contained the human gamma gene were isolated and used to determine the genomic organization of the coding sequences. Four exons were identified, spanning 12.5 kilobases of DNA. Reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the gamma transcript in human and mouse skeletal muscle RNAs, but not in RNA from human brain or cardiac muscle or from mouse brain, cardiac muscle, spleen, kidney, liver, or stomach. A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat within the gamma gene was identified. This repeat was used to type a subset of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families. Linkage analysis indicates that the gamma gene is tightly linked (Z = 12.94, theta = 0.001) to growth hormone at chromosome 17q23, a region that also contains the adult skeletal muscle Na+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1480176123,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is biosynthesized by the sequential addition of carbohydrates to phosphatidylinositol (PI). In the first two reactions, GlcNAc is transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to PI and then deacetylated to form GlcNAc-PI and GlcN-PI, respectively. In this paper, stimulation of GlcNAc-PI deacetylation by GTP, is reported. Addition of this nucleotide triphosphate to incubations in which GPI precursors were synthesized from UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc by microsomes prepared from the lymphoma cell line EL4 resulted in a shift in the relative amount of each intermediate formed such that [6-3H]GlcN-PI was the predominant product. GTP also increased the total synthesis of the first GPI intermediate, GlcNAc-PI, by inhibiting reactions that metabolize UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc into non-GPI-related products. However, unlike the stimulation of GlcNAc-PI deacetylation, ATP was equally effective in increasing the formation of GlcNAc-PI. An additional product, tentatively identified as [6-3H]GlcN-PI(acyl-inositol), was also detected when GTP was present in the incubation. The synthesis of this GPI precursor, which is proposed to be the third intermediate in GPI biosynthesis in mammals, was increased by GTP because the level of GlcN-PI, the substrate for acylation, was elevated. To isolate the effects of GTP on the GlcNAc-PI deacetylation, this reaction was studied directly by using [6-3H]GlcNAc-PI as the substrate. The stimulation was found to be specific for the guanosine-containing nucleotide triphosphate and optimal with approximately 1 mM GTP. Both the reaction rate at early time points and the total amount of deacetylated product formed in 60 min were increased by GTP. The effect on the second reaction of the pathway does not appear to be coupled to the first reaction because GlcNAc-PI deacetylation was increased by GTP in microsomes from cells defective in the GlcNAc-PI synthesis. Finally, 0.5 mM GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) completely inhibited the stimulation of GlcNAc-PI deacetylation caused by 1 mM GTP, indicating that hydrolysis of the nucleotide triphosphate was required for this effect. Although the mechanism and role of the GTP stimulation of GlcNAc-PI deacetylation is not clear, this regulation could influence the biosynthesis of mature GPI precursors and the subsequent expression of GPI-anchored proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1535875407,"Binding protein-dependent transport systems mediate the accumulation of several ions, sugars, amino acids, and peptides in Gram-negative bacteria by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis and belong to a superfamily of membrane proteins which extends to eukaryotic cells and includes the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The binding protein-dependent galactose transport system of Salmonella typhimurium comprises four proteins which have been characterized previously by molecular cloning experiments (51,000-dalton MglA protein, with a stable proteolytic product of 38,000 daltons, 33,000-dalton MglB protein, 29,000-dalton MglC protein, 21,000-dalton MglE protein). By using a MglA hyperproducing strain, we have purified a galactose-stimulated ATPase which shows a single band in polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions and shows three bands at 51,000, 38,000, and 15,000 daltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (our results suggest that the bands at 38,000 and 15,000 daltons represent proteolytic products of the 51,000-dalton protein). The ATPase activity coincides with the purified protein during the two last chromatographic steps of the purification procedure, and it cannot be isolated from a strain which does not contain the mglA gene. The MglA ATPase is stimulated 3-fold by galactose and hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi (Km ATP = 60 microM, Ka galactose = 0.3 mM, Vmax = 140 nmol/min/mg of protein). The gamma-phosphate of ATP is transferred neither to galactose nor to the protein itself. Vanadate, N-ethylmaleimide and 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, a specific inhibitor of binding protein-dependent transport systems, inhibit the MglA ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1563079087,"Evidence for activation of pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins by membrane depolarization in rat brainstem synaptoneurosomes was recently reported (Cohen-Armon, M., and Sokolovsky, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2595-2605; (1991) Neurosci. Lett. 126, 87-90) and is further supported in this study by the observation that the depolarization-induced effect is inhibited when G-proteins are stabilized in the non-activated state with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), which was introduced into synaptoneurosomes during the process of permeabilization and resealing. In the present study, agents that either keep the voltage-dependent Na+ channel in persistently activated state (while Na+ currents are blocked) or prevent it from activation were used in an attempt to determine whether the voltage-dependent Na+ channels are involved in the depolarization-induced activation of pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins. The main probe employed was the cardiotonic and antiarrhythmic agent DPI, which is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, one of which (the R enantiomer) reportedly prevents depolarization-induced activation of the Na+ channel while the other (the S enantiomer) inhibits Na+ channel inactivation. The results suggest that while inactivation of the voltage-dependent Na+ channel does not interfere with the putative depolarization-induced activation of G-proteins, membrane depolarization affects G-proteins and the coupled muscarinic receptors only if the voltage-dependent Na+ channels are capable of being activated. Thus, inhibition of the depolarization-induced activation of Na+ channels was accompanied by inhibition of the depolarization-induced activation of pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins and by modifications of both the coupling of G-proteins to muscarinic receptors and the ADP-ribosylation of Go-proteins. These effects could be counteracted by persistent activation of the voltage-dependent Na+ channels (while Na+ current was blocked). Our observations may suggest that the voltage-dependent Na+ channel gating is involved in the depolarization-induced activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and may provide evidence for a possible mechanism of membrane depolarization signal transduction in excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562921574,"We have constructed a cell-free DNA repair system with UV-irradiated SV40 minichromosomes, as described in the accompanying paper (Sugasawa, K, Masutani, C., and Hanaoka, F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem 268, 9098-9104). In this study, we examined DNA repair synthesis by cell extracts from seven xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation groups, A through G. DNA repair synthesis by XP cell extracts was lower than that with repair-proficient human 293 cell extract and did not increase to the level with the latter on increase in the amount of cell extract or the incubation time. The defects of XP cell extracts were complemented by addition of extracts from cells of different complementation groups, indicating that defective proteins in XP-A through G cells are directly involved in DNA repair. Addition of T4 endonuclease V, which is reported to complement defects of XP cells, stimulated DNA repair synthesis by the 293 cell extract, and also complemented the defects of all XP cell extracts. The XPAC gene product was shown to be involved in DNA repair synthesis using anti-xpac serum and xpac protein produced in Escherichia coli. Anti-xpac serum inhibited DNA repair synthesis by the 293 cell extract and xpac protein reversed the inhibition. Furthermore, xpac protein complemented the defects of extracts of two lines of XP-A cells (XP2OSSV and XP12ROSV) but had no effect on the reactions of extracts from cells of other complementation groups. These findings are consistent with previous results obtained in experiments with cells, indicating that our system is useful for analyzing the mechanisms of DNA excision repair in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094407794,"Mutations in the cut gene transform sense organs in Drosophila embryos from external sensory (es) receptors to chordotonal (ch) organs. We have investigated whether their central axonal projections are also transformed. Following Lucifer yellow injection of the sensory neuron, wild-type es and ch organs show characteristic, different projection patterns in the CNS. Transformed es neurons in cut embryos are variable in their projection patterns: some resemble wild-type es neurons, others ch neurons, while yet others are unlike either of these. We conclude that the cut gene influences axonal projections, although its action as a simple modality switch is open to question. Additional genes could be involved in the specification of the central axonal projection of the transformed neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1576040430,"In several Leishmania species, glycosylated inositol phospholipids exist as free lipids, as membrane protein anchors, and as the membrane-binding moieties of the lipophosphoglycans. Both the glycolipid-anchored cell surface metalloproteinase, gp63, and the lipophosphoglycans have been proposed to be involved in cell invasion. Moreover, the lipophosphoglycans have been implicated in the survival of Leishmania in the parasitophorous vacuole of the host macrophage. In this report we show that mannosamine effectively inhibits the biosynthesis of both free glycosylated inositol phospholipids and the lipophosphoglycans of Leishmania mexicana. [3H]Mannosamine is incorporated into glycosylated inositol phospholipids, but not significantly into lipophosphoglycans when added as a radiochemical tracer at a subinhibitory concentration. The reversible inhibitory effect of mannosamine may be useful for studying precursor/product relationships during the biosynthesis of free glycosylated inositol phospholipids, glycolipid anchors, and the lipophosphoglycans. The implications of these data for the mode of action of mannosamine are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1524283982,"Human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (Glc-6-P) cDNA spanning the entire coding region was subcloned into a pSG5 vector that contains an early SV40 promoter, intron II of the rabbit beta-globin gene, and a polyadenylation signal. This expression cassette was then placed downstream of the human beta-globin locus control region and injected into fertilized mouse eggs. Among five transgenic founders that contained intact copies of the construct, one founder expressed human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase enzyme in a high-level and erythroid-specific fashion (5 x higher than endogenous Glc-6-P dehydrogenase activity). When this male founder mated with a normal individual, all the offspring that carried the transgene showed high-level expression of Glc-6-P dehydrogenase activity in erythroid cells. The endogenous mouse Glc-6-P dehydrogenase in all high-expression mice could be competed out by forming a hybrid with human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase. Our results indicate that the locus control region can drive the human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase gene to be specifically expressed in the erythroid cells of transgenic mice. The results described here provide a basis for experiments designed to express human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase in transgenic mice and suggest a suitable approach to producing a mouse model for studying human Glc-6-P dehydrogenase deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1581821813,"Abstract We report here further characterization of the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast mutant D1-9b displaying elevated agonist-induced phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover responses relative to CCL39, the parental cell line (Rath, H. M., Doyle, G. A. R., and Silbert, D. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13387-13390). These differences in PI turnover responses are further enhanced by long term (24 h) pretreatment of cells with the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA). Short term pretreatment (15 min) with PMA attenuates the agonist-induced PI turnover response of both wild type and mutant D1-9b cell lines to that of unstimulated controls, suggesting that PMA-induced desensitization responses in D1-9b are intact. Both cytosolic and membrane/particulate fractions prepared from mutant D1-9b have decreased phospholipase C (PLC) activities relative to wild type when assayed with either of four different PI/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-mixed micelle/vesicle substrate combinations. Thermolability studies, Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography, and Western blot studies identified the source of cytosolic PLC deficiency in D1-9b as being due to the absence of PLC delta 1, one of at least two PLC isozymes previously shown to be in wild type CCL39 cytosol (Rath, H. M., Fee, J. A., Rhee, S. G., and Silbert, D. F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3080-3087). We also report here the presence of two peaks of PLC activities (i.e. peaks mA and mB) following Mono Q chromatography of wild type CCL39 membrane/particulate extracts; membrane/particulate extracts prepared from mutant D1-9b are missing the first of these two peaks of activities (peak mA). Immunoblot analysis confirms the presence of PLC beta 1, but not PLC gamma 1 or PLC delta 1, in peak mB. Comparisons are made between D1-9b and the previously characterized mutant D1-6b, which displays diminished agonist-induced PI turnover responses yet in vitro biochemical deficiencies similar to those of mutant D1-9b. Somatic cell hybridization experiments suggest that the defects found in mutant D1-9b are codominant relative to wild type phenotype and that mutant D1-9b belongs to the same genetic complementation group as mutant D1-6b. Possible explanations to explain these different agonist-induced responses in light of the two mutants similar in vitro biochemical deficiencies are addressed."
