https://openalex.org/W2079360726,"Geographic variation in the number of coexisting plant and animal species (species density) often follows repeated patterns; best known is the general increase in species richness from temperate to tropical latitudes. Here we undertake a quantitative analysis of geographic trends in species density for the terrestrial vertebrate faunas of the United States and Australia. Trends in numbers of species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are described and are correlated with geographic variation in abiotic environmental measures. Intercontinental comparisons reveal general patterns as well as intriguing and profound differences in vertebrate distributions."

https://openalex.org/W1976485227,"A new type of lake and shore assemblage has been found in the Late Triassic age rocks of North Carolina and Virginia (Dan River group). It includes abundant aquatic reptiles, fishes, at least seven orders of insects, crustaceans, and a diverse flora. Cyclic changes in the fauna and flora correlate with sedimentary cycles, which together reflect the repetitive development and extinction of large meromictic lakes."

The estimated values for ΔCa from these equations, which agree with the values obtained from direct measurements, have been used to estimate the ratio of the in situ inorganic to organic carbon fluxes in the oceans. The precise vertical distribution of this ratio is shown for the first time."

https://openalex.org/W2005229671,Lichens are believed to be extremely resistant to high-temperature stress when desiccated. Results from a reexamination of this concept indicate that some air-dry lichen thalli can be extremely sensitive to even moderate levels of heat stress whereas others exhibit a considerable degree of heat resistance. These differential levels of thermal resistance correlate exactly with the ecology of these populations.

It is separated from secretin by precipitation with aniline, and stimulates equally the formation of the three chief pancreatic enzymes; it is inactivated by incubation with serum, probably on an enzyme basis."
https://openalex.org/W2051331221,"Nearly 200 nearby stars similar to the sun were observed at the 21-centimeter neutral hydrogen wavelength (in the heliocentric frame) with a bandwidth of 1 kilohertz and a resolution of 0.015 hertz, using the Arecibo 305-meter antenna. At this resolution the effects of terrestrial interference are so slight that the detection limit of 4 x 10(-27) watt per square meter was set by receiver noise alone. No evidence of artificial signals was found."

https://openalex.org/W2014624352,"The energy source in these galaxies will be shown to be a black hole, I think, even though it may take 100 years before we have proven it.-MARTIN REES, at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, England I think it will take 1000 years and we may very well be on the wrong track. These [black hole] models are getting into the textbooks now, but there is never anything testable and people are working on smaller and smaller pieces of the problem.- GEOFFREY BURBIDGE, at the Univeristy of California, San Diego, and soon to assume the post of head of the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona REES: I agree, but I would argue that the way we are going about it is the most productive approach, even though the modelers may be getting the illusory satisfaction of a Ptolomean theorist who adds another epicycle. BURBRIDGE: I'm glad to hear you say that, Martin. The trouble is that so many people take these things more seriously than you do."
