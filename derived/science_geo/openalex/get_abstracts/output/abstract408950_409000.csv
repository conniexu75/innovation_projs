https://openalex.org/W2013265123,"Plants and animals are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen for mitochondrial respiration and energy production. In plants, an unanticipated decline in oxygen availability (hypoxia), as caused by roots becoming waterlogged or foliage submergence, triggers changes in gene transcription and messenger RNA translation that promote anaerobic metabolism and thus sustain substrate-level ATP production. In contrast to animals, oxygen sensing has not been ascribed to a mechanism of gene regulation in response to oxygen deprivation in plants. Here we show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis acts as a homeostatic sensor of severe low oxygen levels in Arabidopsis, through its regulation of key hypoxia-response transcription factors. We found that plants lacking components of the N-end rule pathway constitutively express core hypoxia-response genes and are more tolerant of hypoxic stress. We identify the hypoxia-associated ethylene response factor group VII transcription factors of Arabidopsis as substrates of this pathway. Regulation of these proteins by the N-end rule pathway occurs through a characteristic conserved motif at the amino terminus initiating with Met-Cys. Enhanced stability of one of these proteins, HRE2, under low oxygen conditions improves hypoxia survival and reveals a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing in plants via the evolutionarily conserved N-end rule pathway. SUB1A-1, a major determinant of submergence tolerance in rice, was shown not to be a substrate for the N-end rule pathway despite containing the N-terminal motif, indicating that it is uncoupled from N-end rule pathway regulation, and that enhanced stability may relate to the superior tolerance of Sub1 rice varieties to multiple abiotic stresses."

Reinhard Jahn and colleagues use super-resolution stimulated-emission depletion (STED) microscopy to show that syntaxin clusters in the membrane through electrostatic interactions with the strongly anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 70-nanometre microdomains. The results demonstrate that electrostatic protein–lipid interactions can result in the formation of microdomains independent of cholesterol or lipid phases and have important implications for the organization of the plasma membrane. Neuronal exocytosis is catalysed by the SNAP receptor protein syntaxin-1A1, which is clustered in the plasma membrane at sites where synaptic vesicles undergo exocytosis2,3. However, how syntaxin-1A is sequestered is unknown. Here we show that syntaxin clustering is mediated by electrostatic interactions with the strongly anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Using super-resolution stimulated-emission depletion microscopy on the plasma membranes of PC12 cells, we found that PIP2 is the dominant inner-leaflet lipid in microdomains about 73 nanometres in size. This high accumulation of PIP2 was required for syntaxin-1A sequestering, as destruction of PIP2 by the phosphatase synaptojanin-1 reduced syntaxin-1A clustering. Furthermore, co-reconstitution of PIP2 and the carboxy-terminal part of syntaxin-1A in artificial giant unilamellar vesicles resulted in segregation of PIP2 and syntaxin-1A into distinct domains even when cholesterol was absent. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic protein–lipid interactions can result in the formation of microdomains independently of cholesterol or lipid phases."
https://openalex.org/W2034862301,"Cardiomyocytes generated from human pluripotent stem cells have many potential applications in drug screening, disease modeling and cell therapy. Dubois et al. describe a cell-surface marker that allows the isolation of highly enriched populations of cardiomyocytes from differentiation cultures. To identify cell-surface markers specific to human cardiomyocytes, we screened cardiovascular cell populations derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) against a panel of 370 known CD antibodies. This screen identified the signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) as a marker expressed specifically on cardiomyocytes derived from hESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and PECAM, THY1, PDGFRB and ITGA1 as markers of the nonmyocyte population. Cell sorting with an antibody against SIRPA allowed for the enrichment of cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes from hESC/hiPSC differentiationcultures, yielding populations of up to 98% cardiac troponin T-positive cells. When plated in culture, SIRPA-positive cells were contracting and could be maintained over extended periods of time. These findings provide a simple method for isolating populations of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cell cultures, and thereby establish a readily adaptable technology for generating large numbers of enriched cardiomyocytes for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2100388369,"Selective autophagy involves the recognition and targeting of specific cargo, such as damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, or invading pathogens for lysosomal destruction1,2,3,4. Yeast genetic screens have identified proteins required for different forms of selective autophagy, including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting, pexophagy and mitophagy, and mammalian genetic screens have identified proteins required for autophagy regulation5. However, there have been no systematic approaches to identify molecular determinants of selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Here, to identify mammalian genes required for selective autophagy, we performed a high-content, image-based, genome-wide small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes. We identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which were enriched for cellular pathways related to messenger RNA processing, interferon signalling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2-domain containing protein, SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain and liver. Thus, our study identifies candidate determinants of selective autophagy, and defines SMURF1 as a newly recognized mediator of both viral autophagy and mitophagy."

https://openalex.org/W2085252210,"Somatic reprogramming induced by defined transcription factors is a low-efficiency process that is enhanced by p53 deficiency. So far, p21 is the only p53 target shown to contribute to p53 repression of iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell) generation, indicating that additional p53 targets may regulate this process. Here, we demonstrate that miR-34 microRNAs (miRNAs), particularly miR-34a, exhibit p53-dependent induction during reprogramming. Mir34a deficiency in mice significantly increased reprogramming efficiency and kinetics, with miR-34a and p21 cooperatively regulating somatic reprogramming downstream of p53. Unlike p53 deficiency, which enhances reprogramming at the expense of iPSC pluripotency, genetic ablation of Mir34a promoted iPSC generation without compromising self-renewal or differentiation. Suppression of reprogramming by miR-34a was due, at least in part, to repression of pluripotency genes, including Nanog, Sox2 and Mycn (also known as N-Myc). This post-transcriptional gene repression by miR-34a also regulated iPSC differentiation kinetics. miR-34b and c similarly repressed reprogramming; and all three miR-34 miRNAs acted cooperatively in this process. Taken together, our findings identified miR-34 miRNAs as p53 targets that play an essential role in restraining somatic reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W1975440573,"Members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, a large group of polymorphic receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, recognize particular peptide-laden human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) class I molecules and have a pivotal role in innate immune responses. Allelic variation and extensive polymorphism within the three-domain KIR family (KIR3D, domains D0-D1-D2) affects pHLA binding specificity and is linked to the control of viral replication and the treatment outcome of certain haematological malignancies. Here we describe the structure of a human KIR3DL1 receptor bound to HLA-B*5701 complexed with a self-peptide. KIR3DL1 clamped around the carboxy-terminal end of the HLA-B*5701 antigen-binding cleft, resulting in two discontinuous footprints on the pHLA. First, the D0 domain, a distinguishing feature of the KIR3D family, extended towards β2-microglobulin and abutted a region of the HLA molecule with limited polymorphism, thereby acting as an 'innate HLA sensor' domain. Second, whereas the D2-HLA-B*5701 interface exhibited a high degree of complementarity, the D1-pHLA-B*5701 contacts were suboptimal and accommodated a degree of sequence variation both within the peptide and the polymorphic region of the HLA molecule. Although the two-domain KIR (KIR2D) and KIR3DL1 docked similarly onto HLA-C and HLA-B respectively, the corresponding D1-mediated interactions differed markedly, thereby providing insight into the specificity of KIR3DL1 for discrete HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes. Collectively, in association with extensive mutagenesis studies at the KIR3DL1-pHLA-B*5701 interface, we provide a framework for understanding the intricate interplay between peptide variability, KIR3D and HLA polymorphism in determining the specificity requirements of this essential innate interaction that is conserved across primate species."
https://openalex.org/W1967307497,"Homologous recombination is a high-fidelity DNA repair pathway. Besides a critical role in accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, recombination functions in DNA repair and in the recovery of stalled or broken replication forks to ensure genomic stability. In contrast, inappropriate recombination contributes to genomic instability, leading to loss of heterozygosity, chromosome rearrangements and cell death. The RecA/UvsX/RadA/Rad51 family of proteins catalyses the signature reactions of recombination, homology search and DNA strand invasion. Eukaryotes also possess Rad51 paralogues, whose exact role in recombination remains to be defined. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 paralogues, the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, counteract the antirecombination activity of the Srs2 helicase. The Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer associates with the Rad51-single-stranded DNA filament, rendering it more stable than a nucleoprotein filament containing Rad51 alone. The Rad51-Rad55-Rad57 co-filament resists disruption by the Srs2 antirecombinase by blocking Srs2 translocation, involving a direct protein interaction between Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role of the Rad51 paralogues in stabilizing the Rad51 filament against a biologically important antagonist, the Srs2 antirecombination helicase. The biological significance of this mechanism is indicated by a complete suppression of the ionizing radiation sensitivity of rad55 or rad57 mutants by concomitant deletion of SRS2, as expected for biological antagonists. We propose that the Rad51 presynaptic filament is a meta-stable reversible intermediate, whose assembly and disassembly is governed by the balance between Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2, providing a key regulatory mechanism controlling the initiation of homologous recombination. These data provide a paradigm for the potential function of the human RAD51 paralogues, which are known to be involved in cancer predisposition and human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004196283,"Here we show that pemetrexed-treated mesothelioma cells undergo accelerated senescence. This is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory and mitogenic cytokines, reminiscent of an SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype). Conditioned media from senescent MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma) cells trigger the emergence of EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal)-like, clonogenic and chemoresistant cell subpopulations, expressing high levels of ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity (ALDH(bright) cells). We show by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of purified ALDH(bright) and ALDH(low) cells, that both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms converge to maintain the SASP-induced, EMT-like cell subpopulations. Chemoresistant ALDH(bright) cells exist within primary MPM specimens and enrichment for ALDH(bright) cells correlates with an earlier tumor onset into NOD/SCID mice. We show that RAS(v12) expression induces SASP-like changes in untransformed human mesothelial cells, and that p53 ablation increases the effect of RAS(v12) expression. We identify STAT3 activation as a crucial event downstream to SASP signaling. In fact, small hairpin RNA-mediated ablation of STAT3 deeply attenuates the induction of EMT genes and the increase of ALDH(bright) cells induced by SASP-cytokines. This strongly affects the chemoresistance of MPM cells in vitro and leads to anticancer effects in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1488728411,"The microRNA-371-373 (miR-371-373) cluster is specifically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and is thought to be involved in stem cell maintenance. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) of this cluster were shown to be frequently upregulated in several human tumors. However, the regulatory mechanism for the involvement of the miR-371-373 cluster in human ESCs or cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we explored the relationship between this miRNA cluster and the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway, which has been shown to be involved in both stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis. We show that miR-371-373 expression is induced by lithium chloride and is positively correlated with Wnt/β-catenin-signaling activity in several human cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, three TCF/LEF1-binding elements (TBEs) were identified in the promoter region and shown to be required for Wnt-dependent activation of miR-371-373. Interestingly, we also found that miR-372&373, in turn, activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In addition, four protein genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway were identified as direct targets of miR-372&373, including Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a well-known inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Using a lentiviral system, we showed that overexpression of miR-372 or miR-373 promotes cell growth and the invasive activity of tumor cells as knockdown of DKK1. Taken together, our study demonstrates a novel β-catenin/LEF1–miR-372&373–DKK1 regulatory feedback loop, which may have a critical role in regulating the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088255158,"Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) relays growth and stress signals to protein synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). 1-Benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide (NH125) is a widely accepted inhibitor of mammalian eEF2K and an efficacious anti-proliferation agent against different cancer cells. It implied that eEF2K could be an efficacious anticancer target. However, eEF2K siRNA was ineffective against cancer cells including those sensitive to NH125. To test if pharmacological intervention differs from siRNA interference, we identified a highly selective small molecule eEF2K inhibitor A-484954. Like siRNA, A-484954 had little effect on cancer cell growth. We carefully examined the effect of NH125 and A-484954 on phosphorylation of eEF2, the known cellular substrate of eEF2K. Surprisingly, NH125 increased eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas A-484954 inhibited the phosphorylation as expected for an eEF2K inhibitor. Both A-484954 and eEF2K siRNA inhibited eEF2K and reduced eEF2 phosphorylation with little effect on cancer cell growth. These data demonstrated clearly that the anticancer activity of NH125 was more correlated with induction of eEF2 phosphorylation than inhibition of eEF2K. Actually, induction of eEF2 phosphorylation was reported to correlate with inhibition of cancer cell growth. We compared several known inducers of eEF2 phosphorylation including AMPK activators and an mTOR inhibitor. Interestingly, stronger induction of eEF2 phosphorylation correlated with more effective growth inhibition. We also explored signal transduction pathways leading to NH125-induced eEF2 phosphorylation. Preliminary data suggested that NH125-induced eEF2 phosphorylation was likely mediated through multiple pathways. These observations identified an opportunity for a new multipathway approach to anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1990070704,"To identify potential microRNA (miRNA) links between Smad3, a mediator of TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β) signaling, and E-cadherin, we characterized the miRNA profiles of two gastric cancer cell lines: SNU484-LPCX, which does not express Smad3, and SNU484-Smad3, in which Smad3 is overexpressed. We found that among differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-200 family members are overexpressed in SNU484-Smad3 cells. Subsequent studies, including analysis of the effects of silencing Smad3 in SNU484-Smad3 cells and a luciferase reporter assay, revealed that Smad3 directly binds to a Smad-binding element located in the promoter region of miR-200b/a, where it functions as a transcriptional activator. TGF-β did not affect the regulatory role of Smad3 in transcription of miR-200 and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. We conclude that Smad3 regulates, at the transcriptional level, miR-200 family members, which themselves regulate ZEB1 and ZEB2, known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, at the posttranscriptional level in a TGF-β-independent manner. This represents a novel link between Smad3 and posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2099163426,"Aberrant growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a major cellular event in the pathogenesis of many proliferative vascular diseases. Recently, microRNA-31 (miR-31) has been found to play a critical role in cancer cell proliferation. However, the biological role of miR-31 in VSMC growth and the mechanisms involved are currently unknown. In the present study, the expression of rat mature miR-31 (rno-miR-31) was determined in cultured VSMCs and in rat carotid arteries. We identified that rno-miR-31 is an abundant miRNA in VSMCs, and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative VSMCs and in vascular walls with neointimal growth. The up-regulation of rno-miR-31 in proliferative VSMCs was inhibited by the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK). By both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrated that rno-miR-31 had a proproliferative effect on VSMCs. We further identified that LATS2 (large tumor suppressor homolog 2) is a downstream target gene product of rno-miR-31 that is involved in rno-miR-31-mediated effect on VSMC proliferation. The LATS2 as a target gene protein of rno-miR-31 is verified in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. The results suggest that MAPK/ERK/miR-31/LATS2 may represent a novel signaling pathway in VSMC growth. miR-31 is able to enhance VSMC proliferation via its downstream target gene product, LATS2."
https://openalex.org/W2043445883,"GPCRs are known to initiate a variety of signaling pathways, but their full reach in coordinating cellular events is unknown. Live cell imaging using label-free and fluorescence assays to monitor the effects of GPCR ligands now surprisingly connects GPCR networks to nucleotide metabolism. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit exogenous signals to the nucleus, promoting a myriad of biological responses via multiple signaling pathways in both healthy and cancerous cells. However, little is known about the response of cytosolic metabolic pathways to GPCR-mediated signaling. Here we applied fluorescent live-cell imaging and label-free dynamic mass redistribution assays to study whether purine metabolism is associated with GPCR signaling. Through a library screen of GPCR ligands in conjunction with live-cell imaging of a metabolic multienzyme complex for de novo purine biosynthesis, the purinosome, we demonstrated that the activation of endogenous Gαi-coupled receptors correlates with purinosome assembly and disassembly in native HeLa cells. Given the implications of GPCRs in mitogenic signaling and of the purinosome in controlling metabolic flux via de novo purine biosynthesis, we hypothesize that regulation of purinosome assembly and disassembly may be one of the downstream events of mitogenic GPCR signaling in human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067845233,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor for which there is no cure. Overexpression of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and loss of the tumor suppressor genes Ink4a/Arf and PTEN are salient features of this deadly cancer. Surprisingly, targeted inhibition of EGFR has been clinically disappointing, demonstrating an innate ability for GBM to develop resistance. Efforts at modeling GBM in mice using wild-type EGFR have proven unsuccessful to date, hampering endeavors at understanding molecular mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Here, we describe a unique genetically engineered mouse model of EGFR-driven gliomagenesis that uses a somatic conditional overexpression and chronic activation of wild-type EGFR in cooperation with deletions in the Ink4a/Arf and PTEN genes in adult brains. Using this model, we establish that chronic activation of wild-type EGFR with a ligand is necessary for generating tumors with histopathological and molecular characteristics of GBMs. We show that these GBMs are resistant to EGFR kinase inhibition and we define this resistance molecularly. Inhibition of EGFR kinase activity using tyrosine kinase inhibitors in GBM tumor cells generates a cytostatic response characterized by a cell cycle arrest, which is accompanied by a substantial change in global gene expression levels. We demonstrate that an important component of this pattern is the transcriptional activation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and that pharmacological inhibition of MET overcomes the resistance to EGFR inhibition in these cells. These findings provide important new insights into mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibition and suggest that inhibition of multiple targets will be necessary to provide therapeutic benefit for GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2043320580,"The peroxisomal matrix protein import is facilitated by cycling receptor molecules that shuttle between the cytosol and the peroxisomal membrane. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the import of proteins harboring a peroxisomal targeting signal of type II (PTS2) is mediated by the receptor Pex7p and its co-receptor Pex18p. Here we demonstrate that Pex18p undergoes two kinds of ubiquitin modifications. One of these ubiquitination events depends on lysines 13 and 20 and forces rapid Pex18p turnover by proteasomal degradation. A cysteine residue near the extreme Pex18p amino-terminus is required for the second type of ubiquitination. It turned out that this cysteine residue at position 6 is essential for the function of Pex18p in peroxisomal protein import but does not contribute to receptor-cargo association and binding to the peroxisomal import apparatus. However, in contrast to the wild-type protein, cysteine 6-mutated Pex18p is arrested in a membrane-protected state, whereas Pex7p is accessible in a protease protection assay. This finding indicates that Pex18p export is linked to cargo translocation, which supports the idea of an export-driven import of proteins into peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W2073573700,"MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein abnormally expressed in all stages of development of human adenocarcinomas. Overexpression and hypoglycosylation of MUC1 in cancer cells compared with normal epithelial cells are likely to alter its function and affect the behavior of cancer cells. The extracellular domain, specifically the highly O-glycosylated VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) region, plays an important role in cell-cell communication; however, we show here that it also participates intracellularly in activation of the NF-κB pathway. Transfection of MUC1(-) tumor cells with cDNA encoding MUC1 with 22 tandem repeats (MUC1/22TR) or two tandem repeats (MUC1/2TR) or two isoforms that lack the VNTR region (MUC1/Z and MUC1/Y) showed that the highest expression levels of NF-κB family members correlated with the presence of VNTR and the highest number of tandem repeats. Because expression of MUC1 with VNTR on tumors was previously associated with chemotactic activity for cells of the innate immune system, we investigated the influence of MUC1 expression on the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. ChIP and real-time PCR experiments revealed that MUC1/22TR up-regulated IL-6 and TNF-α expression by binding to their promoter regions in a NF-κB p65-dependent manner in both MUC1-transfected and human breast cancer cells that express endogenous MUC1. This newly detected complex of MUC1 and p65 is a novel mechanism that tumors can use to promote inflammation and cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2065460237,"MULTIMERIN2 (MMRN2), also known as Endoglyx-1, is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein whose function has so far remained elusive. Given its specific localization in tight association with the endothelium we hypothesized that this protein could modulate neo-angiogenesis. By multiple assays we showed that MMRN2 significantly impaired endothelial cell (EC) migration and organization of a functional vessel network. The interaction of ECs with MMRN2 induced a striking impairment of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. We focused our attention on VEGFR2, a chief regulator of angiogenesis, and clarified that MMRN2 interfered with the VEGF/VEGFR2 axis through a direct binding with VEGF-A. This novel interaction was assessed in several assays and the affinity was estimated (Kd∼50 nM). We next questioned whether the anti-angiogenic properties of MMRN2 could impair tumor growth. Although overexpression of MMRN2 by HT1080 cells did not affect their growth and apoptotic rate in vitro, it remarkably affected their growth in vivo. In fact, MMRN2-positive cells failed to efficiently grow and form well-vascularized tumors; a similar outcome was observed following treatment of established tumors with a MMRN2 adenoviral construct. Tumor-section immunostaining revealed a strong co-localization of VEGF-A with the ectopically expressed MMRN2. These novel findings suggest that VEGF may be sequestered by MMRN2 and be less available for the engagement to the receptors. Taken together these results highlight MMRN2 as a crucial player in the regulation of EC function, neo-angiogenesis and hence tumor growth. We hypothesize that secreted and deposited MMRN2 may function as a homeostatic barrier halting the sprouting of novel vessels, and suggest that these studies may embody the potential for the development of novel tools for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2011530250,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are naturally occurring single-stranded RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target mRNA transcripts. Many of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in regulating processes commonly altered during tumorigenesis and metastatic growth. These include cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Among the several miRNAs, miRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression is increased in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion through the suppression of the homeobox D10 (HOXD10) tumor suppressor signaling pathway. In breast metastatic cells, miR-10b expression is enhanced by a transcription factor TWIST1. We find that miR-10b expression in breast cancer cells can be suppressed by CCN5, and this CCN5 effect is mediated through the inhibition of TWIST1 expression. Moreover, CCN5-induced inhibition of TWIST1 expression is mediated through the translational inhibition/modification of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α via impeding JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these studies suggest a novel regulatory pathway exists through which CCN5 exerts its anti-invasive function. On the basis of these findings, it is plausible that reactivation of CCN5 in miR-10b-positive invasive/metastatic breast cancers alone or in combination with current therapeutic regimens could provide a unique, alternative strategy to existing breast cancer therapy."

Recent studies have shown that JPs may be also involved in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we report that in skeletal muscle, JP1 and JP2 are part of a complex that, in addition to ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), includes caveolin 3 and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). The interaction between JPs and DHPR was mediated by a region encompassing amino acids 230–369 and amino acids 216–399 in JP1 and JP2, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the pattern of DHPR and RyR signals in C2C12 cells knocked down for JP1 and JP2 was rather diffused and characterized by smaller puncta in contrast to that observed in control cells. Functional experiments revealed that down-regulation of JPs in differentiated C2C12 cells resulted in a reduction of intramembrane charge movement and the L-type Ca2+ current accompanied by a reduced number of DHPRs at the plasma membrane, whereas there was no substantial alteration in Ca2+ release from the sterol regulatory element-binding protein. Altogether, these results suggest that JP1 and JP2 can facilitate the assembly of DHPR with other proteins of the excitation-contraction coupling machinery.

Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+ release from the SR is linked to depolarization of the plasma membrane in a process named excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling (3Rossi A.E. Dirksen R.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, e-c coupling requires the close association of two membrane compartments: the transverse tubules (T-tubules), which are invaginations of the plasma membrane, and the terminal cisternae, which are specialized domains of SR, resulting in the formation of junctional membrane complexes, also known as triads. Junctional membrane complexes are enriched in proteins participating in the e-c coupling mechanism and therefore can be observed by immunofluorescence staining with selective antibodies as transverse striations localized corresponding to the junction between the A-I bands in mature mammalian skeletal muscle fibers, whereas in cultured myotubes, they appear as clusters or puncta distributed in a more irregular way with respect to the contractile apparatus (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, NY2004: 232-256Google Scholar). Two major proteins are known to play an important role in signaling between the T-tubule and the terminal cisternae of SR: the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The DHPR, on the T-tubule membrane, is the voltage-gated Cav1.1 L-type channel, consisting of five subunits (4Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. Jones J.F. Reber B.F. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dirksen R.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In mature skeletal muscle, e-c coupling critically depends on the direct interaction between RyR1 and DHPR. Activation of DHPR by membrane depolarization induces conformational changes and opening of RyR1, leading to release of Ca2+ from the lumen of SR into the cytoplasm and muscle contraction (3Rossi A.E.

Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Junctophilins (JPs) are a class of highly conserved proteins that are localized at junctional membrane complexes and are involved in anchoring the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) membranes to the sarcolemma/T-tubules. JPs are composed of a large cytoplasmic region and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane segment spanning the junctional ER/SR membranes. The cytoplasmic region of JPs contains the repeated motifs of 14 amino acid residues, named “MORN motifs,” that exhibit selective binding affinity to the plasma membrane (8Ma H. Lou Y. Lin W.H. Xue H.W. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The four known junctophilin genes (JP1, JP2, JP3, and JP4) are differentially expressed throughout excitable cells; both JP1 and JP2 are expressed in skeletal muscle, JP2 is the only isoform expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle, whereas neurons express both JP3 and JP4 (7Takeshima H.

In skeletal muscle, the expression and proper targeting of JP1 appear to be involved in the correct formation and stabilization of triads. Heterologous expression of JP1 in amphibian embryos results in formation of artificial plasma membrane/ER junctions, whereas JP1 knock-out mice show neonatal lethality and disrupted membrane junctional structures in skeletal muscle fibers with limited muscle contraction (9Nishi M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Knock-out of JP2 caused an increase in the gap between plasma membrane and the junctional SR and altered Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes, resulting in embryonic lethality (7Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies on JPs have identified missense mutations in JP2 in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14Landstrom A.P. Kellen C.A. Dixit S.S. van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Weisleder N. Ma J.

Wang S.Q. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presented reduced levels of JP2 expression associated with reduced excitation-contraction coupling gain as well as altered Ca2+ homeostasis (14Landstrom A.P. Kellen C.A. Dixit S.S. van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Weisleder N. Ma J. Wehrens X.H. Ackerman M.J. Circ. Heart Fail. 2011; 4: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Comparable alterations were reported in knockdown mice with reduced JP2 expression (18van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Wang W. Dixit S.S. Landstrom A.P. Gaur N. De Almeida A.C. Skapura D.G. Rudy Y. Burns A.R. Ackerman M.J. Wehrens X.H. Circulation. 2011; 123: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Altogether, these evidences strongly suggest that JP1 and JP2 have a critical role in the assembly of the junctional membrane complexes that support the e-c coupling mechanism.Furthermore, Phimister et al. (19Phimister A.J. Lango J. Lee E.H. Ernst-Russell M.A. Takeshima H. Ma J. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8667-8677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that JP1 and RyR1 interact in a conformation-sensitive manner that coincides with changes in the reactivity of specific thiol residues residing on both proteins. An interaction between JP2 and RyR2 has been reported by van Oort et al. (18van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Wang W. Dixit S.S. Landstrom A.P. Gaur N. De Almeida A.C. Skapura D.G. Rudy Y. Burns A.R. Ackerman M.J. Wehrens X.H. Circulation. 2011; 123: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Additional evidence has suggested that JPs could interact with other proteins that control Ca2+ homeostasis and e-c coupling. JP1 was shown to be up-regulated in myotubes expressing low levels of TRPC3 (20Lee E.H. Cherednichenko G. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10042-10048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a Ca2+-permeant channel interacting directly with JP2 (21Woo J.S. Kim do H. Allen P.D. Lee E.H.

Biochem. 2009; 328: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and presumed to also be functionally linked to RyR1 in muscle (20Lee E.H. Cherednichenko G. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol.

J. 2008; 411: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, JP1-deficient muscle cells yield a reduced expression of TRPC3 as well as changes in expression of other channels from the TRPC family (23Li H. Ding X. Lopez J.R. Takeshima H. Ma J. Allen P.D. Eltit J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39171-39179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the role of TRPC channels in muscle remains misunderstood (24Berbey C. Weiss N. Legrand C. Allard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36387-36394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Zanou N. Shapovalov G. Louis M. Tajeddine N. Gallo C. Van Schoor M. Anguish I. Cao M.L. Schakman O.

Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C149-C162Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), available results highlight the existence of complex interactions between this class of Ca2+-permeant channels, JPs, and ryanodine receptors. Junctophilin deficiency in muscle cells was also reported to be associated with compromised store-operated calcium entry (26Hirata Y. Brotto M. Weisleder N. Chu Y. Lin P. Zhao X. Thornton A. Komazaki S. Takeshima H. Ma J. Pan Z. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4418-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and with reduced normal resting Ca2+ entry (23Li H. Ding X.

The identity of the molecules responsible for these Ca2+ entry pathways in muscle remains controversial, but there is growing evidence for a significant contribution of the STIM1-Orai1 protein system (23Li H. Ding X. Lopez J.R. Takeshima H. Ma J. Allen P.D. Eltit J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39171-39179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Lyfenko A.D. Dirksen R.T. J.

Rosenberg P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both components of this mechanism were found down-regulated in JP1-deficient myotubes (23Li H. Ding X. Lopez J.R. Takeshima H. Ma J. Allen P.D. Eltit J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39171-39179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that JP1 may be an important determinant of proper function of STIM1-Orai-1-mediated resting- and store-operated- trans-plasma membrane Ca2+ entry. Also worth mentioning in this context is the recently discovered possibility of interactions between STIM1 and voltage-gated Ca2+ entry, as demonstrated for Cav1.2 channels (29Park C.Y. Shcheglovitov A. Dolmetsch R. Science. 2010; 330: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Deng X. Mancarella S. Hendron E. Eguchi S. Soboloff J. Tang X.D. Gill D.L. Science. 2010; 330: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Here, we report data from immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments showing that in skeletal muscle, JP1 and JP2 can be found in a macromolecular complex that includes RyR1, Cav3, and the DHPR. Immunostaining experiments revealed that the DHPR and RyR signals in C2C12 cells following knockdown of JP1 and JP2 were significantly more diffused than those observed in control cells. Functional experiments showed that knockdown of JPs in cultured myotubes reduced the density of L-type Ca2+ current and intramembrane charge movement with no concurrent alteration of SR Ca2+ release.DISCUSSIONJP1 and JP2 have a key role in anchoring the SR to the T-tubule/sarcolemma membrane in striated muscles, thus contributing to the formation and stabilization of specialized junctional membrane complexes where proteins that participate in the mechanism of e-c coupling are localized. Additional evidence suggests that JPs might also participate in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. This appears to occur either via direct protein-protein interaction between JPs and SR and sarcolemma proteins such as RyR and TRPC3 channels (18van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Wang W. Dixit S.S. Landstrom A.P. Gaur N. De Almeida A.C. Skapura D.G. Rudy Y. Burns A.R. Ackerman M.J. Wehrens X.H. Circulation. 2011; 123: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Lee E.H.

J. 2006; 90: 4418-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or indirectly as proposed for STIM1-Orai1-dependent mechanisms of Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane (23Li H. Ding X. Lopez J.R. Takeshima H. Ma J. Allen P.D. Eltit J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39171-39179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our present results further establish this overlapping function in Ca2+ signaling by uncovering interactions between JP1 and JP2 with the DHPR, making JPs now also involved in the regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ entry in skeletal muscle cells. The association between the JP1 and JP2 and DHPR was observed in co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments with solubilized proteins from skeletal muscle microsomes. The same experiments indicated that RyR1 and Cav3 are also part of the protein complex that was immunoprecipitated together with JP1 and DHPR. The interaction with the DHPR was mapped to a sequence between aa 232–369 of JP1 and the corresponding region in JP2. The interaction between DHPR and JP1, but not with JP2, was further confirmed in HEK293-T cells expressing heterologous proteins, indicating that DHPR and JP1 may interact directly. Altogether, our results suggest that JP1 and JP2 are part of a complex made up by at least two other proteins crucial for e-c coupling, DHPR and RyR.The significance of these interactions is further extended by results obtained in immunofluorescence experiments in C2C12 cells following knockdown of JPs, where the staining for DHPR and RyR was not present with the typical punctated pattern usually observed for junctional proteins. Indeed, following JP knockdown, the immunofluorescence signals for DHPR and RyR appeared more diffused and less organized in clusters than in control cells. Reduced clustering of RyR and DHPR in C2C12 after knockdown of JPs might result from the reduction in junctional membrane complexes due to reduced levels of JPs (7Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18van Oort R.J. Garbino A. Wang W. Dixit S.S. Landstrom A.P. Gaur N. De Almeida A.C. Skapura D.G. Rudy Y. Burns A.R. Ackerman M.J. Wehrens X.H. Circulation. 2011; 123: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, it might also indicate that retention of RyR and DHPR within the junctional membrane complexes may be dependent, at least in part, on interactions with JPs. It is worth noticing that no alteration in the immunofluorescence patterns of RyR and DHPR was ever observed when pSuper-GFP vectors expressing siRNAs selective for either JP1 or JP2 were used separately (data not shown), suggesting that to modify the clustering of RyR and DHPR from larger puncta into a more diffused pattern in differentiated C2C12 cells, a reduced expression of both JP1 and JP2 is required. In addition, we noted that in JP knockdown cells, the DHPR signal, but not that of RyR, was reduced. The effects of JP depletion on DHPR were further confirmed by results from experiments performed under voltage clamp conditions, where knockdown of JPs was associated with a reduction of L-type Ca2+ current and of intramembrane charge movement. The Ca2+ current was also found reduced in adult muscle fibers, although to a smaller extent than in the cultured myotubes, likely due to the less effective depression of JPs in the myofibers in vivo. Altogether, these results are consistent with a drop of DHPR protein density in the sarcolemma, indicating that either the decreased availability of junctional membrane complex and/or the reduced interactions with JPs lowered the expression of DHPRs, but not of RyRs, in JP knockdown muscle cells. This could reflect a specific requirement of the DHPR for JP expression when compared with RyR. Actually, one unexpected finding of our study was the lack of concomitant major alteration of voltage-activated Ca2+ release; indeed, this tends to not only exclude a decisive role of JPs in the acute control of RyR1 channels but also suggests that a 35–50% (from our immunostaining and charge movement data) reduction in DHPR molecules still leaves the system with a sufficient amount of voltage sensors to secure the function of e-c coupling. This obviously is puzzling, and there is to our knowledge no previously reported experimental situation where such straight dissociation between DHPR density and SR Ca2+ release was observed. Rather, a number of studies reported parallel changes in DHPRs and Ca2+ release, as for instance in aging muscle (42Wang Z.M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Still, in the simplest framework, activation of SR Ca2+ release is pictured to operate through voltage-dependent recruitment of a homogeneous population of DHPR tetrads, each contributing to activate an identical fraction of the RyR1 channels. Present results would suggest that there might be redundancy in the system so that a substantial fraction of DHPRs can be lost without necessarily compromising the Ca2+ release capability of the cell. Although this may appear as a subversive hypothesis, it would actually offer an additional safety mechanism for the control of muscle contraction. An alternative would be to consider that functional consequences of JP knockdown included an increased effectiveness of voltage sensor charge movements to activate RyR channels or that under these experimental conditions, a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release-like mechanism might help to ensure full activation of SR Ca2+ release. The absence of an alteration of voltage-activated SR Ca2+ release observed here does not preclude the possibility that, under either intense or prolonged periods of activity, proper maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ regulation and e-c coupling may be affected by the reduced DHPR function. Along this line, data from Hirata et al. (26Hirata Y. Brotto M. Weisleder N. Chu Y. Lin P. Zhao X. Thornton A. Komazaki S. Takeshima H. Ma J. Pan Z. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4418-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that JP-deficient muscle fibers stimulated repetitively in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ failed to develop Ca2+ transients more rapidly than control muscle fibers. Although the authors favored a role of defective store-operated calcium entry mechanism, the possible contribution of reduced DHPR activity may be speculated to also contribute to this type of effect.In conclusion, based on the above reported findings, we propose that JP1 and JP2, in addition to their role in the formation of structural junctional membrane complexes between the SR and T-tubule/sarcolemma, can also provide a scaffold-like function that might help in establishing functional interactions between junctional proteins, including DHPR and RyRs, and thus further help in the establishment of the mechanism of e-c coupling.

Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, NY2004: 232-256Google Scholar, 2Sorrentino V. Int. J Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+ release from the SR is linked to depolarization of the plasma membrane in a process named excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling (3Rossi A.E. Dirksen R.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, e-c coupling requires the close association of two membrane compartments: the transverse tubules (T-tubules), which are invaginations of the plasma membrane, and the terminal cisternae, which are specialized domains of SR, resulting in the formation of junctional membrane complexes, also known as triads. Junctional membrane complexes are enriched in proteins participating in the e-c coupling mechanism and therefore can be observed by immunofluorescence staining with selective antibodies as transverse striations localized corresponding to the junction between the A-I bands in mature mammalian skeletal muscle fibers, whereas in cultured myotubes, they appear as clusters or puncta distributed in a more irregular way with respect to the contractile apparatus (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, NY2004: 232-256Google Scholar). Two major proteins are known to play an important role in signaling between the T-tubule and the terminal cisternae of SR: the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The DHPR, on the T-tubule membrane, is the voltage-gated Cav1.1 L-type channel, consisting of five subunits (4Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. Jones J.F. Reber B.F. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dirksen R.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In mature skeletal muscle, e-c coupling critically depends on the direct interaction between RyR1 and DHPR. Activation of DHPR by membrane depolarization induces conformational changes and opening of RyR1, leading to release of Ca2+ from the lumen of SR into the cytoplasm and muscle contraction (3Rossi A.E. Dirksen R.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 33: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 6Ríos E. Pizarro G. Stefani E. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2067691677,"Factor Xa would be ideally suited to control unregulated bleeding were it not for its extremely short half-life and tendency to overactivate clotting mechanisms. Ivanciu et al. show that a longer lived but less active variant of the protease restores hemostasis in mouse models of hemophilia without thrombotic complications. Effective therapies are needed to control excessive bleeding in a range of clinical conditions. We improve hemostasis in vivo using a conformationally pliant variant of coagulation factor Xa (FXaI16L) rendered partially inactive by a defect in the transition from zymogen to active protease1,2. Using mouse models of hemophilia, we show that FXaI16L has a longer half-life than wild-type FXa and does not cause excessive activation of coagulation. Once clotting mechanisms are activated to produce its cofactor FVa, FXaI16L is driven to the protease state and restores hemostasis in hemophilic animals upon vascular injury. Moreover, using human or murine analogs, we show that FXaI16L is more efficacious than FVIIa, which is used to treat bleeding in hemophilia inhibitor patients3. FXaI16L may provide an effective strategy to enhance blood clot formation and act as a rapid pan-hemostatic agent for the treatment of bleeding conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2012084175,"Aragón and colleagues show that the phosphatase Cdc14 acts on the CDT subunit of RNA polymerase II to silence transcription of repetitive regions of the yeast genome. At telomeres this event promotes condensin loading and mitotic segregation. Kinases and phosphatases regulate messenger RNA synthesis through post-translational modification of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (ref. 1). In yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14 is required for mitotic exit2,3 and for segregation of repetitive regions4. Cdc14 is also a subunit of the silencing complex RENT (refs 5, 6), but no roles in transcriptional repression have been described. Here we report that inactivation of Cdc14 causes silencing defects at the intergenic spacer sequences of ribosomal genes during interphase and at Y′ repeats in subtelomeric regions during mitosis. We show that the role of Cdc14 in silencing is independent of the RENT deacetylase subunit Sir2. Instead, Cdc14 acts directly on RNA polymerase II by targeting CTD phosphorylation at Ser 2 and Ser 5. We also find that the role of Cdc14 as a CTD phosphatase is conserved in humans. Finally, telomere segregation defects in cdc14 mutants4 correlate with the presence of subtelomeric Y′ elements and can be rescued by transcriptional inhibition of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2021952312,"Human aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) comprise a family of 17 homologous enzymes that metabolize different biogenic and exogenic aldehydes. To date, there are relatively few general ALDH inhibitors that can be used to probe the contribution of this class of enzymes to particular metabolic pathways. Here, we report the discovery of a general class of ALDH inhibitors with a common mechanism of action. The combined data from kinetic studies, mass spectrometric measurements, and crystallographic analyses demonstrate that these inhibitors undergo an enzyme-mediated β-elimination reaction generating a vinyl ketone intermediate that covalently modifies the active site cysteine residue present in these enzymes. The studies described here can provide the basis for rational approach to design ALDH isoenzyme-specific inhibitors as research tools and perhaps as drugs, to address diseases such as cancer where increased ALDH activity is associated with a cellular phenotype.

ALDH family members participate in multiple metabolic pathways, including ethanol oxidation, retinol metabolism, dopamine, and GABA metabolism, as well as branched-chain amino acid metabolism and in the elimination of toxic aldehydes produced from lipid peroxidation (3Vasilou V. Nerbert D.W. Hum. Genom. 2005; 2: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated that specific ALDH isoenzymes may contribute to the pathology of different diseases. For example, ALDH1A1 is an important biomarker for cancer cells and cancer stem cells (3Vasilou V. Nerbert D.W. Hum. Genom. 2005; 2: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 4Marcato P.

The low activity of ALDH2*2 enzyme present in East Asians is associated with acetaldehyde toxicity when they consume ethanol (6Harada S. Okubo T. Nakamura T. Fujii C. Nomura F. Higuchi S. Tsutsumi M.

Inhibitors of ALDH family members have potential application in alcohol dependence (12Arolfo M.P. Overstreet D.H. Yao L. Fan P. Lawrence A.J. Tao G. Keung W.M. Vallee B.L. Olive M.F. Gass J.T.

Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5156-5160PubMed Google Scholar, 16Manthey C.L. Landkamer G.J. Sladek N.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4991-5002PubMed Google Scholar, 17von Eitzen U. Meier-Tackmann D. Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this latter regard, siRNA knockdown of ALDH1A1 and/or ALDH3A1 increased sensitivity to cyclophosphamide, with the double knockdown demonstrating the greatest resensitization (5Moreb J.S. Mohuczy D. Muhoczy D. Ostmark B. Zucali J.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2007; 59: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Members of the ALDH superfamily possess a highly reactive active site cysteine residue (Cys-302 in ALDH1A1 and ALDH2, Cys-243 in ALDH3A1) that performs a nucleophilic attack on the aldehydic carbonyl group leading to the formation of a covalent thiohemiacetal intermediate. Subsequent hydride transfer to NAD(P)+ generates the reduced cofactor and an acyl enzyme intermediate, which is then hydrolyzed by a water molecule activated by a general base believed to be either Glu-268 or Glu-399 (Glu-209 and Glu-333 in ALDH3A1). In general, the order of substrate addition is sequential with the cofactor preceding the aldehyde into the active site, but this order of addition is relaxed for some aromatic substrates where random substrate binding can occur (18Allali-Hassani A. Weiner H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to characterize the mechanism of action of a class of inhibitors identified in our high-throughput screen for modulators of ALDH2 activity. Initial characterization of four related compounds showed similar inhibition properties and time-dependent kinetics. Subsequent crystal structure determination demonstrated a covalent adduct with the active site cysteine of both ALDH2 and ALDH3A1. This observation was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products. Together, these data support a mechanism of covalent inhibition where the enzymes catalyzes a beta-elimination of the substituted amine, forming a reactive aromatic vinyl ketone compound that subsequently modifies the highly reactive catalytic nucleophile in the active site. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated. The human ALDH3A1 clone was obtained from Open Biosystems and cloned into a pET-28a plasmid with an N-terminal His tag. The single mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis using a Quikchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Human ALDH3A1 was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (19Parajuli B. Kimble-Hill A.C. Khanna M. Ivanova Y. Meroueh S. Hurley T.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2011; 191: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme is also tested using a standard assay that measures production of NADPH (see description below). Purification of recombinantly expressed ALDH2 and its C302S, E399Q, and E268Q enzymes has been described elsewhere (20Jeng J.J. Weiner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ALDH2 enzyme assay design has been reported previously (19Parajuli B. Kimble-Hill A.C. Khanna M. Ivanova Y. Meroueh S. Hurley T.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2011; 191: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO and screened at 10 μm concentration prior to addition of the substrate. Assays and computer analysis were carried out by the Stanford University High-Throughput Biosciences Center (Department of Chemical and Systems Biology). 63,500 compounds were screened (8Chen C.H. Budas G.R. Churchill E.N. Disatnik M.H. Hurley T.D. Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 2008; 321: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and some were purchased from ChemBridge for further validation. Inhibitors that emerged from the screen were purchased from ChemBridge and were designated as follows: Aldi-1, 3-(1-azepanyl)-1-phenyl-1-propanone hydrochloride; Aldi-2, 3-(dimethylamino)-1-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-propanone hydrochloride; Aldi-3, 3-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-ethylphenyl)-1-propanone hydrochloride; and Aldi-4, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(1-piperidinyl)-1-propanone hydrochloride (named here Aldi-1, -2, -3, and -4 for ALDH inhibitors 1–4). Complexes for analysis by mass spectrometry were formed by the addition of 20 μm ALDH3A1 or ALDH2 with 40 μm (2-fold molar excess) or 100 μm (5-fold molar excess) of the various inhibitors and incubated overnight at room temperature. Samples (0.5 to 8 μl) were injected into an Agilent 6520 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer operating in positive ion electrospray ionization-time of flight mode equipped with an Agilent 1200 series capillary HPLC. The data were analyzed with formula assignments for low molecular weight compounds and deconvolution for proteins using the Mass Hunter/Bioconfirm software suite. Crystals of ALDH3A1 at 3 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 were grown from solutions containing 0.2 m potassium acetate and 18% PEG3350 at 25 °C. We prepared the complexes with inhibitors through direct soaking experiments by first equilibrating the crystals in solution containing 2% DMSO overnight, which were then supplemented with 100 μm of the desired inhibitor. The crystals were directly frozen without any further addition of cryoprotectant. Data sets were collected at a wavelength of 0.9869 Å and at 100 K. All diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 program suite (23Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). All refinements were performed using the program packages Refmac5 as implemented in the CCP4 program suite (23Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar), and model inspection and building was accomplished using the program package Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was used to solve the structure of the apo form of human ALDH3A1 using the rat ALDH3A1 structure as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 1AD3). For structures complexed with inhibitors, the apo structure was used for direct refinement. Binding of inhibitors was evaluated through inspection of the initial σ-A weighted Fo − Fc electron density maps. The Aldi-1 complexed structure showed Cys-243 in two distinct conformations within the actives sites at 50% occupancy, only one of these conformations was modified covalently. Crystals of ALDH2 were grown from protein solutions containing 8 mg/ml ALDH2, in 100 mm Na-ACES, pH 6.4–6.6, 100 mm guanidine-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm dithiothreitol and 16–17% PEG 6000. Introduction of Aldi-3, processing and refinement of the data were performed as outlined above. The structure was solved by using the coordinates of the refined apo enzyme structure of ALDH2 as the refinement model (Protein Data Bank code 1O05) following removal of all solvent molecules. Cys-302 was found in two distinct conformations at 50% occupancy each, only one of those conformations was modified covalently by Aldi-3. Detailed refinement statistics are provided in Table 2. In the Ramachandran plots, 91.1% (ALDH2-Aldi-3), 93.6% (ALDH3A1) and 92.4% (ALDH3A1-Aldi-1) of all residues are in the most favored regions and there were fewer than 0.5% outliers for all residues.TABLE 2X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for ALDH3A and ALDH2ALDH3A1 (apo)aOne crystal was used for each data collection protocol.ALDH3A1 (Aldi-1)aOne crystal was used for each data collection protocol.ALDH2 (Aldi-3)aOne crystal was used for each data collection protocol.Data collection Space groupP212121P212121P212121 Cell dimensionsa = 61.41, b = 86.08, and c = 170.40 Å; α = 90.0, β = 90.0, and γ = 90.0°a = 61.38, b = 85.73, and c = 169.56 Å; α = 90.0, β = 90.0, and γ = 90.0°a = 140.52, b = 151.05, and c = 177.02 Å; α = 90.0, β = 90.0, and γ = 90.0° Resolution (Å)50.0-1.48 (1.51-1.48)bValues in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.50.0-1.51 (1.54-1.51)50-2.10 (2.14-2.10) Rsym or Rmerge0.058 (0.33)0.058 (0.39)0.098 (0.53) I/σI19.6 (4.1)18.6 (2.9)18.1 (3.2) Completeness (%)97.8 (92.3)97.7 (97.8)99.7 (99.7) Redundancy4.7 (4.0)4.4 (3.4)5.5 (5.4)Refinement Resolution (Å)50.0-1.4850.0-1.5150.0-2.10 No. of reflections139,344130,505212,188 Rwork/Rfree0.16/0.190.18/0.200.17/0.23 No. of atoms Protein7186722430,543 Ligand/ion1232260 Water109411602597 B-factors Protein15.119.125.5 Ligand/ion22.025.834.4 Water25.429.730.9 Root mean square deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.0150.0150.01 Bond angles1.54°1.51°1.31°a One crystal was used for each data collection protocol.b Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab IC50 inhibition curves for the inhibitors were measured using the activity of hALDH2, hALDH1A1, and hALDH3A1 as described elsewhere (19Parajuli B. Kimble-Hill A.C. Khanna M. Ivanova Y. Meroueh S. Hurley T.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2011; 191: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IC50 values were further determined for inhibitors Aldi-1, Aldi-2, and Aldi-4 against propionaldehyde oxidation (ALDH1A1, ALDH2) or benzaldehyde oxidation (ALDH3A1) by measuring NADH production over time at various concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μm of inhibitors following a 2-min pre-incubation. All reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate aldehyde. The inhibition curves were fit to the four-parameter EC50 equation using SigmaPlot (version 10.0, StatSys). All data represent the average of a minimum of three independent experiments with their S.D. Enzyme stock solutions each containing ALDH3A1 or ALDH2 and varying concentrations between 0 and 500 μm of Aldi-1 were prepared. At the indicated time points, the remaining enzyme activity was determined. The bi-molecular rate constants for the modification of ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 were determined using the method of Aldridge and Reiner (25Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972: 1-328Google Scholar). Assays for inhibition of caspase activity were carried out using an established method as described in Berger et al. (26Berger A.B. Witte M.D. Denault J.B. Sadaghiani A.M. Sexton K.M. Salvesen G.S. Bogyo M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Enzymatic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was monitored by monitoring ADH production at 340 nm using recombinant human ADH1B1 protein. All assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 9.0, 2.5 mm NAD+ using 30 μg of ADH and 10 mm of ethanol as a substrate. Aldi-1 or Aldi-2 (10 μm), pyrazole (10 μm, a known ADH inhibitor), or DMSO were added immediately prior to the kinetic assays. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used for cell survival and proliferation. A549 cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates 24 h before the start of the first treatment. Cells were treated twice with ALDH inhibitors in the presence or absence of mafosfamide. For the first treatment, ALDH inhibitors were added for 5 h followed by a second treatment for 19 h. Mafosfamide (125 μm, ASTA Z 7557, Asta Werke, Bielefeld, Germany) was added once to the cells alone or in combination with the ALDH inhibitors. MTT assay was carried out 19 h after the addition of the second dose of inhibitors. After the treatments, 0.01 ml of MTT (Millipore CT01-5, 50 mg/ml in PBS) solution was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C for the reduction of MTT to occur. Isopropanol with 0.04N HCl (0.1 ml each) was then added and mixed thoroughly for color development. Within an hour, absorbance was measured at 570 nm and at a reference wavelength at 630 nm. For the calculation, absorbances measured at 570 nm were subtracted with those measured at 630 nm (n = 8–16 for each treatment). The relative percentage was calculated in comparison with DMSO-treated controls based on the subtracted absorbances. A high-throughput screen of small molecules was performed to find modulators of ALDH2 activity (8Chen C.H. Budas G.R. Churchill E.N. Disatnik M.H. Hurley T.D. Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 2008; 321: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This screen yielded several ALDH2 activators, including Alda-1(8Chen C.H. Budas G.R. Churchill E.N. Disatnik M.H.

Biol. 2010; 17: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The screen also identified an interesting class of ALDH inhibitors. The present study focuses on the characterization of four structurally related inhibitors Aldi-1, -2, -3, and -4 with a core structure of 3-amino-1-phenylpropan-1-one. These inhibitors are structurally related to the known inhibitor 4-hydroxyacetophenone, which comprises the affinity ligand used for purification of ALDH2 (27Negoro M. Wakabayashi I. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2005; 29: 304S-308SCrossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 28Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The IC50 values for inhibition of ALDH2 were between 5–9 μm for the four inhibitors (Table 1), whereas the IC50 values for ALDH3A1 ranged between 1.7 and 12 μm, and the IC50 values for ALDH1A1 ranged between 2.5 and 7 μm (Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition constants of Aldi inhibitors for human ALDH isoenzymesInhibitorAverage IC50 values (μm)ALDH1A1ALDH2ALDH3A1Aldi-12.2 (0.3)aValues in parentheses are S.D. for three independent assays.8.6 (1.2)12 (1.0)Aldi-22.5 (0.1)6.4 (1.0)1.9 (0.1)Aldi-37.9 (0.4)5.4 (1.3)1.7 (0.1)Aldi-46.8 (0.3)8.3 (1.2)2.2 (0.3)Ki (m−1 s−1)Aldi-1NDbND, not determined.24030a Values in parentheses are S.D. for three independent assays.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab During the initial IC50 experiments, it was noted that the extent of inhibition was variable depending on whether enzyme or substrate was used to initiate the reaction and whether the enzyme and inhibitor were pre-incubated prior to initiating the reaction with substrate. Such order-of-addition and time-dependent effects are often indicative of a covalent means of inhibition. Consequently, we initiated experiments to determine the bi-molecular rate constant for inhibition for the parent compound for this class molecules: Aldi-1. These experiments were consistent with a covalent means of inhibition and bi-molecular rate constants of 30 m−1 s−1 for ALDH3A1 and 240 m−1 s−1 for ALDH2 (Table 1 and Fig. 1). To determine the mechanism by which these inhibitors broadly inhibit ALDH isoenzymes, we examined their binding through the structure determination by x-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of human ALDH3A1 has not been reported previously, although the structure is expected to be highly similar to the rat ALDH3A1 enzyme (1AD3) with which it shares 82% sequence identity. We solved the structure of human ALDH3A1 in its apo enzyme form and in complex with Aldi-1 (Table 2) to 1.5 Å resolution in the P212121 space group. As expected, the enzyme displays a high similarity to the rat ALDH3A1 enzyme (root mean square deviation for all ordered Cα atoms equal to 0.6 Å) and contains all of the structural features that characterize the ALDH family (Fig. 2A) (29Black W. Vasiliou V. Hum. Genomics. 2009; 4: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In human ALDH3A1, we detect two distinct conformations for Cys-243, at ∼50% occupancy for each conformation. Solving the structure of human ALDH3A1 enabled us to determine how these novel inhibitors exerted their inhibitory effects. The electron density map demonstrated that only a portion of the inhibitor was bound in the crystal structure; due to its proximity to Cys-243, we suspected that a covalent adduct occurs between the inhibitor and ALDH3A1 (Fig. 2B). To test the commonality of this interaction, we also solved the structure of Aldi-3 complexed to ALDH2 to 2.1 Å resolution (Table 2). Similar to that observed in ALDH3A1, the electron density is most consistent with a covalent adduct to Cys-302 (Fig. 2C). However, it was not immediately clear from the electron density which part of the inhibitor was attached to the catalytic cysteines. Nevertheless, the density in both the ALDH3A1 and ALDH2 structures were most consistent with an aromatic ketone and two additional carbons linked to the cysteine residue. To define the chemical entity bound in the crystal structures, we used mass spectrometry of the unreacted protein and protein incubated in the presence of inhibitor. Quadrupole TOF LC/MS of ALDH3A1, ALDH2, and their inhibitor complexes confirmed that there was an increase in mass of the protein following incubation with the inhibitors. Overall, the ALDH2 protein yielded cleaner MS spectra and a single primary deconvoluted mass of 54,445 (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, ALDH3A1 yielded several peaks in the deconvoluted spectrum, although the mass differences between the primary peaks were identical to the mass differences found for ALDH2. The deconvoluted spectra for ALDH3A1 yielded four peaks with masses of 54,413, 52,445, 52,589, and 52,623 (supplemental Fig. S1E). From the smallest mass peak of ALDH3A1, the next peak is shifted by 32 amu, which most likely represents two oxidations of cysteine residues. The next two peaks are each shifted by ∼178 amu from the first two species. A mass shift of 178 Da is consistent with post-translational modification by α-N-6-phosphogluconoylation of the N-terminal His residue of the His tag (30Geoghegan K.F. Dixon H.B. Rosner P.J. Hoth L.R. Lanzetti A.J. Borzilleri K.A. Marr E.S. Pezzullo L.H. Martin L.B. LeMotte P.K. McColl A.S. Kamath A.V. Stroh J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the chemical mechanism of inhibition, our efforts focused on ALDH2, as it was simpler to interpret the mass spectra. Despite the similar phenylpropanone core (Fig. 3), there are numerous differences in structure that would lead to distinct chemical species in the mass spectra. There was an increase in protein mass in all instances when the inhibitors were incubated in the presence of ALDH2 (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D and Table 3). The mass differences between the unmodified and modified proteins were 131.7, 180.0, 159.9, and 166.8 Daltons for incubations with Aldi-1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively (Table 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). These mass differences matched precisely to the resulting vinyl ketone derivatives that would result following β-elimination of the substituted amine group through abstraction of the β-proton by a general base (Fig. 3). The reactive vinyl ketone thus generated reacts covalently with the active site thiol. To confirm this hypothesis and to test the specificity by which the reactive group is generated, we purchased the base vinyl ketone moiety corresponding to the reactive form of Aldi-1 (1-phenyl-2-propen-1-one). Reaction of wild-type ALDH2 with 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-one produced multiple species that differed from the unmodified enzyme by multiples of 132 amu (Table 3 and Fig. 4), matching the molecular weight differential obtained for the Aldi-1. Despite the fact that the Aldi compounds were incubated at 5-fold excess over the concentration of ALDH active sites, only a single cysteine residue was modified based on the combined MS and crystallographic data. In contrast, 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-one only exhibited this level of specific modification at lower concentration ratios (Fig. 4).TABLE 3Mass spectrometric results for ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 upon incubation with Aldi compoundsSampleDeconvoluted massΔm/zALDH254,445ALDH2 + Aldi-154,577132ALDH2 + Aldi-254,626181ALDH2 + Aldi-354,607162ALDH2 + Aldi-454,612167ALDH2 + 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-one54,57713254,70926454,84139654,972527ALDH2-E399Q54,445ALDH2-E399Q + Aldi-3 (2-fold)54,605aSamples contain ∼10–20% of unmodified protein.160ALDH2-E399Q + Aldi-3 (5-fold)54,605160ALDH3A152,413ALDH3A1 + Aldi-352,571159ALDH3A1-C243S52,395ALDH3A1-C243S + Aldi-3 (5-fold)52,3950ALDH3A1-E209Q52,411ALDH3A1-E209Q + Aldi-3 (2-fold)52,572aSamples contain ∼10–20% of unmodified protein.161ALDH3A1-E209Q + Aldi-3 (5-fold)52,572161ALDH3A1-E333Q52,411ALDH3A1-E333Q + Aldi-3 (2-fold)52,571160ALDH3A1-E333Q + Aldi-3 (5-fold)52,571160a Samples contain ∼10–20% of unmodified protein.

We analyzed the ALDH2 after incubation with Aldi-1 incubation, focusing on the lower molecular weight region of the spectrum from 50–1700 m/z to permit detection of small molecules. Following reaction of ALDH2 with Aldi-1, a peak with the appropriate 100.1 mass units was detected (data not shown). Agilent MassHunter Software was used to identify a molecular formula of the small accurate mass ions and a formula of C6H13N was assigned: a mass difference of 0.1 ppm from the expected fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to confirm both the sites of modification and probe the residues responsible for the specificity of the covalent modification. To determine whether any of the surrounding glutamate residues function as the general base to generate the reactive intermediate, we incubated the ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 mutants with 2- to 5-fold excess of Aldi-1 (Table 3) and repeated the mass spectrometry analysis. We find that none of these mutants completely abolished the ability Aldi-1 to modify the proteins. However, the ALDH2-E399Q and ALDH3-E209Q mutants were not fully modified when the inhibitor was present at two times the protein concentration (supplemental Fig. S1G and Table 3). The ALDH3-E333Q mutant was fully modified by a 2-molar excess of Aldi-1, and all mutants were stoichiometrically modified when a 5-fold molar excess was used, suggesting that these glutamates are not required to generate the reactive vinyl ketone. In contrast, mutation of Cys-243 to Ser in the ALDH3A1 enzyme yields a virtually inactive enzyme, which was not covalently modified by any of these inhibitors as assessed by mass spectrometry (Table 3). Interestingly, mutation of Cys-302 to Ser in ALDH2 actually increased the stoichiometry of modification from one to two and mutation of Glu-268 to Gln in ALDH2 (E268Q) further increase"
https://openalex.org/W2021115672,"Dysregulated behavior of cell cycle proteins and their control by ubiquitin E3 ligases is an emerging theme in human lung cancer. Here, we identified and characterized the activity of a novel F-box protein, termed FBXL2, belonging to the SCF (Skip-Cullin1-F-box protein) E3 ligase family. Ectopically expressed FBXL2 triggered G2/M-phase arrest, induced chromosomal anomalies and increased apoptosis of transformed lung epithelia by mediating polyubiquitination and degradation of the mitotic regulator, cyclin D3. Unlike other F-box proteins that target phosphodegrons within substrates, FBXL2 uniquely recognizes a canonical calmodulin (CaM)-binding motif within cyclin D3 to facilitate its polyubiquitination. CaM bound and protected cyclin D3 from FBXL2 by direct intermolecular competition with the F-box protein for access within this motif. The chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine increased apoptosis of human lung carcinoma cells by inducing FBXL2 expression and cyclin D3 degradation, an effect accentuated by CaM knockdown. Depletion of endogenous FBXL2 stabilized cyclin D3 levels, accelerated cancer cell growth and increased cell viability after vinorelbine treatment. Last, ectopic expression of FBXL2 significantly inhibited the growth and migration of tumorogenic cells and tumor formation in athymic nude mice. These observations implicate SCF(FBXL2) as an indispensible regulator of mitosis that serves as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2151601086,"Expression of CD200, the gene encoding the ligand for the inhibitory immune receptor CD200R, is an independent prognostic factor for various forms of leukemia predicting worse overall survival of the patients. The enhanced expression of CD200 on the tumors implies that anti-tumor responses can be enhanced by blockage of the CD200–CD200R interaction. Indeed, antibody-mediated blockade of the CD200-CD200R inhibitory axis is currently evaluated in clinical tests to boost immune responses against CD200-expressing tumors. Here, we show that mice lacking CD200, the exclusive ligand for CD200R, are resistant to chemical skin carcinogenesis. Importantly, CD200R controls tumor outgrowth independently of CD200 expression by the tumor cells themselves. Furthermore, Cd200−/− mice do not become tolerant to intranasally administered antigens, suggesting that tumor rejection is normally suppressed through CD200-induced immune tolerance. Decreased tumor outgrowth is accompanied by increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 by the lymph node (LN) dendritic cells. During carcinogenesis, skin-draining LNs of Cd200−/− mice contain increased numbers of IL-17-producing FoxP3+ cells, which preferentially home to the tumors. Thus, the CD200-CD200R axis induces tolerance to external and tumor antigens and influences the T-regulatory/Th17 cell ratio. We demonstrate for the first time that the absence of CD200R signaling inhibits outgrowth of an endogenous tumor irrespective of CD200 expression by the tumor cells. This important paradigm shift leads to a much broader applicability of CD200-blockade in the treatment of tumors."

https://openalex.org/W4254912390,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and aggressive type of brain tumor. GBMs usually show hyperactivation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, a pro-tumorigenic signaling cascade that contributes to pathogenesis. Girdin, an actin-binding protein identified as a novel substrate of Akt, regulates the sprouting of axons and the migration of neural progenitor cells during early postnatal-stage neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Here, we show that Girdin is highly expressed in human glioblastoma (GBM). Stable Girdin knockdown in isolated GBM stem cells resulted in decreased expression of stem cell markers, including CD133, induced multilineage neural differentiation, and inhibited in vitro cell motility, ex vivo invasion, sphere-forming capacity and in vivo tumor formation. Furthermore, exogenous expression of the Akt-binding domain of Girdin, which competitively inhibits its Akt-mediated phosphorylation, diminished the expression of stem cell markers, SOX2 and nestin, and migration on the brain slice and induced the expression of neural differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein/βIII Tubulin. Our results reveal that Girdin is required for GBM-initiating stem cells to sustain the stemness and invasive properties."
https://openalex.org/W2129231661,"An evolutionary algorithm predicts anti-inflammatory drug combinations that have synergistic effects on IL-1β expression more efficiently than would empirical approaches of testing drug combinations individually. The control of biochemical fluxes is distributed, and to perturb complex intracellular networks effectively it is often necessary to modulate several steps simultaneously. However, the number of possible permutations leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of experiments that would have to be performed in a complete analysis. We used a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to optimize reagent combinations from a dynamic chemical library of 33 compounds with established or predicted targets in the regulatory network controlling IL-1β expression. The evolutionary algorithm converged on excellent solutions within 11 generations, during which we studied just 550 combinations out of the potential search space of ∼9 billion. The top five reagents with the greatest contribution to combinatorial effects throughout the evolutionary algorithm were then optimized pairwise. A p38 MAPK inhibitor together with either an inhibitor of IκB kinase or a chelator of poorly liganded iron yielded synergistic inhibition of macrophage IL-1β expression. Evolutionary searches provide a powerful and general approach to the discovery of new combinations of pharmacological agents with therapeutic indices potentially greater than those of single drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2005028301,"The roles of progesterone (P(4)) and of progesterone receptor (PR) in development and pathogenesis of breast cancer remain unclear. In this study, we observed that treatment of T47D breast cancer cells with progestin antagonized effects of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to stimulate cell proliferation, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous PR abrogated progestin-mediated anti-proliferative effects. To begin to define mechanisms for the anti-proliferative action of P(4)/PR, we considered the role of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1/DUSP1), which catalyzes dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAPKs. Progestin treatment of T47D cells rapidly induced MKP-1 expression in a PR-dependent manner. Importantly, P(4) induction of MKP-1 was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, whereas siRNA knockdown of MKP-1 blocked progestin-mediated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation and repression of FBS-induced cell proliferation. The importance of PR in MKP-1 expression was supported by findings that MKP-1 and PR mRNA levels were significantly correlated in 30 human breast cancer cell lines. By contrast, no correlation was observed with the glucocorticoid receptor, a known regulator of MKP-1 in other cell types. ChIP and luciferase reporter assay findings suggest that PR acts in a ligand-dependent manner through binding to two progesterone response elements downstream of the MKP-1 transcription start site to up-regulate MKP-1 promoter activity. PR also interacts with two Sp1 sites just downstream of the transcription start site to increase MKP-1 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that MKP-1 is a critical mediator of anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory actions of PR in the breast."
https://openalex.org/W2087096438,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/death receptor 5 (DR5)-mediated cell death plays an important role in the elimination of tumor cells and transformed cells. Recently, recombinant TRAIL and agonistic anti-DR5 monoclonal antibodies have been developed and applied to cancer therapy. However, depending on the type of cancer, the sensitivity to TRAIL has been reportedly different, and some tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Using confocal microscopy, we found that large amounts of DR5 were localized in the nucleus in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Moreover, these tumor cells were resistant to TRAIL, whereas DU145 cells, which do not have nuclear DR5, were highly sensitive to TRAIL. By means of immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, we found that DR5 and importin β1 were physically associated, suggesting that the nuclear DR5 was transported through the nuclear import pathway mediated by importin β1. Two functional nuclear localization signals were identified in DR5, the mutation of which abrogated the nuclear localization of DR5 in HeLa cells. Moreover, the nuclear transport of DR5 was also prevented by the knockdown of importin β1 using siRNA, resulting in the up-regulation of DR5 expression on the cell surface and an increased sensitivity of HeLa and HepG2 cells to TRAIL.

The ligation of homotrimeric TRAIL to DR5 results in the trimerization of DR5, the clustering of the DR5 intracellular DD, and the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), leading to the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (1Gonzalvez F. Ashkenazi A. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4752-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Death-inducing signaling complex moves into a membrane compartment enriched in lipid rafts and linked to the cytoskeleton, therefore initiating signal transduction through intracellular signaling machinery involving the activation of caspases (1Gonzalvez F. Ashkenazi A. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4752-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 2Falschlehner C. Schaefer U. Walczak H. Immunology. 2009; 127: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Procaspase-8 is dimerized by its interaction with Fas-associated death domain, and it is activated through interchain cleavage at two cleavage sites. Furthermore, the activated caspase-8 cleaves the procaspase-3 dimer at one cleavage site, and finally, the now active caspase-3 dimer executes apoptosis (10Tait S.W. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). In some cell types, when the activation of caspase-8 is not sufficient, amplification is required and involves the activation of other caspases. In the current model, the intracellular signal transduction is regulated by complex mechanisms, and the resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death can occur at several points in the signal pathways (1Gonzalvez F.

Some strategies to increase the cell surface expression of DR5 on tumor cells are expected to improve the efficacy of these agents. In this study, we found that large amounts of DR5 were localized in the nucleus in some tumor cell lines. We identified two functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences in DR5 recognized by importin (17Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J.

Moreover, the knockdown of importin β1 resulted in the accumulation of DR5 on the cell surface and increased TRAIL/DR5-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells. These findings may be translatable to the TRAIL and anti-DR5 mAb therapies by the tumor-specific targeting of importin β1 using siRNA or a small molecule inhibitor of importin-mediated nuclear transport. Mouse anti-human DR5 mAb (HS201) and recombinant human TRAIL (rTRAIL) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, and goat anti-human DR5 polyclonal antibody (pAb), control rabbit IgG, control goat IgG, and recombinant human IL-4 were from R&D Systems.

A human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), a human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa), and a human prostate carcinoma cell line (DU145) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. For importin β1 knockdown, 30 nm importin β1 siRNA or control siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C and then collected for subsequent analysis. Cells (1 × 104 in a volume of 100 μl of culture medium/well) were seeded into a flat bottomed 96-well plate (Corning) and incubated with various concentrations of rTRAIL for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by the 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)[2H]tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST) assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the percentage of cell death was calculated as described previously (19Jazirehi A.R. Ng C.P. Gan X.H. Schiller G. Bonavida B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3874-3883PubMed Google Scholar). To measure TRAIL sensitivity after importin β1 knockdown, rTRAIL or vehicle alone was added to the culture medium at 24 h post-transfection with siRNA. To examine the cell surface expression of DR5, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg of mouse anti-human DR5 mAb or isotype-matched mouse IgG1 for 30 min at 4 °C followed by PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2. To detect the total cellular (namely cell surface and intracellular) expression of DR5, cells were treated with 70% ethanol in PBS for 30 min on ice and washed with PBS before the staining. The cells were then analyzed on a FACScanTM (BD Biosciences), and the data were processed using the Cell Quest program. The net mean fluorescence intensity was calculated as described previously (20Lanza F. Latorraca A. Moretti S. Castagnari B. Ferrari L. Castoldi G. Cytometry. 1997; 30: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After removal of the culture medium, tumor cells incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C on a poly-l-lysine-coated 4-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc) were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. After the removal of the sidewall from the chamber slide, each chamber was circled with a Dako pen, and the cells were treated with a permeabilization buffer (Takara) according to manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated with appropriate concentrations of the primary antibodies or the isotype-matched control Igs overnight at 4 °C for the detection of DR5 or for 1 h at 37 °C for the detection of other proteins. Importin β1 was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, whereas DR5 was identified by staining with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin. Endogenous biotin was blocked using an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cell nuclei were counterstained with Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Cells were lysed in NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare total cell lysate for the detection of importin β1, sample buffer containing SDS was added directly to the cells, which were sonicated briefly. For the detection of caspases, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The cytoplasmic, nuclear, and total lysate fractions of the cells were subjected to 7.5, 10, or 16% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare) or Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturers' instructions and were analyzed by LAS4000 (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (21Akiba H. Nakano H. Nishinaka S. Shindo M. Kobata T. Atsuta M. Morimoto C. Ware C.F. Malinin N.L. Wallach D.

For the detection of DR5, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed in non-reducing conditions, and the membranes were probed using biotin-conjugated goat anti-human DR5 pAb followed by HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The pEGFP-N1 vector was obtained from Clontech. The cDNA encoding the DD-deleted DR5 containing the wild-type NLS sequences was amplified by PCR using pMKITNeo-DR5 (3Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Eto H. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) as a template with the following primers: sense, 5′-AATCTCGAGATGGAACAACGGGGACAG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CGGAATTCGGGAGTCAAAGGGCACCAAGT-3′. This cDNA was designated wild-type NLS (WT-NLS). To eliminate the putative NLS in the DR5 sequence, R15K16R17 was mutated to AAA by using the oligonucleotide sequences 5′-TCGGGGGCCGCGGCAGCGCACGGCCCA-3′ and its reverse strand. This mutant was designated M1-NLS. A second NLS R322R323R324 sequence was mutated to AAA by using the oligonucleotide sequences 5′-AGGTCTCAGGCGGCGGCGCTGCTGGTTCCA-3′ and its reverse strand. This mutant was designated M2-NLS. PCR products were subcloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector, and the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with an ABI PRISM 3100 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). One day before transfection, 2 × 105 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate and then transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, the cells were cultured in selection medium containing 2 mg/ml G418, and GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACSCaliburTM (BD Biosciences). The detection of DR5 in tumor cell lines was achieved using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1A, HepG2 and HeLa cells expressed a moderate level of DR5, whereas DU145 cells expressed a high level of DR5 on their surface. After treatment with 70% ethanol, which permeabilized the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, an increase in DR5 was detected in HepG2 and HeLa cells but not in DU145 cells, suggesting that HepG2 and HeLa cells expressed intracellular DR5. To determine the intracellular localization of DR5 in these cells, we performed multicolor staining with anti-DR5 mAb, DAPI for nuclear staining, and WGA for staining the Golgi apparatus (22Kanazawa T. Takematsu H. Yamamoto A. Yamamoto H. Kozutsumi Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 215: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B), a large amount of DR5 was detected in the nuclei of both HepG2 and HeLa cells. In contrast, the DR5 in DU145 cells was mostly localized to the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm but was barely detectable in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). To confirm the presence of DR5 in the nucleus of HeLa cells, we performed Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions extracted from HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, DR5 was clearly detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells. DR4 is another death receptor that is engaged by TRAIL like DR5. We also investigated the expression and localization of DR4 in tumor cell lines. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, DU145 cells expressed a significant level of DR4 on the cell surface, but HepG2 and HeLa cells expressed only a low level of DR4. After the permeabilization of the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, the DR4 levels did not increase in any of the cell lines. Using confocal microscopy, DR4 was barely detectable on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm of HepG2 and HeLa cells, whereas DR4 was localized on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of DU145 cells (supplemental Fig. 2B). Nuclear DR4 was not detectable in any of the cell lines. We next investigated the sensitivity of these cell lines to TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 2A, DU145 cells were highly sensitive to TRAIL, and 25 ng/ml rTRAIL induced 80% cell death in 24 h. In contrast, the same doses of rTRAIL had no effect on cell death in HepG2 and HeLa cells. We confirmed that concentrations up to 625 ng/ml rTRAIL did not cause significant cell death in these cells even after 48 h (data not shown). These results suggest that tumor cells containing nuclear DR5 are resistant to TRAIL. To further substantiate the TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we performed Western blot analysis to estimate the cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3, which are required for the generation of active initiator and executioner caspases that induce apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2B, in DU145 cells, procaspase-8 was completely cleaved, a significant amount of procaspase-3 was cleaved following a 2-h incubation with 125 ng/ml rTRAIL, and new bands corresponding to cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3 were detected. After a 24-h incubation with rTRAIL, procaspase-8 was cleaved completely, and only a small amount of procaspase-3 remained. In contrast to DU145 cells, only small amounts of cleaved procaspase-8 and cleaved procaspase-3 were detected in HeLa cells that were incubated with rTRAIL for 2 h. After a 24-h incubation, there was no difference in the expression levels of procaspase-8 and procaspase-3 in the presence or absence of rTRAIL in HeLa cells. Collectively, these data indicate that tumor cells containing nuclear DR5 are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and tumor cells having no nuclear DR5 are responsive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The transport of proteins into the nucleus is generally mediated by importins via the recognition of NLS sequences. Analysis of the primary structure of human DR5 revealed two NLS-like sequences, RKR starting at amino acid 15 and RRR starting at amino acid 322 (Fig. 3A, hDR5). Therefore, we investigated the association of DR5 with importin β1, which is essential for the transport of various proteins into the nucleus regardless of the presence of importin α (18Sorokin A.V. Kim E.R. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 72: 1439-1457PubMed Google Scholar). Two-color immunostaining for DR5 and importin β1 showed that DR5 colocalized with importin β1 in the nucleus and in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). We next performed Western blot analysis to detect importin β1 in anti-DR5 immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells and DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, importin β1 was co-precipitated with DR5 from the HeLa cell lysate but not from the DU145 cell lysate. We also detected DR5 in anti-importin β1 immunoprecipitates from the HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 3D). The results suggest that DR5 was transported into the nucleus through its physical interaction with importin β1 in HeLa cells. To identify the functional NLS in human DR5, we generated two NLS mutants, M1-NLS and M2-NLS, by replacing basic amino acids with AAA (Fig. 3A). In these mutants and in the WT-NLS constructs, the death domain was replaced with GFP to avoid selective death of the transfected cells and to monitor the expression of the DR5-GFP fusion proteins directly (Fig. 3A). After transfection of the constructs in pEGFP-N1 vector into HeLa cells, stable transfectants were generated. As estimated by cell surface staining of intact cells with anti-DR5 mAb, the cell surface expression levels of M1-NLS and M2-NLS correlated with the expression level of the introduced DR5-GFP (Fig. 3E). In contrast, cell surface DR5 levels did not increase in the majority of the cells that expressed DR5-GFP with WT-NLS (Fig. 3, E and F). When compared with intact cells, the permeabilization of the plasma membrane and nuclear membrane with 70% ethanol increased anti-DR5 mAb staining in the WT-NLS cells but not in the M1-NLS or M2-NLS cells (Fig. 3, F and G). Moreover, confocal microscopy showed that the expression of DR5-GFP with WT-NLS was mainly localized in the nucleus, but the expression of DR5-GFP with the mutant M1-NLS or M2-NLS was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region corresponding to the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3H). These results indicate that both of the NLS-like sequences in human DR5 are required for the nuclear import. We next examined whether the localization of DR5 was affected by the knockdown of importin β1. When HeLa cells were transfected with importin β1 siRNA, importin β1 protein levels decreased substantially as estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Compared with the control siRNA-treated cells, which showed a prominent nuclear localization of DR5, confocal microscopy of the importin β1 siRNA-treated cells demonstrated the distinct localization of DR5 in the WGA+ Golgi apparatus, the cytoplasm, and at the cell surface but not in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with the translocation to STAT6, which is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through the importin β1 pathway after the stimulation with IL-4 (23Chen H.C. Reich N.C. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas histone H3, which is known to be imported to the nucleus by transportin, importin β, importin 5, and importin 7 (24Baake M. Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was localized in the nucleus following importin β1 knockdown (Fig. 4B). Moreover, knockdown of importin β1 reduced the level of DR5 protein in the nuclear fraction and increased the DR5 level in the cytoplasmic fraction as compared with the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4C). We also investigated whether importin β1 regulates the expression and localization of DR4 as well as DR5. By flow cytometric and confocal microscopic analyses, the expression level and localization of DR4 were not affected by importin β1 knockdown in HepG2, HeLa, or DU145 cells (supplemental Fig. 1, C, D, and E). The results indicate that the nuclear transport is unique to DR5 and is mediated by importin β1. We investigated whether the cell surface expression of DR5 increases following the knockdown of importin β1. Flow cytometric analysis of intact or permeabilized cells after anti-DR5 mAb staining showed that the cell surface expression levels of DR5 on intact cells increased significantly following transfection of importin β1 siRNA compared with control siRNA, whereas the total cellular DR5 expression levels in the permeabilized cells were not affected (Fig. 4, D and E). Finally, we examined whether the knockdown of importin β1 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to TRAIL. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that massive cell death was induced in the importin β1 siRNA-treated HeLa cells but not in the control siRNA-treated cells after a 24-h treatment with 25 ng/ml rTRAIL (Fig. 5A). WST assays showed that the sensitivity of HeLa cells to either 25 or 125 ng/ml rTRAIL increased following the transfection of importin β1 siRNA compared with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). We also examined the effect of importin β1 knockdown on TRAIL sensitivity in HepG2 and DU145 cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, A and B, TRAIL sensitivity of DU145 cells was not affected by the knockdown of importin β1. In contrast, the TRAIL sensitivity of HepG2 cells was greatly increased by the importin β1 knockdown. To confirm the induction of apoptosis by TRAIL following importin β1 knockdown, we performed Western blot analysis to estimate cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in whole cell lysates from HeLa cells. After the knockdown of importin β1, a large portion of the procaspase-8 and procaspase-3 proteins was cleaved, and the cleaved forms were clearly detected following a 4-h incubation with 125 ng/ml rTRAIL (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that the TRAIL-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation was enhanced by the importin β1 knockdown. Because DR4 expression was not affected by importin β1 knockdown (supplemental Fig. 1C), it is possible that the increase in TRAIL sensitivity of HeLa and HepG2 cells was caused by the augmentation of DR5-mediated apoptosis. To confirm this possibility, we finally examined whether the addition of anti-DR5 mAb inhibits the increase in TRAIL sensitivity of HeLa cells. As expected, the increased sensitivity of importin β1 siRNA-treated cells to TRAIL was completely abolished by the addition of an anti-DR5 blocking antibody (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that the knockdown of importin β1"
https://openalex.org/W2050154441,"We developed a clonal WI-38hTERT/GFP-RAF1-ER immortal cell line to study RAF-induced senescence of human fibroblasts. Activation of the GFP-RAF1-ER kinase by addition of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen led to a robust induction of senescence within one population doubling, accompanied by the assembly of heterochromatic foci. At least two pathways contribute in parallel to this senescence leading to the accumulation of p15, p16, p21 and p27 inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CKIs). Cells that traversed S phase after RAF1 kinase activation experienced a replicative stress manifested by phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2 and synthesis of p21. However, about half the cells in the population were blocked without passing through S phase and did not show activation of DNA-damage checkpoints. When the cells were cultivated in 5% oxygen, RAF1 activation generated minimal reactive oxygen species, but RAF-induced senescence occurred efficiently in these conditions even in the presence of anti-oxidants or inhibitors of DNA checkpoint pathways. Despite the presence of heterochromatic foci, simultaneous knockdown of p16 and p21 with inactivation of the GFP-RAF1-ER kinase led to rapid reversion of the senescent state with the majority of cells becoming competent for long-term proliferation. These results demonstrate that replicative and oxidative stresses are not required for RAF-induced senescence, and this senescence is readily reversed upon loss of CKIs."
https://openalex.org/W2044375660,"Mass spectrometric analyses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from isogenic Escherichia coli strains with nonpolar mutations in the waa locus or overexpression of their cognate genes revealed that waaZ and waaS are the structural genes required for the incorporation of the third 3-deoxy-α-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) linked to Kdo disaccharide and rhamnose, respectively. The incorporation of rhamnose requires prior sequential incorporation of the Kdo trisaccharide. The minimal in vivo lipid A-anchored core structure Kdo(2)Hep(2)Hex(2)P(1) in the LPS from ΔwaaO (lacking α-1,3-glucosyltransferase) could incorporate Kdo(3)Rha, without the overexpression of the waaZ and waaS genes. Examination of LPS heterogeneity revealed overlapping control by RpoE σ factor, two-component systems (BasS/R and PhoB/R), and ppGpp. Deletion of RpoE-specific anti-σ factor rseA led to near-exclusive incorporation of glycoforms with the third Kdo linked to Kdo disaccharide. This was accompanied by concomitant incorporation of rhamnose, linked to either the terminal third Kdo or to the second Kdo, depending upon the presence or absence of phosphoethanolamine on the second Kdo with truncation of the outer core. This truncation in ΔrseA was ascribed to decreased levels of WaaR glycosyltransferase, which was restored to wild-type levels, including overall LPS composition, upon the introduction of rybB sRNA deletion. Thus, ΔwaaR contained LPS primarily with Kdo(3) without any requirement for lipid A modifications. Accumulation of a glycoform with Kdo(3) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose in lipid A in ΔrseA required ppGpp, being abolished in a Δ(ppGpp(0) rseA). Furthermore, Δ(waaZ lpxLMP) synthesizing tetraacylated lipid A exhibited synthetic lethality at 21-23°C pointing to the significance of the incorporation of the third Kdo."
https://openalex.org/W2073204547,"With the cost of DNA sequencing falling rapidly, sample preparation is becoming a bottleneck to surveying genetic variation across large populations or performing clinical diagnostics. Myllykangas et al. present an efficient approach for targeted sequencing in which genomic regions of interest are captured and sequenced inside a flow cell using a common oligonucleotide probe. We describe an approach for targeted genome resequencing, called oligonucleotide-selective sequencing (OS-Seq), in which we modify the immobilized lawn of oligonucleotide primers of a next-generation DNA sequencer to function as both a capture and sequencing substrate. We apply OS-Seq to resequence the exons of either 10 or 344 cancer genes from human DNA samples. In our assessment of capture performance, >87% of the captured sequence originated from the intended target region with sequencing coverage falling within a tenfold range for a majority of all targets. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) called from OS-Seq data agreed with >95% of variants obtained from whole-genome sequencing of the same individual. We also demonstrate mutation discovery from a colorectal cancer tumor sample matched with normal tissue. Overall, we show the robust performance and utility of OS-Seq for the resequencing analysis of human germline and cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2080537230,"The B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) is a member of the antiproliferative BTG gene family and a downstream target of p53. BTG3 also binds and inhibits E2F1. Although it connects functionally two major growth-regulatory pathways, the physiological role of BTG3 remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we present evidence that loss of BTG3 in normal cells induced cellular senescence, which was correlated with enhanced ERK-AP1 signaling and elevated expression of the histone H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3/KDM6B, leading to acute induction of p16(INK4a). Importantly, we also found that BTG3 expression is specifically downregulated in prostate cancer, thus providing a physiological link with human cancers. Our data suggest that BTG3 may have a fail-safe role against tumorigenic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2099697409,"Inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene causes both hereditary and sporadic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Although the best-characterized function of the VHL protein (pVHL) is regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα), pVHL also controls the development of pheochromocytoma through HIF-independent pathways by regulating JunB. However, it is largely unknown how these pathways contribute to the development and progression of ccRCC. In the present study, we confirmed that JunB was upregulated in VHL-defective ccRCC specimens by immunostaining. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of JunB in 786-O and A498 VHL null ccRCC cells suppressed their invasiveness. In addition, JunB knockdown significantly repressed tumor growth and microvessel density in xenograft tumor assays. Conversely, forced expression of wild-type, but not dimerization-defective, JunB in a VHL-restored 786-O subclone promoted invasion in vitro and tumor growth and vessel formation in vivo. Quantitative PCR array analysis revealed that JunB regulated multiple genes relating to tumor invasion and angiogenesis such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) in 786-O cells. JunB knockdown in these cells reduced the proteolytic activity of both MMPs in gelatin zymography and the amount of CCL2 in the culture supernatant. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP-2 or inhibition of CCL2 activity with a neutralizing antibody repressed xenograft tumor growth and angiogenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that JunB promotes tumor invasiveness and enhances angiogenesis in VHL-defective ccRCCs."

https://openalex.org/W1968717741,"Obesity-related cardiac lipid accumulation is associated with increased myocardial oxidative stress. The role of the antioxidant glutathione in cardiac lipotoxicity is unclear. Cystathionine β-synthase (Cbs) catalyzes the first step in the trans-sulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine, which is estimated to provide ∼50% of cysteine for hepatic glutathione biosynthesis. As cardiac glutathione is a reflection of the liver glutathione pool, we hypothesize that mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of Cbs (Cbs(+/-)) are more susceptible to obesity-related cardiolipotoxicity because of impaired liver glutathione synthesis. Cbs(+/+) and Cbs(+/-) mice were fed a high fat diet (60% energy) from weaning for 13 weeks to induce obesity and had similar increases in body weight and body fat. This was accompanied by increased hepatic triglyceride but no differences in hepatic glutathione levels compared with mice fed chow. However, Cbs(+/-) mice with diet-induced obesity had greater glucose intolerance and lower total and reduced glutathione levels in the heart, accompanied by lower plasma cysteine levels compared with Cbs(+/+) mice. Higher triglyceride concentrations, increased oxidative stress, and increased markers of apoptosis were also observed in heart from Cbs(+/-) mice with diet-induced obesity compared with Cbs(+/+) mice. This study suggests a novel role for Cbs in maintaining the cardiac glutathione pool and protecting against cardiac lipid accumulation and oxidative stress during diet-induced obesity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2052584349,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are growth factors that exert important functions in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. Till date, multiple human tumors have been reported to display a dysregulation of several members of the BMP pathway that is associated with enhanced malignant tumor growth and metastasis. BMPER (BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator) is a direct BMP modulator that is necessary for BMPs to exert their full-range signaling activity. Moreover, BMPER is expressed by endothelial cells and their progenitors, and has pro-angiogenic features in these cells. Here, we describe the expression of BMPER in human specimens of lung, colon and cervix carcinomas and cell lines derived from such carcinomas. In contrast to healthy tissues, BMPER is highly expressed upon malignant deterioration. Functionally, loss of BMPER in the lung tumor cell line A549 impairs proliferation, migration, invasion as well as tumor cell-induced endothelial cell sprout formation. In contrast, stimulation of A549 cells with exogenous BMPER had no further effect. We found that the BMPER effect may be transduced by regulation of the BMP target transcription factor inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 9 and 2. These facilitators of cell migration are downregulated when BMPER is absent. To prove the relevance of our in vitro results in vivo, we generated Lewis lung carcinoma cells with impaired BMPER expression and implanted them into the lungs of C57BL/6 mice. In this model, the absence of BMPER resulted in severely reduced tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, these data unequivocally demonstrate that the BMP modulator BMPER is highly expressed in malignant tumors and tumor growth is dependent on the presence of BMPER."
https://openalex.org/W2166521586,"Tubular atrophy predicts chronic kidney disease progression, and is caused by proximal tubular epithelial cellcaused by proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTC) apoptosis. The normally quiescent Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-1 (NHE1) defends against PTC apoptosis, and is regulated by PI(4,5)P(2) binding. Because of the vast array of plasma membrane lipids, we hypothesized that NHE1-mediated cell survival is dynamically regulated by multiple anionic inner leaflet phospholipids. In membrane overlay and surface plasmon resonance assays, the NHE1 C terminus bound phospholipids with low affinity and according to valence (PIP(3) > PIP(2) > PIP = PA > PS). NHE1-phosphoinositide binding was enhanced by acidic pH, and abolished by NHE1 Arg/Lys to Ala mutations within two juxtamembrane domains, consistent with electrostatic interactions. PI(4,5)P(2)-incorporated vesicles were distributed to apical and lateral PTC domains, increased NHE1-regulated Na(+)/H(+) exchange, and blunted apoptosis, whereas NHE1 activity was decreased in cells enriched with PI(3,4,5)P(3), which localized to basolateral membranes. Divergent PI(4,5)P(2) and PI(3,4,5)P(3) effects on NHE1-dependent Na(+)/H(+) exchange and apoptosis were confirmed by selective phosphoinositide sequestration with pleckstrin homology domain-containing phospholipase Cδ and Akt peptides, PI 3-kinase, and Akt inhibition in wild-type and NHE1-null PTCs. The results reveal an on-off switch model, whereby NHE1 toggles between weak interactions with PI(4,5)P(2) and PI(3,4,5)P(3). In response to apoptotic stress, NHE1 is stimulated by PI(4,5)P(2), which leads to PI 3-kinase activation, and PI(4,5)P(2) phosphorylation. The resulting PI(3,4,5)P(3) dually stimulates sustained, downstream Akt survival signaling, and dampens NHE1 activity through competitive inhibition and depletion of PI(4,5)P(2)."
https://openalex.org/W1984776559,"Somatotrophs produce growth hormone (GH) and are the most abundant secretory cells of the pituitary. Somatotrophs express the transcription factor Pit-1 and the dependence receptor RET, its co-receptor GFRa1 and ligand GDNF. Pit-1 is a transcription factor essential for somatotroph proliferation and differentiation and for GH expression. GDNF represses excess Pit-1 expression preventing excess GH. In the absence of GDNF, RET behaves as a dependence receptor, becomes intracellularly processed and induces strong Pit-1 expression leading to p53 accumulation and apoptosis. How accumulation of Pit-1 leads to p53 expression is unknown. We have unveiled the relationship of Pit-1 with the p19Arf gene. There is a parallel correlation of RET processing, Pit-1 increase and ARF protein and mRNA expression. Interfering the pathway with RET, Pit-1 or p19Arf siRNA blocked apoptosis. We have found a Pit-1 DNA-binding element within the ARF promoter. Pit-1 directly regulates the CDKN2A locus and binds to the p19Arft promoter inducing p19Arf gene expression. The Pit-1-binding element is conserved in rodents and humans. RET/Pit-1 induces p19Arf/p53 and apoptosis not only in a somatotroph cell line but also in primary cultures of pituitary somatotrophs, where ARF siRNA interference also blocks p53 and apoptosis. Analyses of the somatotrophs in whole pituitaries supported the above findings. Thus Pit-1, a differentiation factor, activates the oncogene-induced apoptosis (OIA) pathway as oncogenes exerting a tight control in somatotrophs to prevent the disease due to excess of GH (insulin-resistance, metabolic disease, acromegaly)."
https://openalex.org/W1985310751,"Molecular profiling has allowed a more precise classification of human cancers. With respect to breast cancer, this approach has been used to identify five subtypes; luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low. In addition, this approach can be used to determine the type of tumor represented by particular cell lines or transgenic animal models. Therefore, this approach was utilized to classify the mammary tumors that develop in MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice. It was determined that the primary mammary tumors, which develop due to elevated expression of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in mammary epithelial cells, most closely resemble murine tumors with basal-like or mixed gene expression profiles and with human basal-like breast cancers. Downregulation of IGF-IR transgene in MTB-IGFIR tumor-bearing mice leads to the regression of most of the tumors, followed by tumor reappearance in some of the mice. These tumors that reappear following IGF-IR transgene downregulation do not express the IGF-IR transgene and cluster with murine mammary tumors that express a mesenchymal gene expression profile and with human claudin-low breast cancers. Therefore, IGF-IR overexpression in murine mammary epithelial cells induces mammary tumors with primarily basal-like characteristics, whereas tumors that develop following IGF-IR downregulation express a gene signature that most closely resembles human claudin-low breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2023942443,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) regulate cell growth, proliferation and survival, and are frequently affected in human cancer. PI3K is composed of a catalytic subunit, p110, and a regulatory subunit, p85. The PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ is encoded by PIK3CD and contains p85- and RAS-binding domains, and a kinase domain. Here we present an alternatively spliced PIK3CD transcript encoding a previously unknown protein, p37δ, and demonstrate that this protein is expressed in human ovarian and colorectal tumors. p37δ retains the p85-binding domain and a fraction of the RAS-binding domain, lacks the catalytic domain, and has a unique carboxyl-terminal region. In contrast to p110δ, which stabilizes p85, p37δ promoted p85 sequestering. Despite the truncated RAS-binding domain, p37δ bound to RAS and we found a strong positive correlation between the protein levels of p37δ and RAS. Overexpressing p37δ, but not p110δ, increased the proliferation and invasive properties of HEK-293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cells overexpressing p37δ showed a quicker phosphorylation response of AKT and ERK1/2 following serum stimulation. Ubiquitous expression of human p37δ in the fruit fly increased body size, DNA content and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Thus, p37δ appears to be a new tumor-specific isoform of p110δ with growth-promoting properties."
https://openalex.org/W2058720888,"Tumor protein (TP)-p53 family members often play proapoptotic roles, whereas nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) functions as a proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulator depending on the cellular environment. We previously showed that the NF-κB activation leads to the reduction of the TP63 isoform, ΔNp63α, thereby rendering the cells susceptible to cell death upon DNA damage. However, the functional relationship between TP63 isotypes and NF-κB is poorly understood. Here, we report that the TAp63 regulates NF-κB transcription and protein stability subsequently leading to the cell death phenotype. We found that TAp63α induced the expression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (RELA) and target genes involved in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, thereby triggering cell death pathways in MCF10A cells. RELA was shown to concomitantly modulate specific cell survival pathways, making it indispensable for the TAp63α-dependent regulation of cell death. We showed that TAp63α and RELA formed protein complexes resulted in their mutual stabilization and inhibition of the RELA ubiquitination. Finally, we showed that TAp63α directly induced RelA transcription by binding to and activating of its promoter and, in turn, leading to activation of the NF-κB-dependent cell death genes. Overall, our data defined the regulatory feedback loop between TAp63α and NF-κB involved in the activation of cell death process of cancer cells.

Finally, we showed that TAp63α directly induced RelA transcription by binding to and activating of its promoter and, in turn, leading to activation of the NF-κB-dependent cell death genes. Overall, our data defined the regulatory feedback loop between TAp63α and NF-κB involved in the activation of cell death process of cancer cells. TP53 members and NF-κB respond to a variety of intrinsic stresses, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, starvation, and cytokine activation (1Murray-Zmijewski F. Lane D.P. Bourdon J.C.

We and others previously showed that the NF-κB activation is a potential mechanism by which levels of ΔNp63α are reduced, thereby rendering the cells susceptible to cell death in the face of cellular stress (37King K.E.

Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar), the functional relationship between TAp63 isotypes and NF-κB is poorly understood. We showed that TAp63 and NF-κB form protein complexes and TAp63 regulates the NF-κB transcription and protein stability leading to a cell death phenotype. Dimethyl sulfoxide (D8418) and MG-132 (C2211) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), TRIzolTM reagent, PCR primers for RelA, Bcl-xL, Bad, c-Myc, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the mouse monoclonal antibodies against RELA (436700) were from Invitrogen. We used the caspase (CASP)-3 Assay fluorometric kit (QIA70-1KIT; Calbiochem) and the Ready-To-GlowTM NF-κB Secreted Luciferase Reporter system (631743; Clontech). We used mouse monoclonal antibodies against poly(ADP-ribosylating) enzyme (PARP, sc-8007), TP63 (4A4, sc-71828), and histone H1 (sc-56403), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against RELA (H-286, sc-7151), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We also used rabbit polyclonal antibodies to β-actin (AV40173) and FLAG (F7427), and mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (H3663), as well as a mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG, R3155) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. A goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (LS-C55866) was from Lifespan Biosciences. The monoclonal antibodies to CDKN1A (p21WAF1, 2947), p-S536-RELA (3033), and polyclonal antibodies to BBC3 (Bcl2-binding component or PUMA), the TP53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (4976), Bcl-xL (2762), and caspase (CASP)-3 (9662) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.

Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. MCF10A were maintained in 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium with reduced Ca2+ 0.04 mm, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 5% of Chelex-treated horse serum (all from Invitrogen), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml (95%) hydrocortisone (all from Sigma). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector or with the FLAG-tagged TAp63α, TAp63α, ΔNp63α, or RelA expression cassettes using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. We used human TAp63α small interfering (si)RNA (5′-GCACACAGACAAAUGAAUUUU-3′, Stealth RNAiTM siRNA, HSS112631; Invitrogen), and RelA SureSilencing shRNA plasmid (5′-CTCAGAGTTTCAGCAGCTC-3′, KH01812P, SABiosciences). To eliminate the off-target effect of RelA-shRNA, a shRNA-resistant construct, pEGFP-p65Res (42Wang J. Fu X.Q. Lei W.L. Wang T. Sheng A.L. Luo Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11104-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was used. Cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA or 1 μg of shRNA using Lipofectamine SiRNAMAX (Invitrogen) or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). Resulting cells were harvested 48 or 72 h after transfection. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described (38Chatterjee A. Chang X. Sen T. Ravi R. Bedi A. Sidransky D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Sen T. Chang X. Sidransky D. Chatterjee A. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4841-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TAp63α was amplified from its cDNA and subcloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-5.1 (E7901; Sigma) expression vector in front of the FLAG tag. Expression cassettes pCMV4-RelA, pCMV-HA-Ub, pBbc3-luc, and pCDKN1A-luc were purchased from Addgene (as deposited by Dr. Warner Greene, Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of California at San Francisco, Dr. Dirk. P. Bohmann, University of Rochester, NY, and Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The control (empty) TA-luc (LR0000) and RelA-luc (LR0051 and LR0052) reporter vectors were purchased from Panomics/Affymetrix. All clones were verified by sequencing. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF), supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15min, the supernatant (total lysate) was harvested. Protein concentration was determined by Lowry-based DC Protein Assay kit (500-0112; Bio-Rad). 30 μg of protein mixed with Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was run on 4–12% NuPAGE, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and bands were stained with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells transfected with various constructs for 48 h were lysed using a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with primary antibody or affinity matrix. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 4h at 4 °C, and the nonspecific bound proteins were washed with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C. Beads in Laemmli buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The empty pCMV vector, pCMV-TAp63α-FLAG construct, or siRNAs were introduced into MCF10A cells. A ChIP kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) along with the TP63 (4A4) antibody was used for ChIP, as described (32Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S.

The following primers were used: for the specific region, sense (−1900) 5′-CCCATCTCTATTTACAATAA-3′ (−1881), and antisense (−1570) 5′-CCGTGTCTCAAAAAATAAAT-3′ (−1551); for the nonspecific region, sense (−600) 5′-CCACAGCCGCATCTAGATTG-3′ (−581), and antisense (−370) 5′-GATCGGCGGGAGGGGGCCCT-3′ (−351) giving rise to the 350-bp and 250-bp PCR fragments, respectively. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using qScriptTM cDNA SuperMix kit (Quanta Biosciences). Each semi-qRT-PCR was performed for 25 or 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Quantitation of the PCR product was performed after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Cellular viability was monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay kit (MTT; ATCC). Briefly, 104 cells/well in 96-well plates were cultured in 5% FBS for 24h. 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent (5 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium without FBS, and the mix was then incubated in the dark for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of an SDS-based detergent reagent, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and measurements (A570 nm to A650 nm) were obtained on a Spectra Max 250 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each assay was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Diagrams indicated the extent of cell viability expressed as a percentage of control. MCF10A cells were co-transfected with the pCMV-HA-Ub and pCMV4-RelA expression cassettes along with an empty vector, pCMV-TAp63α-FLAG plasmid or TAp63α siRNA. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 25 μm MG-132 and lysed in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Ubiquitinated proteins were recovered with the red anti-HA affinity gel (E6779; Sigma) and analyzed with the anti-RELA antibody. MCF10A and H1299 cells were transfected with the pCMV-TAp63α-FLAG or control vector using FuGENE HD in the presence or absence of the pRelA-MetLuc2 reporter vector or pMetLuc2 control vector, and after 24–48 h, the RelA promoter-driven luciferase activity was determined by a Ready-To-Glow pNF-κB MetLuc luciferase reporter system (Clontech). Each transfection was performed in duplicate at least three times. 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to MCF10A cells 24 h after transfection with the indicated combination of plasmids. Protein levels were monitored at the indicated time points. To confirm equal loading, the membrane was reprobed with the β-actin antibody. MCF10A cells were transiently transfected with the Bbc3-luc and pCDKN1A-luc reporter plasmids along with 500 ng of the pCMV-TAp63α expression plasmid (where indicated) in the presence or absence of the 1.0 μg pCMV4-RelA expression plasmid and the empty pGL3-Basic vector. For the NF-κB luciferase assay, MCF10A cells were transiently transfected with the RelA luciferase reporter plasmids along with the 500 ng of pCMV-TAp63α expression plasmid in the presence or absence of the 1.0 μg of pCMV4-RelA expression plasmid and the TA-luc empty vector. Transfection efficiency was determined by the Renilla luciferase gene-containing pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (5× PLBR; Promega) with gentle shaking at room temperature for 20 min, and then total lysates were spun down at 13,000 rpm for 2 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, and the Dual luciferase activity in 2 μl (2 μg) of the cell lysates was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was monitored by a luminometer programmed as described elsewhere (38Chatterjee A. Chang X. Sen T. Ravi R. Bedi A. Sidransky D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Sen T. Chang X. Sidransky D. Chatterjee A. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4841-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After stopping the firefly luciferase activity, the Renilla luciferase activity was then measured. Each experiment was repeated at three times with duplicate transfections. Data represent mean ± S.D. from independent experiments, and statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test at a significance level of p < 0.05 to < 0.001. TP63 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. We and others recently showed that NF-κB regulates ΔNp63α and TAp63α functions in cellular response to external stimuli (38Chatterjee A. Chang X. Sen T. Ravi R. Bedi A. Sidransky D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Sen T. Chang X. Sidransky D. Chatterjee A. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4841-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Wu J. Bergholz J. Lu J. Sonenshein G.E. Xiao Z.X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar). Because both TAp63α and NF-κB have been implicated in regulation of cell proliferation/differentiation, cell death/survival, we focused our studies on whether TAp63α plays a role in regulating NF-κB expression. We initially examined how the TAp63α forced expression affects the RELA endogenous expression in MCF10A cells and H1299 cells (Fig. 1). We found that the RELA protein levels markedly increased by the ectopic TAp63α (0–1.5 μg) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and C). We further showed that TAp63α induced levels of CDKN1A and BBC3 proteins (Fig. 1, A and C), and subsequently increased cell death, as observed by the CASP3 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1, A and C), and MTT assay (Fig. 1, B and D). Because MCF10A expresses detectable levels of the endogenous TAp63α, we next transfected MCF10A cells with the scrambled siRNA or TAp63α siRNA and found that the RELA protein levels markedly decreased upon the TAp63α silencing (Fig. 1E), whereas no changes were found under control (scrambled) conditions. Similarly, the TAp63α knockdown exclusively decreased the CDKN1A and BBC3 protein levels (Fig. 1E) and dramatically inhibited the cell death, as observed by a reduced CASP3 and PARP cleavage and MTT assay (Fig. 1F). These findings suggested that TAp63α could regulate RELA expression. We next examined whether overexpression or down-regulation of RELA regulated CDKN1A, BBC3 protein levels, as well as cell survival. We showed that with the increased NF-κB expression (0–1.5 μg) up-regulated the TAp63α, CDKN1A, and BBC3 protein levels, increased the CASP3- and PARP-cleaved product levels (Fig. 2A), and markedly reduced the cell viability (Fig. 2B). At the same time, siRNA-mediated RELA knockdown decreased the TAp63α, CDKN1A, and BBC3 protein levels (Fig. 2C). To eliminate the off-target effect of RelA-shRNA, the shRNA-resistant pEGFP-p65Res construct (42Wang J. Fu X.Q. Lei W.L. Wang T. Sheng A.L. Luo Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11104-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was added to the cells (Fig. 2D). Expression of p65Res in the RelA knocked-down MCF10A cells exhibited a “rescue” effect on TAp63α, CDKN1A, and BBC3 protein levels (Fig. 2D). However, shRNA-mediated knockdown of RELA dramatically reduced the cell death, as observed by the decreased CASP3 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2C), or by cell viability assay (Fig. 2D), whereas co-transfection with the pEGFP-p65Res plasmid increased cell death (Fig. 2E). These data strongly suggest the specific effect of RelA down-regulation on TAp63α expression and cell death. To examine further the role for TAp63α/RelA axis in the cell death regulation, we transfected MCF10A cells with 20 nm TAp63α siRNA followed by increasing concentration of the ectopic RelA expression cassette (0–1.5 μg). In addition, we transfected MCF10A cells with 1 μg of RelA shRNA and then with the TAp63α expression cassette (0–1.5 μg). We found that the RELA up-regulation following the TAp63α down-regulation increased the CDKN1A, BBC3 protein levels, PARP cleavage, and induced cell death (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the TAp63α up-regulation following the RELA down-regulation failed to affect the CDKN1A, BBC3 protein levels, PARP cleavage, and cell death induction (Fig. 3, C and D). This observation suggests that TAp63α regulates cell viability of MCF10A cells through a RELA overexpression. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the TAp63α/NF-κB functional relationship, we transfected MCF10A cells with the TAp63α-FLAG expression cassette. We precipitated total lysates with an anti-FLAG antibody and probed TAp63α protein complexes with an antibody to RELA and vice versa. We showed that TAp63α and RELA, indeed, formed protein complexes in MCF10A cells (Fig. 4A). We previously reported that IKKβ promotes a proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α through a NF-κB-dependent pathway. Here, we further examined whether the physical interaction of TAp63α and RELA leads to a degradation of any of them. We transfected MCF10A cells with the scrambled siRNA and TAp63α siRNA and subsequently treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 or control medium. We found that the TAp63α down-regulation resulted in a decrease of the endogenous RELA, whereas the MG-132 treatment significantly restored the RELA levels (Fig. 4B), suggesting a proteasome-dependent mechanism for the RELA reduction induced by TAp63α knockdown. To assess directly the role for TAp63α in regulation of RELA protein stability, we analyzed the effect of the TAp63α forced expression on the RELA half-life in MCF10A cells. Cells were co-transfected with the RELA and TAp63α expression cassettes or with scrambled and TAp63α siRNAs for 24 h. Cells were further exposed to cycloheximide for an additional 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of RELA at serial time intervals showed that the overexpression of the exogenous TAp63α increased the RELA half-life, whereas the down-regulation of the endogenous TAp63α dramatically modulated the RELA half-life (Fig. 4, C–E), supporting the notion that TAp63α positively regulates the RELA half-life in MCF10A cells. Because TAp63α interacts with RELA and decreases its protein degradation, we further examined the role for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in this process (43Skaug B. Jiang X. Chen Z.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 769-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We transfected MCF10A cells with the RelA and HA-Ub expression cassettes along with the increasing concentrations of the TAp63α or its siRNA for 36 h, and then cells were treated with MG-132 for an additional 10 h. Total lysates were precipitated with anti-HA-matrix, and then HA-Ub protein complexes were probed with the RELA antibody. We showed that the TAp63α down-regulation elevated the ubiquitination of RELA protein, whereas TAp63α overexpression modulated RELA ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4F, lane 2 to lanes 3-5, or lanes 6–7), suggesting that TAp63α effectively suppressed the RELA ubiquitination. To exert its transcriptional activity, NF-κB is activated by phosphorylation and then translocates into the nucleus (29Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Wan F. Lenardo M.J. Cell Res. 2010; 20: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We showed that TAp63α overexpression led to an increasing Ser-536 phosphorylaton of RELA and subsequent translocation of activated RELA from cytoplasm to nucleus (Fig. 5A). Using semi-qRT-PCR we then found that TAp63α induction (0–1.5 μg) caused a significant increase in the RelA mRNA levels, and subsequently a dramatic increase in the levels of mRNAs (e.g. c-Myc, Bcl-xL and Bad"
https://openalex.org/W1969283911,The peptidyl transferase center of the domain V of large ribosomal RNA in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes acts as general protein folding modulator. We showed earlier that one part of the domain V (RNA1 containing the peptidyl transferase loop) binds unfolded protein and directs it to a folding competent state (FCS) that is released by the other part (RNA2) to attain the folded native state by itself. Here we show that the peptidyl transferase loop of the mitochondrial ribosome releases unfolded proteins in FCS extremely slowly despite its lack of the rRNA segment analogous to RNA2. The release of FCS can be hastened by the equivalent activity of RNA2 or the large subunit proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome. The RNA2 or large subunit proteins probably introduce some allosteric change in the peptidyl transferase loop to enable it to release proteins in FCS.
https://openalex.org/W2092206322,"Metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) is an essential protein required for mouse embryonic development. We report here the occurrence of sumoylation on MTF-1. Mutational studies demonstrated that sumoylation occurs on the lysine residue at position 627 (Lys(627)) of mouse MTF-1. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 was fused to the C terminus of MTF-1 to mimic the sumoylated form of the protein and it suppressed the transcriptional activity of MTF-1. The nuclear translocation activity, DNA-binding activity, and protein stability of SUMO-fused MTF-1 are similar to that of wild type MTF-1. The level of sumoylation was reduced by metal in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The fact that zinc reduces MTF-1 sumoylation makes the suppressive role of sumoylated MTF-1 in transcription physiologically less significant because the SUMO moiety of MTF-1 is removed when MTF-1 translocates into nucleus. We further identified a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) on MTF-1. Remarkably, MTF-1 binds sumoylated MTF-1 and/or other cellular factors in a SIM-dependent manner. This interaction was disrupted by treating cells with zinc. Gel permeation chromatography demonstrated that MTF-1 forms SIM-dependent complexes. This cross-interaction transpires in the cytoplasm and markedly reduces upon nuclear translocation. It can therefore be concluded that SUMO conjugation and the SIM on MTF-1 do not play a critical role in suppressing transcriptional activity. Instead, MTF-1 forms complexes with cellular factors through SIM and SUMO moiety in the cytoplasm. The result explores a new understanding for the mode of MTF-1 assembly and regulation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2150122914,"Normal human colonic epithelial cells (HCECs) are not immortalized by telomerase alone but also require CDK4. Some human cell types growth-arrest due to stress- or aberrant signaling-induced senescence (stasis). Stasis represents the consequences of growth conditions culture that are inadequate to maintain long-term proliferation. Overexpressed CDK4 titers out p16 and allows cells to ignore the growth arrest signals produced by stasis. To identify factors contributing to the inadequate culture environment, we used a 62,000-member shRNA library to knock down factors cooperating with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in the immortalization of HCECs. Knockdown of Klotho gamma (KLG; also known as KLPH and LCTL) allowed hTERT to immortalize HCECs. KLG is one isoform of the Klotho family of factors that coordinate interaction between different FGF ligands and the FGF receptor. We also found that knockdown of KLG induced another member of the Klotho family, Klotho beta (KLB). Induction of KLB was maintained and could activate ERK1/2 in immortalized cells. Supplementation of the culture medium with the KLB ligand FGF19 had a similar effect on hTERT-expressing HCECs as knockdown of KLG regarding both immortalization and down-regulation of the tumor suppressor Klotho alpha. Together, these data suggest that KLB is an important regulator in the immortalization of HCECs by facilitating FGF19 growth factor signaling."
