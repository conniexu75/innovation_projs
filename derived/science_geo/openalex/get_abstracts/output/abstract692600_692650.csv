https://openalex.org/W4225100118,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequent forms of cancer, and new strategies for its prevention and therapy are urgently needed1. Here we identify a metabolite signalling pathway that provides actionable insights towards this goal. We perform a dietary screen in autochthonous animal models of CRC and find that ketogenic diets exhibit a strong tumour-inhibitory effect. These properties of ketogenic diets are recapitulated by the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which reduces the proliferation of colonic crypt cells and potently suppresses intestinal tumour growth. We find that BHB acts through the surface receptor Hcar2 and induces the transcriptional regulator Hopx, thereby altering gene expression and inhibiting cell proliferation. Cancer organoid assays and single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with CRC provide evidence that elevated BHB levels and active HOPX are associated with reduced intestinal epithelial proliferation in humans. This study thus identifies a BHB-triggered pathway regulating intestinal tumorigenesis and indicates that oral or systemic interventions with a single metabolite may complement current prevention and treatment strategies for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W4225005440,"COVID-19 accelerated a decade-long shift to remote work by normalizing working from home on a large scale. Indeed, 75% of US employees in a 2021 survey reported a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week1, and studies estimate that 20% of US workdays will take place at home after the pandemic ends2. Here we examine how this shift away from in-person interaction affects innovation, which relies on collaborative idea generation as the foundation of commercial and scientific progress3. In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas. By contrast, when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that videoconferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups. Departing from previous theories that focus on how oral and written technologies limit the synchronicity and extent of information exchanged4-6, we find that our effects are driven by differences in the physical nature of videoconferencing and in-person interactions. Specifically, using eye-gaze and recall measures, as well as latent semantic analysis, we demonstrate that videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus. Our results suggest that virtual interaction comes with a cognitive cost for creative idea generation."
https://openalex.org/W4225088396,"The composition of the intestinal microbiome varies considerably between individuals and is correlated with health1. Understanding the extent to which, and how, host genetics contributes to this variation is essential yet has proved to be difficult, as few associations have been replicated, particularly in humans2. Here we study the effect of host genotype on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in a large mosaic pig population. We show that, under conditions of exacerbated genetic diversity and environmental uniformity, microbiota composition and the abundance of specific taxa are heritable. We map a quantitative trait locus affecting the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae species and show that it is caused by a 2.3 kb deletion in the gene encoding N-acetyl-galactosaminyl-transferase that underpins the ABO blood group in humans. We show that this deletion is a ≥3.5-million-year-old trans-species polymorphism under balancing selection. We demonstrate that it decreases the concentrations of N-acetyl-galactosamine in the gut, and thereby reduces the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae that can import and catabolize N-acetyl-galactosamine. Our results provide very strong evidence for an effect of the host genotype on the abundance of specific bacteria in the intestine combined with insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin this association. Our data pave the way towards identifying the same effect in rural human populations."
https://openalex.org/W4225106338,"Global photosynthesis consumes ten times more CO2 than net anthropogenic emissions, and microalgae account for nearly half of this consumption1. The high efficiency of algal photosynthesis relies on a mechanism concentrating CO2 (CCM) at the catalytic site of the carboxylating enzyme RuBisCO, which enhances CO2 fixation2. Although many cellular components involved in the transport and sequestration of inorganic carbon have been identified3,4, how microalgae supply energy to concentrate CO2 against a thermodynamic gradient remains unknown4-6. Here we show that in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the combined action of cyclic electron flow and O2 photoreduction-which depend on PGRL1 and flavodiiron proteins, respectively-generate a low luminal pH that is essential for CCM function. We suggest that luminal protons are used downstream of thylakoid bestrophin-like transporters, probably for the conversion of bicarbonate to CO2. We further establish that an electron flow from chloroplast to mitochondria contributes to energizing non-thylakoid inorganic carbon transporters, probably by supplying ATP. We propose an integrated view of the network supplying energy to the CCM, and describe how algal cells distribute energy from photosynthesis to power different CCM processes. These results suggest a route for the transfer of a functional algal CCM to plants to improve crop productivity."

https://openalex.org/W4226474215,"Mobile sensing data processed using machine learning models can passively and remotely assess mental health symptoms from the context of patients' lives. Prior work has trained models using data from single longitudinal studies, collected from demographically homogeneous populations, over short time periods, using a single data collection platform or mobile application. The generalizability of model performance across studies has not been assessed. This study presents a first analysis to understand if models trained using combined longitudinal study data to predict mental health symptoms generalize across current publicly available data. We combined data from the CrossCheck (individuals living with schizophrenia) and StudentLife (university students) studies. In addition to assessing generalizability, we explored if personalizing models to align mobile sensing data, and oversampling less-represented severe symptoms, improved model performance. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) results were reported. Two symptoms (sleep quality and stress) had similar question-response structures across studies and were used as outcomes to explore cross-dataset prediction. Models trained with combined data were more likely to be predictive (significant improvement over predicting training data mean) than models trained with single-study data. Expected model performance improved if the distance between training and validation feature distributions decreased using combined versus single-study data. Personalization aligned each LOSO-CV participant with training data, but only improved predicting CrossCheck stress. Oversampling significantly improved severe symptom classification sensitivity and positive predictive value, but decreased model specificity. Taken together, these results show that machine learning models trained on combined longitudinal study data may generalize across heterogeneous datasets. We encourage researchers to disseminate collected de-identified mobile sensing and mental health symptom data, and further standardize data types collected across studies to enable better assessment of model generalizability."
https://openalex.org/W4226042875,"The world production of plastic exceeded 360 million tonnes in 2020 alone, a considerable amount of which is not properly disposed of. The significant pressures and damages posed by conventional plastic to human and environmental health suggest that alternatives are urgently needed. One of them is “bioplastic”, which is defined as bio-based plastic that is (or not) biodegradable. This paper reports on a study on the perceptions of bioplastics among consumers in 42 countries to identify their levels of information and concerns. The results suggest that most respondents have positive expectations regarding the future of bioplastics to replace conventional plastics fully or partially, especially for food containers, kitchenware, and boxes and bags for packaging. They also reported that the low costs and increased availability of bioplastic products on the market are likely to be the main drivers for their wide-scale adoption. However, many participants are unsure whether they would buy bio-based and biodegradable products if they are expensive. Overall, whereas a rather positive attitude to bioplastics has been identified, greater efforts are needed to address the many information needs of consumers towards upscaling the adoption of bioplastics. Relevant policies are therefore needed to encourage investments in the large-scale manufacture and market uptake of bioplastics. The paper reports on an initial study of consumer behavior, in a sample of countries spread across all geographical regions."
https://openalex.org/W4225815955,"Increasing evidence has shown that the Covid-19 outbreak, and subsequent school closures and exam cancellations that followed, has impacted adolescent mental health. The current cross-sectional study examined rates of depression, anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms about Covid-19 in adolescents and whether current or past mental health support, additional support in school, keyworker status, poorer household relationships since the outbreak of Covid-19 or reduced physical activity were associated with elevated levels of depression, anxiety or PTSD-like symptoms. Lastly, it examined perceived changes in mental health due to the Covid-19 pandemic, school closures and the cancellation of exams. A total of 899 adolescents (14–18 years) took part in the ’in isolation instead of in school’ (INISS) project. Findings indicated that older adolescents, females, those who currently or previously received mental health support or additional support in school and adolescents who reported poorer relationships at home since Covid-19 were more likely to meet clinical threshold levels for their mental health. Adolescents highlighted worsening of their mental health due to Covid-19 and school closures with mixed positive and negative impact of exam cancellations. Adolescents experiencing clinical threshold levels of depression and anxiety uniquely reported worsening of their mental health since the Covid-19 pandemic, school closures and exam cancellations. Understanding the rates, perceptions and factors associated with increases in depression, anxiety and PTSD-like symptoms in adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic will inform national policy in supporting adolescent mental health and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4226280486,"Introduction Reduced rates of help seeking by those who self-harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported. Objectives To understand changes in healthcare service contacts for self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic across primary, emergency and secondary care. Methods This retrospective cohort study used routine electronic healthcare data for Wales, United Kingdom, from 2016 to March 14, 2021. Population-based data from primary care, emergency departments and hospital admissions were linked at individual-level. All Welsh residents aged ≥10 years over the study period were included in the study. Primary, emergency and secondary care contacts with self-harm at any time between 2016 and March 14, 2021 were identified. Outcomes were counts, incidence, prevalence and proportion of self-harm contacts relative to all contacts in each and all settings, as well as the proportion of people contacting one or more settings with self-harm. Weekly trends were modelled using generalised estimated equations, with differences between 2020 (to March 2021) and comparison years 2016–2018 (to March 2017–2019) quantified using difference in differences, from which mean rate of odds ratios (μROR) across years was reported. Results The study included 3,552,210 individuals over the study period. Self-harm contacts reduced across services in March and December 2020 compared to previous years. Primary care contacts with self-harm reduced disproportionately compared to non-self-harm contacts (μROR = 0.7, p&lt;0.05), while their proportion increased in emergency departments during April 2020 (μROR = 1.3, p&lt;0.05 in 2/3 comparison years) and hospital admissions during April-May 2020 (μROR = 1.2, p&lt;0.05 in 2/3 comparison years). Despite this, those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in primary care than other settings compared to previous years (μROR = 1.2, p&lt;0.05). A lower proportion of those with self-harm contacts in emergency departments were subsequently admitted to hospital in December 2020 compared to previous years (μROR = 0.5, p&lt;0.05). Conclusions These findings suggest that those who self-harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been less likely to seek help, and those who did so faced more stringent criteria for admission. Communications encouraging those who self-harm to seek help during pandemics may be beneficial. However, this needs to be supported by maintained provision of mental health services."
https://openalex.org/W4225743871,"In hospitals, patient falls prevention education is frequently delivered by nurses and allied health professionals. Hospital falls rates remain high globally, despite the many systems and approaches that attempt to mitigate falling. The aim of this study was to investigate health professional views on the enablers and barriers to providing patient falls education in hospitals. Four focus groups with 23 nursing and allied health professionals were conducted at 3 hospitals. Three researchers independently coded the data and findings were analysed thematically with a descriptive qualitative approach to identify and develop themes according to barriers and enablers. Barriers included (i) limited interprofessional communication about patient falls; (ii) sub-optimal systems for falls education for patients and health professionals, and (iii) perceived patient-related barriers to falls education. Enablers to providing patient falls education included: (i) implementing strategies to increase patient empowerment; (ii) ensuring that health professionals had access to effective modes of patient education; and (iii) facilitating interprofessional collaboration. Health professionals identified the need to overcome organisational, patient and clinician-related barriers to falls education. Fostering collective responsibility amongst health professionals for evidence-based falls prevention was also highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W4226181463,"It has been shown that small intestine development in low birth weight (LBW) piglets is impaired. Glutamine (Gln) has been reported to improve piglet health and intestinal function in weaned piglets, but data is scarce in suckling piglets. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of oral Gln supplementation compared to Alanine (Ala) on jejunal development and function in 5 and 12 d old male LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) suckling piglets.Gln had no effect on the jejunal morphology, development, tissue and digesta amino acid profiles and mRNA abundance of genes involved in amino acid transport, metabolism, glutathione synthesis in LBW piglets when compared to Ala supplementation and birth weight controls at 5 and 12 d. Only the concentration of Gln in jejunal tissue was higher in NBW piglets supplemented with Gln compared to Ala at 5 d (P < 0.05). A comparison of the birth weight groups showed no differences between LBW and NBW piglets at 5 and 12 d in any parameter. Jejunal crypt depth, villus height / width, tunica muscularis thickness, number of goblet and IgA positive cells, the ratio of jejunal RNA to DNA and the concentration of DNA, protein and RNA changed (P < 0.05) from 5 compared to 12 d. The concentrations of several free, and protein bound amino acids as well as amino metabolites differed between age groups in jejunal tissue but the digesta concentrations were affected to a lesser extent.Oral Gln supplementation to suckling male piglets over the first 12 d of life was not associated with changes in jejunal parameters measured in this study. The absence of effects may indicate that Gln is absorbed as well as metabolized in the upper intestinal tract and thus could benefit intestinal development at a more proximal location."
https://openalex.org/W4226201199,"Background Breastfeeding is the process of feeding a newborn with the mother’s milk, and it is very important for enhancing child and maternal health. The proportion and duration of breastfeeding may vary by location, and is poorly practiced for cultural, economic, and societal reasons. Thus, this study was conducted to determine breastfeeding practices and determinants of exclusive breastfeeding among mothers of six month aged infants in the Horro district, Ethiopia. Methods We used a community-based cross-sectional study among 649 mothers of index infants. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select the women. Data were collected from March 15 to April 5, 2020. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data using a semi-structured questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to examine the factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Results All women who participated in the study have ever breastfed their children at some point. Exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding initiation were found to be good (70.4% and 61.8%, respectively) within 24 hours prior to the survey time. Having had information about breastfeeding during antenatal care (AOR = 4.15, 95% CI = 2.36, 7.30), postnatal care follow-up (AOR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.92, 7.70), having infant aged 0-1month (AOR = 12.14, 95% CI = 3.83, 38.46) and 2–3 month (AOR = 8.62, 95% CI = 5.00, 14.85), being a single birth (AOR = 12.91, 95% CI = 3.86, 43.21), having monthly income of ≤ 100 Ethiopian Birrs (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.16, 3.32), and breastfeeding initiation within one hour of birth (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.13, 3.35) were found to be a significantly associated factors of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion Despite meeting the global nutrition target of 2025, the practice of exclusive breastfeeding was lower than the WHO recommendations. Providing education about breastfeeding during antenatal care follow-up and increasing access to postnatal care follow-up is recommended to enhance exclusive breastfeeding practices in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W4226464627,"The matricellular protein CCN5 exerts anti-fibrotic activity in hearts partly by inducing reverse trans-differentiation of myofibroblasts (MyoFBs) to fibroblasts (FBs). CCN5 consists of three structural domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP), a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC), and a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1). In this study, we set out to elucidate the roles of these domains in the context of the reverse trans-differentiation of MyoFBs to FBs. First, human cardiac FBs were trans-differentiated to MyoFBs by treatment with TGF-β; this was then reversed by treatment with recombinant human CCN5 protein or various recombinant proteins comprising individual or paired CCN5 domains. Subcellular localization of these recombinant proteins was analyzed by immunocytochemistry, cellular fractionation, and western blotting. Anti-fibrotic activity was also evaluated by examining expression of MyoFB-specific markers, α-SMA and fibronectin. Our data show that CCN5 is taken up by FBs and MyoFBs mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is essential for the function of CCN5 during the reverse trans-differentiation of MyoFBs. Furthermore, we showed that the TSP-1 domain is essential and sufficient for endocytosis and nuclear localization of CCN5. However, the TSP-1 domain alone is not sufficient for the anti-fibrotic function of CCN5; either the IGFBP or VWC domain is needed in addition to the TSP-1 domain."

https://openalex.org/W4225659838,"The current social context requires an increase in food production, improvement of its quality characteristics and greater environmental sustainability in the management of agricultural systems. Technological innovation plays a great role in making agriculture more efficient and sustainable. One of the main aims of precision farming (PF) is optimizing yield and its quality, while minimizing environmental impacts and improving the efficient use of resources. Variable rate techniques (VRT) are amongst the main management options for PF, and they require spatial information. This work incorporates maps of soil properties from low induction electromagnetic measurements into nitrogen (N) balance calculations for a field application of VRT nitrogen fertilization of (Triticum durum Desf., var. Tirex). The trial was conducted in 2018-19 at Genzano di Lucania (PZ, Italy) geologically located on the clayey hillsides of the Bradanica pit and the Sant'Arcangelo basin. Three soil homogeneous areas were detected through low induction electromagnetic measurements and used as uniform management zones. The amount of nitrogen fertilizer to be applied by VRT was calculated on the base of estimated crop nitrogen uptake and soil characteristics of each homogeneous area. Crop response to VRT was compared to uniform nitrogen application (UA) on the whole field. The application of VRT resulted in a reduction of 25% nitrogen fertilizer with the same level of yield respect to UA. Grain protein content, as well as gluten content and N content, were significantly higher in VRT than in UA. As a consequence of lower nitrogen input and higher levels of N removal, VRT reached a higher nitrogen use efficiency than UA, and this indicates a lower environmental impact and a higher economic profitability."
https://openalex.org/W4225846760,"This study determined the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 4964 individuals, comprising 300 coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) prepandemic serum samples, 142 COVID-19 patients, 2113 individuals at risk due to their occupations, 1856 individuals at risk due to sharing workplaces or communities with COVID-19 patients, and 553 Thai citizens returning after spending extended periods of time in countries with a high disease prevalence. We recruited participants between May 2020 and May 2021, which spanned the first two epidemic waves and part of the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand. Their sera were tested in a microneutralization and a chemiluminescence immunoassay for IgG against the N protein. Furthermore, we performed an immunofluorescence assay to resolve discordant results between the two assays. None of the prepandemic sera contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while antibodies developed in 88% (15 of 17) of the COVID-19 patients at 8–14 days and in 94–100% of the patients between 15 and 60 days after disease onset. Neutralizing antibodies persisted for at least 8 months, longer than IgG antibodies. Of the 2113 individuals at risk due to their occupation, none of the health providers, airport officers, or public transport drivers were seropositive, while antibodies were present in 0.44% of entertainment workers. Among the 1856 individuals at risk due to sharing workplaces or communities with COVID-19 patients, seropositivity was present in 1.9, 1.5, and 7.5% of the Bangkok residents during the three epidemic waves, respectively, and in 1.3% of the Chiang Mai people during the first epidemic wave. The antibody prevalence varied between 6.5 and 47.0% in 553 Thai people returning from high-risk countries. This serosurveillance study found a low infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Thailand before the emergence of the Delta variant in late May 2021. The findings support the Ministry of Public Health’s data, which are based on numbers of patients and contact tracing."
https://openalex.org/W4226092077,"Objectives We sought to examine healthcare workers (HCWs) utilisation of formal and informal psychological support resources in the workplace during the first and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. Methods A convergent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Four hundred and thirty HCWs in the Mid West and South of Ireland responded to an online survey in terms of their use of psychological support resources during Wave 1 (April/May 2020) of COVID-19. Thirty-nine HCWs undertook in depth interviews at Wave 3 (January/February 2021), and a further quantitative survey was distributed and completed by 278 HCWs at this time. Quantitative data arising at Wave 1 and Wave 3, were synthesised with Qualitative data collected at Wave 3. A Pillar Integration Process (PIP) was utilised in the analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data. Results Five pillars were identified from the integration of results. These were: a) the primacy of peer support, b) the importance of psychologically informed management, c) a need to develop the organisational well-being ethos, d) support for all HCWs, and e) HCWs ideas for developing the well-being path. These pillars encapsulated a strong emphasis on collegial support, an emphasis on the need to support managers, a questioning of the current supports provided within the healthcare organisations and critical reflections on what HCWs viewed as most helpful for their future support needs. Conclusions HCWs who utilised supportive resources indicated ‘in house’ supports, primarily collegial resources, were the most frequently used and perceived as most helpful. While formal psychological supports were important, the mechanism by which such psychological support is made available, through utilising peer support structures and moving towards psychologically informed supervisors and workplaces is likely to be more sustainable and perceived more positively by HCWs."
https://openalex.org/W4226241153,"Background Obesity is associated with cardiovascular diseases and is a risk factor for all-cause mortality. Until now, the associations between abdominal obesity and mortality or cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence have not been conclusive. We aimed to evaluate the associations between waist circumference (WC) and mortality or CVD incidence in a general Korean population. Methods We analyzed a total of 204,068 adults older than 40 years of age who had undergone a national health examination at least once from 2009 to 2018 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service Cohort. WC was divided into five categories (&lt; 80, 80–84.9, 85–89.9, 90–94.9, ≥ 95 cm). Hazard ratios for death and CVD incidence were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results In men, WC and overall mortality showed a reverse J-shaped association. In women, the association between WC and overall mortality was not significant. For both men and women, WC was not associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Contrary to the mortality trend, CVD incidence was positively associated with WC in both men and women, and the risk of the CVD incidence was the lowest in subjects with a WC &lt; 80 cm. Conclusions WC exhibited a significant J-shaped association with overall mortality in men, where subjects who had central obesity showed a lower rate of mortality than those in the lowest or highest WC group. The risk of incident CVD showed a positive association with central obesity, where the lowest risk was observed for subjects in the lowest WC group in a general Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W4226301640,"To assess the levels of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction among mental healthcare professionals in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia.A cross-sectional study was conducted on mental healthcare professionals in Jeddah between January 2017 and October 2018. Sociodemographic characteristics and levels of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and Job Satisfaction Scale (JSS). Descriptive statistics were used. Independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to assess for effects of demographic variables on the perceived stress score, emotional exhaustion (EE) score, depersonalization (DP) score, professional accomplishment (PA) score, and the job satisfaction score (JSS).A total of 107 participants were included (50.5% men; 49.5% women) with response rate of 79.2%. Prevalence of stress was 56.1%. High levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were present among 41 (38.3%) and 26 (24.3%) of the respondents, respectively, while high score of low personal accomplishment were present among 61 (57%) respondents. In terms of job satisfaction, 25 (23.4%) were satisfied and 74 (69.2%) were indecisive. Male participants' emotional exhaustion score (27±12) was significantly higher than females (22 ±10), (t(105) = 1.99, p-value = 0.049). Also, participants with a monthly income above SR 20,000 had significantly higher total job satisfaction (p-value = 0.041).Our findings suggest rates of stress and burnout among mental health professionals that warrant attention, with less than one-quarter of the participants being satisfied with their jobs. Further studies are needed to expand the findings and to explore the contributing factors. Additionally, interventions should be established by authorities to address the increasing rates of stress and burnout."
https://openalex.org/W4226328647,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently deregulated in various types of cancer. While antisense oligonucleotides are used to block oncomiRs, delivery of tumour-suppressive miRNAs holds great potential as a potent anti-cancer strategy. Here, we aim to determine, and functionally analyse, miRNAs that are lowly expressed in various types of tumour but abundantly expressed in multiple normal tissues.The miRNA sequencing data of 14 cancer types were downloaded from the TCGA dataset. Significant differences in miRNA expression between tumor and normal samples were calculated using limma package (R programming). An adjusted p value < 0.05 was used to compare normal versus tumor miRNA expression profiles. The predicted gene targets were obtained using TargetScan, miRanda, and miRDB and then subjected to gene ontology analysis using Enrichr. Only GO terms with an adjusted p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data from wet-lab experiments (cell viability assays and flow cytometry) were expressed as means ± SEM, and their differences were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (Student's t test, p < 0.05).By compiling all publicly available miRNA profiling data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Project, we reveal a small set of tumour-suppressing miRNAs (which we designate as 'normomiRs') that are highly expressed in 14 types of normal tissues but poorly expressed in corresponding tumour tissues. Interestingly, muscle-enriched miRNAs (e.g. miR-133a/b and miR-206) and miRNAs from DLK1-DIO3 locus (e.g. miR-381 and miR-411) constitute a large fraction of the normomiRs. Moreover, we define that the CCCGU motif is absent in the oncomiRs' seed sequences but present in a fraction of tumour-suppressive miRNAs. Finally, the gain of function of candidate normomiRs across several cancer cell types indicates that miR-206 and miR-381 exert the most potent inhibition on multiple cancer types in vitro.Our results reveal a pan-cancer set of tumour-suppressing miRNAs and highlight the potential of miRNA-replacement therapies for targeting multiple types of tumour."
https://openalex.org/W4226451593,"Veterinary medicine uses antibiotics randomly for treatment and growth promotion. Milk of dairy animals contains substantial quantities of antibiotics that have harmful effects on health. It is therefore necessary to test commercially available milk using immunological, chromatographic, or microbiological methods to confirm the absence of antibiotic residues. This study aims to perform a microbiological test, followed by a quantitative confirmation analysis, on raw milk to assess the presence of antibiotic residues. Tests were conducted on 200 milk samples collected from markets and farms in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The microbial inhibitor test (Delvotest SP-NT) revealed that 40 samples were positive for antibiotic residues. The positive samples were further tested using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a confirmatory quantitative test for 29 antibiotics that belong to five groups: tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and lactamases. Only four samples tested positive for oxytetracycline residues above the maximum residue limit. Based on these results, researchers suggest a monitoring system that considers both microbial and HPLC-MS/MS methods when detecting antibiotic residues in bovine milk. The analysis of risk to human health revealed that antibiotic residues at the detected levels do not pose any health risks to consumers."
https://openalex.org/W4226061464,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains the leading cause for blindness in children. Limited hyperoxia induced proliferative retinopathy (L-HIPR) was recently introduced as a potential animal model for ROP and persistent fetal vasculature; however, the detailed pathological changes remain unclear.To model L-HIPR, we placed C57BL/6J mice in 65% oxygen from birth to post-natal day 7 (P7). We examined eyes at intervals between P12 and P30. Retinal morphometry, thickness, and preretinal fibrosis were quantified at different time points on histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson Trichrome, respectively. Vascular development, angiogenesis, inflammation, and pericyte coverage were analyzed using immunohistochemistry staining in retinal flat mounts and cross sections.In L-HIPR, the hyaloidal vessels persisted until the latest time point in this study, P30 and began to invaginate the peripheral then central retina starting at P12. Central retinal distortion was noted beginning at P17, while the peripheral retina demonstrated a trend of thinning from P12 to P30. We found that L-HIPR was associated with delayed and abnormal retinal vascular development with subsequent retinal inflammation, pericyte loss and preretinal fibrosis.Our study presents a detailed analysis of the L-HIPR animal model demonstrating vitreoretinal pathologic changes, preretinal fibrosis and persistent hyaloidal vessels into adulthood. Based on our findings, we suggest that the persistence and peculiar stepwise migration of the hyaloidal vessels into the retina may provide a potential rescue mechanism for inner retinal development that deserves further study."
https://openalex.org/W4226091812,"The Neolithic and Bronze Age construction and habitation of the Stonehenge Landscape has been extensively explored in previous research. However, little is known about the scale of pre-Neolithic activity and the extent to which the later monumental complex occupied an 'empty' landscape. There has been a long-running debate as to whether the monumental archaeology of Stonehenge was created in an uninhabited forested landscape or whether it was constructed in an already partly open area of pre-existing significance to late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. This is of significance to a global discussion about the relationship between incoming farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherer societies that is highly relevant to both Old and New World archaeology. Here we present the results of plant sedaDNA, palynological and geoarchaeological analysis at the Late hunter-gatherer site complex of Blick Mead at the junction of the drylands of Salisbury Plain and the floodplain of the River Avon, on the edge of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The findings are placed within a chronological framework built on OSL, radiocarbon and relative archaeological dating. We show that Blick Mead existed in a clearing in deciduous woodland, exploited by aurochsen, deer and hunter-gatherers for approximately 4000 years. Given its rich archaeology and longevity this strongly supports the arguments of continuity between the Late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers activity and Neolithic monument builders, and more specifically that this was a partially open environment important to both groups. This study also demonstrates that sediments from low-energy floodplains can provide suitable samples for successful environmental assaying using sedaDNA, provided they are supported by secure dating and complementary environmental proxies."
https://openalex.org/W4226095059,"The cytokine midkine (MK) is a growth factor that is involved in different physiological processes including tissue repair, inflammation, the development of different types of cancer and the proliferation of endothelial cells. The production of MK by primary human macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) was never described. We investigated whether MK is produced by primary human monocytes, macrophages and MDDCs and the capacity of macrophages and MDDCs to modulate the proliferation of endothelial cells through MK production. The TLR stimulation of human monocytes, macrophages and MDDCs induced an average of ≈200-fold increase in MK mRNA and the production of an average of 78.2, 62, 179 pg/ml MK by monocytes, macrophages and MDDCs respectively ( p &lt; 0.05). MK production was supported by its detection in CD11c + cells, CLEC4C + cells and CD68 + cells in biopsies of human tonsils showing reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. JSH-23, which selectively inhibits NF-κB activity, decreased the TLR-induced production of MK in PMBCs, macrophages and MDDCs compared to the control ( p &lt; 0.05). The inhibition of MK production by macrophages and MDDCs using anti-MK siRNA decreased the capacity of their supernatants to stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells ( p = 0.01 and 0.04 respectively). This is the first study demonstrating that the cytokine MK is produced by primary human macrophages and MDDCs upon TLR triggering, and that these cells can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation through MK production. Our results also suggest that NF-κB plays a potential role in the production of MK in macrophages and MDDCs upon TLR stimulation. The production of MK by macrophages and MDDCs and the fact that these cells can enhance the proliferation of endothelial cells by producing MK are novel immunological phenomena that have potentially important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W4226331106,"While there is evidence of consumers' interest in wine sustainability, acceptance of innovations in wine production is not guaranteed. The current study addresses this issue by analyzing consumers' acceptance of fungus-resistant grape (FRG) wines, a sustainable innovation that can substantially reduce the need for chemical inputs in viticulture. To do so, by means of an online survey including large samples of regular wine drinkers in Italy (N = 752), the UK (N = 858) and the USA (N = 856), the study compares individuals' preferences for conventional wines with preferences for FRG wines. The study also explores whether FRG wine acceptance is influenced by informal or formal purchase occasion, by different types of information regarding the product, and by individual attitudinal characteristics. The findings show a general acceptance of FRG wines among consumers. In particular, consumers' preferences for FRG wines on formal occasions are not significantly different from their preferences for conventional wine, whereas on informal occasions, consumers prefer FRG wines over conventional wines. Regarding the impact of information on participant choice, participants informed about the potential effects of FRG on sensory wine characteristics had lower preferences for FRG wines than those who read an information script regarding crop biodiversity. Last, individuals' sustainability concerns and food technology neophobia had positive and negative influences on FRG acceptance, respectively. Overall, this research provides wineries, nurseries and policy-makers with important insights concerning the market potential of FRG wines in three key markets."
https://openalex.org/W4226334963,"Most research aimed at measuring biomarkers on the skin is only concerned with sensing chemicals in sweat using electrical signals, but these methods are not truly non-invasive nor non-intrusive because they require substantial amounts of sweat to get a reading. This project aims to create a truly non-invasive wearable sensor that continuously detects the gaseous acetone (a biomarker related to metabolic disorders) that ambiently comes out of the skin. Composite films of polyaniline and cellulose acetate, exhibiting chemo-mechanical actuation upon exposure to gaseous acetone, were tested in the headspaces above multiple solutions containing acetone, ethanol, and water to gauge response sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability. The bending of the films in response to exposures to these environments was tracked by an automatic video processing code, which was found to out-perform an off-the-shelf deep neural network-based tracker. Using principal component analysis, we showed that the film bending is low dimensional with over 90% of the shape changes being captured with just two parameters. We constructed forward models to predict shape changes from the known exposure history and found that a linear model can explain 40% of the observed variance in film tip angle changes. We constructed inverse models, going from third order fits of shape changes to acetone concentrations where about 45% of the acetone variation and about 30% of ethanol variation are captured by linear models, and non-linear models did not perform substantially better. This suggests there is sufficient sensitivity and inherent selectivity of the films. These models, however, provide evidence for substantial hysteretic or long-time-scale responses of the PANI films, seemingly due to the presence of water. Further experiments will allow more accurate discrimination of unknown exposure environments. Nevertheless, the sensor will operate with high selectivity in low sweat body locations, like behind the ear or on the nails."
https://openalex.org/W4226454601,"Background Resistance to antibiotics is an increasing and major threat to global health. While the large majority of antimicrobial use occurs in the community where antibiotics are available without prescription, we did not find any studies investigating community-level factors influencing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where non-prescription antibiotic use is prevalent. Methods This qualitative study was conducted from April 1 st 2019 to May 5 th 2019 and consisting of in-depth semi-structured interviews, utilizing purposive and snowball sampling schemes to recruit adult heads of households in the Pakadjuma slum, in Kinshasa, DRC. Participants with differing medical and educational backgrounds were selected. We employed a thematic analysis approach to explore community knowledge and use of antibiotics in the sampled population. Results A total of 18 participants with a median age of 35 years were interviewed. The majority was female (77.7%), had at least a secondary education (83.4%), and unemployed (61.1%). We found that participants were familiar with the term “antibiotics”, but had limited knowledge of the indications and risks of antibiotics, including the risk of antibiotic resistance. Inappropriate use of antibiotics was common and there was frequent self-medication of non-prescribed medicines for a range of non-indicated conditions such as menstruation. Having limited income was the most commonly reported reason for not visiting a health facility for appropriate health care. Conclusion Inappropriate use of antibiotics is a widespread practice and is influenced by lack of adequate knowledge of antibiotic use, indications and risks, prevalent self-medication, and financial barriers to accessing appropriate health care. There is need for both community education as well as structural interventions addressing poverty in order to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in the Pakadjuma slum in Kinshasa."

Due to its novelty and quick spread, scientists have had difficulty in creating accurate forecasts for this disease. In part, this is due to variation in human behavior and environmental factors that impact disease propagation. This is especially true for regionally specific predictive models due to either limited case histories or other unique factors characterizing the region. This paper employs both supervised and unsupervised methods to identify the critical county-level demographic, mobility, weather, medical capacity, and health related county-level factors for studying COVID-19 propagation prior to the widespread availability of a vaccine. We use this feature subspace to aggregate counties into meaningful clusters to support more refined disease analysis efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4221141341,"The purpose of this study was to assess whether the retail food environment, measured by multiple indicators around the home and in activity space, was associated with the nutritional quality of food purchases.This cross-sectional study included 462 households from a quota sampling survey conducted in the south of France (Montpellier Metropolitan Area). The revised Healthy Purchase Index was implemented in order to assess the nutritional quality of food purchases. Food environment indicators (presence, number, relative density and proximity of food outlets) were calculated around the home and in activity space using a geographical information system. Six different types of food outlets were studied: supermarkets, markets, greengrocers, bakeries, other specialized food stores (butcher's, fishmonger's and dairy stores) and small grocery stores. Associations between food environment and the nutritional quality of food purchases were assessed using multilevel models, and geographically weighted regressions to account for spatial non-stationarity. Models were adjusted for households' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.The nutritional quality of food purchases was positively associated with the number of greengrocers around the home (1 vs. 0: β = 0.25, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.49]; >1 vs. 0: β = 0.25, 95%CI = [0.00, 0.50]), but negatively associated with the number of markets around the home (1 vs. 0: β = -0.20, 95%CI = [-0.40, 0.00]; >1 vs. 0: β = -0.37, 95%CI = [-0.69, -0.06]). These associations varied across space in the area studied. For lower income households, the number of greengrocers in activity space was positively associated with the nutritional quality of food purchases (1 vs. 0: β = 0.70, 95%CI = [0.12, 1.3]; >1 vs. 0: β = 0.67, 95%CI = [0.22, 1.1]).Greengrocers might be an effective type of food store for promoting healthier dietary behaviors. Further studies, particularly interventional studies, are needed to confirm these results in order to guide public health policies in actions designed to improve the food environment."
https://openalex.org/W4225722248,"The center of mass (CoM) is the location in a body where mass distribution is balanced. It has a fundamental role in balance and motion which has been poorly described in the dog. The objective of this study was to estimate the variance of the center of mass (CoM) in a heterogeneous population of client-owned dogs and to describe the relationship between CoM, subject morphometrics and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) box positioned ventrally on a neck collar. A single force platform and a reaction board were used to determine CoM in the transverse, sagittal and dorsal planes in thirty-one healthy adult dogs. A series of morphometric measurements were acquired with each dog standing, including distances relative to an IMU box positioned ventrally on a neck collar. Mean transverse plane CoM was 48% the distance from ischium to the IMU box, near the xiphoid process. Mean sagittal place CoM was 59% the width of the chest on the left side. Mean dorsal plane CoM was 41% the distance from the most dorsal to the most ventral aspect of the body. Dog length was the primary variable required to maximize the relationship between three-dimensional CoM and identifiable variables measured. A CoM based normalization procedure should be considered to normalize mass or motion based outcome measure output (e.g., ground reaction forces, vector acceleration) in a heterogeneous population of dogs. Future research will be needed to determine if CoM-based normalization procedures reduce variance in outcome measures affected by subject morphometrics."
https://openalex.org/W4225835015,"COPD and coronary heart disease (CHD) frequently co-occur, yet which COPD phenotypes are most prone to CHD is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to see whether COPD patients did have a true higher risk for CHD than subjects without COPD, and to examine a range of potential factors associated with CHD in COPD patients and controls.347 COPD patients and 428 non-COPD controls, were invited for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and pulmonary CT. Arterial blood gas, bioelectrical impedance and lung function was measured, and a detailed medical history taken. The CCTA was evaluated for significant coronary stenosis and calcium score (CaSc), and emphysema defined as >10% of total area <-950 Hounsfield units.12.6% of the COPD patients and 5.7% of the controls had coronary stenosis (p<0.01), whereas 55.9% of the COPD patients had a CaSc>100 compared to 31.6% of the controls (p<0.01). In a multivariable model adjusting for sex, age, body composition, pack-years, CRP, cholesterol/blood pressure lowering medication use and diabetes mellitus, the OR (95% CI) for having significant stenosis was 1.80 (0.86-3.78) in COPD patients compared with controls. In a similar model, the OR (95% CI) for having CaSc>100 was 1.68 (1.12-2.53) in COPD patients compared with controls. Examining the risk of significant stenosis and CaSc>100 among COPD patients, no variable was associated with significant stenosis, whereas male sex [OR 2.85 (1.56-5.21)], age [OR 3.74 (2.42-5.77)], statin use [OR 2.23 (1.23-4.50)] were associated with CaSc>100, after adjusting for body composition, pack-years, C-reactive protein, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diabetes, emphysema score, GOLD category, exacerbation frequency, eosinophilia, and hypoxemia.COPD patients were more likely to have CHD, but neither emphysema score, lung function, exacerbation frequency, nor hypoxemia predicted presence of either coronary stenosis or CaSc>100."
https://openalex.org/W4225966167,"Objectives Many patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have nocturia. However, the predictive index of nocturia in patients with OSAS is currently not well known. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of nocturia in patients with OSAS and determine the factors that could predict nocturia in these patients. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1,264 untreated patients with OSAS (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI ≥5/h on polysomnography [PSG]) from January 2017 to January 2020. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Participants were divided by sex and then subdivided into nocturia and non-nocturia groups according to the following question, “Do you go to the bathroom two times or more during your sleep?” Participants’ characteristics and underlying disease were investigated, and all information, including PSG data, was compared between the two groups using the t-test or chi-square test. Results Overall, 35.2% (337/958) of male participants with OSAS and 59.8% (183/306) of female participants with OSAS had nocturia. The nocturia group was older; scored higher on the BDI-II, PSQI, and ISI; and had more underlying disease in both sexes. There was no difference in the AHI between the two groups among both sexes, but the hypoxia-related PSG parameters and sleep quality parameters, such as higher 90% oxygen desaturation index (90% ODI), lesser N3 sleep, and higher wakefulness after sleep onset, were worse among male participants with OSAS in the nocturia group than in the non-nocturia group. In multivariate logistic analysis, 90% ODI was an independent risk factor associated with nocturia in male participants with OSAS. Conclusions Considerable number of patients with OSAS had nocturia and poor sleep quality. Nocturia should be evaluated in male OSAS patients with severe hypoxia observed during sleep."

However, there is a lack of biomechanics studies on patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). This study’s purpose was to compare the frontal plane biomechanics of the trunk and lower limb during the single-leg squat and isometric hip abductor torque in individuals with isolated PFOA and controls. Frontal plane kinematics during the single-leg squat were evaluated using a three-dimensional (3-D) motion analysis system. Isometric hip abductor torque was determined using a handheld dynamometer. Twenty individuals participated in the study (10 with PFOA and 10 controls). No significant differences between groups were found regarding age (mean ± SD, PFOA group = 51.8 ± 6.9 versus control group = 47.8 ± 5.5; mean difference = 4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.9 to 9.9, p = 0.20) or body mass index (PFOA group = 27.6 ± 2.2 versus control group = 25.5 ± 2.5; mean difference = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.1 to 4.3, p = 0.06). Compared to control, the PFOA group presented greater hip adduction in the descending and ascending phases of the single-leg squat at 45° (mean difference [95% CI] = 6.44° [0.39–12.48°], p = 0.04; mean difference [95% CI] = 5.33° [0.24–10.42°], p = 0.045, respectively) and 60° (mean difference [95% CI] = 8.44° [2.15–14.73°], p = 0.01; mean difference [95% CI] = 7.58° [2.1–13.06°], p = 0.009, respectively) of knee flexion. No significant differences between groups were found for the frontal plane kinematics of the trunk, pelvis or knee (p &gt; 0.05). The PFOA group exhibited lower isometric hip abductor torque (mean difference [95% CI] = -0.34 Nm/kg [-0.67 to -0.01 Nm/kg], p = 0.04). The individuals with PFOA presented greater hip adduction than the control group, which could increase lateral patellofemoral joint stress at 45° and 60° of knee flexion in the descending and ascending phases of the single-leg squat. These individuals also exhibited hip abductor weakness in comparison to healthy controls."

Photocatalytic nanoparticles have been developed to inhibit indirect transmission of pathogens by acting as surface coating materials. During development of such antiviral materials, researchers use bacteriophages as model viruses due to their safety and experimental efficiency. Screening methods are used to identify potential antiviral materials, and better screening technologies will accelerate the discovery of antiviral treatments. In this study, we constructed a novel platform to evaluate antiviral activity of surface coating materials using the M13 bacteriophage and phagemid system derived from phage display technology. The evaluation results generated by this system for the two tested antiviral materials were comparable to those for the materials tested on the Qβ bacteriophage and influenza virus using traditional screening methods. The experimental system developed in this study provides rapid and effective screening and can be applied to the development of novel antiviral materials."

However, urban streams are still neglected and degraded, specially in southern European countries. One important step towards the rehabilitation of these ecosystems is the awareness of their importance by citizens. This study aimed to assess the effect of 1-year of activities (field and laboratory) of an environmental education project on primary school children, in improving their knowledge on urban stream ecosystems and their problems. We analyzed students' questionnaires before and after field and laboratory activities, drawings and group interviews. Initially, most children had incipient contact with rivers and streams, showing fears and lack of knowledge about them. As the project progressed, their perceptions changed, with a clear increase in the proportion of students recognizing the biodiversity associated to rivers (e.g., names of riparian trees, aquatic plants and invertebrates). Also, their fears decreased significantly, while their awareness to the impacts of artificialization and lack of riparian vegetation increased. Our results show that direct contact with nature have a positive role in the way it is understood by children, as well as promoting responsible and sustainable behaviors, being effective from the early primary-school years."

https://openalex.org/W4226212340,"Evaluating the impact of environmental changes on past societies is frequently confounded by the difficulty of establishing cause-and-effect at relevant scales of analysis. Commonly, paleoenvironmental records lack the temporal and spatial resolution to link them with historic events, yet there remains a tendency to correlate climate change and cultural transformations on the basis of their seeming synchronicity. Here, we challenge perceptions of societal vulnerability to past environmental change using an integrated paleoenvironmental and land-use history of a remote upland site in the north of Ireland. We present a high-resolution, multi-proxy record that illustrates extended occupation of this marginal locality throughout the climate oscillations of the last millennium. Importantly, historically-dated volcanic ash markers enable us to pinpoint precisely in our record the timing of major national demographic crises such as the Black Death and the European, Irish and Great (Potato) Famines. We find no evidence that climate downturns or demographic collapses had an enduring impact on the use of the uplands: either the community escaped the effects of these events, or population levels recovered rapidly enough (within a generation) to leave no appreciable mark on the palaeoenvironmental record. Our findings serve to illustrate the spatial complexity of human activity that can enable communities to withstand or quickly bounce back from largescale calamities. In neglecting to consider such local-scale variability in social and economic organization, generalized models of societal collapse risk overplaying the vulnerability of populations to long- and short-term ecological stressors to the detriment of identifying the social constraints that influence a population’s response to change."
https://openalex.org/W4226213852,"Infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae have been difficult to control because of the worldwide emergence of carbapenem-resistant isolates mainly due to carbapenemase production. Information regarding carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae is still scarce in Ethiopia. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and to assess the occurrence of blaNDM and blaKPC carbapenemase genes.A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2018 to February 2019 at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 132 non-duplicate K. pneumoniae isolates were studied. Phenotypic confirmation of carbapenemase production was done by modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (mCIM). Multiplex PCR was performed for the detection of carbapenemase-encoding genes blaKPC, and blaNDM.Out of the total 132 K. pneumoniae isolates, 39 (29.6%) were non-susceptible to one or more carbapenems. The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing isolates from the total was 28 (21.2%) with mCIM of which the most dominant gene was blaNDM 26 (92.9%) and one isolate carried blaKPC concomitantly. Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were 100% non-susceptible to half of the antimicrobials used in the study, including meropenem and ertapenem. Previous use of carbapenems was associated with carbapenemase production (P = 0.004).The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was worrying in the study area. To our knowledge, the study described the emergence of blaNDM and blaKPC gene carrying K. pneumoniae in Ethiopia for the first time. Further large-scale molecular-based studies, including other carbapenemase genes and sequencing of K. pneumoniae, are warranted to have a clear awareness about the presence of antimicrobial resistance high-risk clones in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4226429837,"Background Exposure to traditional media (TV, radio, and newspapers) and the use of mobile as an interpersonal communication tool allow for a variety of information provision. The purpose of this study is to investigate how women’s media and mobile access affect maternal health service (MHS) utilization. The study also aims to look into the moderated mediation effects of socioeconomic variables on the association mentioned above. Methods The study analyzed reproductive and media data of 5,011 ever-married women extracted from the latest nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Hierarchical logistic regression and moderated mediation analysis are performed to determine the association. Results Only 26.9% of women used mobile for health service use, while more than 55% had media access. Media access is significantly associated with all three types of MHS use; mobile usage also has a significant association with antenatal and delivery care. When women have both access to media and mobile, the likelihood of delivering in a health facility increased by 1.82 times (AOR: 1.82, 95%CI: 1.51, 2.20) which is slightly better than having access to only one type of media channel. Women’s education, household wealth, place of residence, religion, and current working status are among the socioeconomic factors associated with access to media and mobile. Women’s education mediates the relationship of media and MHS; however, the mediation effect of women (β: .45; LLCI: .21, ULCI: .68) on the association of media and place of delivery is seen to be moderated by household wealth. Women who belong to well-off families moderates positively (Effect: .33, 95%CI: .27, .40) the education effect of media and where to deliver. Place of residence, another moderator, significantly moderates (Effect: .09, BootLLCI: .02, BootULCI: .16) the mediation effect of women’s education on the association of media and antenatal care visits; women living in urban areas seems to have positively moderated the education effects on the mentioned association. Conclusions Provision of media access and mobile use indicate better utilization of MHS in Bangladesh, and women’s education mediates these relationships via the influence of household wealth and area of residence. Therefore, while planning interventions to increase MHS use, its relationships with the media and mobile use should be extrapolated. The collective use of these channels could be a catalyst for the success of health promotion initiatives to improve women’s health behaviors, build community capacity, and create mass awareness that supports the optimal use of MHS in Bangladesh."

While it is commonly assumed that environmental conditions partially explain variation in visitation to coastal recreation areas across space and time, scarce and inconsistent visitation observations challenge our ability to reveal these connections. With the ubiquity of mobile phone usage, novel sources of digitally derived data are increasingly available at a massive scale. Applications of mobile phone locational data have been effective in research on urban-centric human mobility and transportation, but little work has been conducted on understanding behavioral patterns surrounding dynamic natural resources. We present an application of cell phone locational data to estimate the effects of beach closures, based on measured bacteria threshold exceedances, on visitation to coastal access points. Our results indicate that beach closures on Cape Cod, MA, USA have a significant negative effect on visitation at those beaches with closures, while closures at a sample of coastal access points elsewhere in New England have no detected impact on visitation. Our findings represent geographic mobility patterns for over 7 million unique coastal visits and suggest that closures resulted in approximately 1,800 (0.026%) displaced visits for Cape Cod during the summer season of 2017. We demonstrate the potential for human-mobility data derived from mobile phones to reveal the scale of use and behavior in response to changes in dynamic natural resources.

https://openalex.org/W4226105416,"Roughly 400,000 people in the U.S. are living with bone metastases, the vast majority occurring in the spine. Metastases to the spine result in fractures, pain, paralysis, and significant health care costs. This predilection for cancer to metastasize to the bone is seen across most cancer histologies, with the greatest incidence seen in prostate, breast, and lung cancer. The molecular process involved in this predilection for axial versus appendicular skeleton is not fully understood, although it is likely that a combination of tumor and local micro-environmental factors plays a role. Immune cells are an important constituent of the bone marrow microenvironment and many of these cells have been shown to play a significant role in tumor growth and progression in soft tissue and bone disease. With this in mind, we sought to examine the differences in immune landscape between axial and appendicular bones in the normal noncancerous setting in order to obtain an understanding of these landscapes. To accomplish this, we utilized mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to examine differences in the immune cell landscapes between the long bone and vertebral body bone marrow from patient clinical samples and C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate significant differences between immune populations in both murine and human marrow with a predominance of myeloid progenitor cells in the spine. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed differences in concentrations favoring a more myeloid enriched population of cells in the vertebral body bone marrow. These differences could have clinical implications with respect to the distribution and permissive growth of bone metastases."

In this study, the characteristic temperature of coal spontaneous combustion, the generation law of indicator gases, the combustion process, and the division of the combustion stages of coal samples taken from Hongqingliang (HQL) and Dayan (DY) mines were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis experiment, indicator gas detection experiment, and coal oxidation spontaneous combustion experiment. The results of the thermogravimetric analysis experiment showed that the pyrolysis temperatures of the HQL and DY coals were 115.76°C and 131.80°C, and the ignition temperatures were 337.74°C and 360.18°C, respectively. The indicator gas detection results showed that the first-appearance temperature of C2H4 was 85°C for the HQL and DY coals, whereas the first-appearance temperature of C2H6 varied: 115°C for the HQL coal and 130°C for the DY coal. The first-appearance temperatures of C2H2 were 180°C and 195°C for the HQL and DY coals, respectively. The experiments on coal oxidation spontaneous combustion showed that the spontaneous combustion period of the HQL and DY coals were 35.45 and 42.3 days, respectively. The heating process during combustion could be divided into four stages: a latent period of spontaneous combustion, a slow spontaneous heating period, an accelerated spontaneous heating period, and a period of combustion. The critical temperature of each stage showed a good correlation with the incipient temperature of the indicator gases, namely C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, and the appearance of the above gases can be used to characterize the degree of spontaneous combustion of coal."

Therefore, it is important to understand what factors shape young people's climate-relevant behavior. In this study, we examine how information about peer behavior affects adolescents' perception of prevailing social norms and own decision-making. Experimentally, we manipulated whether adolescents received information about other young people's (lack of) support for climate protection, operationalized as a donation to a CO2 offsetting scheme. We find that empirical expectations shifted for all age groups when the information revealed that peers donated nothing or only small amounts. Donation behavior and the normative assessment, however, changed only in the younger age groups. Our study illustrates the caution that must be exercised when others' behavior becomes visible or is deliberatively made salient in order to induce behavioral change, especially among young individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4226043506,"In this study, we statistically identified and characterized the relationship between the long-run social benefits of creativity and the in-life individual costs (in terms of happiness and health) of creativity. To do so, we referred to a theoretical framework that depicts a creator's life. We generated a balanced dataset of 200 creators (i.e., composers, painters, mathematicians and physicists, and biologists and chemists born between 1770 and 1879), and calculated standardized evaluations of the long-run social benefits in different domains (performances, exhibitions, citations). We performed regression analysis and identified the statistical determinants of the relationship between a creator's social benefits and the costs to their happiness and health. We found that creativity represented an individual cost for all four creator groups, with a larger impact on happiness than on health; the cost was greater if creativity was based more on divergent than on convergent thinking or if authors faced greater language issues. The impacts of long-run social benefits on individual happiness and health were similar in the arts and sciences if institutional differences were taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W4226082741,"Inherent differences as well as health disparities among rural and urban populations warrant further studies focused on the characteristics and outcomes in COVID-19 patients in a rural setting. The aim of this study was to describe these elements in patients infected with SARS-CoV2, hospitalized at a single center in rural Pennsylvania.Patients with SARS-CoV2 infections hospitalized between March-December 2020 were studied. Data were obtained from electronic health records generated reports and was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups according to severity. Distribution of variables was studied among these three groups. Using certain variables, we ran logistic regression analysis to study the odds of death and requirement of mechanical ventilation (MV).Among 335 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV2, age more than 65 years increased the severity of clinical status and in-hospital mortality. Gender did not affect odds of death nor need for MV. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, but diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increased the risk of death. In terms of laboratory parameters, our data suggests that maximum LDH marginally increased the risk of death and maximum WBC marginally increased the risk of need for MV and death.Through our basic analysis of various characteristics of SARS-CoV2 positive patients admitted in a rural hospital, we have identified certain risk factors associated with severe disease and increased in-hospital mortality. These were found to be largely similar to current literature from studies in urban populations, bolstering the reproducibility and generalizability of existing knowledge. This information lays the foundation for future studies to investigate the role of these factors in morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in depth."
https://openalex.org/W4226265530,"Although there have been great advancements in the field of HIV treatment and prevention, there is no cure. There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. In addition to genetic differences between the two types of HIV, HIV-2 infection causes a slower disease progression, and the rate of new HIV-2 infections has dramatically decreased since 2003. Like HIV-1, HIV-2 is capable of establishing latent infection in CD4+ T cells, thereby allowing the virus to evade viral cytopathic effects and detection by the immune system. The mechanisms underlying HIV latency are not fully understood, rendering this a significant barrier to development of a cure. Using RT-ddPCR, we previously demonstrated that latent infection with HIV-1 may be due to blocks to HIV transcriptional elongation, distal transcription/polyadenylation, and multiple splicing. In this study, we describe the development of seven highly-specific RT-ddPCR assays for HIV-2 that can be applied to the study of HIV-2 infections and latency. We designed and validated seven assays targeting different HIV-2 RNA regions along the genome that can be used to measure the degree of progression through different blocks to HIV-2 transcription and splicing. Given that HIV-2 is vastly understudied relative to HIV-1 and that it can be considered a model of a less virulent infection, application of these assays to studies of HIV-2 latency may inform new therapies for HIV-2, HIV-1, and other retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W4226376539,"The reason for the existence of adversarial samples is still barely understood. Here, we explore the transferability of learned features to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) classes. We do this by assessing neural networks' capability to encode the existing features, revealing an intriguing connection with adversarial attacks and defences. The principal idea is that, ""if an algorithm learns rich features, such features should represent Out-of-Distribution classes as a combination of previously learned In-Distribution (ID) classes"". This is because OoD classes usually share several regular features with ID classes, given that the features learned are general enough. We further introduce two metrics to assess the transferred features representing OoD classes. One is based on inter-cluster validation techniques, while the other captures the influence of a class over learned features. Experiments suggest that several adversarial defences decrease the attack accuracy of some attacks and improve the transferability-of-features as measured by our metrics. Experiments also reveal a relationship between the proposed metrics and adversarial attacks (a high Pearson correlation coefficient and low p-value). Further, statistical tests suggest that several adversarial defences, in general, significantly improve transferability. Our tests suggests that models having a higher transferability-of-features have generally higher robustness against adversarial attacks. Thus, the experiments suggest that the objectives of adversarial machine learning might be much closer to domain transfer learning, as previously thought."
