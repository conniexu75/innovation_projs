https://openalex.org/W2069157368,"The effects of the Mount St. Helens eruption on the surrounding forest and the processes affecting recovery from this major disturbance, which Franklin and MacMahon discuss in their Perspective “Messages from a mountain” ( Science 's Compass, 19 May, p. [1183][1]), are similar to the effects of hurricanes on coral reefs. For both the forest and the reef, major natural disturbances leave most of the ecosystem structure intact, and recovery can begin from surviving organisms (or, in some cases, portions of organisms) ([1][2]). Both the species composition and the physical structure of these ecosystems influence the course of recovery.

In the case of Mount St. Helens, the recovery process has had little interference from humans. In contrast, the recovery of coral reefs from hurricanes is almost invariably confounded by anthropogenic stresses, most notably fishing. Overfishing can delay reef recovery by removing herbivorous fishes that keep algal growth in check. If grazing is not intense enough, algae (particularly “fleshy” seaweeds) can inhibit both growth of adult coral colonies and settlement or survival of coral recruits ([2][3]). Humans have now degraded tropical marine ecosystems to the point where our ability to evaluate ecological theories about succession and effects of disturbance has been compromised.

https://openalex.org/W2056332308,"Chondrites contain a small fission xenon component of unexplained origin. Evidence on the geochemical behavior of this component suggests that it was not derived from an actinide element (Z = 89 to 103), or from a transition metal between Z = 104 and 111, but from a more volatile progenitor. The most likely candidates are the superheavy elements between Z = 112 and 119, whose lighter congeners (mercury, tellurium, lead, and the like) are known to be strongly fractionated in meteorites."

Zeilinger discusses recent advances toward using this principle for quantum cryptography and highlights studies into the entanglement (or controlled superposition) of several photons, atoms, or ions."

The treatment appears to improve mental functioning in mice, and despite earlier concerns, is well tolerated by a variety of experimental animals, and by humans as well. Excitement was palpable here at last week's World Alzheimer Congress 2000, but researchers caution against undue optimism given that safety trials in Alzheimer's patients are just beginning and there is currently no evidence that it will help people with the disease."
