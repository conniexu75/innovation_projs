https://openalex.org/W2005159766,"Volatile halogenated organic compounds synthesized by various industrial processes are troublesome pollutants because they are persistent in terrestrial ecosystems and because they may be present in sufficient quantities to alter the natural atmospheric cycles of the halogens. Certain of these compounds, including polybromomethanes and several previously unobserved alkyl monohalides and dihalides, appear to be natural products of the marine environment. A variety of temperate marine macroalgae (the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosis, the green algae Enteromorpha linza and Ulva lacta, and the red alga Gigartina stellata) not only contain volatile halogenated organic compounds but also release them to seawater at rates of nanograms to micrograms of each compound per gram of dry algae per day. The macroalgae may be an important source of bromine-containing material released to the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2032963331,"During November and December 1983, two anticyclonic eddies were observed west of the Agulhas Retroflection, apparently spawned at the retroflection. The western eddy, centered 300 kilometers southwest of Cape Town, has a winter cooled core encircled by warm Indian Ocean water. Between Cape Town and the ""Cape Town Eddy"" is a net geostrophic transport of Indian Ocean thermocline water (14 x 10(6) cubic meters per second) into the South Atlantic Ocean. This circulation configuration, similar to that observed by earlier researchers, suggests that Indian-Atlantic thermocline exchange is a common occurrence. Such a warmwater link between the Atlantic and Indian oceans would strongly influence global climate patterns. The Indian Ocean water is warmer than the adjacent South Atlantic water and thus represents a heat input of 2.3 x 10(13) to 47 x 10(13) watts into the Atlantic. The large uncertainty arises from the unknown partition between two possible routes for the return flow from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean: cooler South Atlantic thermocline water or much colder North Atlantic Deep Water. In either case, interocean mass and heat exchange of thermocline water at the Agulhas Retroflection is a distinct likelihood."

https://openalex.org/W2074414753,Character displacement resulting from interspecific competition has been extremely difficult to demonstrate. The problem was addressed with a study of Darwin's ground finches (Geospiza). Beak sizes of populations of G. fortis and G. fuliginosa in sympatry and allopatry were compared by a procedure that controls for any possible effects on morphology of variation among locations in food supply. The results provide strong evidence for character displacement. Measurement of natural selection in a population of G. fortis on an island (Daphne) lacking a resident population of G. fuliginosa shows how exploitation of G. fuliginosa foods affects the differential survival of G. fortis phenotypes.

Differences among males in the attractiveness of their pheromone to females were statistically significant. Developmental time of progeny was significantly heritable, indicating that some males have ""good genes"" for this trait. There was no statistically significant correlation between progeny fitness and male attractiveness. These results do not support the hypothesis that in this species the evolution of female preferences for male pheromone is adaptive."
https://openalex.org/W2052016727,"The basic concepts for thermochemical hydrogen generation processes have been summarized in this article. A useful set of criteria has been described for the screening and selection of potentially viable, multistep, closedcycle thermochemical processes for hydrogen generation. Three illustrative, new closed-cycle processes have been discussed, indicating potential, overall thermal efficiencies ranging from approximately 40 to 60 percent. Combined thermochemical-electrolytic schemes also warrant further consideration. Principal technical problems in the development of such thermochemical closed-cycle and mixed-cycle processes are expected to include primarily materials compatibility, reaction kinetics, separation techniques, and heat-exchanger systems. As natural gas supplies decline and prices rise, new open-cycle thermochemical processes based on water and other fossil fuel feedstocks will be the first important new technology in supplying the growing hydrogen needs of industry for at least the next two decades. Conventional electrolysis technology does not appear to be a competitor for large-scale supplies in this century unless very low off-peak electrical power rates become available, although electrolysis will be the best technique for some small-scale uses. Further analysis will be required to determine if closed-cycle thermochemical or mixed-cycle methods will displace electrolysis or other methods as the principal technology for the production of hydrogen on a large scale for the longer term."

https://openalex.org/W2031802789,"IN an article on earthquakes in the Holy Land1 there is given a list of 207 shocks, of which there is record, between the years 1606 B.C. and A.D 1927. Among these are 27 dates from an Arabian authority, As-Soyuti, whose work appears in translation in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In transcribing these dates I failed to observe that they were stated as A.H., that is, Anno Hejira, instead of Anno Domini. They are, therefore, as quoted in my list something over six centuries too early. The corrected dates are as follows:"

https://openalex.org/W1980357799,"I have been asked to predict the condition of science five thousand years hence when the Time Capsule is dug out of the Flushing meadows-provided there are any meadows here in A.D. 6939. Land has been rising and falling in different parts of the globe within historic time, and within five thousand years the Time Capsule may be considerably below sea level or raised several hundred feet above where it is now. While I speak to the youth of to-day, I am speaking for the youth that will be living one hundred and fifty generations hereafter, in other words to your great, great, one hundred and fifty times great grandchildren. One can predict only in terms of what is known in the past. Let us compare what has actually occurred within these fifty centuries with what a man five thousand years ago might have predicted for the present. He could not have thought about development of world civilization because the world to him was only a limited region. Civilizations could develop and decline with little or no influence on one another because of lack of means of communication. His knowledge of the geographical world and of the laws of nature was so limited that it would have been impossible for him to predict the condition of the world in 1940. Science, as we understand this term, did not exist in B.C. 3060. Are we to-day in our ignorance as incapable of predicting the future five thousand years hence as was the man five thousand years ago? In many ways probably yes; in other ways we have an advantage. We have made a start. So 1 Address before the American Institute of the City of New York at the World's Fair, September 23, in conneetion with the sealing-in of the Westinghouse Time Capsule. The address was broadcast in part over the NBC network. Reprint from Science."
