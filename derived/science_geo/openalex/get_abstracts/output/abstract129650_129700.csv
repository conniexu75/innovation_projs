In individuals who control viremia in the absence of antiviral therapy, polyclonal, persistent, and vigorous HIV-1–specific CD4 + T cell proliferative responses were present, resulting in the elaboration of interferon-γ and antiviral β chemokines. In persons with chronic infection, HIV-1–specific proliferative responses to p24 were inversely related to viral load. Strong HIV-1–specific proliferative responses were also detected following treatment of acutely infected persons with potent antiviral therapy. The HIV-1–specific helper cells are likely to be important in immunotherapeutic interventions and vaccine development."

The sites varied, both as sources and recipients of larvae, by an order of magnitude. It is likely that sites supplied copiously from ""upstream"" reef areas will be more resilient to recruitment overfishing, less susceptible to species loss, and less reliant on local management than places with little upstream reef. The mapping of connectivity patterns will enable the identification of beneficial management partnerships among nations and the design of networks of interdependent reserves."

The crystal structure of the enzyme from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum , determined at 1.45 angstrom resolution for the inactive enzyme state MCR ox1-silent , reveals that two molecules of the nickel porphinoid coenzyme F 430 are embedded between the subunits α, α′, β, and γ and α′, α, β′, and γ′, forming two identical active sites. Each site is accessible for the substrate methyl–coenzyme M through a narrow channel locked after binding of the second substrate coenzyme B. Together with a second structurally characterized enzyme state (MCR silent ) containing the heterodisulfide of coenzymes M and B, a reaction mechanism is proposed that uses a radical intermediate and a nickel organic compound."

In epithelial Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, Tiam1 localized to adherens junctions. Ectopic expression of Tiam1 or RacV12 inhibited hepatocyte growth factor–induced scattering by increasing E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesion accompanied by actin polymerization at cell-cell contacts. In Ras-transformed MDCK cells, expression of Tiam1 or RacV12 restored E-cadherin–mediated adhesion, resulting in phenotypic reversion and loss of invasiveness. These data suggest an invasion-suppressor role for Tiam1 and Rac in epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2143725421,"Stream channel erosion has long been suspected as the major contributor to long-term sediment yield from urbanizing watersheds. For San Diego Creek in southern California, measurements from 1983 to 1993 showed that stream channel erosion furnished 10(5) megagrams per year of sediment, or about two-thirds of the total sediment yield. Thus, because channel erosion can be a major source of sediment yield from urbanizing areas, channel stabilization should be a priority in managing sediment yield."

https://openalex.org/W2132951979,"Carbon-isotope values of bulk organic matter from high-altitude lakes on Mount Kenya and Mount Elgon, East Africa, were 10 to 14 per mil higher during glacial times than they are today. Compound-specific isotope analyses of leaf waxes and algal biomarkers show that organisms possessing CO2-concentrating mechanisms, including C4 grasses and freshwater algae, were primarily responsible for this large increase. Carbon limitation due to lower ambient CO2 partial pressures had a significant impact on the distribution of forest on the tropical mountains, in addition to climate. Hence, tree line elevation should not be used to infer palaeotemperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2059093135,"Analysis of a continuous sedimentary record taken in the Maldives indicates that strong primary production fluctuations (70 to 390 grams of carbon per square meter per year) have occurred in the equatorial Indian Ocean during the past 910,000 years. The record of primary production is coherent and in phase with the February equatorial insolation, whereas it shows diverse phase behavior with δ 18 O, depending on the orbital frequency (eccentricity, obliquity, or precession) examined. These observations imply a direct control of productivity in the equatorial oceanic system by insolation. In the equatorial Indian Ocean, productivity is driven by the wind intensity of westerlies, which is related to the Southern Oscillation; therefore, it is suggested that a precession forcing on the Southern Oscillation is responsible for the observed paleoproductivity dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2136767810,"The bacterial Sec and signal recognition particle ( ffh -dependent) protein translocation mechanisms are conserved between prokaryotes and higher plant chloroplasts. A third translocation mechanism in chloroplasts [the proton concentration difference (ΔpH) pathway] was previously thought to be unique. The hcf106 mutation of maize disrupts the localization of proteins transported through this ΔpH pathway in isolated chloroplasts. The Hcf106 gene encodes a receptor-like thylakoid membrane protein, which shows homology to open reading frames from all completely sequenced bacterial genomes, which suggests that the ΔpH pathway has been conserved since the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts. Thus, the third protein translocation pathway, of which HCF106 is a component, is found in both bacteria and plants."

It has been also demonstrated that Gas6 is a ligand of receptor tyrosine kinases Axl, Sky, and Mer.

In this study, we clarified that Gas6 specifically bound to phosphatidylserine and the binding was dependent on Ca2+ and γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues.

U937 cells also bound to ELISA plate coated with phosphatidylinositol, but the binding was independent of Gas6 and Ca2+. On the other hand, U937 cells did not adhere to phosphatidylcholine- or phosphatidylethanolamine-coated ELISA plate even in the presence of Gas6 and Ca2+.

Gas6 was initially identified as a product of a gene whose expression in fibroblasts increased during the growth-arrested state, although its biological activity was unclear (1Manfioletti G. Brancolini G. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We purified Gas6 as a protein, which is released from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. and specifically potentiates VSMC proliferation mediated by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors (2Nakano T.

Another biological activity of Gas6 is the prevention of cell death of VSMCs and fibroblasts (3Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Arita H.

Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657PubMed Google Scholar), contain a characteristic extracellular ligand-binding domain composed of two immunoglobulin-like motifs and two fibronectin type III motifs. Thus, the biological activities of Gas6, i.e. potentiation of cell proliferation and prevention of cell death, are very likely to be mediated by these receptor tyrosine kinases. Gas6 has 46% amino acid identity to protein S, a serum protein negatively regulating blood coagulation. Similarly to protein S, Gas6 is composed of defined structural motifs: a Gla domain, four epidermal growth factor-like repeats, and a C-terminal domain (1Manfioletti G. Brancolini G. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The Gla domain is rich in γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues, which are found in some factors in blood coagulation. Amino acid analysis of Gas6 revealed that Gas6 contains 11–12 Gla residues (2Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The function of the Gla domain of protein S is thought to be mediation of its Ca2+-dependent binding to negatively charged phospholipids, which is important for the biological activity of protein S (18Nelsestuen G.L. Kisiel W. Di Scipio R.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2134-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The specific binding of Gas6 to its receptor on cell membrane has been shown to be dependent on Ca2+ (19Nakano T. Kishino J. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that interaction of the Gla domain with Ca2+ is important for the receptor binding. Moreover, Gla-deficient Gas6 lacks receptor binding activity and growth-potentiating activity, indicating that Gla residues of Gas6 are necessary for Gas6 activity (20Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the interaction of Gas6 with phospholipids and found that it specifically bound to phosphatidylserine (PS) and that the interaction was dependent on Ca2+ and Gla residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gas6 functions as an adhesion molecule, which binds Gas6 receptor-expressing cells to PS-exposing surfaces. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and PS were purchased from Avanti. CHO cells were transfected with rat Gas6 expression plasmid. Confluent CHO cells were cultured in protein-free culture medium PM-1000 (Eiken, Japan) in the presence of 4 μm vitamin K2. Recombinant rat Gas6 was purified from the culture medium as described elsewhere (2Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To prepare Gla-deficient Gas6, the CHO cells were cultured in PM-1000 in the presence of 1 μm warfarin. The Gla-deficient Gas6 was prepared as described elsewhere (20Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). cDNA fragment coding for the extracellular domain of human Axl (amino acid residues 1–438) was ligated in-frame with the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragment of the Fc region (residues 216–443) of human IgG1, with the spacer sequence Ser-Ser-Val-Pro-Gly. The fused cDNA was subcloned into PUC-SRα expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells, using a liposome method. The serum-free conditioned medium of COS cells was collected for 3 days, and the Axl-Fc was purified with Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The binding of Gas6 to phospholipids was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (21Igarashi K. Kaneda M. Yamaji A. Saido T.C. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29075-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were dissolved in ice-cold ethanol (2 μg/ml unless otherwise described), and 100 μl of the individual phospholipids was used to coat each well of the ELISA plate (Corning). Wells coated with ethanol alone were used as a control. The wells were kept at 25 °C for 18 h to evaporate the ethanol and blocked by incubation of the phospholipid-coated wells with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the wells were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with Gas6 or Gla-deficient Gas6 in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 unless otherwise described. The binding of Gas6 or Gla-deficient Gas6 was determined using rabbit anti-rat Gas6 IgG and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International Inc.). The anti-Gas6 IgG detected Gas6 and Gla-deficient Gas6 equally on ELISA and Western blotting (data not shown). The binding of Gas6 to PS is very firm. EDTA, PS, or a high concentration of salt, which all inhibited the binding, did not dissociate bound Gas6 from the PS-coated plate. Only a strong solubilizing reagent, such as SDS, guanidine HCl, or urea, dissociated the bound Gas6 (data not shown). Axl-Fc fusion protein (0.7 μg) was immobilized to the carboxymethyl dextran layer of a CM5 sensor chip on a BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia), using procedures described in the manufacturer's manual. Gas6 was dissolved in TBS containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mm CaCl2 with or without phospholipids and passed over the immobilized Axl-Fc at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 20 min. The binding of the ligand with Axl-Fc was monitored in real time by the increase in the relative resonance unit on the sensorgram. The apparent association rate constants (k a ) and dissociation rate constants (k d ) were calculated using the manufacturer's software. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) was calculated ask d /k a . ELISA plates were coated with phospholipids (0.5 μg/well) as described above. The wells were blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.3 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 1 h and washed with PBS containing 0.05% BSA. The wells were filled with PBS, 0.05% BSA containing U937 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) and various concentrations of Gas6 and CaCl2. The plate was sealed with a transparent film and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, the plate was inverted and incubated for 15 min. During the incubation, unbound cells came off the plate. The cells on the plate were observed with a microscope, and adherent cells in a field were counted. First, we investigated the interaction of Gas6 with phospholipids. The wells on the ELISA plate were coated with various concentrations of phospholipids, including acidic phospholipids (PS and PI) and neutral phospholipids (PC and PE). The wells were incubated with Gas6, and Gas6 bound to the wells was detected with ELISA using anti-Gas6 IgG. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Gas6 interacted with PS but not with PC, PE, or PI. Fig. 1 A also demonstrates that the binding was dependent on the concentration of PS, with half-maximal binding occurring at approximately 60 ng/well. Since interaction of some Gla-containing coagulation factors with phospholipids is dependent on Ca2+, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of Gas6 with PS. As shown in Fig. 1 B, approximately 2 mmCa2+ was required for maximal binding, whereas Mg2+ did not substitute for Ca2+. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 C, the wells coated with PS or those without coating were incubated with various concentrations of Gas6. Specific binding of Gas6 to PS, which was calculated by subtracting the values with non-coated wells from the values with PS-coated wells, was saturable, with half-maximal binding observed at approximately 0.7 μg/ml Gas6. With some coagulation factors the Gla residues are known to be important for interactions with negatively charged phospholipids (23Dahlback B. Hildebrand B. Malm J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 265: 8127-8135Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We thus investigated the contribution of Gla residues to the binding of Gas6 to PS. As shown in Fig. 1 C, no specific binding of Gla-deficient Gas6 to PS was observed, indicating that Gla residues are essential for the binding of Gas6 to PS. Since the interaction of Gla-containing blood coagulation factors with negatively charged phospholipids remarkably increases the activity of the coagulation factors, we next examined the effect of PS on the binding activity of Gas6 to its receptor Axl. TableI summarizes the effect of PS and PC onk a , k d , and K d estimated with BIAcore. The most significant effect of PS was observed on the k a value. PS but not PC increased it by 6-fold, whereas PS increased the k d value by about 4-fold. As a result, PS decreased the K d value by approximately 30%. On the other hand, PC decreasedk a and increased k d , resulting in an increase of K d by about 10-fold.Table IEffect of PS on kinetic constants for binding of Gas6 to AxlControl+PS+PCk a3.8 × 10421.8 × 1042.0 × 104k d1.5 × 10−55.8 × 10−59.8 × 10−5K d3.8 × 10−102.7 × 10−104.9 × 10−9Interaction of Gas6 with Axl was analyzed by BIAcore in the presence or absence of 100 μm PS or PC. Open table in a new tab Interaction of Gas6 with Axl was analyzed by BIAcore in the presence or absence of 100 μm PS or PC. The above results demonstrated that Gas6 interacted with PS and the interaction facilitated receptor binding of Gas6. However, the enhancement of receptor binding is not remarkable enough to consider it as a major meaning of the interaction of Gas6 with PS. On the other hand, these findings also implied that Gas6 might be a divalent ligand and raised the possibility of its function as an adhesion molecule. The requirement of Gla residues for the interaction of Gas6 with PS suggests that Gas6 binds to PS via the N-terminal Gla domain. Furthermore, it has been reported that Gas6 interacts with its receptor via the C-terminal globular domain (24Mark M.R. Chen J. Hammonds R.G. Sadick M. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9785-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Gas6 could connect the cells containing Gas6 receptor with the cells expressing PS on their surfaces. To assess this possibility, we examined the interaction of monoblastic cells U937 with PS coated on ELISA plates. It has been reported that U937 cells express Axl, a receptor for Gas6 (25Neubauer A. Fiebeler A. Graham D.K. O'Bryan J.P. Schmidt C.A. Barckow P. Serke S. Siegert W. Snodgrass H.R. Huhn D. Liu E.T. Blood. 1994; 84: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When U937 cells were incubated with an ELISA plate coated with PS, they did not bind to the plate (Fig. 2 A). However, when they were incubated in the presence of Gas6, U937 cells adhered to the plate (Fig. 2 B). In the experiment in Fig. 2, U937 cells and Gas6 were simultaneously incubated in PS-coated wells. On the other hand, when PS-coated wells were first incubated with Gas6, washed, and then incubated with U937 cells, the cells also adhered to the wells (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, Gas6 stimulated the binding of U937 cells to PS when the incubation was carried out at 4 °C instead of at 37 °C (data not shown). From these results, it is suggested that Gas6 interacts with PS and Axl at the different sites in Gas6 molecule and mediates adhesion of Axl-expressing cells to PS-expressing surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3, binding of U937 cells to PS required Ca2+, which is also required for the interaction of Gas6 with PS (Fig. 1 B) or receptor (20Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 also shows that Gla-deficient Gas6, which does not bind to PS (Fig. 1 C) or receptor (20Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), did not stimulate the binding of U937 cells to PS-coated plate.Figure 3Requirement of Gla residues of Gas6 and Ca2+ for Gas6-dependent adhesion of U937 cells to PS.

Binding of U937 cells to PS definitely required both Ca2+ and Gas6. U937 cells also adhered to the PI-coated plate, whereas the adhesion did not require Ca2+ or Gas6. U937 cells weakly adhered to the plates coated with PC or PE. However, the addition of Ca2+decreased the binding to PC or PE and Gas6 did not affect the binding. PS is normally almost totally confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane but has been reported to be exposed on apoptotic cells, senescent red blood cells, or activated platelets (26Fadok V.A.

Therefore, PS is supposed to be one of the markers for phagocytic macrophages to identify dying cells. Our results demonstrate that binding of monoblastic cells U937 to PS is dependent on Gas6. Thus, Gas6-mediated adhesion may be one of the mechanisms for phagocytic cells to recognize dying cells, which express PS on their surfaces. It has been reported that classes A and B macrophage scavenger receptors may be involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (29Platt N. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12456-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 30Fukusawa M. Adachi H. Hirota K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, adhesion of U937 cells to PI is not dependent on Gas6 or Ca2+. Therefore, adhesion to PI, another negatively charged phospholipid, may be mediated by other mechanisms including those scavenger receptors. In this study, we demonstrated that Gas6 links Axl-expressing cells to the PS-expressing surface and suggested that Gas6-dependent adhesion may be involved in the recognition of dying cells by phagocytic cells. The Gas6-mediated adhesion is unique since it also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation in receptor-expressing cells. The phosphorylation may stimulate phagocytic activity of the cells. However, further in vivo studies are necessary to clarify the physiological importance of the Gas6-mediated cell adhesion mechanism. We thank Dr. Koji Hanasaki for helpful discussions. We also thank Miho Okuyama and Ayako Terawaki for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1874911532,"A moderate elevation of plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and arterial and veinous thrombosis. However, the mechanisms leading to vascular disorders are poorly understood because studies that have investigated the potential atherothrombogenicity of hyperhomocysteinemia in vivo are scarce. Using a rat model, we were the first to show that dietary folic acid deficiency, a major cause of basal hyperhomocysteinemia, is associated with enhanced macrophage-derived tissue factor and platelet activities. We proposed that an homocysteine-induced oxidative stress may account for this hypercoagulable state. To determine the true thrombogenicity of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and better understand its etiology, we have carried out an acute methionine load in control and folate-deficient animals. When rats were fed the control diet, a transient fourfold increase in plasma homocysteine levels was observed 2 h after the methionine administration. As with prolonged dietary folic acid deficiency, this methionine load potentiated the platelet aggregation in response to thrombin and ADP as well as the thrombin-induced thromboxane synthesis. It also stimulated the basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue factor activity of peritoneal macrophages. These prothrombotic effects were associated with an increased lipid peroxidation characterized by an elevation of plasma conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. When rats were fed a folic acid-deficient diet, the methionine load did not cause any further increase in plasma homocysteine concentration, platelet activation, macrophage tissue factor-dependent coagulation, or lipoperoxidation. Altogether, our data showed that the prethrombotic state due to both the altered remethylation and transsulfuration pathways resulted from the moderate elevation of circulating homocysteine. We conclude that moderate hyperhomocysteinemia plays a role in the development of a thrombogenic state that might be mediated by the occurrence of oxidative stress.—Durand, P., Lussier-Cacan, S., Blache, D.

We show that the cell-death protease CPP32 (caspase-3) in vitro specifically cleaved chicken and human IκB-α at a conserved Asp-Ser sequence.

Other caspases, namely interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (caspase-1) and Ich-1 (caspase-2), did not cleave IκB-α. CPP32 also cleaved mammalian IκB-β in vitro at the analogous Asp-Ser sequence. Cleavage of IκB-α by CPP32 was blocked by serine phosphorylation of IκB-α. Cleavage of IκB-α by a CPP32- like protease could generate a constitutive inhibitor of Rel transcription complexes.

Apoptosis is a form of regulated programmed cell death that is involved in normal development and organ homeostasis (reviewed in Ref.1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.

One cellular pathway leading to apoptosis involves a family of related cysteine proteases (caspases) first defined by theCaenorhabditis elegans cell-death protease CED-3 and the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; aa, amino acid(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; aa, amino acid(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Although all caspases cleave C-terminal to Asp residues, individual proteases show distinct substrate specificities in vitro and can be divided into subfamilies based on substrate preference (3Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar, 4Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The caspase CPP32 shows a substrate specificity similar to that of CED-3, and CPP32 appears to be an important cell-death protease in vertebrates. For example, mice with a disruption of the gene encoding CPP32 have reduced neural cell death (5Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karauyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). It is likely that in many cell types specific cell-death proteases are activated in a sequential manner to lead to cell death (6Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Thus, one class of in vivo substrates for the cell-death proteases includes the caspases themselves. In addition, several other proteins have been identified as substrates for caspases (reviewed in Ref.3Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). The IκB proteins comprise a conserved family of proteins that act as regulators of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 7Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). IκB proteins are structurally related in that they all have a central core of ankyrin repeats that are essential for interaction with Rel complexes. Interaction of an IκB protein with a Rel complex usually results in retention of the Rel complex in the cytoplasm and inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the Rel complex. In the best characterized case, IκB-α interacts with and inhibits the activity of NF-κB. In response to a variety of signals, IκB-α becomes phosphorylated on two Ser residues in its N-terminal regulatory domain (8Brockman J.A. Sherer D.C. McKinnsey T.A. Hall S.A. Qi X. Lee W.H.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). This N-terminal phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination of IκB-α at nearby Lys residues, thereby targeting IκB-α for cleavage by the proteasome (11Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 12Baldi L. Brown K. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2425-2435PubMed Google Scholar). The free NF-κB complex can then enter the nucleus and affect gene transcription. We have previously shown that IκB-α undergoes a specific N-terminal cleavage in chicken spleen cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of the retroviral oncoprotein v-Rel when these cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by a shift to the nonpermissive temperature (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). This observation led us to suggest that IκB-α might be a direct substrate for a cell-death protease, which could cleave IκB-α at a conserved Asp near the N terminus (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 15White D.W. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that IκB-α is a substrate for CPP32in vitro. Cleavage of IκB-α by CPP32 could create a dominant inhibitor of Rel transcription complexes. Chicken spleen cell lines transformed by ts mutant v-G37E were cultured in Temin's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum as described previously (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of p40 was performed using the method of Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar), as described previously (17White D.W. Gilmore T.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An EcoRI to HincII fragment from an IκB-α/p40 cDNA was first subcloned into M13mp19. The following oligonucleotides were used on single-stranded DNA templates to create the indicated IκB-α/p40 mutants: D35A, 5′-GACGACCGCCACGCCAGCGGGCTGGAC-3′; D39A, 5′-GACCGCCACGACAGCGGGCTGGCCTCCATG-3′; S36A/S40A, 5′-CGCCACGACGCCGGGCTGGACGCCATGAAG-3′; S36E/S40E, 5′-GACCGCCACGACGAAGGGCTGGACGAACTGAAG-3′. The D35A mutation introduced aBstXI site that was used in screening for other mutations. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create in vitro expression vectors for IκB-α/p40, human IκB-α, and mouse IκB-β, cDNAs were subcloned into pGEM4. An EcoRI to HincII fragment containing wild-type p40 sequences was subcloned into pGEM4 digested withEcoRI and HincII; expression vectors for mutant IκB-α/p40 proteins were made by replacing wild-type sequences with appropriate mutant fragments. Wild-type and D31A human IκB-α inserts were subcloned as KpnI toNotI/Klenow-treated fragments into pGEM4 digested withKpnI and HincII. An EcoRI toXhoI fragment from a mouse IκB-β cDNA was subcloned into pGEM4 digested with EcoRI and SalI. All in vitrotranslations were performed in the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract (Promega) using SP6 polymerase in the presence of Tran35S-label (Amersham Corp.). Cleavage of in vitro translated proteins by individual caspases was performed as described previously (4Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated substrate proteins were incubated in CED-3 buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sucrose, 5% glycerol) with approximately 40 ng of a given bacterially produced and purified enzyme for 2–6 h at 30 or 37°C. Where indicated, the CPP32 inhibitor Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD; Bachem) was included at a concentration of 50 μm. Phosphorylation of in vitro translated p40 was carried out with purified IκB kinase as described previously (18Lee F.S. Jagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p40 was dephosphorylated by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 45 min at 30°C. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, and35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography or using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed as described previously (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-Rel primary antiserum (1:500) (19Gilmore T.D. Temin H.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 791-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody (anti-ANK; HY95) (1:2500) (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate secondary antiserum was added, and complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) and autoradiography. To determine whether chicken IκB-α (called p40 hereafter) could serve as a direct substrate of a caspase, in vitro translated p40 was incubated with bacterially expressed and purified ICE, CPP32, and Ich-1, which represent apparently distinct classes of enzymes within the caspase family (2Chinnaiyan A. Dixit V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). p40 was specifically cleaved by CPP32, but not by ICE or Ich-1 (Fig. 1 B). Cleavage of p40 in vitro by CPP32 was inhibited by Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD), a specific peptide inhibitor of CPP32-like proteases (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, p40 is a substrate of CPP32 in vitro. CPP32-like proteases cleave C-terminal to Asp residues that are frequently followed by Gly, Ser, or Ala and that are often in the consensus sequence Asp-X-X-Asp-Gly/Ser/Ala (3Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). There is a potential CPP32 cleavage site (Asp-Arg-His-Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser, aa 32–40; Fig.1 A) between aa 35 and 36 of p40. To determine if this was the site of CPP32 cleavage in p40, mutants with site-directed changes in p40 were incubated with CPP32 (Fig. 2,A and B). Mutant D35A, in which the predicted Asp cleavage site was changed to an Ala, was not detectably cleaved by CPP32. In contrast p40 mutant D39A was cleaved by CPP32 to a similar extent as wild-type p40. The cleaved form of p40 is not recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of p40, indicating that CPP32 cleaved near the N terminus of p40 in vitro (data not shown; Ref. 14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that CPP32 cleaved p40 between Asp-35 and Ser-36. We previously showed that p40 is cleaved near its N terminus in chicken spleen cells transformed by ts v-Rel mutant v-G37E when these cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by a shift to the nonpermissive temperature (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar, 15White D.W. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, A and B, the proteolyzed form of p40 generated by in vitro cleavage with CPP32 co-migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the major N-terminally truncated form of p40 seen in ts v-Rel-transformed cells undergoing apoptosis. This result suggests that the N-terminal cleavage of p40 in vitro by CPP32 is identical to the cleavage of p40 that occurs in ts v-G37E-transformed chicken spleen cells undergoing apoptosis. Ser-36 and Ser-40, which are located just beyond Asp-35 (the site of CPP32 cleavage) in p40, are sites of signal-induced phosphorylation (8Brockman J.A. Sherer D.C. McKinnsey T.A. Hall S.A. Qi X. Lee W.H. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brown K. Gerstburger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these Ser residues can be mimicked by Glu substitutions at these sites (8Brockman J.A. Sherer D.C. McKinnsey T.A. Hall S.A. Qi X. Lee W.H. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IκB-α can be phosphorylated in vitro at these Ser residues by a purified MEKK1-activated kinase from HeLa cells (18Lee F.S. Jagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation at these Ser residues affects the ability of p40 to serve as a substrate for CPP32, we tested whether p40 double mutant S36E/S40E as well as in vitro phosphorylated p40 could be cleaved by CPP32 in vitro (Fig.4). Neither the S36E/S40E mutant nor wild-type p40 phosphorylated at Ser-36 and Ser-40 in vitrowas cleaved by CPP32. In contrast, p40 mutant S36A/S40A (Ser → Ala) was cleaved by CPP32 to the same extent as wild-type nonphosphorylated p40. Treatment of phosphorylated p40 with calf intestinal phosphatase rendered p40 susceptible to cleavage by CPP32. Taken together, these results suggest that signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB-αin vivo would block its ability to be cleaved by a CPP32-like protease(s). The Asp-Ser sequence at aa 35–36 of chicken IκB-α/p40 is conserved in mammalian IκB-α and IκB-β (aa 31–32 in human IκB-α and aa 19–20 in mouse IκB-β; Fig. 1 A). To determine whether these mammalian IκB proteins could also serve as substrates for CPP32, in vitro translated human IκB-α and mouse IκB-β were incubated with CPP32 (Fig.5). Each mammalian IκB protein was cleaved by CPP32 to a size consistent with cleavage at this Asp-Ser sequence. Furthermore, human IκB-α mutant D31A, containing a mutation at the predicted Asp cleavage site, was not cleaved by CPP32. Thus, mammalian IκB proteins can also be cleaved by CPP32 in vitro. In this report, we describe biochemical evidence for a link between an apoptosis pathway and the Rel/NF-κB signal transduction pathway. Specifically, we have shown that IκB proteins can servein vitro as direct substrates for the cell-death protease CPP32. In addition, the chicken p40 cleavage product generated byin vitro cleavage with CPP32 appears to be identical to that generated in vivo in temperature-sensitive v-Rel-transformed cells undergoing apoptosis (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar, 15White D.W. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar). CPP32 is expressed in these cells, 2M. Barkett and T. D. Gilmore, unpublished results. indicating that CPP32 may be the in vivo cleaving activity; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that a related protease cleaves p40 in these cells. Three observations indicate that cleavage of p40 is not essential for the apoptosis that occurs in ts v-Rel-transformed cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. First, cleavage of p40 is a late event in ts v-Rel-transformed spleen cells undergoing apoptosis (14White D.W. Roy A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). Second, Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis in these cells but does not block cleavage of p40 (15White D.W. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar). Third, CrmA (a cowpox virus-encoded inhibitor of caspases) blocks N-terminal cleavage of p40 in these cells but does not block apoptosis (15White D.W. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 891-899PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that cleavage of IκB-α by a CPP32-like protease is distinct from signal-induced, proteasome-mediated cleavage of IκB-α. Namely, signal-induced cleavage of IκB-α requires phosphorylation at two N-terminal Ser residues, whereas phosphorylation or mutations that mimic phosphorylation at these Ser residues block the ability of CPP32 to cleave IκB-α. Therefore, we appear to have identified a novel pathway for proteolysis of IκB-α. Overexpression of an N-terminally deleted form of IκB-α, which is resistant to ubiquitination-based degradation, prevents activation of NF-κB (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). Therefore, cleavage of IκB-α by a CPP32-like protease could create what is sometimes called a super-repressor form of IκB-α (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). That is, cleavage by CPP32 would block the ability of IκB-α to undergo signal-induced degradation by removing the sites of signal-induced ubiquitination and by likely disrupting the ability of IκB-α to become phosphorylated at critical Ser residues. Therefore, cleavage of IκB-α by CPP32 would block activation of Rel/NF-κB complexes and their responsive genes. Activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor has recently been shown to induce two conflicting pathways, one leading to CPP32-mediated apoptosis and one leading to activation of NF-κB, which is anti-apoptotic (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar, 21Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activation by a noninducible form of IκB-α renders cells more susceptible to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar, 21Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Therefore, cleavage of IκB-α by a CPP32-like protease may act to facilitate, rather than effect, apoptosis. We thank G. Pitoc for excellent technical assistance, Drs. D. White and S.

https://openalex.org/W1619037645,"The objective of this study was to generate an immortal cell line representative of specialized human brain microvascular endothelia forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Human capillary and microvascular endothelial cells (HCEC) were transfected with the plasmid pSV3-neo coding for the SV40 large T antigen and the neomycin gene. The neomycin-resistant transfected cells overcame proliferative senescence, and after a 6-8 wk period of crisis produced immortalization-competent cell colonies. Single-cell clones of near-diploid genotype were isolated from these colonies, propagated, and characterized. Immortalized HCEC (SV-HCEC) exhibited accelerated proliferation rates, but remained serum and anchorage dependent and retained the characteristic cobblestone morphology at confluence. SV-HCEC displayed a stable nuclear expression of SV40 large T antigen, lacked the invasiveness of transformed cells, and maintained major phenotypic properties of early passage control cells including expression of factor VIII-related antigen, uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein, binding of fluorescently labeled lectins, expression of transferrin receptor and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis, and high activities of the BBB-specific enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The diffusion of radiolabeled sucrose across SV-HCEC monolayers was fivefold lower than that observed with human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, media conditioned by fetal human astrocytes increased the transendothelial electrical resistance of SV-HCEC monolayers by 2.5-fold. Therefore, this newly established human cell line expressing the specialized phenotype of BBB endothelium may serve as a readily available in vitro model for studying the properties of the human BBB."
https://openalex.org/W1988277042,"The transcription factor Elk-1 is a component of ternary complex factor and regulates gene expression in response to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of Elk-1, especially at serine 383, is important for its transactivation activity. Recently mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase have been demonstrated to be Elk-1 kinases. However, negative regulators of Elk-1, such as protein phosphatases, still remain to be identified. Here we report that COS cell lysates were able to dephosphorylate an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-Elkc fusion protein, including serine 383. The phosphatase activity was inhibited by cyclosporin A (a calcineurin inhibitor) but not by okadaic acid (a PP1 and PP2A inhibitor). Purified calcineurin also could efficiently dephosphorylate glutathione S-transferase-Elkc in vitro. Pretreatment of COS cells with cyclosporin A significantly enhanced epidermal growth factor-induced serine 383 Elk-1 phosphorylation whereas ionomycin inhibited the Elk-1 phosphorylation. These data provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that calcineurin is the major Elk-1 phosphatase and plays a critical role in Elk-1 regulation. The identification of calcineurin as the major Elk-1 phosphatase may provide a mechanism for Elk-1 regulation by Ca2+ signals as well as a possible biochemical basis for the neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A."

CGP 53716 inhibited dose dependently tyrosine phosphorylation of both the known PDGFRs: the PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta. In primary rat SMC cultures, a dose-dependent inhibition of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB induced migration, and tritiated thymidine incorporation of SMC was seen at nontoxic concentrations. After rat carotid artery ballooning injury in vivo, the migration of alpha-actin-positive cells on the luminal side of internal elastic lamina was decreased with 50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of CGP 53716 from 38 +/- 10 (control group) to 4 +/- 2 (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, N=18). CGP 53716 did not inhibit the number of replicating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporating cells in the intima, media, or adventitia during BrdU labeling at 0-96 postoperative h, though it inhibited significantly (P<0.01) the replication of medial and intimal cells from 93 h onward. Intima/media ratio was inhibited by 40% after 14 days in the CGP 53716-treated group (P=0.028) after rat aortic denudation. The results indicate that inhibition of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibits SMC migration and proliferation in vitro, SMC migration, and, to a lesser extent, proliferation after ballooning injury in vivo, confirming a causal role for activation of the PDGFR and the formation of neointimal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2313277012,"The ATF/CREB family of eukaryotic transcription factors contain the bZIP structural motif and mediate their transcriptional activities via heterodimerization with ATF and AP-1 family members. Quenching of CREB-associated proteins by a dominant-negative CREB (KCREB) that is mutated within its DNA-binding domain decreases radiation resistance of human melanoma cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of CREB in tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma using KCREB. Highly metastatic MeWo human melanoma cells were transfected with the KCREB expression vector and subsequently analysed for changes in their tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Expression of KCREB in MeWo human cells decreased their tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nude mice compared with parental and control transfected cells. The KCREB-transfected cells displayed downregulation of 72 kDa collagenase type IV (MMP-2) mRNA expression and activity and decreased invasiveness through Matrigel-coated filters. Moreover, transcriptional activities mediated by the CAT gene driven by the MMP-2 promoter were decreased by 14 – 45-fold in KCREB-transfected cells. In addition, the cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 that is involved in metastasis of human melanoma was downregulated in the KCREB-transfected cells. These data indicate that, through their transcriptional activities, CREB and its associated proteins play an important role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007243487,"CCR5 and CD4 are coreceptors for immunodeficiency virus entry into target cells. The gp120 envelope glycoprotein from human immunodeficiency virus strain HIV-1(YU2) bound human CCR5 (CCR5hu) or rhesus macaque CCR5 (CCR5rh) only in the presence of CD4. The gp120 from simian immunodeficiency virus strain SIVmac239 bound CCR5rh without CD4, but CCR5hu remained CD4-dependent. The CD4-independent binding of SIVmac239 gp120 depended on a single amino acid, Asp13, in the CCR5rh amino-terminus. Thus, CCR5-binding moieties on the immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein can be generated by interaction with CD4 or by direct interaction with the CCR5 amino-terminus. These results may have implications for the evolution of receptor use among lentiviruses as well as utility in the development of effective intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1584880758,"Apoptosis of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) is thought to be critical for the control of the inflammatory process, but the mechanisms underlying its regulation in physiological settings are still incompletely understood. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the beta2 integrin (CD11/CD18) family of leukocyte adhesion molecules contributes to the control of activated PMN by up-regulating apoptosis. Apoptosis of isolated human PMN was investigated by 1) analysis of DNA content, 2) detection of DNA degradation, 3) morphological studies, and 4) measurement of CD16 expression on the cell surface. We found that beta2 integrins potentiated the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) -induced apoptosis within 4 and 8 h after stimulation. The effect required aggregation of the beta2 integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), which was induced by antibody cross-linking, and was independent of Fc receptors. An enhancement of apoptosis was also observed after migration of PMN through an endothelial cell monolayer. TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis as well as potentiation by beta2 integrins was prevented by inhibition of tyrosine kinases with herbimycin A or genistein. The present study provides a new model for the regulation of PMN apoptosis by a functional cross-talk between beta2 integrins and TNF-alpha with a promoting role for the beta2 integrins. This mechanism, which allows enhanced elimination of previously emigrated PMN, may be critical to abate local inflammatory processes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1971140306,"Malignant gliomas extensively infiltrate the surrounding normal brain, and their diffuse invasion is one of the most important barriers to successful therapy. Recent studies indicate that the progression of gliomas from low-grade to high-grade may depend on the acquisition of a new phenotype and the subsequent addition of genetic defects. One of the most frequent abnormalities in the progression of gliomas is the inactivation of tumor-suppressor gene p16, suggesting that loss of p16 is associated with acquisition of malignant characteristics. Consistent with this hypothesis, our previous studies showed that restoring wild-type p16 activity into p16-null malignant glioma cells modified their phenotype. In order to understand whether the biological consequences of p16 inactivation in high-grade gliomas included facilitating invasiveness, we used a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus carrying the cDNA of the p16/CDKN2 gene to infect and express high levels of p16 protein in p16-null SNB19 glioma cells. Invasion of SNB19 glioma cells was tested into two models: invasion of glioma cells through Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and invasion of tumor-cell spheroids into fetal rat-brain aggregates in a co-culture system. Matrigel invasion assays showed that the SNB19 cells expressing exogenous p16 exhibited significantly reduced invasion. Similarly, invasion of p16-treated SNB19 cells into fetal rat-brain aggregates was reduced during a 72 h time period compared to invasion of the adenovirus-control and mock-infected cells. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), an enzyme involved in tumor-cell invasion, in SNB19 cells expressing p16 was significantly reduced compared to that of parental SNB19 and vector-infected cells. Our results show that restoring wild-type p16 activity into p16-null SNB19 glioma cells significantly inhibits tumor-cell invasion, thus suggesting a novel function of the p16 gene."

They demonstrate how to avoid anomalous transport and thus solve the major problems of Tokamak reactors: size, the production of 14-megaelectron volt neutrons, and maintenance. An alternate confinement system, the field-reversed configuration, confines beams of protons and boron-11. For the proton–boron-11 fusion reaction, the fusion products are all charged particles for which direct conversion is feasible and neutron flux is negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2327027083,"Intragenic deletions of TSG101, the human homolog of a mouse gene (tsg101) that acts to suppress malignant cell growth, were reported in human breast tumours. We screened TSG101 for somatic mutations in DNA and RNA samples isolated from a variety of common human malignancies, EBV-immortalised B-cells, and normal lung parenchyma. Intragenic TSG101 deletions in RNA transcripts were frequently found in all types of samples. Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples. The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic splice site sequences, suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing. A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the putative tumour suppressor gene FHIT. We analysed FHIT in the same series of RNA samples and detected truncated FHIT transcripts frequently in both tumour and normal tissues. In addition, transcripts from TSG101, FHIT and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Large TSG101 and FHIT intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in 'aged' lymphocytes. Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed. Our findings demonstrate that truncated TSG101 and FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing. While we cannot exclude that alterations in TSG101 and FHIT occur during cancer development, our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading."
https://openalex.org/W1913713515,"Skeletal muscle glutamine uptake via the transport system Nm is subject to rapid (t(1/2) = approximately 1 min) regulation after changes in cell volume by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. Wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) but not rapamycin (inhibitor of p70S6 kinase activation) prevents both hypo-osmotic swelling-induced stimulation and hyperosmotic shrinkage-induced inhibition of Na+-dependent glutamine uptake in primary culture of rat skeletal muscle. G-protein inhibitors (cholera, pertussis toxins) also abolished responses of glutamine transport to cell volume changes whereas these responses were sustained in the presence of G-protein activators (MAS 7, lysophosphatidic acid). Swelling-induced activation of glutamine transport does not seem to involve release of autocrine factors because ""conditioned"" medium from swollen cells has no effect on previously unstimulated cells. System A amino acid transport exhibits responses to cell volume change that are opposite to those of system Nm, but these are also blocked by wortmannin. Active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase appears to be required to enable muscle cells to exhibit rapid, volume-induced changes in amino acid transport when suitably stimulated."
https://openalex.org/W2031796624,"We have cloned a cDNA encoding a novel protein of 302 amino acids (designated Noc2, no C2 domain) that has 40.7% amino acid identity with and 77.9% similarity to the N-terminal region of rabphilin-3A, a target molecule of Rab3A. However, unlike rabphilin-3A, Noc2 lacks two C2 domains that are thought to interact with Ca2+ and phospholipids. Noc2 is expressed predominantly in endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines and at very low levels in brain. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions of the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 and immunocytochemistry reveal that Noc2 is a 38-kDa protein present in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of Noc2 in PC12 cells cotransfected with growth hormone enhances high K+-induced growth hormone secretion. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system shows that Noc2 interacts with the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin, a component of the cytoskeleton, and this interaction is further confirmed by the coimmunoprecipitation experiment.

Accordingly, Noc2 is probably involved in regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the cytoskeleton. Exocytosis is a key step in neurotransmitter and hormone secretions from neurons and endocrine cells, respectively (1Südhof T.C.

These secretions are regulated by Ca2+, which triggers exocytosis (3Bennet M.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In neurons, the small GTP-binding protein Rab3A plays an important role in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (4Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C.

Although, like synaptotagmins, which are a candidate for calcium sensor in neurotransmitter release (9Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Nils B. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), rabphilin-3A has two repeats of the C2 domain (regulatory domain of protein kinase C that confers Ca2+ and phospholipid binding) in the C-terminal half, rabphilin-3A is unique in that it has a Rab3A-binding domain in the N-terminal region (6Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The recently identified Doc2α and Doc2β also have two repeats of the C2 domain, but lack the Rab3A-binding domain (10Orita S. Sasaki S. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H.

Previously, we identified synaptotagmin III, which is expressed at high levels in endocrine tissues (14Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11675-11678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and suggested that synaptotagmin III is a candidate for the Ca2+ sensor in insulin release from pancreatic β-cells (15Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of the exocytosis-associated proteins in endocrine cells is not well known. Although Rab3A is expressed in neuronal cells and endocrine cells, rabphilin-3A is expressed exclusively in neurons and neuron-like cells and is absent or present at very low levels in endocrine cells (16Inagaki N. Mizuta M. Seino S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reasoning that a putative target for Rab3A might be expressed specifically in endocrine cells, we screened a rat pancreatic islet and the insulin-secreting cell line RINm5F cDNA libraries using a DNA fragment encoding the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin-3A as a probe. We identified a novel protein that has a high similarity to the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin-3A but lacks the C2 domain. Our data also suggest that Noc2 is involved in regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the cytoskeleton. 700,000 plaques of a rat islet cDNA library were hybridized under low stringency conditions (17Fukumoto H. Seino S. Imura H. Seino Y. Eddy R.L. Fukushima Y. Byers M.G. Showes T.B. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) using a mouse rabphilin-3A cDNA (16Inagaki N. Mizuta M. Seino S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a probe. Five clones encoded a partial rabphilin-3A-related protein (designated Noc2). A full-length Noc2 clone was isolated from a RINm5F cDNA library. Both strands of DNA were sequenced. RNA blot analysis was performed under standard stringent hybridization conditions with32P-labeled 580-base pair Noc2 cDNA. Membranes were washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 1 h and were exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screen at −80 °C for 36 h. Anti-Noc2 antiserum was raised by immunizing rabbits with 17-mer peptide (GATDPQGGTLPRPEPRV) corresponding to amino acid residues 274–290 of Noc2. The antisera were purified through a protein G-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The anti-Noc2 and anti-synaptotagmin III antibodies (15Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were used in 1:1000 and 1:5000 dilution, respectively. Blots were probed with these antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp.), and proteins were detected with ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.). Discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation of the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 was performed according to the method described by Wendland and Scheller (18Wendland B. Scheller R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (15Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Each postnuclear fraction containing 2–20 μg of protein was precipitated with 15% of trichloroacetate, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. MIN6 cells grown on chamber slides were incubated in HEPES balanced Krebs-Ringer buffer, fixed with 4% of paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoreactivity of Noc2 was detected with anti-Noc2 antibody and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Immunoreactivity of insulin was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-rat insulin antibody (Advanced Immuno Chemical, Long Beach, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) (15Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA of Noc2 or β-galactosidase was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pSRα. PC12 cells, a rat catecholamine-secreting cell line, were plated at a density of 3 × 105/35-mm dish and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. The cells were cotransfected with GH 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; PSS, physiological salt solution; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; kb, kilobase(s). expression vector pXGH5 (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) (1 μg) and pSRαNoc2 (1 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As controls, cells were cotransfected with pXGH5 (1 μg) and pSRαβgal (1 μg). 3 days after transfection, PC12 cells were washed with a PSS (140 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 11 mm glucose) and incubated for 2.5, 5, or 10 min with a high K+ solution (PSS containing 60 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl) or a low K+ solution (PSS containing 4.7 mm KCl and 140 mm NaCl). GH was measured by enzyme immunoassay kit (Picoia, Sumitomo, Osaka, Japan). Secretion was expressed as a percentage of the GH amounts released into the medium relative to the total cellular GH amounts (19Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was transformed with a derivative of pBTM116 bearing a full-length Noc2 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (pBTM116-Noc2) using the lithium acetate method (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Strain L40 carrying pBTM116-Noc2 was transformed with a mouse embryonic cDNA library. Approximately 1.96 × 106 transformants were screened for growth on Yc plate medium (2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 1% succinic acid, and 0.12% yeast nitrogen base) containing 0.5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole but lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, and leucine. His+ colonies were then placed on the paper filters and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for β-galactosidase activity as described (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Four HIS+ and LacZ+ positive clones were obtained with this screening. The plasmids were recovered through Escherichia colitransformation. The protein coding region Noc2 cDNA was subcloned in frame into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). The pGEX-2T-Noc2 was transformed into JM109. The expressed protein was affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The N-terminal fragment of mouse zyxin (amino acids 343–564) cDNA was subcloned in frame into pFLAG-MAC (Kodak/IBI, New Haven, CT). The expressed protein was affinity-purified by Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Kodak/IBI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For coimmnoprecipitation experiments, the purified GST-Noc2 (1 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the purified FLAG-zyxin (1 μg) in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) was then added. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the binding buffer, the mixture was eluted with the elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm glutathione) and was then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation with Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Kodak/IBI) was performed similarly. The sequence of the longest insert (1934 base pairs) of λ clones contains an open reading frame encoding a 302-amino acid protein (M r = 33431.2) having 40.7% identity with and 77.9% similarity to the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–304) of rat rabphilin-3A (Fig.1). However, unlike rabphilin-3A, it lacks the C2 domains and was therefore designated Noc2 (no C2 domain). Interestingly, Noc2 has a putative metal ion-binding domain containing a cluster of cysteine residues that is also conserved in rabphilin-3A. There are a potential protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation site and three potential protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites in Noc2. RNA blot analysis revealed that a single 2.2- or 2.6-kb transcript of Noc2 is expressed at very high levels in pancreatic islets; at moderate to high levels in ovary, adrenal, pituitary, and PC12 cells and the insulin secreting cell lines RINm5F (rat), MIN6 (mouse), and HIT-T15 (hamster); and at low levels in testis, the rat GH-secreting cell line GH3, and the mouse adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting cell line AtT20 (Fig.2). Noc2 mRNA is detected at only very low levels in brain after a longer exposure (data not shown). Noc2 protein is detected as a 38-kDa protein in total proteins prepared from MIN6 cells and PC12 cells (data not shown). Fig.3 A shows the immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions prepared from MIN6 cells probed with anti-Noc2 and anti-synaptotagmin III antibodies. Noc2 was detected as a 38-kDa protein in fractions 2–8, peaking at fraction 3. In contrast, synaptotagmin III, which is present in large dense core vesicle in MIN6 cells (15Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), was detected in fraction at 9 and 10 (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows the representative of double-immunostaining of MIN6 cell for Noc2 and insulin. Noc2 was detected diffusely and partially dotted in the cytoplasm of MIN6 cells. Total amounts of GH produced in PC12 cells transfected with human GH ranged from 3 to 10 ng/35-mm dish. The basal secretion of GH (expressed as a percentage of GH amounts released into the medium containing 4.7 mm K+ relative to amounts of total cellular GH) is not significantly different between Noc2-transfected (8.5 ± 0.87%) and control cells (8.7 ± 0.99%). Upon high K+ (60 mm) stimulation, GH secretion from PC12 cells cotransfected with GH and Noc2 was significantly higher than that seen in controls (Fig.4). A putative target of Noc2 was isolated from a mouse embryonic cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system with the full-length Noc2 used as a bait. We isolated four clones, one encoding a partial amino acid sequence of zyxin (amino acids 353–509). FLAG-zyxin was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 5). In addition, GST-Noc2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with zyxin by Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Fig. 5). In the present study we have identified a novel protein designated Noc2. Noc2 has structural features characterized by 1) a high degree of similarity to the N-terminal region of rabphilin-3A, 2) no C2 domain, and 3) no putative transmembrane region. Interestingly, Noc2 has a putative zinc finger motif composed of a cysteine-rich sequence that is conserved among rabphilin-3A and a recently identified putative Rab3 effector, RIM (21Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Because rabphilin-3A has been shown to bind Rab3A via this domain in a zinc-dependent manner (22Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we assumed that Noc2 might also interact with Rab3 members. However, Noc2 did not bind Rab3A, Rab3B, or Rab3C under the conditions in which rabphilin-3A binds Rab3A, 2T. Sasaki and Y. Takai, unpublished observation. although we cannot exclude the possibility that Noc2 might bind other members of the Rab3 subfamily or their related proteins. To search for a molecule that interacts with Noc2, we screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and identified zyxin as a candidate. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Noc2 interacts with zyxin. Zyxin is a cytoskeletal element that exhibits an unusual proline-rich N terminus followed by three tandemly arrayed LIM domains (23Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The LIM domain contains the cysteine-rich consensus sequence CX 2CX 16–23HX 2CX 4CX 2CX 16–21CX 2–3(C/H/D) (24Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This domain participates in protein-protein interaction in a zinc-dependent manner (24Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the zinc finger domain of Noc2 interacts with one of the LIM domains in zyxin. In fact, we have found by the yeast two-hybrid system that the zinc finger containing N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–200) of Noc2 interacts with the fragment between the first and a part of the third LIM domain of zyxin (data not shown). Rabphilin-3A has been shown to interact with α-actinin, a component of the cytoskeleton, and possibly to be involved in the predocking and docking process of synaptic vesicles by linking Rab3A to the cytoskeleton (25Kato M. Sasaki T. Ohya T. Nakanishi H. Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This Rab3A-rabphilin-3A system is suggested to regulate reorganization of actin filaments (25Kato M. Sasaki T. Ohya T. Nakanishi H. Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a proline-rich domain in the N-terminal region of zyxin has been shown to interact with α-actinin (26Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Noc2 may participate in the reorganization of actin filaments by interacting with zyxin. Although rabphilin-3A is expressed predominantly in brain, Noc2 is expressed predominantly in endocrine cells and is poorly expressed in brain. Overexpression of rabphilin-3A in PC12 cells enhances high K+-induced GH secretion from the cells transfected with GH (27Chung S.H. Takai Y. Holtz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16714-16718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have found that overexpression of Noc2 in PC12 cells also enhances high K+-induced secretion, further suggesting involvement of Noc2 in Ca2+-triggered secretion. Because Noc2 lacks the C2 domain and is not present in large dense core vesicle in MIN6 cells, it remains to be determined whether Noc2 interacts directly or indirectly with vesicle-associated proteins having the C2 domain. Considering these findings together, Noc2 participates in regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells probably by interacting with the cytoskeleton. We thank S. Hollenberg for providing us with the mouse embryonic cDNA library and A. Tamamoto for excellent technical assistance."

To determine the role(s) of receptor phosphorylation in FPR processing and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLF)-mediated chemotaxis, we utilized U937 cells expressing the recombinant wild type receptor and a mutant form of the FPR. This mutant, which lacks all of the serine and threonine residues in the C terminus of the receptor, ΔST, has recently been shown to produce a receptor capable of fMLF binding and G protein activation but was demonstrated not to undergo fMLF-dependent phosphorylation or desensitization of the calcium mobilization response upon repeated exposure to agonist (Prossnitz, E. R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15213–15219). In this report, we examined the role of receptor phosphorylation in FPR internalization and leukocyte chemotaxis. Whereas the wild type receptor was rapidly internalized upon stimulation, the phosphorylation-deficient mutant was not, remaining entirely on the cell surface. In addition, contrary to the hypothesis that receptor processing and recycling are required for chemotaxis, we found no defect in the ability of the mutant FPR to migrate up a concentration gradient of fMLF. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the FPR is a necessary step in receptor internalization but that receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization are not required for chemotaxis.

These results indicate that phosphorylation of the FPR is a necessary step in receptor internalization but that receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization are not required for chemotaxis. Neutrophils normally exist in a resting state as they circulate though the body. However, upon interaction with small molecules known as chemoattractants, they rapidly respond with endothelial adhesion followed by emigration from the vasculature and chemotaxis to the site of inflammation (1Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chemoattractants activate neutrophils through binding to heptahelical receptors located on the cell surface (2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 3Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These receptors activate heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; FPR, N-formyl peptide receptor; Nle, norleucine; fMLF,N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution. that initiate numerous elaborate signal transduction cascades, culminating in neutrophil migration and activation. Once at the site of inflammation, neutrophils respond with phagocytosis, superoxide generation, and the release of degradative enzymes (4Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). One of the most thoroughly studied chemoattractant receptors is the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), which recognizes short N-formylated oligopeptides of bacterial or mitochondrial origin (5Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol.

Leukocyte chemotaxis has been shown to be dependent on the binding of chemoattractants to their respective receptors (8Zigmond S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following binding of the ligand and cellular activation, the receptors undergo desensitization and internalization (10van Epps D.E. Simpson S. Bender J.G. Chenoweth D.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1062-1068PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wilde M.W. Carlson K.E. Manning D.R. Zigmond S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 190-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once internalized, ligand dissociates from the receptor and is degraded, whereupon the receptor is recycled to the cell surface for additional rounds of activation (10van Epps D.E. Simpson S. Bender J.G. Chenoweth D.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1062-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor recycling has been suggested to be essential for sustained cellular responses, such as cell chemotaxis (12Perez H.D. Elfman F. Marder S. Lobo E. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Perez H.D. Ong R. Khanna K. Banda D. Goldstein I.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2718-2724PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of receptor recycling through exposure to wheat germ agglutinin or by neuraminidase treatment was found to block chemotaxis without affecting receptor-mediated superoxide generation or degranulation. Receptor endocytosis was also demonstrated to proceed normally with the internalized receptor accumulating within the cell and not being re-expressed to the cell surface (12Perez H.D. Elfman F. Marder S. Lobo E. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Perez H.D. Ong R. Khanna K. Banda D. Goldstein I.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2718-2724PubMed Google Scholar). A role for neutral endopeptidase has also been implicated through the use of the inhibitor phosphoramidon (14Painter R.G. Dukes R. Sullivan J. Carter R. Erdos E.G. Johnson A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9456-9461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with this inhibitor blocked degradation of the internalized ligand as well as re-expression of the internalized receptor, suggesting that dissociation of the ligand from the receptor and its subsequent hydrolysis are essential for receptor recycling (15Painter R.G. Aiken M.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In fact, degradation of internalized ligand was shown to occur at a rate proportional to receptor re-expression, suggesting that the former process may be rate-limiting. Inhibition of receptor recycling through this method specifically blocked chemotaxis but not other neutrophil responses, providing further support for the conclusion that receptor recycling is required for chemotaxis (15Painter R.G. Aiken M.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that phosphorylation of the FPR is an essential step in the functional desensitization of the receptor. In this report, we investigated the role of receptor phosphorylation in the internalization process as a means to examine the role of receptor processing in chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate that although receptor phosphorylation is absolutely essential to receptor desensitization and internalization, neither phosphorylation nor receptor internalization is required for cell chemotaxis. The cDNA encoding the FPR was obtained from a human HL-60 granulocyte library as described previously (16Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein and indo-1AM were obtained from Molecular Probes. fMLF was purchased from Sigma. Carrier-free, acid-free [32P]orthophosphate was from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Chemotaxis chambers (48-well) were from Neuroprobe with cellulose nitrate filters from Toyo. RPMI was from Whittaker Bioproducts; fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. The FPR cDNA was subcloned and mutagenized as described (16Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For transfection, approximately 4 × 106 cells were harvested and resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (18Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715PubMed Google Scholar). Linearized DNA (10 μg in a volume of 10 μl) was added to the cells and preincubated for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then subjected to a 240-V pulse from a 960-microfarad capacitor (resulting in a pulse time constant of approximately 30 ms) and immediately returned to 5–10 ml of culture medium. The following day, G418 was added to a final active concentration of 1 mg/ml. As the selection proceeded, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium (containing G418) at 4–6-day intervals. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2 and 94% air. Phosphorylation of the FPR was determined as described (19Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, FPR-transfected U937 cells were harvested and washed extensively to remove traces of phosphate. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 1 mCi of carrier-free, acid-free [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml). Cells were loaded for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently stimulated with fMLF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by the addition of 0.33 volume of 4 × radioimmune precipitation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 2% deoxycholate, 4% Triton X-100, 4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 mmsodium phosphate, 40 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 ng/ml aprotinin, and 200 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following lysis, extraction, and removal of insoluble debris, the supernatant was added to 10 mg of Protein A-Sepharose, which had been precoated with 15 μl of a rabbit antiserum directed against the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the FPR, and incubated for 1 h while rotating at 4 °C. The beads were then washed as follows: once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, pH 8.0; once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0; once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0; and finally with phosphate-buffered saline. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, and 32P content was determined with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To assess desensitization, the ability of the cells to respond to ligand with a calcium mobilization response was monitored. For calcium determinations, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS). The cells were incubated with 5 μm indo-1AM for 25 min at 37 °C, washed once with HBSS, and resuspended to a concentration of approximately 106 cells/ml in HBSS containing 1.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. The elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by fMLF was monitored by continuous fluorescence measurement using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco) detecting at 400 and 490 nm, respectively, as described (16Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ was calculated as described (20Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For desensitization determinations, cells were first pretreated with 1 μm fMLF, and the response was recorded. The stimulated cells were then removed from the cuvette, washed three times with HBSS at room temperature to remove surface-bound fMLF, and replaced in the cuvette. The response of the washed cells to a second stimulation with 1 μm fMLF was then determined. Receptor internalization was first determined as the loss of FPR from the cell surface as follows. FPR-transfected U937 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in HBSS. Cells were then stimulated with 1 μm fMLF for 10 min at 37 °C and washed three times with HBSS. Remaining cell surface receptors were determined with 10 nm N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein. Following incubation for at least 15 min on ice, cells were analyzed for fluorescent intensity on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with dead cells excluded by a gate on forward and side scatter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Receptor internalization was determined relative to cells that had not been treated with fMLF. Internalization was also evaluated as the intracellular accumulation of fML[3H]F as follows. FPR-transfected U937 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in HBSS. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of fML[3H]F at 37 °C for 60 min. Control cells were incubated on ice (which prevents endocytosis) or with excess unlabeled fMLF to determine nonspecific binding and internalization. After incubation, cell samples were added to 10 volumes of 0.2 m glycine (pH 3.0) containing 0.5m NaCl for 5 min on ice. This incubation removes ligand bound to the cell surface but has no effect on internalized ligand. Cell samples added to 10 volumes of cold Hanks' buffer (as opposed to pH 3.0 glycine) provided total fML[3H]F associated with the cell, both internal and external. Free ligand was separated from cell-associated ligand by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters followed by three washes with cold dilution buffer. Results are expressed as the percentage of saturably bound fML[3H]F that is internalized and normalized to the amount internalized by the wild type FPR. Cell migration was quantitated with a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe) using 5.0- or 8.0-μm pore size cellulose nitrate filters (9Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells and fMLF were prepared in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin. Chemoattractant was placed in the lower chamber and covered with the cellulose nitrate filter. Cells (4 × 106/ml) were placed in the upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following the incubation, the filter was fixed with isopropyl alcohol, stained with hematoxylin, and mounted on a microscope slide. The distance migrated by the cells (in μm) was determined by the leading edge technique (21Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). For each evaluation, five fields per duplicate filter were measured at 400-fold magnification. The data are presented as the distance migrated by the leading front of the cells in a 2-h span. It has been well established that G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors mediate leukocyte chemotaxis (22Snyderman R. Smith C.D. Verghese M.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 40: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The signal transduction cascade initiated by these receptors has also been shown to be essential since treatment of cells with pertussis toxin, which blocks the interaction of Gi proteins with receptors, completely abolishes leukocyte chemotaxis (23Lad P.M. Olson C.V. Grewal I.S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 200: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Becker E.L. Kermode J.C. Naccache P.H. Yassin R. Marsh M.L. Munoz J.J. Sha'afi R.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Spangrude G.J. Sacchi F. Hill H.R. Van Epps D.E. Daynes R.A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 4135-4143PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, actin polymerization has been demonstrated to be essential, since cytochalasins, which block actin polymerization, also abolish chemotaxis (26Pham Huu T. Biomedicine (Paris). 1979; 30: 121-124PubMed Google Scholar, 27Becker E.L. Davis A.T. Estensen R.D. Quie P.G. J. Immunol. 1972; 108: 396-402PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the signaling between these two events, however, remains unclear. We have sought to determine the role of receptor processing in these events. Previous experiments have suggested that recycling of chemoattractant receptors is essential for chemotaxis to take place. This conclusion was based on a number of experiments, which correlated a block in the re-expression of internalized chemoattractant receptors with a lack of chemotactic ability despite normal ligand binding, cell activation of superoxide generation and degranulation, and normal receptor internalization (15Painter R.G. Aiken M.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Perez H.D. Elfman F. Lobo E. Sklar L. Chenoweth D. Hooper C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1803-1812PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a unique approach to investigate the role of receptor processing in chemotaxis. We have previously demonstrated that U937 myeloid cells stably transfected with chemoattractant receptors such as the FPR are capable of migrating up a chemotactic gradient (9Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This chemotactic response is indistinguishable from the response observed with differentiated U937 cells or neutrophils. To evaluate the role of receptor processing, we compared U937 cells transfected with the wild type FPR to U937 cells transfected with a mutant form of the FPR, ΔST, in which all of the serine and threonine residues in the C terminus have been converted to alanines and glycines. Fig. 1 demonstrates that, whereas the wild type FPR becomes phosphorylated upon stimulation with fMLF, the ΔST mutant does not. That the mutant form of the FPR was capable of responding to fMLF was demonstrated by monitoring the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Upon fMLF stimulation, both the wild type and ΔST mutant underwent similar degrees of calcium mobilization (Fig. 2). This indicated that in the absence of receptor phosphorylation, ligand binding and G protein activation remained intact. We examined desensitization of the fMLF-initiated calcium mobilization response by taking cells that had been exposed to a saturating concentration of fMLF yielding a maximal calcium mobilization response, washing them extensively to remove bound ligand, and determining their responsiveness to a second exposure to fMLF. As expected for the wild type FPR, the amount of calcium mobilization following a second exposure to agonist was minimal (Fig.2). However, exposing fMLF-treated ΔST cells to a second dose of ligand yielded a calcium response of the same magnitude as that observed for the first exposure. These results confirm that receptor phosphorylation is an essential step in the functional desensitization of the receptor-mediated response.Figure 2Desensitization of calcium mobilization of the wild type FPR and ΔST mutant. FPR desensitization was determined as the decrease in fMLF-stimulated elevation of intracellular calcium in response to a second exposure to fMLF. Cells expressing the wild type (WT) and ΔST mutant form of the FPR were loaded with indo-1AM and stimulated (pretreated) with 1 μm fMLF. The cells were then washed extensively to remove bound ligand and re-assessed for calcium mobilization in response to a second stimulation with 1 μm fMLF. Data represent mean ± S.E. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine what mechanism may underlie this phenomenon, we next evaluated the ability of the receptor to undergo ligand-stimulated internalization. Receptor internalization provides possible mechanisms for desensitization by removing occupied receptors from the cell surface to intracellular endosomes. We initially evaluated receptor endocytosis by determining the amount of receptor remaining on the cell surface following a period of exposure to fMLF. Cell surface receptors were quantitated by flow cytometry usingN-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein as a specific probe for cell surface-localized FPR. When U937 cells transfected with the wild type FPR were exposed to fMLF for 10 min at 37 °C and assayed for cell surface receptors, they exhibited a 75% decrease in the number of cell surface receptors compared with cells that had not been exposed to fMLF (Fig.3 A). However, when the same comparison was made with U937 cells expressing the ΔST FPR mutant, which express almost equal numbers of receptors, there was no decrease in the number of cell surface receptors following a pretreatment with fMLF. To confirm that the decrease in cell surface receptors was the result of ligand-mediated receptor internalization, we also measured uptake of tritiated ligand. Increasing concentrations of fML[3H]F were incubated with wild type and mutant cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then transferred to a low pH buffer, which causes dissociation of ligand bound to the cell surface but has no effect on internalized ligand. Wild type FPR-transfected U937 cells demonstrated significant uptake of fML[3H]F during the course of the assay (Fig. 3 B). On the contrary, cells expressing the ΔST mutant internalized almost no ligand, even at fMLF concentrations 10-fold higher than that required to demonstrate significant uptake with the wild type receptor. These results suggest that receptor phosphorylation is required for internalization as well as desensitization of the FPR and that the two processes may be interdependent. Having defined a form of the FPR that is capable of binding ligand and initiating signal transduction but incapable of being internalized and thus recycled to the cell surface, we were now able to test the hypothesis that chemotaxis requires recycling of the receptor. Chemotaxis was evaluated using a 48-well chemotaxis chamber with the lower chamber containing chemoattractant separated from the upper chamber containing cells by a 120-μm thick convoluted pore cellulose nitrate filter. This method allows the distinction to be made between simple migration though an “open hole” thin polycarbonate filter and true chemotaxis as revealed with this method. Only myeloid cells are capable of migrating through thick convoluted pore filters whereas many cell types including endothelial cells and fibroblasts, for example, can traverse straight open hole pore filters. The ability of the FPR-transfected U937 cells to undergo chemotaxis in response to a gradient is demonstrated in Table I. Only in the presence of a ligand gradient, with the higher concentration of ligand in the lower chamber, was significant migration into the filter observed. The pattern of migration is consistent with the cells responding in a chemotactic manner, as opposed to a chemokinetic manner, where the presence of ligand in the upper chamber (or both chambers) induces increased random movement of the cells and therefore migration into the filter. Chemotaxis of undifferentiated U937 cells is dependent only upon the introduction of a chemoattractant receptor, such as the FPR, with vector-transfected cells showing no response (Fig. 4). When we tested the ΔST FPR mutant, we found that the chemotactic potential of this mutant was identical to that of the wild type receptor, demonstrating that receptor processing and recycling are not required for chemotaxis to take place.Table ICheckerboard analysis of FPR-transfected U937 cell chemotactic activityfMLF in lower chamberfMLF in upper chamber01 nm10 nm100 nm000001 nm12010010 nm46321110100 nm5339220Data are expressed as the distance of migration (in microns) in a 2-h period as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means of five measurements on each of duplicate filters and are representative of three experiments. Open table in a new tab Data are expressed as the distance of migration (in microns) in a 2-h period as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means of five measurements on each of duplicate filters and are representative of three experiments. The results of this study have demonstrated for the first time that receptor phosphorylation, internalization, desensitization, and recycling are not required for chemotaxis to occur. Our result is contrary to the conclusions based on inhibitors of receptor recycling, which result in inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. It is unclear, however, what additional side effects these inhibitors might have upon cell function. Furthermore, it is possible that only in the presence of internalized receptor is receptor re-expression required for chemotaxis to occur. This would indicate that under normal circumstances, replenishing of cell surface receptors is essential to provide the receptors necessary to propagate migration; however, as our results demonstrate, in the absence of receptor depletion through internalization, chemotaxis can be initiated and continue for a prolonged period of time. This demonstrates that signal transduction mediated by a functional chemoattractant receptor in the absence of receptor desensitization can control the spatial and temporal aspects of the signal transduction cascade that are involved in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that propels the cell forward during chemotaxis. Although receptor desensitization and internalization are not required for chemotaxis, these processes are involved in preventing chronic activation of leukocytes at sites of inflammation. To compensate for the possible lack of receptors during the relatively long periods of chemotaxis, it appears that re-expression of internalized receptors has evolved as a mechanism to ensure sufficient cell surface receptors. In conclusion, although receptor recycling occurs during chemotaxis, it is not an essential component of the chemotactic phenomenon. We thank Dr. Richard Kew for expertise in analyzing chemotaxis results."
https://openalex.org/W2020194753,Retroviral vectors containing CD4 and an appropriate chemokine receptor were evaluated for the ability to transduce cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These CD4–chemokine receptor pseudotypes were able to target HIV- and SIV-infected cell lines and monocyte-derived macrophages in a manner that corresponded to the specificity of the viral envelope glycoprotein for its CD4–chemokine receptor complex. This approach could offer a way to deliver antiviral genes directly to HIV-infected cells in vivo and could provide an additional treatment strategy in conjunction with existing antiviral therapies.

These units are distinctly different from surface dimers. They may provide the link missing in our understanding of the elementary processes in epitaxial film growth: the step between monomer adsorption and the initial formation of two-dimensional growth islands."

The weak link consists of a square array of 100-nanometer-diameter apertures. For temperatures T such that T / T c ≥ 0.6 (where T c is the superfluid transition temperature), I ∝ sin(Δφ). At lower temperatures, I (Δφ) approaches a straight line. Several remarkable phenomena heretofore inaccessible to superconducting Josephson junctions, including direct observation of quantum oscillations and continuous knowledge of Δφ, were also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1595590464,"Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) associated with the production, transmission, and use of electricity are ubiquitous in industrialized societies. These fields are predominantly of low frequency (50/60 Hz) and are generally of low intensity. Review of the epidemiological evidence shows that the association between exposure to EMFs and cancer is weak and inconsistent, and generally fails to show a dose-response relationship. Moreover, in view of the methodological problems of these epidemiological studies, animal and laboratory studies are urgently needed to determine whether EMFs could be initiators and/or promoters of cancers. The objective of the present study was to determine whether chronic exposure to 60 Hz linear (single axis) sinusoidal, continuous-wave magnetic fields (MFs) of different intensities might increase the risk of leukemia and solid tumor development in rodents born and raised under these fields. Five groups of 50 female F344 rats were exposed for 20 h/day to 60 Hz MFs at intensities of <0.02 (sham controls), 2, 20, 200, and 2000 microT. Full body exposure to the different fields was administered for 104 wk starting from the prenatal period (2 days before birth) and continuing during lactation and weaning until late adult life. Body weight, survival, and clinical observations were evaluated in all groups of animals during in-life exposure. Necropsy was performed on all exposed and control animals that died, were found moribund, or were killed at termination of the study. To preserve and demonstrate the absence of any experimental bias, all clinical observations and pathological evaluations were conducted under ""blinded"" conditions. Fifty organs and tissues were evaluated in each animal, with special attention to the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia, brain tumors, and mammary tumors. The findings from this chronic carcinogenicity study demonstrate that, under our defined experimental conditions, exposure to 60 Hz linear (single axis) sinusoidal, continuous wave MFs did not affect animal survival, solid tumor, or mononuclear cell leukemia development in female F344 rats. No statistically significant, consistent, positive dose-related trends with the number of tumor-bearing animals per study group could be attributed to MF exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1519411326,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) plays a central role in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In this study, we investigated the effect of ethanol on the expression of the large subunit of MTP in a human liver hepatoma cell line, the HepG2 cells. Exposure of HepG2 cells to low concentrations of ethanol reduced MTP mRNA levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The level of MTP mRNA decreased significantly (P<0.05, –26% relative to pretreatment control) when the concentration of ethanol in the culture medium was 50 ppm (0.005%, v/v). Maximal suppression (–50%) was observed at 100 ppm ethanol; the MTP mRNA levels remained at 50% of control when the ethanol concentration was raised to 10,000 ppm. Furthermore, a 10-day ethanol treatment caused a significant 50% decrease in the MTP activity and apoB secretion rate in HepG2 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we examined the effect of ethanol on the promoter activity of the MTP gene. Transient transfection analysis of human MTP promoter-driven luciferase gene expression showed that ethanol down-regulates MTP promoter activity in a manner parallel to that observed for mRNA levels. Deletion analysis suggested that the MTP promoter sequence contains a negative ethanol response element –612 to –142 bp upstream of the transcription start site. To evaluate the in vivo relevance of the effect of ethanol on MTP mRNA levels, rats were given a single oral dose of ethanol, with hepatic and intestinal MTP mRNA measured 3 h after dosing. Rats receiving 1 or 3 g/kg of ethanol exhibited substantially lower hepatic and intestinal MTP mRNA levels. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ethanol can modulate the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins by down-regulating the expression of MTP large subunit, primarily through inhibiting the transcription of the MTP gene.—Lin, M. C. M., Li, J.-J., Wang, E.-J., Princler, G.L., Kauffman, F. C., Kung, H.-f. Ethanol down-regulates the transcription of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene. FASEB J. 11, 1145–1152 (1997)"
https://openalex.org/W1843648689,"In contrast to two-chain urokinase (uPA), a chemical conjugate between uPA and native saporin (a cytotoxic plant seed ribosome-inactivating protein) did not require plasminogen activator inhibitors to be internalized. To dissect this pathway, we constructed a chimera consisting of the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of human urokinase fused to a saporin isoform (SAP-3). The chimeric ATF-SAP toxin was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized for its ribosome-inactivating activity. Besides being a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in cell-free assays, ATF-SAP was specifically cytotoxic toward cells expressing human uPAR. Competition experiments indicated that both the human uPAR and the LDL-related receptor protein are involved in mediating the cell killing ability of ATF-SAP. We conclude that neither plasminogen activator inhibitors nor the catalytic moiety of urokinase are necessary to initiate these internalization pathways. Thus, saporin may play a role similar to plasminogen activator inhibitors in its ability to trigger internalization of uPAR-bound ligands through endocytic receptors.—Fabbrini, M. S., Carpani, D., Bello-Rivero, I., Soria, M. R. The amino-terminal fragment of human urokinase directs a recombinant chimeric toxin to target cells: internalization is toxin-mediated.

https://openalex.org/W2087770202,"Abstract Phenobarbital is a classical inducer of the drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 genes, but the molecular mechanism of induction has not been elucidated. Functional analyses have identified a phenobarbital-responsive unit in the rat CYP2B1/2 and mouse Cyp2b10 genes about −2.3 kilobase pairs from the transcriptional start site, but little or no changes in protein binding to this region were observed in vitro. To examine the role of chromatin structure, protein binding to the phenobarbital-responsive unit assessed by in vitro DNase I footprinting was compared with that assessed by DNase I in vivo footprints in native chromatin. A region centered on a putative nuclear factor-1 site was the major protected region in in vitro footprints, and there were no detectable differences in binding between extracts from control and phenobarbital-treated animals. In contrast, phenobarbital treatment dramatically altered the protection pattern in native chromatin. In control samples a core region of about 25 base pairs (bp) centered on the nuclear factor-1 site was protected. However, after phenobarbital treatment, the protection of this core region was increased, and more dramatically the region of protection was extended 20 bp to either side so that a total of about 60 bp were protected. These results provide the first evidence that phenobarbital treatment alters the composition or architecture of proteins binding to the phenobarbital-responsive unit region and indicate that chromatin structure is important in this process. Because proteins are bound to the region in the untreated animal, the mechanism of induction involves the activation of proteins bound to the region and possibly recruitment of additional regulatory proteins rather than conversion of a closed chromatin structure to an open one that can bind regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1577481173,"To optimize glucose utilization, double transgenic mice were created by crossing mice overexpressing glucose transporter GLUT4 with mice overexpressing hexokinase (HKII) in muscle. Transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 alone have exhibited improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin action. In vitro studies of hexose uptake in soleus muscle from transgenic mice suggested that GLUT4 was limiting the glucose flux except at high glucose concentration, where hexokinase became the limiting step. In vivo, glucose tolerance was similar in GLUT4 and GLUT4/HKII mice, although stimulated plasma insulin values were significantly lower in the latter group. Insulin tolerance tests performed in diabetic GLUT4 vs. diabetic GLUT4/HKII transgenic mice yielded identical results. Again, endogenous insulin in GLUT4/HKII mice during a mild hyperglycemic clamp was stimulated by only two- vs. fourfold in GLUT4 mice. Although the overexpression of HKII alone resulted in increased glucose utilization in several muscles, the overexpression of GLUT4 plus HKII did not augment basal or stimulated in vivo glucose utilization compared to GLUT4 overexpression. In conclusion, GLUT4 is rate limiting for muscle glucose utilization but HKII might be important under hyperglycemia. The addition of HKII to GLUT4 overexpression is not sufficient to further augment glucose tolerance or insulin action. In GLUT4/HKII double transgenic mice, glucose clearance is tempered by a low insulin stimulated level."

https://openalex.org/W2120684498,"Oncogenic mutation of nuclear transcription factors often is associated with altered patterns of subcellular localization that may be of functional importance. The leukemogenic transcription factor gene E2A-PBX1 is created through fusion of the genes E2A and PBX1 as a result of t(1;19) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We evaluated subcellular localization patterns of E2A-PBX1 protein in transfected cells using immunofluorescence. Full-length E2A-PBX1 was exclusively nuclear and was concentrated in spherical domains denoted chimeric-E2A oncoprotein domains (CODs). In contrast, nuclear fluorescence for wild-type E2A or PBX1 proteins was diffuse. Enhanced concentrations of RNA polymerase II within many CODs and the requirement for an E2A-encoded activation domain suggested transcriptional relevance. However, in situ co-detection of nascent transcripts labeled with bromouridine failed to confirm altered transcriptional activity in relation to CODs. CODs also failed to co-localize with other proteins known to occupy functional nuclear compartments, including the transcription factor PML, the spliceosome-associated protein SC-35 and the adenovirus replication factor DBP, or with foci of DNA replication. Co-transfection of Hoxb7, a homeodomain protein capable of enhancing DNA binding by PBX1, impaired COD formation, suggesting that CODs contain E2A-PBX1 protein not associated with DNA. We conclude that, as a 'gain of function' phenomenon requiring protein elements from both E2A and PBX1, COD formation may be relevant to the biology of E2A-PBX1 in leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1570219499,"We demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously resolve both an mRNA and its protein product by electrophoresis in a single SDS-polyacrylamide gel by using double labeling with [32P]H3PO4 and [35S]methionine, and an elongated 5% stacking gel atop the 10% resolving gel. The mRNA is resolved in the 5% gel; the protein, as expected, resolves in the 10% gel. Using a T7 expression system, we show that putative mRNA bands in the 5% gel are: 1) labeled only with 32P and not with 35S; 2) inducible with isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (needed to induce a T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of a lac promoter); 3) synthesized in the presence of rifampicin (T7 RNA polymerase is not inhibited by rifampicin); 4) degraded by base or RNase treatment; and 5) are largely resistant to DNase treatment. The mRNA bands were also evident in samples not treated with rifampicin. We used this technique to confirm previously published results that inhibition of expression by consecutive low-usage AGG arginine codons inserted near the 5' end of a test message in Escherichia coli is at the level of translation."

It seems obvious, from our present perspective, that for Einstein to write and administer a collection of grants would have destroyed his creativity. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), however, supports many researchers who are principal investigators of four, five, six or more research grants. Have these grants been awarded without concern for the applicant's scientific creativity? What peer-review committees (called study sections) make these awards? Although giving many grants to one person probably doesn't often result in bad science (although a lack of supervision leading to fraud may be an issue), the real penalty is the loss of ideas. We are giving funds to provide predictable new life at the expense of the unexpected1."
