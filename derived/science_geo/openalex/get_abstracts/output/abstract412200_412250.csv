https://openalex.org/W2120287165,"Plants transport fixed carbon predominantly as sucrose, which is produced in mesophyll cells and imported into phloem cells for translocation throughout the plant. It is not known how sucrose migrates from sites of synthesis in the mesophyll to the phloem, or which cells mediate efflux into the apoplasm as a prerequisite for phloem loading by the SUT sucrose-H(+) (proton) cotransporters. Using optical sucrose sensors, we identified a subfamily of SWEET sucrose efflux transporters. AtSWEET11 and 12 localize to the plasma membrane of the phloem. Mutant plants carrying insertions in AtSWEET11 and 12 are defective in phloem loading, thus revealing a two-step mechanism of SWEET-mediated export from parenchyma cells feeding H(+)-coupled import into the sieve element-companion cell complex. We discuss how restriction of intercellular transport to the interface of adjacent phloem cells may be an effective mechanism to limit the availability of photosynthetic carbon in the leaf apoplasm in order to prevent pathogen infections."

However, DNA contamination and DNA fragmentation heterogeneity produce false positives (erroneous calls) and imprecision in mapping. Consequently, stringent data filtering produces false negatives (missed calls). Here we describe ChIP-exo, where an exonuclease trims ChIP DNA to a precise distance from the crosslinking site. Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep sequencing. Contaminating DNA is degraded or fails to form complementary peak pairs. With the single bp accuracy provided by ChIP-exo, we show an unprecedented view into genome-wide binding of the yeast transcription factors Reb1, Gal4, Phd1, Rap1, and human CTCF. Each of these factors was chosen to address potential limitations of ChIP-exo. We found that binding sites become unambiguous and reveal diverse tendencies governing in vivo DNA-binding specificity that include sequence variants, functionally distinct motifs, motif clustering, secondary interactions, and combinatorial modules within a compound motif."
https://openalex.org/W2069441590,"Currently there is no general approach for achieving specific optogenetic control of genetically defined cell types in rats, which provide a powerful experimental system for numerous established neurophysiological and behavioral paradigms. To overcome this challenge we have generated genetically restricted recombinase-driver rat lines suitable for driving gene expression in specific cell types, expressing Cre recombinase under the control of large genomic regulatory regions (200–300 kb). Multiple tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)::Cre and choline acetyltransferase (Chat)::Cre lines were produced that exhibited specific opsin expression in targeted cell types. We additionally developed methods for utilizing optogenetic tools in freely moving rats and leveraged these technologies to clarify the causal relationship between dopamine (DA) neuron firing and positive reinforcement, observing that optical stimulation of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Th::Cre rats is sufficient to support vigorous intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). These studies complement existing targeting approaches by extending the generalizability of optogenetics to traditionally non-genetically-tractable but vital animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2162381025,"A common goal of neuroimaging research is to use imaging data to identify the mental processes that are engaged when a subject performs a mental task. The use of reasoning from activation to mental functions, known as ""reverse inference,"" has been previously criticized on the basis that it does not take into account how selectively the area is activated by the mental process in question. In this Perspective, I outline the critique of informal reverse inference and describe a number of new developments that provide the ability to more formally test the predictive power of neuroimaging data."
https://openalex.org/W1989700973,"Local field potentials (LFPs) are of growing importance in neurophysiological investigations. LFPs supplement action potential recordings by indexing activity relevant to EEG, magnetoencephalographic, and hemodynamic (fMRI) signals. Recent reports suggest that LFPs reflect activity within very small domains of several hundred micrometers. We examined this conclusion by comparing LFP, current source density (CSD), and multiunit activity (MUA) signals in macaque auditory cortex. Estimated by frequency tuning bandwidths, these signals' “listening areas” differ systematically with an order of MUA < CSD < LFP. Computational analyses confirm that observed LFPs receive local contributions. Direct measurements indicate passive spread of LFPs to sites more than a centimeter from their origins. These findings appear to be independent of the frequency content of the LFP. Our results challenge the idea that LFP recordings typically integrate over extremely circumscribed local domains. Rather, LFPs appear as a mixture of local potentials with “volume conducted” potentials from distant sites.

While the technique was overshadowed by action potential recording for a number of years, its importance has reemerged over the past decade because of the observations that the field potential is linked to the neural underpinnings of hemodynamic signals (Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K.

Finally, field potentials form part of the signal spectrum that can drive neuroprosthetic devices (Hatsopoulos and Donoghue, 2009Hatsopoulos N.G. Donoghue J.P.

Brain-computer interfaces as new brain output pathways.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that field potentials recorded within the brain are in general, extremely local phenomena, reflecting neuronal processes occurring within approximately 200–400 μm of the recording electrode in the cortex (Katzner et al., 2009Katzner S.

Spatial spread of the local field potential and its laminar variation in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11540-11549Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This basic proposition is imbued in the common use of the term local field potential (LFP), which has become widespread in the literature, particularly over the last 10 years. However, the proposition seems at odds with many prior studies, which suggest that LFPs spread laterally over distances of 600∼1000 μm (Berens et al., 2008Berens P. Keliris G.A. Ecker A.S.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11540-11549Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have been largely confined to visual cortices on the brain surface and have analyzed the spread of LFPs only in the “lateral” dimension. This is but one of the relevant dimensions that need to be considered, especially given that models of the underlying generators of scalp ERP/EEG components often contain directional terms (Ingber and Nunez, 2011Ingber L.

Srinivasan R. Comparison of the effect of volume conduction on EEG coherence with the effect of field spread on MEG coherence.Stat. Med. 2007; 26: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Spread of LFPs along “vertical” dimensions creates apparent similarity and coherence between depths (Maier et al., 2010Maier A. Adams G.K. Aura C. Leopold D.A. Distinct superficial and deep laminar domains of activity in the visual cortex during rest and stimulation.Front Syst. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 31PubMed Google Scholar), though it could be just due to the volume conduction (Kocsis et al., 1999Kocsis B. Bragin A. Buzsáki G. Interdependence of multiple theta generators in the hippocampus: a partial coherence analysis.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6200-6212PubMed Google Scholar). To provide a more general assessment of the spatial spread of LFPs, we examined the issue in the context of tonotopic mapping in primary auditory cortex (A1). Corresponding to the precise mapping of the retinal receptor surface in V1 as examined by recent studies (Katzner et al., 2009Katzner S. Nauhaus I. Benucci A. Bonin V. Ringach D.L. Carandini M. Local origin of field potentials in visual cortex.Neuron. 2009; 61: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, Xing et al., 2009Xing D. Yeh C.I. Shapley R.M. Spatial spread of the local field potential and its laminar variation in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11540-11549Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), A1 contains a precise spatial map of the cochlear surface (Kosaki et al., 1997Kosaki H. Hashikawa T. He J. Jones E.G.

Neurol. 1997; 386: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Merzenich and Brugge, 1973Merzenich M.M. Brugge J.F. Representation of the cochlear partition of the superior temporal plane of the macaque monkey.Brain Res. 1973; 50: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), which allows examination of the lateral spread of LFPs as was done in V1. Moreover, due to A1's placement in the inferior bank of the lateral sulcus, vertical penetrations through A1 could examine the spatial spread of LFPs in the vertical dimension as well. A central concern in LFP analysis is that with use of distant, extracranial reference electrodes, there is uncertainty as to the precise neural generator of the LFP, which is in part why the first and second spatial derivatives of the LFP were explored as additional measures (Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100PubMed Google Scholar). The second derivative of the LFP, known as current source density (CSD) also estimates the net local pattern of neuronal transmembrane current flows that generate an LFP distribution in the extracellular medium (Nicholson, 1973Nicholson C. Theoretical analysis of field potentials in anisotropic ensembles of neuronal elements.IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 1973; 20: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Nicholson and Freeman, 1975Nicholson C. Freeman J.A. Theory of current source-density analysis and determination of conductivity tensor for anuran cerebellum.J. Neurophysiol. 1975; 38: 356-368PubMed Google Scholar), and is a centerpiece of our analysis. We directly compared the vertical and lateral spread of the LFP recorded with a distant reference, with that of the derived CSD signal and that of the concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) signal. LFP and MUA signals were sampled with linear array multielectrodes (100 or 200 μm spacing) placed in and near A1 in awake monkeys. Our findings clearly indicate lateral spread of the LFP well beyond the 200∼400 μm range, with a vertical spread also extending many millimeters beyond auditory cortex. These findings challenge the notion that LFPs can be generally assumed to represent very local neuronal processes. They emphasize the critical importance of considering technical factors such as reference electrode location, as well as physiological factors such as the spatial extent/configuration and activation strength/symmetry of the underlying neuronal generators, in the interpretation of LFP recordings. Data were collected from awake monkeys that were conditioned to sit quietly in the primate chair and accept painless head restraint, but were not required to attend or respond to the auditory stimuli. A1 yields robust and consistent responses to suprathreshold tones under these conditions (O'Connell et al., 2011O'Connell M.N. Falchier A. McGinnis T. Schroeder C.E. Lakatos P.

Cortex. 2008; 18: 610-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), comparable in quality to those generated by attended auditory stimuli (Lakatos et al., 2009Lakatos P. O'Connell M.N. Barczak A. Mills A. Javitt D.C. Schroeder C.E. The leading sense: supramodal control of neurophysiological context by attention.Neuron. 2009; 64: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Laminar profiles of auditory-evoked LFPs and MUA were recorded with linear array multielectrodes (100 or 200 μm intercontact spacing) positioned for each experiment so that they straddled the layers of A1. To illustrate the recording preparation and methods, Figure 1 depicts averaged laminar profiles of response to the “best frequency” (BF) tone of one penetration site in A1 (see Experimental Procedures for details on BF determination). Laminar LFP profiles are shown in both raw, line plot (A) and in a more intuitive color plot (B) formats, both of which are used in subsequent figures. On the right (C) is the CSD profile derived from the LFP profile, with selected MUA recordings superimposed to help connect current source and sink configurations with local physiological processes. Layers are identified functionally using standard criteria; e.g., the initial current sink and largest peak MUA in response to robust sensory input occurs in Layer 4 (Lakatos et al., 2007Lakatos P. Chen C.M. O'Connell M.N. Mills A. Schroeder C.E.

Cellular generators of the cortical auditory evoked potential initial component.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1992; 84: 196-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data illustrate the local cortical ensemble response to a suprathreshold (60 dB), 100 ms duration tone at the penetration site's preferred frequency. Response onset consists of an initial current sink with a robust concomitant increase in MUA in Layer 4, followed by subsequent CSD responses accompanied by less marked MUA in the supra and infragranular layers. The form of the excitatory response, initial transient with a lesser sustained component is one of the common variant tone responses observed in A1 (e.g., O'Connell et al., 2011O'Connell M.N. Falchier A. McGinnis T. Schroeder C.E. Lakatos P. Dual mechanism of neuronal ensemble inhibition in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2011; 69: 805-817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The initial activation of Layer 4 is reflected in an LFP negativity that arises in association with the collocated current sink (“1” in Figures 1B and 1C), and with a current sink that begins slightly later in Layer 3 (“2” in Figures 1B and 1C). It is sometimes possible, as in this case, to discern an earlier negativity that arises in association with a sink/source configuration and a brief MUA burst below layer 4 (“−1” in Figure 1C). Modeling and physiology experiments suggest that the initial transient responses in primary sensory cortices are a combination of presynaptic (afferent terminal discharge), and postsynaptic (granule cell depolarization) processes (Schroeder et al., 1995Schroeder C.E.

Interpretation of high-resolution current source density profiles: a simulation of sublaminar contributions to the visual evoked potential.Exp. Brain Res. 1993; 94: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In most cases, the presynaptic component is masked by a much larger postsynaptic component. The larger, more obvious LFP, the positivity peaking at ∼30 ms, and the negativity peaking at ∼50 ms (P30/N50, Figures 1A–1C) appear to arise mainly from processes in the supragranular layers. The superficial P30 extends upward from a supragranular current source that we interpret as a “passive” CSD feature reflecting current return to the “active” current source, itself representing the initial activation of supragranular pyramidal cells (by granule cell afferents from Layer 4). Passive current return happens because of the conservation of net electrical currents and electrical neutrality. N50 extends vertically from a superficial current sink (an asterisk in Figure 1C), whose physiological significance is less clear. As discussed below, we use the P30 to track LFP spread vertically. To get at lateral spread of LFPs, we focused analysis on the initial negativity associated with the frequency-selective responses in Layer 4/lower Layer 3 (“1” and “2”, Figure 1); this negativity extends in a ventral direction from the current sinks in these locations, particularly the lower (Layer 4) one. Figure 2 shows Layer 4 MUA, CSD, and LFP responses to tones in two different A1 penetration sites. In each site, it is clear that the three signals were largest in response to same tone frequencies, and thus shared a common BF. However, while MUA and CSD responses to tones disappeared as the tone frequency moved away from the BF, the LFP response did not. Tuning curves were derived by measuring mean response amplitudes over 10 ms periods, centered between 23 and 30 ms following the stimulus onset at a recording depth within the Layer 4 (see Experimental Procedures). The mean amplitude of MUA, CSD, and LFP signals indicated change in the level of local neuronal firing, the magnitude of current sinks due to excitatory synaptic currents and the magnitude of LFP negativity caused by current sinks relative to the baseline levels, respectively. The period was chosen to be the time during both LFP and CSD signals were negatively deflected along with simultaneous increase in MUA. Figures 3A and 3B show the normalized tuning curves for LFP, CSD, and MUA signals in the two example cases shown in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively. The three types of tuning curve generally peak at the same tone frequencies. The same trend was observed across all recording sites (Figure 3C). BF estimates were not significantly different between the three signals (Friedman's nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA, χγ2 (2, n = 130) = 0.92, p = 0.2) (see Figure S1 available online). The tuning bandwidths of MUA, CSD, and LFP differed significantly from one another (Friedman's nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA, χγ2 (2, n = 130) = 85.2, p < 0.01), in an order of BWMUA < BWCSD < BWLFP (Tukey's HSD test, all comparisons p < 0.05; Figure 3D). Similar results were found for the tuning of three signals in the supragranular layers (Figure S2), where BWMUA did not differ significantly from layer 4 (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.34). Two physiological factors likely can account for these differences. First, due to reflection of subthreshold synaptic currents in the CSD measure, the tuning of CSD responses to tones is wider than that of MUA responses to the same tones. Second, due to volume conduction of electrical events in auditory cortical loci tonotopically not matched to the penetration sites, the tuning of LFP is wider than that of CSD measures. The idea that LFP responses to tones octaves away from the BF at a penetration site in A1 is due to volume conduction predicts that the CSD index derived by numeric differentiation from such an LFP profile should not contain the “volume conducted” components. In other words, the local spatiotemporal distribution of sources and sinks outlined by CSD analysis would not be able to generate the observed profile of LFP response (LFPobs). To test this idea, laminar LFP responses (LFPcal) were calculated back from CSD profiles. According to Poisson's differential equation, the local LFP profile is the spatial integration of its solution given a particular spatial distribution of current sinks/sources identified by CSD analysis (Experimental Procedures). Figure 4A (left column) shows laminar-temporal profiles of LFPobs responses to tones, in a penetration site tuned toward low frequencies. The profiles maintained common patterns across tone frequencies: the predominant onset negativity in the bottom two-thirds of channels and positivity in the top one-third of channels across tone frequencies. Other later features, like the strong positivity around 50 ms in the bottom of the profile, were preserved only for responses to lower frequency tones. CSD responses (Figure 4A, second column) are similar to LFPobs in terms of their strength across frequencies below 1.4 kHz. However, CSD responses are nearly abolished at high stimulus frequencies. Tuning curves in Figure 4B also show that CSD responses were nearly zero at high stimulus frequencies where LFPobs responses still had amplitudes about 20% of peak values. Figure 4A (third column) shows laminar-temporal profiles of LFPcal derived from CSD profiles using Equation 1 (Experimental Procedures). Note that our simultaneous recording from single arrays orthogonal to cortical layers cannot resolve the fine details of spatial distributions for sinks/sources. For example, lateral spread of activity may differ between layers, but cannot be elucidated by our methods. Regardless, application of Equation 1 to CSD worked qualitatively well to calculate LFP when that was generated locally. LFPcal at low frequencies had largely similar profiles to LFPobs from the onset to the later inversions of polarity across similar subsets of the recording depths. As the tone frequency increased, the response became weaker. At high stimulus frequencies where CSD responses were negligible, the LFPcal diverged markedly from the LFPobs and more portions of signals differed in their sign (Figure 4A, fourth column). We calculated SXCorr that quantified how well the shape of LFPcal matched to that of LFPobs, irrespective of difference in response magnitudes between the two LFP profiles for individual tone frequencies. For the example shown in Figure 4A, SXCorr peaked at 1 kHz the frequency at which the amplitude of LFPobs response also peaked (Figure 4B). Up to 2.8 kHz, the SXCorr was above 0.8 and but it fell off at higher frequencies. Across all recording sites, SXCorr gradually decreased as the tone frequency departed from the BFMUA (Figure 4C). At frequencies beyond 1 octave difference, median SXCorr were significantly different from that at BFMUA (bootstrap, two-tailed, p < 0.05). These results can be explained by volume conduction. Tones at BFMUA evoke strong MUA and CSD responses (Figure 3C). CSD responses accompanied with MUA more likely reflect local activity than CSD responses without MUA concomitants (e.g., near the foot of tuning curve), and these are strong enough to generate similarly strong (and local) LFP responses like those to low frequency tones shown in Figure 4A. Tones that are away from the BFMUA may still evoke weaker CSD responses. However, considering the tonotopic organization of auditory cortex, concurrent strong CSD responses must occur somewhere else in either ascent or descent positions along the tonotopic gradient. In such cases, due to volume conduction, the LFP would still be strong. However, the LFPs generated by remote loci do not have correspondingly strong local responses in the CSD profile. In such cases, LFPcal should and does differ from LFPobs. Accordingly, LFPobs responses to tones more than 1 octave away from BFMUA could not be accounted for solely by electrical potentials generated by the CSD responses derived from LFPobs themselves. This conclusion is consistent with the idea that LFPobs responses are generated by a mixture of local and nonlocal electrophysiological events. The results described above reveal apparent volume conduction of LFP over relatively large distances traveling parallel to the cortical sheet, lateral to their site of generation. To get at volume conduction perpendicular to the cortical sheet in A1, we examined the spatial spread of the P30 component described in Figure 1 above. Figure 5A shows LFP responses to broad-band noise (BBN) recorded at recording depths with 200 μm intervals from the depth of A1 to the dura at the dorsal brain surface in one penetration. Near the bottom of the column, there is a polarity inversion of this component in supragranular A1, like that shown for the tone-evoked P30 in Figure 1. Above the inversion, the component is gradually attenuated over distance. Figure 5B shows the amplitude distribution of the P30 component in the LFP and CSD signals at the same timing. Insets in both columns show a magnified view of the top one-third of depths, and one can see that the peak remained observable up to the dural surface of the brain, about 18 mm above A1. The sink and source of CSD, however, were clearly confined to the proximity of inversion. Figure 5C plots the median of the amplitude distributions against the distance from the inversion (n = 105 penetrations). In general, the amplitude of the P30 and its decay rate decreased with distance. However, the peak amplitude stayed positive and significantly different from zero (bootstrap two-tailed, p < 0.05), all the way to the dorsal brain surface. These results are consistent with the forward solution of Poisson's equation, in which distribution of potential is proportional to the inverse of distance.

Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity."

Kessler et al. (p. 348 , published online 8 December; see the Perspective by Evan ) searched for gene products that support Myc-driven tumorigenesis. One pharmacologically tractable target that emerged from the screen was the SUMO-activating enzyme complex SAE1/2, which catalyzes a posttranslational modification (SUMOylation) that alters protein behavior and function. SUMOylation was found to control the Myc transcriptional response, and its inhibition caused mitotic defects and apoptosis in Myc-dependent breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992686988,"A major issue in the clinic is excessive, or hypertrophic, scarring of the skin after injury. Geoffrey Gurtner and his colleagues have now shown that mechanical forces during such injury upregulates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which in turn leads to the release of a cytokine that promotes inflammation and fibrosis. They also show that genetic deletion of FAK or its pharmacological inhibition results in minimal scarring in a mouse model. Exuberant fibroproliferation is a common complication after injury for reasons that are not well understood1. One key component of wound repair that is often overlooked is mechanical force, which regulates cell-matrix interactions through intracellular focal adhesion components, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1,2. Here we report that FAK is activated after cutaneous injury and that this process is potentiated by mechanical loading. Fibroblast-specific FAK knockout mice have substantially less inflammation and fibrosis than control mice in a model of hypertrophic scar formation. We show that FAK acts through extracellular-related kinase (ERK) to mechanically trigger the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as CCL2), a potent chemokine that is linked to human fibrotic disorders3,4,5. Similarly, MCP-1 knockout mice form minimal scars, indicating that inflammatory chemokine pathways are a major mechanism by which FAK mechanotransduction induces fibrosis. Small-molecule inhibition of FAK blocks these effects in human cells and reduces scar formation in vivo through attenuated MCP-1 signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment. These findings collectively indicate that physical force regulates fibrosis through inflammatory FAK–ERK–MCP-1 pathways and that molecular strategies targeting FAK can effectively uncouple mechanical force from pathologic scar formation."

Rates of structural maturation are highly coordinated within the cortical sheet Maturational coupling with other cortices is maximal in association cortex Maturational coupling echoes known patterns of structural and functional connectivity Prefrontal maturational coupling in adolescence is sexually dimorphic Longitudinal structural neuroimaging provides a powerful tool for developmental neuroscience because of its unique ability to measure anatomical change within the same individual over time. In recent years, studies using this approach have yielded fundamental insights into the dynamic nature of typical human brain maturation, and the ways in which neurodevelopment can differ according to sex, cognitive ability, genetic profile, and disease status (Giedd and Rapoport, 2010Giedd J.N. Rapoport J.L. Structural MRI of pediatric brain development: what have we learned and where are we going?.Neuron. 2010; 67: 728-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To date, however, published studies of developmental changes in brain anatomy have considered each cortical location in statistical isolation from all others (although intriguing qualitative descriptions of coordinated anatomical change in the developing human brain have begun to emerge [Hill et al., 2010Hill J. Inder T. Neil J. Dierker D. Harwell J. Van Essen D. Similar patterns of cortical expansion during human development and evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar]). Resultantly, while it is now clear that changes in cortical anatomy en route to adulthood show marked regional heterogeneity in humans (Gogtay et al., 2004Gogtay N. Giedd J.N. Lusk L. Hayashi K.M.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8223-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), the relationships between structural change in different parts of the developing cortical sheet remain unquantified. Similarly, while factors such as sex (Raznahan et al., 2010Raznahan A. Lee Y. Stidd R. Long R. Greenstein D. Clasen L. Addington A. Gogtay N. Rapoport J.L. Giedd J.N.

Psychiatry. 2006; 63: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have now been linked to focal differences in the rate of structural cortical maturation—the possibility that these factors could also modify how different cortical regions change in relation to one another remains unexamined. A primary obstacle to studying the coordination of cortical development in humans has been the slow pace with which detectable maturational changes in cortical anatomy unfold (Shaw et al., 2008Shaw P. Kabani N.J. Lerch J.P. Eckstrand K. Lenroot R. Gogtay N. Greenstein D. Clasen L. Evans A. Rapoport J.L. et al.Neurodevelopmental trajectories of the human cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3586-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Consequently, there are very few longitudinal neuroimaging studies of sufficient size and longevity to permit correlational analysis of developmental changes in cortical structure. Here, we use the largest and longest-running longitudinal neuroimaging study of human brain maturation (Gordon et al., 1994Gordon C.T. Frazier J.A. McKenna K. Giedd J. Zametkin A. Zahn T. Hommer D.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7174-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) to describe and analyze in vivo patterns of correlated anatomical change within the cortex across the sensitive developmental window of late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood (Paus et al., 2008Paus T. Keshavan M. Giedd J.N. Why do many psychiatric disorders emerge during adolescence?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). We included 108 typically developing individuals on whom a total of 376 structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) brain scans, had been gathered between ages 9 and 22 years. Measures of cortical thickness (CT) were taken at ∼82,000 points (vertices) on the cortical surface of each scan with submillimeter resolution (Lerch and Evans, 2005Lerch J.P. Evans A.C.

At least three (and up to six) sMRI scans had been acquired on each participant at ∼2 year intervals over the developmental period in question, These data allowed us to generate an estimate of annual CT change at each vertex, in each participant. This re-representation of repeat sMRI measures of brain anatomy as person-specific maps of anatomical change enabled us to interrelate the diverse maturational tempos that exist within the growing cortical sheet (Gogtay et al., 2004Gogtay N. Giedd J.N. Lusk L. Hayashi K.M. Greenstein D. Vaituzis A.C. Nugent 3rd, T.F. Herman D.H. Clasen L.S.

We focused on cortical thickness (CT) as our anatomical index of interest because; it can be validly and reliably (Kabani et al., 2001Kabani N. Le Goualher G. MacDonald D. Evans A.C.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3586-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar); and several studies have already examined cross-sectional CT correlations (He et al., 2007He Y. Chen Z.J. Evans A.C.

Surface area and cortical thickness descriptors reveal different attributes of the structural human brain networks.Neuroimage. 2010; 50: 1497-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), thus providing a useful context within which to consider findings regarding correlated CT change. Our first goal was to address the basic question of whether coordinated patterns of structural change can be identified in the developing cortex. The existence of such maturational coupling is suggested by evidence that cross-sectional measures of cortical anatomy show a highly organized correlational structure (He et al., 2007He Y. Chen Z.J. Evans A.C. Small-world anatomical networks in the human brain revealed by cortical thickness from MRI.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 2407-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, Lerch et al., 2006Lerch J.P. Worsley K. Shaw W.P. Greenstein D.K. Lenroot R.K. Giedd J. Evans A.C.

Surface area and cortical thickness descriptors reveal different attributes of the structural human brain networks.Neuroimage. 2010; 50: 1497-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and recognition that neurostructural variation at any one point in time is (at least in part) likely to reflect earlier variations in the rate of anatomical change. In order to discern patterns of correlated CT change within the brain, we adapted a methodology initially developed for studying cross-sectional CT correlations (Lerch et al., 2006Lerch J.P. Worsley K. Shaw W.P. Greenstein D.K. Lenroot R.K. Giedd J. Evans A.C. Mapping anatomical correlations across cerebral cortex (MACACC) using cortical thickness from MRI.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and used this to correlate the rate of CT change at each vertex with that at every other vertex on the cortical sheet. We predicted that patterns of correlated CT change would echo existing descriptions of cross-sectional CT correlation (Lerch et al., 2006Lerch J.P. Worsley K. Shaw W.P. Greenstein D.K. Lenroot R.K. Giedd J. Evans A.C. Mapping anatomical correlations across cerebral cortex (MACACC) using cortical thickness from MRI.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), such that fronto-temporal cortices would show the strongest and most spatially extensive patterns of correlation with CT change in other cortical areas, while the maturational tempo of primary sensory cortices would be relatively uncoupled from that within the rest of the cortical sheet. Next, we built on our description of correlated anatomical change by asking if maturational coupling within the cortex is structured according to known principles of brain organization. Specifically, we sought evidence in support of the hypothesis that cortical systems already established as showing strong and persistent structural and functional interconnectivity, would also show highly correlated rates of anatomical change. This hypothesis is prompted by experimental evidence of activity-dependent structural plasticity in the cerebral cortex from sMRI studies (Draganski et al., 2004Draganski B. Gaser C. Busch V. Schuierer G. Bogdahn U. May A. Neuroplasticity: changes in grey matter induced by training.Nature. 2004; 427: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar, Hyde et al., 2009Hyde K.L. Lerch J. Norton A. Forgeard M. Winner E. Evans A.C. Schlaug G. Musical training shapes structural brain development.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These neuroimaging experiments imply that cortical regions sharing similar patterns of activation over the lifespan will develop under more similar sets of activity-related trophic influences than cortical regions that are functionally independent of each other. This notion is partly supported by evidence that cross-sectional patterns of functional and structural correlations within the human brain strongly echo each other (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J. Miller B.L. Greicius M.D. Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale human brain networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 42-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). In order to test for convergence between known patterns of functional and structural connectivity in the cortex, and patterns of coordinated cortical maturation, we used two complementary analytic approaches. First, we examined correlated rates of CT change within the cortical “default mode network” (DMN) (Raichle et al., 2001Raichle M.E. MacLeod A.M. Snyder A.Z. Powers W.J. Gusnard D.A. Shulman G.L. A default mode of brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (9045) Google Scholar). The DMN provides an useful model for investigating the relevance of patterned neural activity for coordinated brain maturation because it is a fundamental activational signature of the resting brain that exists across primates (Margulies et al., 2009Margulies D.S.

USA. 2006; 103: 13848-13853Crossref PubMed Scopus (3257) Google Scholar). The three core DMN nodes are well-established as lying within a medial posterior cortical region (mPC) that encompasses posterior cingulate and precuneus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and lateral inferior parietal cortex (iPC) (Buckner et al., 2008Buckner R.L. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Schacter D.L. The brain's default network: anatomy, function, and relevance to disease.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1124: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6980) Google Scholar). Of these, the mPC node appears to play an organizing role in the DMN (Fransson and Marrelec, 2008Fransson P. Marrelec G.

We therefore first nominated a mPC DMN “seed” vertex, empirically and without observer bias, using results of the largest existing meta-analytic delineation of the DMN (Laird et al., 2009Laird A.R. Eickhoff S.B. Li K. Robin D.A. Glahn D.C. Fox P.T. Investigating the functional heterogeneity of the default mode network using coordinate-based meta-analytic modeling.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14496-14505Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and then defined those cortical regions where rate of CT change was most highly correlated with that within the mPC seed. We hypothesized that correlations with mPC CT change would be maximal within mPFC and iPC DMN areas. We then further tested for elevated CT change correlations within the DMN using mPFC, iPC, and mPC seeds localized by an independent functional neuroimaging study (Fox et al., 2005Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z.

Finally, a second, “task positive” network (TPN) defined by this same independent study allowed us to asses if any observed maturational coupling changes were specific to the DMN, or also applied to other distributed cortical networks (Fox et al., 2005Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z.

Our second test for convergence between the coordination of cortical development and cortical function focused on the relationship between CT changes at homologous cortical vertices. Functional coactivation of homologous points on the left and right cortical sheet is a core property of the healthy living brain (Toro et al., 2008Toro R. Fox P.T. Paus T.

Therefore, if structural connections and functional relationships within the cortical sheet are reflected in the way cortical regions develop with respect to one another, correlated CT change should be elevated in homologous, relative to nonhomologous pairings of contra-lateral vertices. To test this we statistically contrasted the distribution of all possible correlations between homologous vertices and the distribution of correlations between an equal number of nonhomologous left-right vertex pairings. Finally, we asked if analysis of correlated CT change can reveal previously unidentified group differences in brain development by applying our methodology to test for sex differences in patterns of maturational coupling within the cortical sheet. Sex influences on maturational coupling are likely given that sex is known to modify several brain properties that could potentially reflect, or impact, the coordination of CT change, including cross-sectional patterns of CT correlation in the brain (Gong et al., 2009Gong G.

A similar situation occurs in the decision-making process of swarming bees, where multiple individuals relay information about suitable hive sites, but a single site is chosen by the swarm. Seeley et al. (p. 108 , published online 8 December; see the Perspective by Niven ) show that consensus in this system is reached as information from scouting bees accumulates within the hive. Stop signals were given by scout bees from a particular site to those scout bees signaling from other sites. As the signals accumulate, scouting ceases and the bees prepare to swarm to the site that was best represented among the scouts. When this process was simulated, the results indicated that cross-inhibition among the bees functions similarly to that which occurs among neurons within complex brains. In both cases, such cross-inhibition prevents the overall system from coming to an impasse."

https://openalex.org/W1968811439,"In mammalian cells, the autophagy-dependent degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy) is thought to maintain mitochondrial quality by eliminating damaged mitochondria. However, the physiological importance of mitophagy has not been clarified in yeast. Here, we investigated the physiological role of mitophagy in yeast using mitophagy-deficient atg32- or atg11-knock-out cells. When wild-type yeast cells in respiratory growth encounter nitrogen starvation, mitophagy is initiated, excess mitochondria are degraded, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondria is suppressed; as a result, the mitochondria escape oxidative damage. On the other hand, in nitrogen-starved mitophagy-deficient yeast, excess mitochondria are not degraded and the undegraded mitochondria spontaneously age and produce surplus ROS. The surplus ROS damage the mitochondria themselves and the damaged mitochondria produce more ROS in a vicious circle, ultimately leading to mitochondrial DNA deletion and the so-called ""petite-mutant"" phenotype. Cells strictly regulate mitochondrial quantity and quality because mitochondria produce both necessary energy and harmful ROS. Mitophagy contributes to this process by eliminating the mitochondria to a basal level to fulfill cellular energy requirements and preventing excess ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2091913778,"The β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is directly related to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). The two most abundant alloforms of the peptide co-exist under normal physiological conditions in the brain in an Aβ(42):Aβ(40) ratio of ∼1:9. This ratio is often shifted to a higher percentage of Aβ(42) in brains of patients with familial AD and this has recently been shown to lead to increased synaptotoxicity. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is unclear. Although the aggregation characteristics of Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) individually are well established, little is known about the properties of mixtures. We have explored the biophysical and structural properties of physiologically relevant Aβ(42):Aβ(40) ratios by several techniques. We show that Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) directly interact as well as modify the behavior of the other. The structures of monomeric and fibrillar assemblies formed from Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) mixtures do not differ from those formed from either of these peptides alone. Instead, the co-assembly of Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) influences the aggregation kinetics by altering the pattern of oligomer formation as evidenced by a unique combination of solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high molecular weight mass spectrometry, and cross-seeding experiments. We relate these observations to the observed enhanced toxicity of relevant ratios of Aβ(42):Aβ(40) in synaptotoxicity assays and in AD patients."

Focal attention yielded robust improvements in behavioral performance accompanied by increases in cortical responses. Quantitative analysis revealed that if performance were limited only by the sensitivity of the measured sensory signals, the improvements in behavioral performance would have corresponded to an unrealistically large reduction in response variability. Instead, behavioral performance was well characterized by a pooling and selection process for which the largest sensory responses, those most strongly modulated by attention, dominated the perceptual decision. This characterization predicts that high-contrast distracters that evoke large responses should negatively impact behavioral performance. We tested and confirmed this prediction. We conclude that attention enhanced behavioral performance predominantly by enabling efficient selection of the behaviorally relevant sensory signals."

NMDAR activation results in calcium-ion influx, which links synapse activation to intracellular signaling cascades which control synaptic strength, neuronal excitability, and neuronal survival. NMDARs are heteromultimeric protein complexes containing two GluN1 subunits (a single gene) and two GluN2 (NR2) subunits, which are encoded by four genes in mammals (GluN2A-D; also known as NR2A-D) (Meguro et al., 1992Meguro H.

Contribution of GluN2 subunits to the NMDAR complex is precisely regulated during development, with early postnatal receptors containing exclusively GluN2B subunits, whereas increased incorporation of GluN2A subunits occurs during a postnatal period of synapse maturation and cortical circuit refinement (Monyer et al., 1994Monyer H.

By contrast, GluN2A knockout animals are viable and fertile (Sakimura et al., 1995Sakimura K. Kutsuwada T. Ito I. Manabe T. Takayama C. Kushiya E. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Inoue Y. Sugiyama H. et al.Reduced hippocampal LTP and spatial learning in mice lacking NMDA receptor epsilon 1 subunit.Nature. 1995; 373: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Due in part to the lethality of the GluN2B knockout mutation, the role of this receptor subtype during development remains unclear. In addition, the relative role of GluN2B- versus GluN2A-containing NMDARs in synapse function has become a highly debated issue, with potentially distinct roles ascribed to these receptors in regimes of synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity (Yashiro and Philpot, 2008Yashiro K. Philpot B.D. Regulation of NMDA receptor subunit expression and its implications for LTD, LTP, and metaplasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Assigning unique functional roles to GluN2B-containing NMDARs during development is complicated by the fact that their exclusive expression means that specific loss of GluN2B also results in total loss of NMDAR signaling during this period. This poses a problem for interpretation of data from GluN2B loss-of-function experiments during postnatal development: which aspects of the loss-of-function phenotype are due to loss of GluN2B signaling specifically, and which are due to loss of NMDAR signaling generally? To answer this question and improve our knowledge of the distinct roles that GluN2B-containing NMDARs play in regulating synapse function, we genetically replaced GluN2B with GluN2A in mice (2B→2A). In these 2B→2A allelic “replacement” animals, functional NMDAR current is recovered during postnatal development, but the current is now mediated by GluN2A-containing receptors in the absence of GluN2B. We show here that premature expression of GluN2A is unable to rescue GluN2B loss of function, demonstrating that this period of GluN2B predominance is critical. Homozygous 2B→2A animals suffer high rates of lethality, a dramatically suppressed suckling reflex, and retarded body growth. This phenotype was observed despite the fact that NMDAR-mediated currents were rescued to comparable levels at excitatory cortical synapses. Our experiments show that GluN2B-mediated signaling is specifically required for proper AMPAR regulation at developing cortical synapses, and loss of GluN2B occludes protein translation-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity in these neurons. Furthermore, we show that this is likely due to the unique association between GluN2B and alpha calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and involves regulation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The behavioral phenotype of homozygous 2B→2A mice includes reduced social exploration in spite of exhibiting hyperlocomotion. In summary, our experiments reveal a critical role for GluN2B-mediated NMDAR signaling in regulating cortical synapse development and protein translation-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity, as well as show that selective loss of GluN2B function during development results in behaviors consistent with mouse models of schizophrenia. To test the role of GluN2B-containing NMDARs during development, we generated a GluN2B-to-GluN2A “replacement” mouse (2B→2A). The genetic strategy is shown in Figure 1A . The first coding exon of GluN2B (exon 4) was disrupted and replaced with cDNA encoding GluN2A as well as a neomycin resistance selection cassette. Following targeted homologous recombination, selection of properly targeted embryonic stem cells, and generation of confirmed founder animals, the neomycin cassette was removed by crossing animals with a protamine-driven Cre-recombinase mouse line (JAX: 003328). Double heterozygous (HET) male mice, containing a copy of the protamine-CRE transgene and a copy of the 2B→2A allele, were mated with C57/BL6 wild-type (WT) female mice. PCR-based genotyping differentiated between 2B→2A and WT GluN2B alleles and confirmed removal of the neomycin selection cassette (Figure 1B). Western blot analysis of cortical neuronal lysates, both in vitro and in vivo, showed that GluN2A protein is expressed prematurely in this animal in lieu of GluN2B (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1F). Western blot analysis during development confirmed the continued absence of GluN2B and the premature expression of GluN2A in 2B→2A cortical neurons (see Figure S1 available online). RT-PCR analysis of mRNA harvested from P17 homozygous 2B→2A animals showed the absence of GluN2B transcript and replacement with exogenous rat mRNA encoding GluN2A, in addition to the endogenous mouse transcript (Figure 1E). Together, these data show that the genetic strategy was successful and predict that in homozygous 2B→2A animals, glutamatergic cortical synapses contain only GluN2A-containing receptors within a GluN2B null background. Genetic deletion of GluN2B leads to perinatal lethality (Kutsuwada et al., 1996Kutsuwada T. Sakimura K. Manabe T. Takayama C. Katakura N. Kushiya E. Natsume R. Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Yagi T. et al.Impairment of suckling response, trigeminal neuronal pattern formation, and hippocampal LTD in NMDA receptor epsilon 2 subunit mutant mice.Neuron. 1996; 16: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). 2B→2A mice also displayed a high rate of perinatal lethality, indicating that premature expression of GluN2A is not sufficient to fully rescue GluN2B loss of function. Genotyping embryos harvested to prepare cortical cultures showed that the transmission frequency of the 2B→2A allele followed a predicted pattern with an approximately 1:2:1 (WT:HET:2A→2B) ratio from matings between heterozygous 2B→2A animals (19:41:21, in ten cultures). However, only ≈8% of 2A→2B homozygous animals survived past P0: 6 out of 72 predicted animals (24 months following removal of the neo cassette, data from 38 litters). Surviving homozygous 2B→2A pups exhibited no differences in size at P0 but were significantly stunted in mass when measured as juveniles (P12–P16) (Figures 1G and 1H). In homozygous 2B→2A pups at P0, we recorded a decrease in the number of rhythmic mouth suckling movements in response to stimulation with a feeding needle (Figure 1I), suggestive of a weakened ability to feed. This is consistent with an observed lack of milk in their bellies at this age (Figure 1G) and is similar to the GluN2B full knockout animals, which show a complete absence of suckling behavior. These observations underscore the importance of NMDAR signaling during development but also suggest a required and specific role for GluN2B-containing NMDARs. To determine whether or not GluN2A-containing receptors were properly expressed and trafficked to the neuronal membrane in 2B→2A mice, we generated neuronal cultures from homozygous embryos as well as WT embryos at E16–E17 and performed immunofluorescence analysis of GluN1. GluN1 is the obligate subunit of the NMDAR, and thus its expression in dendrites will correlate positively with total receptor levels. We measured similar levels of anti-GluN1 staining in 2B→2A dendrites compared to WT controls by costaining with the dendritic marker MAP2 (Figure 2A ). To examine surface-localized protein, we used a live-labeling protocol. This analysis showed that the amount of membrane-associated GluN1 protein in 2B→2A neurons was comparable to WT (Figure 2B). Because GluN1 subunits do not traffic to the neuronal surface in the absence of GluN2 (Horak et al., 2008Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. Masking of the endoplasmic reticulum retention signals during assembly of the NMDA receptor.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) this suggests that levels of surface membrane receptors are similar between genotypes. We also observed comparable levels of GluN1 staining intensity in 2B→2A neurons when we examined the signal that colocalized with the excitatory synapse marker VGluT1, suggesting that levels of synaptically localized receptors are also comparable (Figures 2B and S2A). To confirm the presence of functional NMDARs on these neurons, we applied localized NMDA stimulation (100 μM NMDA + 10 μM D-serine) while recording from voltage-clamped neurons at a holding potential of +50mV (Figure 2C). This allowed us to investigate surface receptor responses independent of presynaptic release. Interestingly, stimulation durations required to evoke similar current amplitudes were higher for 2B→2A neurons, and the peak amplitudes of these responses were slightly lower than control neurons at similar stimulation durations (Figure 2D). Although this suggested a decrease in the number of functional surface receptors, it is also consistent with the observation that GluN2A-containing NMDARs have lower agonist sensitivity than GluN2B (Erreger et al., 2007Erreger K. Geballe M.T. Kristensen A. Chen P.E. Hansen K.B. Lee C.J. Yuan H. Le P. Lyuboslavsky P.N. Micale N. et al.Subunit-specific agonist activity at NR2A-, NR2B-, NR2C-, and NR2D-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In support of this, we noted that when NMDA concentration was increased (1 mM), response amplitudes were not significantly different (Figure S2B). To further estimate the number of functional membrane receptors, we applied coefficient of variance (COV) analysis to the NMDA-evoked responses. As predicted, application of the use-dependent NMDAR antagonist MK801 caused an increase in COV over time (Figures 2C and 2E). However, we observed no significant difference in COV values between WT and 2B→2A neurons at either high or low levels of receptor blockade (Figure 2E). Single-channel recordings in expression systems have shown that heteromeric GluN1/GluN2A NMDARs exhibit higher open probability than GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs, which predict a faster rate of block by MK801 (Erreger et al., 2005Erreger K.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6844-6854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our observations are consistent with other results in neurons (Speed and Dobrunz, 2009Speed H.E. Dobrunz L.E.

Westbrook G. Integrins mediate functional pre- and postsynaptic maturation at a hippocampal synapse.Nature. 2001; 411: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and suggest that, unlike in expression systems, GluN2A-containing NMDARs in cortical neurons may have similar open channel probabilities compared to those containing GluN2B. The pharmacological profile of NMDAR currents in 2B→2A neurons was consistent with a pure GluN2A-containing population because they were insensitive to the GluN2B antagonist ifenprodil (3 μM), whereas WT responses were blocked to nearly 50% (Figure 2F). GluN2A-containing NMDARs are also more sensitive to ambient zinc ions, and we observed that 2B→2A responses exhibited significantly more potentiation following application of the zinc-ion chelator TPEN (0.5 μM) (Figure 2F). Together, these data indicate that GluN2A protein is expressed and, along with GluN1, is able to form functional receptors in the absence of GluN2B. Moreover, they suggest the presence of similar numbers of NMDARs on 2B→2A neurons, although peak amplitudes of NMDA-evoked currents were depressed, potentially due to the dominance of extrasynaptic receptors to responses evoked under this stimulation method and/or to decreased agonist sensitivity of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. Responses evoked by localized NMDA application in vitro are the result of activation of both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. We next carried out experiments in acute slices to confirm the presence of synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents ex vivo. GluN2A-containing NMDARs have been shown to traffic to autaptic synapses in GluN2B null hippocampal cultures and in cultured cortical slices following knockdown of GluN2B (Tovar et al., 2000Tovar K.R. Sprouffske K. Westbrook G.L. Fast NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in neurons from mice lacking the epsilon2 (NR2B) subunit.J.

Subunit-specific NMDA receptor trafficking to synapses.Neuron. 2002; 35: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, their ability to traffic to GluN2B null synapses in vivo had not been tested. We recorded whole-cell currents from layer II/III cortical neurons in acute brain slices in response to presynaptic stimulation in layer IV of 2B→2A animals (P12–P16) (Figure 3). Voltage clamping at depolarized potentials to remove the Mg2+ block of NMDARs and electrically stimulating afferent axons allowed us to record APV-sensitive currents in 2B→2A cortex (Figures 3A and 3B). The peak amplitude of the synaptic NMDAR-mediated current at +50mV was not significantly different in 2B→2A mice compared to controls (Figure 3B). Consistent with a pure population of GluN2A-containing receptors, these recordings revealed a lack of sensitivity to the GluN2B selective antagonist ifenprodil (Figure 3C) and to NMDAR-mediated currents that exhibited significantly faster decay times (decreased tau) (Figure 3D) (Vicini et al., 1998Vicini S. Wang J.F. Li J.H. Zhu W.J. Wang Y.H. Luo J.H. Wolfe B.B. Grayson D.R. Functional and pharmacological differences between recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Faster decay resulted in a slight, but statistically significant, decrease in integrated current measured at +50mV over the initial 200 ms of the evoked response, but not over the initial 100 ms of the response (Figure 3D). These data show that our genetic strategy was successful in removing GluN2B and driving precocious expression and synaptic incorporation of GluN2A-mediated NMDAR-receptors while recovering a significant amount of synaptic NMDAR-mediated current at cortical synapses in vivo. GluN2B and GluN2A interact with, and activate, distinct signaling cascades at excitatory synapses in order to control the composition and strength of synaptic contacts. The dominant way by which NMDARs regulate synaptic strength is through bidirectional trafficking of AMPARs. In light of this, we examined AMPAR-mediated currents in 2B→2A mice. For these experiments, cortical neuron cultures were prepared from both homozygous GluN2B knockout and 2B→2A embryos, as well as from WT littermate embryos. We isolated AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) between 11 and 15 days in vitro (DIV) using 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) + 50 μM picrotoxin. In both GluN2B null and 2B→2A cultures, we observed a significant increase in mean mEPSC amplitudes (Figure 4A ), showing that individual cortical synapses had enriched AMPAR contribution in the absence of GluN2B. This is consistent with published data showing that NMDAR signaling, under basal levels of activity, can act to suppress incorporation of AMPARs at glutamatergic synapses (Hall et al., 2007Hall B.J.

The inability of GluN2A to rescue mEPSC amplitudes in 2B→2A neurons predicts a unique role for GluN2B-containing NMDARs in regulating AMPAR current development in cortical neurons. The increase in mEPSC amplitudes, both in GluN2B null and 2B→2A neurons, was multiplicative (slope: GluN2B null = 1.85, R = 0.984; 2B→2A = 1.64, R = 0.99) (Figure 4A). This predicted a proportionate enrichment of AMPARs across all synapses, which is a hallmark of synaptic scaling (Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). This led us to believe that GluN2B might be important for controlling homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Proper circuit formation requires homeostatic plasticity, which drives cell-wide changes in synaptic strength in part by regulating AMPAR contribution. Homeostatic changes in synaptic strength can be measured as changes in AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitudes (Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Synaptic scaling, evoked in response to manipulation of activity levels in neuronal cultures, can be transcription dependent or protein translation dependent, and the effect on individual neurons can vary depending upon cell type and age in culture (Desai et al., 2002Desai N.S.

We were able to consistently scale up AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitudes in WT cortical pyramidal neurons between 11 and 15DIV, in response to chronic activity blockade (24 hr 2 μM TTX) (control = 10.68 ± 0.30 pA, n = 38; TTX = 16.13 ± 0.64 pA, n = 13; p < 0.001) and in response to acute activity blockade (5 hr 2 μM TTX concurrent with 4 hr of 50 μM APV treatment) (TTX + APV = 14.56 ± 0.86 pA, n = 13; p < 0.001) (Figures 4B and 4C), consistent with previous reports (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G.

Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We next examined the role of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in these regimes of homeostatic plasticity by comparing WT, GluN2B KO, and 2B→2A replacement neurons. In both GluN2B knockout neurons and homozygous 2B→2A neurons, scaling in response to chronic (24 hr) TTX treatment was intact (+36% GluN2B KO, p < 0.001; +19% 2B→2A, p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). However, activation of NMDARs even in the presence of TTX can suppress local protein translation, and removing this suppression results in a rapid multiplicative scaling up of synapses. This form of scaling is mediated by novel protein synthesis and can be evoked in response to acute treatment with TTX and APV (5 hr TTX + 4 hr concurrent APV treatment; see Figures 4B and 4C). In our experiments, acute treatment with TTX and APV in WT neurons caused a 36% increase in mEPSC amplitudes, consistent with previous results (Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P. Kempf C. Woo J.C. Schuman E.M.

Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Additionally, we observed that this was predominantly due to an initial increase in the presence of GluA1 (GluR1)-containing AMPARs (Figure S4), which are replaced over time by GluA2. Interestingly, this form of homeostatic plasticity was occluded in both GluN2B knockout (101% ± 3.8%, p = 0.82) and 2B→2A (100.5% ± 3.2%, p = 0.93) cultures (Figure 4C). To confirm these results, we attempted to rescue the increase in mEPSC amplitudes by cotransfecting GluN2A or GluN2B into GluN2B null neurons. In these experiments, only GluN2B recovered mEPSC amplitudes to WT control levels, and transfection of GluN2B into 2B→2A neurons also returned mEPSC amplitudes to control levels (Figure 5A ). Treatment with TTX and ifenprodil (3 μM) also increased mEPSC amplitudes, supporting a role for GluN2B-containing receptors in this protein translation-dependent scaling regime (Figure 5B). Interestingly, coapplication of actinomycin-D (12 μM) blocked scaling in response to 24 hr TTX (Figure 5C), in line with previous observations suggesting that synaptic scaling in response to chronic manipulation requires transcriptional activation (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). To confirm a role for protein translation in the rapid scaling regime, we also observed that coapplication of the translation inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM) blocked the increase in mEPSC amplitudes observed with TTX + APV alone (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the protein translation blocker cycloheximide (100 μM, 24 hr) rescued the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GluN2B in cultures (Figure 5D). Together, these data strongly suggest that the cellular mechanisms underlying these two forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity are dissociable but also that NMDAR-mediated suppression of translation is likely mediated specifically by GluN2B signaling, and the downstream cellular signaling pathways responsible for this regulation are not activated by GluN2A-containing NMDARs. Supporting our conclusion that GluN2B directly, and negatively, regulates local protein translation in dendrites, both western blot analysis and immunostaining revealed a strong increase in levels of phosphorylated p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) in 2B→2A cultures relative to WT controls (Figures 6A and S5). Levels of phosphorylated p70S6K correlate positively with the degree of active protein synthesis in neurons and are positively regulated by mTOR. To test the potential role of mTOR in acute scaling, we applied TTX + APV either in the presence or the absence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (1 μM). The results are consistent with a role for mTOR signaling in this scaling regime, because exposure to rapamycin comp"

In a few recent reports, acetylation down-regulated activity of specific enzymes in fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, electron transport, and anti-oxidant pathways. Here, we reveal that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase-1 (PGAM1) is negatively regulated by Sirt1, a member of the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases. Acetylated PGAM1 displays enhanced activity, although Sirt1-mediated deacetylation reduces activity. Acetylation sites mapped to the C-terminal ""cap,"" a region previously known to affect catalytic efficiency. Overexpression of a constitutively active variant (acetylated mimic) of PGAM1 stimulated flux through glycolysis. Under glucose restriction, Sirt1 levels dramatically increased, leading to PGAM1 deacetylation and attenuated activity. Previously, Sirt1 has been implicated in the adaptation from glucose to fat burning. This study (i) demonstrates that protein acetylation can stimulate metabolic enzymes, (ii) provides biochemical evidence that glycolysis is modulated by reversible acetylation, and (iii) demonstrates that PGAM1 deacetylation and activity are directly controlled by Sirt1."

PR expression in these cellular compartments is under tight temporal and endocrine control. Although ex vivo studies demonstrated the importance of stromal PR expression, they failed to show a role for epithelial PR in uterine function. Here, the in vivo role of PR in the uterine epithelium is defined using floxed PR (PR(f/f)) mice crossed to Wnt7a-Cre mice. Progesterone was unable to stimulate the expression of its epithelial target genes, including Ihh, in the Wnt7a-Cre(+)PR(f/-) mice. Analysis was conducted on Ihh to determine whether PR directly regulates epithelial gene transcription. ChIP-on-chip analysis identified PR binding sites in the 5'-flanking region of Ihh. Cotransfection of the proximal Ihh promoter with PR demonstrated that PR directly regulates Ihh transcription. Female Wnt7a-Cre(+)PR(f/-) mice are infertile due to defects in embryo attachment, stromal cell decidualization, and the inability to cease estrogen-induced epithelial cell proliferation. Finally, progesterone was unable to inhibit neonatal endometrial glandular development in Wnt7a-Cre(+)PR(f/-) mice. Thus, epithelial PR is necessary for the regulation of progesterone epithelial target gene expression, as well as uterine function and development."

One of the CYP3A4 substrates is bromoergocryptine (BEC), a dopamine receptor agonist prescribed for the inhibition of prolactin secretion and treatment of Parkinson disease, type 2 diabetes, and several other pathological conditions. Here we present a 2.15 Å crystal structure of the CYP3A4-BEC complex in which the drug, a type I heme ligand, is bound in a productive mode. The manner of BEC binding is consistent with the in vivo metabolite analysis and identifies the 8' and 9' carbons of the proline ring as the primary sites of oxidation. The crystal structure predicts the importance of Arg(212) and Thr(224) for binding of the tripeptide and lysergic moieties of BEC, respectively, which we confirmed experimentally. Our data support a three-step BEC binding model according to which the drug binds first at a peripheral site without perturbing the heme spectrum and then translocates into the active site cavity, where formation of a hydrogen bond between Thr(224) and the N1 atom of the lysergic moiety is followed by a slower conformational readjustment of the tripeptide group modulated by Arg(212)."

We show that classical deprivation-induced whisker map plasticity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of rat somatosensory (S1) cortex involves robust weakening of L4-L2/3 feedforward inhibition. This weakening was caused by reduced L4 excitation onto L2/3 fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, which mediate sensitive feedforward inhibition and was partially offset by strengthening of unitary FS to L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses. Weakening of feedforward inhibition paralleled the known weakening of feedforward excitation. As a result, mean excitation-inhibition balance and timing onto L2/3 pyramidal cells were preserved. Thus, reduced feedforward inhibition is a covert compensatory process that can maintain excitatory-inhibitory balance during classical deprivation-induced Hebbian map plasticity.

Whisker deprivation reduces feedforward inhibition during whisker map plasticity Feedforward inhibition is reduced in parallel with feedforward excitation Reduced inhibition maintains excitation-inhibition balance during plasticity Multiple sites of plasticity exist within fast-spiking interneuron circuits Sensory experience shapes cortical sensory representations and perception. In classical sensory map plasticity, deprived sensory inputs weaken and shrink within maps, whereas spared or overused inputs strengthen and expand (Feldman and Brecht, 2005Feldman D.E. Brecht M. Map plasticity in somatosensory cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This process involves multiple sites of plasticity in excitatory circuits, but how experience regulates inhibitory circuits is less clear and may be more varied. In some cases, deprivation potentiates inhibition, which may suppress responses to deprived sensory inputs (Maffei et al., 2006Maffei A. Nataraj K. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Potentiation of cortical inhibition by visual deprivation.Nature. 2006; 443: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In other cases, deprivation weakens inhibition, which may homeostatically restore sensory responsiveness (Jiao et al., 2006Jiao Y. Zhang C. Yanagawa Y. Sun Q.Q.

A key factor is how deprivation affects excitation-inhibition balance, which is a major regulator of sensory tuning and information processing (Pouille et al., 2009Pouille F. Marin-Burgin A.

However, it may be essential to have a mode of cortical map plasticity that preserves normal excitation-inhibition balance, so that sensory processing is unimpaired in the reorganized map. We studied how experience regulates feedforward inhibitory circuits and excitation-inhibition balance during whisker map plasticity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of rodent somatosensory (S1 or barrel) cortex. L2/3 is the primary site of plasticity in postneonatal animals (Fox, 2002Fox K. Anatomical pathways and molecular mechanisms for plasticity in the barrel cortex.Neuroscience. 2002; 111: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Rats have five rows of whiskers, labeled A–E, which are active tactile detectors. The whiskers are represented in S1 by an isomorphic map of cortical columns, each centered on a cell cluster in layer 4 (L4), called a barrel. L4 excitatory cells in each barrel receive thalamocortical whisker input and make a strong feedforward projection to L2/3 pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the same column (Feldmeyer et al., 2002Feldmeyer D. Lübke J. Silver R.A. Sakmann B. Synaptic connections between layer 4 spiny neurone-layer 2/3 pyramidal cell pairs in juvenile rat barrel cortex: physiology and anatomy of interlaminar signalling within a cortical column.J.

Neurons in each column respond most strongly to deflection of the corresponding whisker, resulting in a whisker-receptive field map across S1. Plucking or trimming a subset of whiskers in juvenile animals causes whisker map plasticity, in which spiking responses to deprived whiskers are rapidly depressed in L2/3 of deprived columns, whereas responses in L4 remain relatively unaffected (Drew and Feldman, 2009Drew P.J.

However, whether plasticity also occurs within L2/3 inhibitory circuits and how it contributes to the expression of whisker map plasticity remain unknown. We focused on a specific circuit component, feedforward inhibition, because it powerfully sharpens receptive fields, sets response gain and dynamic range, and enforces spike-timing precision (Bruno and Simons, 2002Bruno R.M.

Sci. 2002; 357: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that changes in feedforward inhibition or its balance with excitation may contribute importantly to expression of sensory map plasticity. We found that the most sensitive L4-L2/3 feedforward inhibition is mediated by L2/3 fast-spiking (FS) interneurons. Whisker deprivation weakened L4 excitatory drive onto L2/3 FS cells, which was partly offset by strengthening of unitary FS to pyramidal cell inhibition. Overall, deprivation strongly reduced net feedforward inhibition. This reduction in feedforward inhibition occurred in parallel with the known reduction in feedforward excitation onto L2/3 pyramidal cells (Allen et al., 2003Allen C.B. Celikel T. Feldman D.E.

Thus, feedforward inhibition is plastic, and weakening of feedforward inhibition constitutes a compensatory mechanism that can maintain excitation-inhibition balance during deprivation-induced Hebbian map plasticity. We induced whisker map plasticity by plucking the right-side D-row whiskers for 6–12 days, starting at postnatal day (P) 12, which is a robust early critical period for L2/3 map plasticity (Stern et al., 2001Stern E.A. Maravall M. Svoboda K. Rapid development and plasticity of layer 2/3 maps in rat barrel cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2001; 31: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This deprivation paradigm weakens whisker-evoked spiking responses in L2/3, but not L4, of deprived columns, indicating a locus for plasticity in L4-L2/3 or L2/3 circuits (Drew and Feldman, 2009Drew P.J. Feldman D.E. Intrinsic signal imaging of deprivation-induced contraction of whisker representations in rat somatosensory cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2009; 19: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether feedforward inhibition was altered by deprivation, we prepared “across-row” S1 slices in which A–E-row whisker columns can be unambiguously identified (Finnerty et al., 1999Finnerty G.T. Roberts L.S. Connors B.W. Sensory experience modifies the short-term dynamics of neocortical synapses.Nature. 1999; 400: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We compared synaptic and cellular properties of inhibitory circuits in D whisker columns from deprived animals versus sham-deprived littermates, except in conductance experiments (see below) in which we compared deprived D versus spared B whisker columns in slices from deprived animals. Spared columns are appropriate controls because whisker responses and single-cell physiological properties in spared columns are unaffected by D-row deprivation (Allen et al., 2003Allen C.B.

To measure L4-L2/3 feedforward inhibition, we stimulated L4 extracellularly at low intensity and made whole-cell recordings from cocolumnar L2/3 pyramidal cells, with 50 μM D-APV in the bath to reduce polysynaptic excitation. In current clamp, L4 stimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential-inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP-IPSP) sequences in L2/3 pyramidal cells (Figure 1B , top). In voltage clamp, L4-evoked inhibitory currents (Cs+ gluconate internal containing 5 mM BAPTA; 0mV holding potential) were essentially abolished by 10 μM NBQX, indicating that inhibition was largely polysynaptic (Figure 1B, bottom). We characterized the recruitment of feedforward inhibition by measuring L4-evoked excitation and inhibition in single pyramidal cells at increasing L4 stimulation intensities above excitatory-response threshold, defined as the intensity required to evoke an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) with no failures (EPSCs measured at −68mV; inhibitory postsynaptic currents [IPSCs] measured at 0mV). At each stimulation intensity, mono- and polysynaptic inhibition were separated using NBQX (see Experimental Procedures). Polysynaptic inhibition was first detectable at 1.2 × excitatory-response threshold, and 97% ± 2% of inhibition was polysynaptic at this intensity (n = 10 cells) (Figure 1C). To determine whether L4-evoked inhibition was feedforward (as opposed to feedback), we made cell-attached recordings (using K+ gluconate internal) from L2/3 pyramidal cells and from L2/3 inhibitory interneurons, which provide ∼80% of inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramids (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000Dantzker J.L. Callaway E.M. Laminar sources of synaptic input to cortical inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We measured spike probability in response to increasing L4 stimulation intensity (measured relative to excitatory-response threshold for a cocolumnar pyramidal cell) and then broke in to establish whole-cell recording and to classify each cell as a putative pyramidal (PYR) cell, fast-spiking (FS) interneuron, or regular-spiking nonpyramidal (RSNP) interneuron by electrophysiological criteria (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 available online). Biocytin reconstruction showed that FS interneurons were primarily basket cells, whereas RSNP cells were bipolar, bitufted, and basket cells, and all PYR cells had dense dendritic spines characteristic of excitatory cells (Figure 2A ). We found that L2/3 FS cells were much more likely to spike to low-intensity L4 stimulation than PYR or RSNP cells (Figure 2B). The median stimulation intensity required to reliably evoke ≥1 spike was 2.5, 5.0, and 5.5 × excitatory-response threshold for FS, RSNP, and PYR cell types, respectively (Figure 2C; n = 10, n = 19, and n = 22 cells each). This is consistent with the strong excitation that L2/3 FS cells receive from L4 excitatory cells (Helmstaedter et al., 2008Helmstaedter M. Staiger J.F. Sakmann B. Feldmeyer D. Efficient recruitment of layer 2/3 interneurons by layer 4 input in single columns of rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8273-8284Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because L2/3 PYR cells did not spike at low-stimulation intensity (<2 × threshold), L4-evoked inhibition at low-stimulus intensity must be feedforward rather than feedback inhibition. Additional experiments using 2-photon calcium imaging from large populations of L2/3 pyramidal cells confirmed that L4 stimulation at <2 × threshold evoked spikes in only 1/110 L2/3 PYR neurons (J.E. and D.E.F., unpublished data). This confirms that low-intensity L4 stimulation selectively evokes feedforward inhibition and excitation onto L2/3 pyramidal cells. Because L4 stimulation primarily activates FS cells among L2/3 interneurons, the most sensitive feedforward inhibition is likely to be mediated by L2/3 FS neurons. To determine how deprivation affects L4-L2/3 feedforward inhibition, we first assayed L4-evoked excitation onto L2/3 FS cells. L4-evoked EPSPs were recorded in current clamp from L2/3 FS, RSNP, and PYR neurons in D columns of D-row-deprived rats or whisker-intact, sham-deprived littermates. Focal bicuculline was used to block inhibition and high-divalent Ringer's (4 mM Ca2+, 4 mM Mg2+) was used to reduce polysynaptic activity and isolate monosynaptic EPSPs (Allen et al., 2003Allen C.B. Celikel T. Feldman D.E. Long-term depression induced by sensory deprivation during cortical map plasticity in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A ). For each cell, we constructed an input-output curve for EPSP amplitude and initial slope in response to L4 stimulation at 1.0–1.8 × excitatory-response threshold measured for a cocolumnar pyramidal cell. EPSPs were measured at −70mV in PYR cells and at −60mV in FS and RSNP cells (to mimic normal Vrest; Figure S1F). Deprivation substantially reduced input-output curves for L2/3 FS cells (by ∼50%) in deprived relative to sham-deprived columns (n = 9 cells each; amplitude: p < 0.0001; slope: p < 0.001; 2-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]; Figures 3B1 and 3B2). These changes occurred despite identical stimulation intensity in deprived versus sham-deprived columns (3.4 ± 0.2 μA and 3.4 ± 0.2 μA at excitatory-response threshold; p = 0.80; t test). For PYR cells, deprivation also reduced input-output curves for EPSP amplitude and slope relative to sham-deprived columns (n = 26 and n = 25 cells each; amplitude: p < 0.002; slope: p < 0.04; Figure 3C). This is consistent with known weakening of L4-L2/3 excitatory synapses onto PYR cells (Allen et al., 2003Allen C.B. Celikel T. Feldman D.E.

For RSNP cells, input-output curves were inconsistently affected, with EPSP amplitude being unchanged in deprived versus sham-deprived columns (n = 12 and n = 9 cells each) but with EPSP slope showing a trend toward decrease (amplitude: p = 0.54; slope: p = 0.05) (Figure 3D). Weakening of L4-evoked excitation onto FS cells was confirmed by dual recordings from neighboring PYR and FS cells in the same cortical column (Figure 4A ). PYR and FS cells (mean 90 μm, max 170 μm apart) were recorded simultaneously or sequentially, and an input-output curve for EPSPs onto each cell was measured using identical L4 stimulation. In sham-deprived D columns, L4-evoked EPSPs in L2/3 FS cells were reliably larger than EPSPs in cocolumnar PYR cells (Figure 4B; shown for 1.4 × threshold), as expected for strong, highly sensitive feedforward inhibition (Bruno and Simons, 2002Bruno R.M.

However, in deprived D columns, EPSP slope and amplitude were equal or smaller in FS cells compared to cocolumnar pyramidal cells (Figure 4B; 1.4 × threshold). Across stimulation intensities, FS cells in sham-deprived columns consistently received stronger EPSPs than cocolumnar PYR cells, whereas FS cells in deprived columns received weaker or equal EPSPs than cocolumnar PYR cells (Figure 4C) (n = 9 each; amplitude: p < 0.001; 2-way ANOVA; slope: p < 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that deprivation weakens L4 excitation onto L2/3 FS cells even more substantially than the previously known weakening of L4 excitation onto L2/3 PYR cells (Allen et al., 2003Allen C.B.

Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This suggests that deprivation reduces the recruitment of L2/3 feedforward inhibition onto L2/3 pyramidal cells. To test whether deprivation altered FS excitability, we first measured passive membrane properties and intrinsic spiking of L2/3 FS cells in D columns of deprived rats and sham-deprived littermates. In whole-cell recordings, resting membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Rin), membrane time constant (τ), and spike threshold were identical in deprived versus sham-deprived columns, as was spiking rate in response to 500 ms somatic current injection (n = 21 sham, n = 20 deprived) (Figures 5A and 5B ). To assess synaptically driven excitability, we measured the magnitude of L4 excitatory synaptic input required to drive spikes in L2/3 FS cells. Recording in cell-attached mode (K+ gluconate internal; 50 μM APV in bath), we first determined the L4 stimulation intensity required to elicit 50% (range: 40%–60%) spiking probability (Figure 5C). Then, we broke in and measured in voltage clamp the L4-evoked excitatory conductance at this stimulation intensity, termed threshold Ge (see Experimental Procedures). Threshold Ge represents the magnitude of excitation required to elicit 50% spike probability. Deprivation did not alter integrated threshold Ge (calculated from response onset to each cell's mean spike latency) or peak, indicating that the amount of excitatory drive necessary to elicit a spike from Vrest was unaltered (n = 8 sham, n= 6 deprived) (Figure 5D and Figure S2). Together, these results indicate that FS cell intrinsic excitability is essentially unaltered after deprivation. However, deprivation did increase onset latency of threshold Ge onto L2/3 FS cells (sham deprived: 3.3 ± 0.3 ms; deprived: 4.4 ± 0.2 ms; p < 0.05), with a corresponding increase in evoked spike latency (7.8 ± 0.5 ms versus 11.1 ± 1.4 ms; p < 0.05) (Figure S2). In L4 of visual cortex, sensory deprivation has been reported to enhance inhibition by potentiation of inhibitory FS→PYR synapses (Maffei et al., 2006Maffei A. Nataraj K. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Potentiation of cortical inhibition by visual deprivation.Nature. 2006; 443: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To test whether L2/3 FS→PYR synapses are also altered by whisker deprivation, we measured connectivity rate and synapse properties for unitary inhibitory connections from L2/3 FS cells to PYR cells (L2/3 FS→PYR synapses) in D columns from deprived and sham-deprived rats (Figure 6A ). Cells were patched with a low chloride internal (ECl = −88mV) to increase the size of hyperpolarizing unitary IPSPs (uIPSPs) (Figure 6B). FS spikes were elicited by current injection, and connected FS→PYR pairs were identified by a statistically significant uIPSP amplitude compared to a prespike baseline period (20–40 sweeps; post-PYR cell Vm = −50mV; paired sign rank test; p < 0.05). The L2/3 FS→PYR connection rate was greater in deprived columns (22/28 pairs connected, 78.6% connection rate [95% confidence interval 61%–93%]) versus sham-deprived columns (21/45 pairs connected, 46.7% [31%–60%]; p < 0.01; rank-sum test). Intersoma distance was identical for these connected pairs (deprived: 57 ± 5 μm; sham deprived: 56 ± 3 μm). FS→PYR uIPSP amplitude for connected pairs was also greater in deprived (−1.59 ± 0.23mV; n = 21 pairs, measured at Vm = −50mV) than in sham-deprived columns (−0.69 ± 0.12mV; n = 20; p < 0.01; t test; one pair in each condition excluded because of low Rin). uIPSP slope was similarly increased (deprived: −0.27 ± 0.05mV/ms; sham deprived: −0.12 ± 0.02mV/ms; p < 0.01) (Figures 6B–6D). This increase in uIPSP synapse strength and connection rate was associated with a decrease in failure rate (deprived: 16.3% [8%–30%]; sham deprived: 36.8% [22%–52%]; p < 0.04; rank-sum test) and coefficient of variation (deprived: 0.27 [0.22–0.37]; sham deprived: 0.40 [0.30–0.69]; p < 0.05; rank-sum test). Deprivation did not alter short-term plasticity during trains of five presynaptic spikes (50 ms isi) or uIPSP kinetics (Figures 6E and 6F). Together, these results suggest that deprivation strengthens uIPSPs by increasing the number of synapses or release sites. If deprivation weakens L4 excitation onto L2/3 FS neurons but increases FS→PYR unitary synapse strength, what is the overall net effect of deprivation on feedforward inhibition? To address this, we measured net L4-evoked feedforward inhibition and excitation onto single L2/3 pyramidal cells in voltage clamp (Cs+ gluconate internal with 5 mM BAPTA, 50 μM APV in bath to reduce polysynaptic excitation). L4 stimulation intensity was standardized at 1.2 × excitatory-response threshold in order to st"

Previous studies have identified the horizontal basal cell (HBC) as the neural stem cell of the postnatal olfactory epithelium. However, the molecules and pathways regulating HBC self-renewal and differentiation are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor gene family known to regulate stem cell dynamics in other epithelia, is highly enriched in HBCs. We show that p63 is required cell autonomously for olfactory stem cell renewal and further demonstrate that p63 functions to repress HBC differentiation. These results provide critical insight into the genetic regulation of the olfactory stem cell in vivo and more generally provide an entrée toward understanding the coordination of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2024322138,"During homeostatic adjustment in response to alterations in neuronal activity, synaptic expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is globally tuned up or down so that the neuronal activity is restored to a physiological range. Given that a central neuron receives multiple presynaptic inputs, whether and how AMPAR synaptic expression is homeostatically regulated at individual synapses remain unclear. In cultured hippocampal neurons we report that when activity of an individual presynaptic terminal is selectively elevated by light-controlled excitation, AMPAR abundance at the excited synapses is selectively downregulated in an NMDAR-dependent manner. The reduction in surface AMPARs is accompanied by enhanced receptor endocytosis and dependent on proteasomal activity. Synaptic activation also leads to a site-specific increase in the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and polyubiquitination levels, consistent with AMPAR ubiquitination and degradation in the spine. These results indicate that AMPAR accumulation at individual synapses is subject to autonomous homeostatic regulation in response to synaptic activity."

Here, we report that in Drosophila neurons, ELP3 is necessary and sufficient to acetylate the ELKS family member Bruchpilot, an integral component of the presynaptic density where neurotransmitters are released. We find that in elp3 mutants, presynaptic densities assemble normally, but they show morphological defects such that their cytoplasmic extensions cover a larger area, resulting in increased vesicle tethering as well as a more proficient neurotransmitter release. We propose a model where ELP3-dependent acetylation of Bruchpilot at synapses regulates the structure of individual presynaptic densities and neurotransmitter release efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2023053172,"Adipose tissue plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Disruption of the Lpin1 gene encoding lipin-1 causes impaired adipose tissue development and function in rodents. Lipin-1 functions as a phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzyme in the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway for triglyceride storage and as a transcriptional coactivator/corepressor for metabolic nuclear receptors. Previous studies established that lipin-1 is required at an early step in adipocyte differentiation for induction of the adipogenic gene transcription program, including the key regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Here, we investigate the requirement of lipin-1 PAP versus coactivator function in the establishment of Pparg expression during adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that PAP activity supplied by lipin-1, lipin-2, or lipin-3, but not lipin-1 coactivator activity, can rescue Pparg gene expression and lipogenesis during adipogenesis in lipin-1-deficient preadipocytes. In adipose tissue from lipin-1-deficient mice, there is an accumulation of phosphatidate species containing a range of medium chain fatty acids and an activation of the MAPK/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Phosphatidate inhibits differentiation of cultured adipocytes, and this can be rescued by the expression of lipin-1 PAP activity or by inhibition of ERK signaling. These results emphasize the importance of lipid intermediates as choreographers of gene regulation during adipogenesis, and the results highlight a specific role for lipins as determinants of levels of a phosphatidic acid pool that influences Pparg expression."
https://openalex.org/W2116965394,"SIRT1 is one of seven mammalian sirtuin (silent information regulator 2-related) proteins that harbor NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase activity and is implicated in multiple metabolic and age-associated pathways and disorders. The sirtuin proteins contain a central region of high sequence conservation that is required for catalytic activity, but more variable N- and C-terminal regions have been proposed to mediate protein specific activities. Here we show that the conserved catalytic core domain of SIRT1 has very low catalytic activity toward several known protein substrates, but that regions N- and C-terminal to the catalytic core potentiate catalytic efficiency by between 12- and 45-fold, with the N-terminal domain contributing predominantly to catalytic rate, relatively independent of the nature of the acetyl-lysine protein substrate, and the C-terminal domain contributing significantly to the Km for NAD+. We show that the N- and C-terminal regions stimulate SIRT1 deacetylase activity intramolecularly and that the C-terminal region stably associates with the catalytic core domain to form a SIRT1 holoenzyme. We also demonstrate that the C-terminal region of SIRT1 can influence the inhibitory activity of some sirtuin inhibitors that are known to function through the catalytic core domain.

The founding member of this protein family, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2p, one of five yeast sirtuin proteins including HST1–4, is a limiting factor in yeast aging, because deletion of the SIR2 gene results in reduced replicative lifespan (5Kim E.

Humans have seven sirtuin proteins (SIRT1–7) (10Frye R.A. Phylogenetic classification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Sir2-like proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), several of which have been shown to have distinct biological properties (11Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Mammalian sirtuins: biological insights and disease relevance.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). The SIRT1 protein has been the most thoroughly studied of the human sirtuins and has been shown to play roles in many biological processes including cell survival, apoptosis, stress resistance, fat storage, insulin production, glucose homeostasis, and lipid homeostasis through direct deacetylation or regulation of its many known in vivo targets including transcription factors such as p53, Forkhead box class O, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and histones such as H3 (K9 and K14) and H4 (K16) (reviewed in Ref. 12Guarente L. Sirtuins in aging and disease.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2007; 72: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). SIRT1 has also been implicated to play a role in a number of age-related human diseases including diabetes, cancer, and inflammation (reviewed in Ref. 13Donmez G. Guarente L. Aging and disease. Connections to sirtuins.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the sirtuin proteins indicates that they contain an ∼275-amino acid conserved catalytic core domain (7Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. The SIR2 gene family, conserved from bacteria to humans, functions in silencing, cell cycle progression, and chromosome stability.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 14Frye R.A.

Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with the sequence conservation among the sirtuin proteins, the catalytic core domains of known sirtuin structures show a high degree of structural superposition (supplemental Fig. S1). Several x-ray crystal structures of sirtuin proteins from bacteria (CobB and Sir2Tm), yeast (Sir2 and Hst2), archaea (Sir2-Af1 and Sir2-Af2), and human (SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5) in several different liganded forms reveal a structurally conserved catalytic core domain that adopts an elongated shape containing a large and structurally homologous Rossmann fold domain, characteristic of NAD+/NADH-binding proteins; a more structurally diverse, smaller, zinc-binding domain; and several loops connecting the two domains (reviewed in Ref. 15Sanders B.D. Jackson B. Marmorstein R. Structural basis for sirtuin function. What we know and what we don't.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1604-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These loops form a pronounced, extended cleft between the large and small domains where the NAD+ and acetyl-lysine-containing peptide substrates enter from opposite sides and bind to the enzyme. The amino acids involved in catalysis and the reactive groups of both bound substrate molecules are buried within a protein tunnel in the cleft between the two domains, the region of the enzyme that contains the highest sequence conservation within the sirtuin enzymes (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to the sequence and structural conservation of the catalytic core domain, many eukaryotic sirtuin proteins contain N- and C-terminal flanking regions that are variable in length and sequence and have been proposed to play protein-specific regulatory roles (Fig. 1A). For example, the N- and C-terminal segments of yeast Hst2 have been shown to mediate homotrimer formation that plays an autoinhibitory role in the deacetylase activity of Hst2 (16Zhao K. Chai X. Clements A. Marmorstein R. Structure and autoregulation of the yeast Hst2 homolog of Sir2.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal region was also shown to contain a nuclear export signal (17Wilson J.M. Le V.Q. Zimmerman C. Marmorstein R. Pillus L. Nuclear export modulates the cytoplasmic Sir2 homologue Hst2.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Of the seven human sirtuin proteins, the 747-residue SIRT1 protein contains the most extended N- and C-terminal segments that flank a catalytic core domain within approximately residues 240–500, with the function of these N- and C-terminal segments unknown (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, like yeast Hst2, the N- and C-terminal segments of SIRT1 play autoregulatory functions to modulate SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that a SIRT1 protein construct harboring the conserved catalytic core domain contains very low deacetylase activity, whereas the addition of N- and C-terminal segments of SIRT1 can potentiate the catalytic efficiency of the core region by between 12–45-fold, with the N-terminal domain contributing predominantly to catalytic rate and the C-terminal domain contributing significantly to the Km for NAD+. We also show that the N- and C-terminal regions stimulate SIRT1 deacetylase activity intramolecularly to form a SIRT1 holoenzyme and that the C-terminal domain can influence the activity of SIRT1 inhibitors. A plasmid expressing full-length human SIRT1 was a generous gift from David Sinclair (Harvard Medical School). DNA fragments encoding various SIRT1 constructs (residues 214–583, 160–583, 160–665, and 584–665) were cloned into the first multiple cloning site of the pETDuet-1 vector containing the gene for yeast SMT3, a ubiquitin-like protein of the SUMO family. BL21-CodonPlus (DE3 RIL) cells harboring the SIRT1 expression constructs were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and induced at log phase with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. The cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in a sonication buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol with the addition of 0.1 mg/ml PMSF. The cell lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the protein supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column and washed extensively with sonication buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole, before eluting the protein with a 30–600 mm imidazole gradient in sonication buffer. The His-SUMO tag was removed by incubating the SIRT1 protein with ULP1 (ubiquitin-like-specific protease 1) at 4 °C overnight and then passing the overnight incubation solution through a fresh nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated in sonication buffer plus 30 mm imidazole. The NaCl concentration of the collected flow through was lowered to ∼100 mm by diluting with sonication buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and loading the solution on a HiTrap Q ion exchange column. SIRT1 protein elution was carried out with a gradient of 100–800 mm NaCl in sonication buffer. Peak SIRT1 protein fractions were further purified on Superdex-200 in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm DTT to yield >90% pure SIRT1 protein (as judged by SDS-PAGE). SIRT1 protein was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using a microconcentrator and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C after flash freezing prior to use. A 6-liter purification typically yielded 1–3 mg of purified protein depending on the specific SIRT1 protein construct. The steady state parameters and catalytic efficiency of deacetylase activity of SIRT1 protein constructs were determined using a radioactive assay that employs [14C]NAD+, labeled on the carbonyl group of the nicotinamide moiety. This assay measures the SIRT1-dependent hydrolysis of the [14C]nicotinamide group, which is isolated from unreacted [14C]NAD+ by extraction using ethyl acetate and quantified by scintillation counting as described elsewhere (2Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. The silencing protein SIR2 and its homologs are NAD-dependent protein deacetylases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5807-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The peptide substrates used in this study were purchased from Genscript and were centered around the SIRT1 targets H3(4–14)K9Ac (QTARKK(Ac)STGGK), H4(7–25)K16Ac (GKGLGKGGAK(Ac)RHRKVLRDN), and p53(372–389)K382Ac (KKGQSTSRHKK(Ac)LMFKTEG). Radioactive assays were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C (in the linear range of enzyme activity) in a total reaction volume of 100 μl in a buffer containing 50 mm glycine, pH 9.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction also contained 100 nm protein, a saturating concentration of NAD+ of 2 mm (or near saturating for the CC and N-CC SIRT1 constructs that have relatively high Km values for NAD+) while varying peptide concentrations (0–500 μm) (see Table 1) or saturating peptide substrate (500 μm) with varying NAD+ concentrations (0–800 μm) (see Table 2). The reactions were quenched by adding 67 μl of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.0, into the reaction buffer before the cleaved [14C]nicotinamide product of the reaction was extracted with ethyl acetate and quantified by scintillation counting. Background control reactions were performed in the absence of enzyme. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate, and the data were directly fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation in GraphPad Prism.TABLE 1Summary of steady state parameters and catalytic efficiency of SIRT1 protein constructs on acetylated peptide substratesPeptide substrateSIRT1 constructkcatKmkcat/KmRelative kcat/Kmmin−1μmmin−1 m−1H3(4–14) K9AcCCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.3.4 ± 0.1132.6 ± 9.025,9001N-CCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.26.7 ± 0.585.3 ± 5.8313,00012.1N-CC + C69.6 ± 1.5111.8 ± 7.1623,00024.0N-CC-C64.9 ± 2.4100.2 ± 11.4648,00025.0N-CC-C + C67.1 ± 2.080.5 ± 8.2833,00032.2H4(7–25) K16AcCCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.2.5 ± 0.154.5 ± 4.445,0001N-CCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.19.2 ± 0.663.2 ± 7.3304,0006.7N-CC + C64.2 ± 1.9101.6 ± 9.1632,00014.0N-CC-C64.9 ± 2.4100.1 ± 11.4648,00014.4p53(372–389) K382AcCCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.4.7 ± 0.169.1 ± 3.467,7001N-CCakcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.26.8 ± 0.641.1 ± 4.0653,0009.6N-CC + C43.1 ± 0.843.9 ± 3.6981,00014.5N-CC-C66.8 ± 2.083.6 ± 8.1799,00011.8a kcat and Km for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC are apparent values because the NAD+ concentration is subsaturating.

The IC50 value of nicotinamide was determined using the Fluor-de-Lys SIRT1 fluorometric drug discovery assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manual. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate, and the data were fit to a sigmoidal curve using GraphPad Prism. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the SIRT1(160–665) construct was performed at 4 °C using absorbance optics with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, using a four-hole rotor. The partial specific volume, buffer density, and viscosity were estimated using Sednterp (18Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Computer-aided interpretation of analytical sedimentation data for proteins.in: Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using six-channel centerpieces with quartz windows, spinning at 18,000, 22,000, and 26,000 rpm and at protein concentrations of 1.3, 0.9, and 0.6 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A global fit of the data, using the program Heteroanalysis, fit best to a single species SIRT1(160–665) monomer. The quality of the fit was assessed from examination of root mean square deviation. We successfully prepared recombinant full-length SIRT1 protein in bacteria but found that the protein was highly prone to aggregation and degradation and that its catalytic activity was highly variable (data not shown). To prepare a more stable and catalytically active SIRT1 protein construct, we used a sequence alignment of sirtuin proteins to aid in the design of SIRT1 protein constructs containing the catalytically active region (supplemental Fig. S1). This alignment suggested that the catalytic core domain of SIRT1 mapped to within residues 240–510. The preparation of several different SIRT1 protein constructs containing this region resulted in the identification of three SIRT1 protein constructs that could be expressed to high levels in bacteria and purified to >95% homogeneity and isolated as a monodisperse, nonaggregated species on gel filtration chromatography. These protein constructs were SIRT1(214–583) (herein called SIRT1-CC for containing the catalytic core domain), SIRT1(160–583) (herein called SIRT1-N-CC for containing the catalytic core domain plus an extended N-terminal region), and SIRT1(160–665) (herein called SIRT1-N-CC-C for containing the catalytic core domain plus extended N- and C-terminal regions). The deacetylase activity of these three SIRT1 protein constructs were analyzed using saturation kinetics to determine steady state parameters (kcat and Km) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). For these initial studies, varying concentrations of a peptide substrate centered around histone H3(4–14)K9Ac was used with saturating levels of NAD+. These studies revealed that the shortest of the SIRT1 protein constructs harboring the catalytic core domain, SIRT1-CC, exhibits steady state parameters of Km = 132.6 μm, kcat = 3.4 min−1 and a catalytic efficiency of 25,900 min−1 m−1 (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the SIRT1 protein constructs that contained extended N- and C-terminal segments showed significantly greater activity with SIRT1-N-CC and SIRT1-N-CC-C constructs exhibiting catalytic efficiencies of 313,000 min−1 m−1 and 648,000 min−1 m−1, respectively (Fig. 2). This elevation in catalytic efficiency of ∼12-fold for the N-terminally extended protein construct and of ∼25-fold for the N- and C-terminally extended construct suggests that regions N- and C-terminal to the conserved catalytic core domain of SIRT1 potentiate deacetylase activity on a histone H3(4–14)K9Ac-containing substrate. To determine whether the C-terminal region of SIRT1 potentiates the activity of the catalytic core domain by directly binding to the catalytic core domain or through some indirect mechanism, we tested the ability of a SIRT1 fragment containing the isolated extended C-terminal region, SIRT1(584–665) (SIRT1-C) to potentiate the activity of SIRT1-N-CC in trans. As can be seen in Fig. 3 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2, a 10-fold molar excess of SIRT1-C added to SIRT1-N-CC increases the catalytic efficiency of this domain by ∼1.5–5-fold, depending on the nature of the substrate, and very close to the activity of the intact SIRT1-N-CC-C protein construct. Importantly, the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of SIRT1-C to SIRT1-N-CC-C did not further increase the activity of SIRT1-N-CC-C (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, these data are consistent with a direct interaction between the catalytic core domain of SIRT1 with the C-terminal segment and possibly also the N-terminal segment to potentiate the catalytic activity of SIRT1. Because the data described above is consistent with an interaction of the N- and C-terminal segments of SIRT1 with the catalytic core domain to potentiate catalytic activity through the same or possibly another molecule of SIRT1 (for example through dimer formation), we subjected SIRT1-N-CC-C to sedimentation equilibrium studies using analytical ultracentrifugation to establish the oligomerization state of SIRT1. We carried out these experiments at three protein concentrations (1.3, 0.9, and 0.6 mg/ml) and three centrifugation speeds (18,000, 22,000, and 26,000 rpm) (Fig. 3C). A global analysis of this data fit extremely well to a single species monomer model with a molecular mass of 53.3 kDa (actual mass = 57.0 kDa) and root mean square deviation of 0.0105 Abs280. Taken together, these data suggest that the N- and C-terminal segments of SIRT1 potentiate catalytic activity by an intramolecular mechanism. We were curious to determine whether the SIRT1 catalytic potentiation observed against the H3(4–14)K9Ac peptide substrate might also be observed for other SIRT1 substrates. To address this, we assayed the SIRT1 constructs SIRT1-CC, SIRT1-N-CC, and SIRT1-N-CC-C against peptides containing H4(7–25)K16Ac and p53(372–389)K382Ac, two other known SIRT1 substrates. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, deacetylation of the H4(7–25)K16Ac substrate shows ∼6.7- and ∼14.4-fold enhancements in catalytic efficiency of the SIRT1-N-CC and SIRT1-N-CC-C constructs relative to the SIRT1-CC construct, respectively. This is comparable with the ∼12.1- and 25-fold enhancement that was observed for the corresponding protein constructs against the H3(4–14)K9Ac substrate (Table 1). Similar levels of potentiation by N- and C-terminal regions was also observed on p53(372–389)K382Ac substrate (9.6- and 11.8-fold, respectively). Taken together, these studies reveal that catalytic potentiation by the N- and C-terminal segments that flank the SIRT1 catalytic core domain is relatively independent of the nature of the acetyl-lysine protein substrate and therefore likely does not participate in protein specific acetyl-lysine recognition. An analysis of the activity of SIRT1 constructs on several acetyl-lysine-containing protein substrates clearly shows that the potentiating effects of the N- and C-terminal segments on SIRT1 catalysis is largely driven by an enhancement of kcat of ∼6–8-fold for the N-terminal segment and of another ∼2–3-fold for the C-terminal segment, with relative minor effects on Km for acetyl-lysine substrate binding (Table 1). To explore whether the N- and/or C-terminal segments of SIRT1 contributed to the Km for NAD+ catalysis, we carried out similar saturation kinetics under conditions of saturating acetyl-lysine substrate peptide and varying concentrations of NAD+ substrate (Fig. 5). We employed both the H4(7–25)K16Ac and p53(372–389)K382Ac substrates for these studies. We observed that the catalytic efficiency is enhanced ∼5.7- and ∼44.8-fold for SIRT1-N-CC and SIRT1-N-CC-C relative to SIRT1-CC, respectively, against the H4(7–25)K16Ac substrate and similarly ∼4.6- and ∼26.7-fold, respectively, against the p53(372–389)K382Ac substrate. Interestingly, this degree of catalytic potentiation is ∼3-fold higher than that observed when varying the acetyl-lysine protein substrate (compare TABLE 1, TABLE 2). A comparison of the steady state parameters reveals that this increase on catalytic potentiation on the NAD+ substrate over the acetyl-lysine protein substrate is largely due to a 3–5-fold increase in the Km for NAD+ of the SIRT1-N-CC construct relative to SIRT1-N-CC-C. This observation suggests that the C-terminal segment of SIRT1 also contributes to NAD+ binding for catalytic potentiation. We note that in the absence of the SIRT1 C-terminal segment, relatively high Km values for NAD+ are obtained for SIRT1-CC and SIRT1-N-CC (489–888 μm) so that 2 mm NAD+ is at a subsaturating concentration for these protein constructs. This suggests that the apparent kcat values obtained for these protein constructs at 2 mm NAD+ (Table 1) are marginally smaller than the actual values (because the enzymes only have 70–80% of their maximal activity), and therefore the reported potentiation by the C-terminal segment reported in Table 1 is a slight overestimate. Taking the data together, the extended N- and C-terminal segments of SIRT1 both contribute to potentiating the catalytic efficiency of the SIRT1 catalytic domain. The N- and C-terminal segments contribute to an elevation in kcat, with the N-terminal segment playing a significant role. In contrast, the C-terminal segment of SIRT1 plays an additional role in lowing the Km for NAD+. Several sirtuin inhibitors have been described in the literature (reviewed in Ref. 19Cen Y.

Sema-2a and Sema-2b proteins are distributed in gradients opposing the Sema-1a protein gradient, and Sema-1a binds to Sema-2a-expressing cells. In Sema-2a and Sema-2b double mutants, PN dendrites that normally target dorsolaterally in the antennal lobe mistarget ventromedially, phenocopying cell-autonomous Sema-1a removal from these PNs. Cell ablation, cell-specific knockdown, and rescue experiments indicate that secreted semaphorins from degenerating larval ORN axons direct dendrite targeting. Thus, a degenerating brain structure instructs the wiring of a developing circuit through the repulsive action of secreted semaphorins."

https://openalex.org/W2036402697,"Methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36) is catalyzed by the Set2 methyltransferase and is linked to transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have shown that trimethylation of H3K36 by Set2 is directed through its association with the phosphorylated repeats of the RNA polymerase C-terminal domain (RNAPII CTD). Here, we show that disruption of this interaction through the use of yeast mutants defective in CTD phosphorylation at serine 2 results in a destabilization of Set2 protein levels and H3K36 methylation. Consistent with this, we find that Set2 has a short half-life and is co-regulated, with RNAPII CTD phosphorylation levels, during logarithmic growth in yeast. To probe the functional consequence of uncoupling Set2-RNAPII regulation, we expressed a truncated and more stable form of Set2 that is capable of dimethylation but not trimethylation in vivo. Results of high throughput synthetic genetic analyses show that this Set2 variant has distinct genetics from either SET2 or set2Δ and is synthetically sick or lethal with a number of transcription elongation mutants. Collectively, these results provide molecular insight into the regulation of Set2 protein levels that influence H3K36 methylation states."
https://openalex.org/W2157927241,"Intermediate filaments serve important structural roles, but other cellular functions are increasingly recognized. This study demonstrated normal function of the low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein (NFL) in mitochondrial dynamics and disruption in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) due to mutations in the Nefl gene. In motor neurons of spinal cord cultured from Nefl-knockout mice, mitochondrial length and the rate of fusion were decreased concomitant with increased motility. These parameters were normalized after expression of NFL(wt) on the Nefl(-/-) background, but not by overexpression of the profusion protein, mitofusin 2 (MFN2). The effects of CMT-causing NFL mutants bore similarities to and differences from Nefl knockout. In the early phase of toxicity before disruption of the neurofilament network, NFL(Q333P) and NFL(P8R) integrated into neurofilaments and had effects on mitochondria similar to those with Nefl knockout. The reduction of fusion rate by NFL(Q333P) was partly due to interference with the function of the profusion protein MFN2, which is mutated in CMT2A, functionally linking these forms of CMT. In the later phase of toxicity, mitochondria essentially stopped moving in neurons expressing NFL mutants, probably a consequence of cytoskeletal disruption. Overall, the data point to important functions of neurofilaments in mitochondrial dynamics as well as primary involvement in CMT2E/1F."
https://openalex.org/W1969855892,"We provide evidence for a prodegenerative, glial-derived signaling framework in the Drosophila neuromuscular system that includes caspase and mitochondria-dependent signaling. We demonstrate that Drosophila TNF-α (eiger) is expressed in a subset of peripheral glia, and the TNF-α receptor (TNFR), Wengen, is expressed in motoneurons. NMJ degeneration caused by disruption of the spectrin/ankyrin skeleton is suppressed by an eiger mutation or by eiger knockdown within a subset of peripheral glia. Loss of wengen in motoneurons causes a similar suppression providing evidence for glial-derived prodegenerative TNF-α signaling. Neither JNK nor NFκβ is required for prodegenerative signaling. However, we provide evidence for the involvement of both an initiator and effector caspase, Dronc and Dcp-1, and mitochondrial-dependent signaling. Mutations that deplete the axon and nerve terminal of mitochondria suppress degeneration as do mutations in Drosophila Bcl-2 (debcl), a mitochondria-associated protein, and Apaf-1 (dark), which links mitochondrial signaling with caspase activity in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1972577951,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation represents a major form of post-translational modification that is conserved across most eukaryotic species. This type of glycosylation is initiated by a family of enzymes (GalNAc-Ts in mammals and PGANTs in Drosophila) whose members are expressed in distinct spatial and temporal patterns during development. Previous work from our group demonstrated that one member of this family is essential for viability and another member modulates extracellular matrix composition and integrin-mediated cell adhesion during development. To investigate whether other members of this family are essential, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to each gene in vivo. Using this approach, we identified 4 additional pgant genes that are required for viability. Ubiquitous RNAi to pgant4, pgant5, pgant7, or the putative glycosyltransferase CG30463 resulted in lethality. Tissue-specific RNAi was also used to define the specific organ systems and tissues in which each essential family member is required. Interestingly, each essential pgant had a unique complement of tissues in which it was required. Additionally, certain tissues (mesoderm, digestive system, and tracheal system) required more than one pgant, suggesting unique functions for specific enzymes in these tissues. Expanding upon our RNAi results, we found that conventional mutations in pgant5 resulted in lethality and specific defects in specialized cells of the digestive tract, resulting in loss of proper digestive system acidification. In summary, our results highlight essential roles for O-glycosylation and specific members of the pgant family in many aspects of development and organogenesis."

We have engineered P. furiosus to overproduce SHI utilizing a recently developed genetic system. In the overexpression (OE-SHI) strain, transcription of the four-gene SHI operon was under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and a Strep-tag II was added to the N terminus of one subunit.

Overexpressed SHI was purified by a single affinity chromatography step using the Strep-tag II, and it and the native form had comparable activities and physical properties.

Their physiological roles in microorganisms include the reduction of protons to evolve H2 to remove excess reductant generated by oxidative metabolism or, in the reverse reaction, the oxidation of H2 and its use as a source of reductant and energy. Structural and biochemical analyses have revealed that most hydrogenases contain either nickel and iron or only iron at their catalytic sites, and these are referred to as the [NiFe] and [FeFe] enzymes, respectively (4Fontecilla-Camps J.C.

With the increasing demand for energy and limiting supply of fossil fuels, carbon-neutral renewable energy sources are receiving increased attention. Biological H2 production is a potentially viable alternative to establish a renewable and low carbon-emitting hydrogen economy (12Cammack R. Frey M. Robson R. Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature. Taylor & Francis, London2001: 201-230Google Scholar, 13Gupta R.B. Hydrogen Fuel: Production, Transport, and Storage. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2009: 1-31Google Scholar). One impetus for this is the replacement of expensive palladium- and platinum-based catalysts used in the current chemical generation of hydrogen gas (14Lee H.S. Vermaas W.F. Rittmann B.E. Biological hydrogen production: prospects and challenges.Trends. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 262-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Hence, any future cost-efficient hydrogen production method is likely to have biological or bio-inspired components (15Krassen H. Schwarze A. Friedrich B. Ataka K. Lenz O. Heberle J. Photosynthetic hydrogen production by a hybrid complex of photosystem I and [NiFe]-hydrogenase.ACS Nano. 2009; 3: 4055-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Efforts to overproduce hydrogenases in various heterologous systems to decipher their structural and biochemical properties have met with limited success (16English C.M. Eckert C. Brown K. Seibert M. King P.W. Recombinant and in vitro expression systems for hydrogenases: new frontiers in basic and applied studies for biological and synthetic H2 production.Dalton Trans. 2009; : 9970-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A major limitation is the complex oxygen-sensitive post-translational processing pathway that is required to give a functional [NiFe] catalytic subunit (17Blokesch M. Böck A. Maturation of [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Escherichia coli: the HypC cycle.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Blokesch M. Albracht S.P. Matzanke B.F. Drapal N.M.

Physiol. 2006; 51: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For example, assembly of the Hyd3 hydrogenase of E. coli, a membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase, requires the participation of at least eight processing proteins (17Blokesch M. Böck A. Maturation of [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Escherichia coli: the HypC cycle.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, the majority of successful heterologous recombinant expression systems for hydrogenase have been achieved in closely related hosts. For example, the hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas was heterologously expressed in Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (20Rousset M. Magro V. Forget N. Guigliarelli B. Belaich J.P. Hatchikian E.C.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4982-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a functional, NAD-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenase from the Gram-positive organism, Rhodococcus opacus, was produced in the Gram-negative organism, Ralstonia eutropha (21Porthun A. Bernhard M. Friedrich B. Expression of a functional NAD-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase from the Gram-positive Rhodococcus opacus in the Gram-negative Ralstonia eutropha.Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound hydrogenase of R. eutropha was produced in Pseudomonas stutzeri using a broad host range plasmid containing all the accessory genes required for maturation of the [NiFe] active site (22Lenz O. Gleiche A. Strack A. Friedrich B. Requirements for heterologous production of a complex metalloenzyme: the membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6590-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The one example of heterologous production of a [NiFe]-hydrogenase in a distantly related organism was the production of the cytoplasmic hydrogenase I (SHI) 4The abbreviations used are: SHIsoluble hydrogenase IOE-SHIengineered strain of P. furiosusMVmethyl viologenqPCRquantitative PCREPPS4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. from the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. furiosus, which grows at 100 °C, in the mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli (23Sun J.

Heterologous expression and maturation of an NADP-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenase: a key enzyme in biofuel production.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, assembly and maturation of P. furiosus SHI was accomplished by the processing proteins of E. coli, with the exception of the proteolytic C-terminal cleavage to give the functional catalytic subunit, which required the P. furiosus protease (FrxA) specific for SHI. soluble hydrogenase I engineered strain of P. furiosus methyl viologen quantitative PCR 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. Unfortunately, however, none of the heterologous systems for hydrogenase have achieved significant overproduction of the enzyme relative to the amount produced in the native host organism (16English C.M. Eckert C. Brown K. Seibert M. King P.W.

Heterologous expression and maturation of an NADP-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenase: a key enzyme in biofuel production.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An alternative approach is to homologously overproduce hydrogenase, but this obviously requires a genetic system for the host organism. To date, the only successful homologous overexpression of a [NiFe]-hydrogenase was reported with the enzyme from the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (24Germer F. Zebger I. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Schulz R. Appel J. Overexpression, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of the bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36462-36472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This enzyme consists of five different subunits and utilizes NAD(P) as an electron carrier. To overexpress the hydrogenase operon and incorporate an affinity Strep-tag II, expression was controlled by a light-induced promoter psbAII. Simultaneously, five hyp accessory genes from the closely related organism Nostoc sp PCC7120 were expressed using the same promoter (24Germer F. Zebger I. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Schulz R. Appel J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 36462-36472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This resulted in increased expression of the hydrogenase operon by 5-fold, but simultaneous overexpression of the maturation genes was necessary to process the increased amounts of the enzyme, resulting in a 2–3-fold increase in the amount of active hydrogenase. The goal of the current study was to develop a homologous expression system for P. furiosus SHI. This is a heterotetrameric enzyme that contains flavin and six iron-sulfur clusters, in addition to the [NiFe] catalytic site, and utilizes NADP(H) as an electron carrier (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B.

A diagrammatic representation of the enzyme is shown in Fig. 1, which is based on sequence analyses of the four subunits and the measured cofactor content of the purified enzyme. SHI has been shown to be very efficient in in vitro systems to produce H2 from starch and cellulose in synthetic enzyme pathways (26Zhang Y.H. Evans B.R. Mielenz J.R. Hopkins R.C. Adams M.W. High yield hydrogen production from starch and water by a synthetic enzymatic pathway.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e456Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These approaches are limited, however, as they utilize SHI purified from P. furiosus biomass. Our goal is, therefore, to take advantage of the genetic system recently reported with P. furiosus (27Lipscomb G.L. Stirrett K. Schut G.J. Yang F. Jenney Jr., F.E. Scott R.A. Adams M.W.

Herein we describe the development of a one-step marked knock-in method using linear DNA fragments to construct a strain that overproduces SHI by at least an order of magnitude more than the wild-type strain. The recombinant hydrogenase has a Strep-tag II affinity tag to facilitate purification and has properties that are comparable, although not identical, with those of SHI purified from wild-type P. furiosus (25Bryant F.O. Adams M.W. Characterization of hydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5070-5079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although an order of magnitude of more fully processed SHI was produced in the recombinant strain, expression of the maturation genes was at the same level as in the parent strain. The strains used in this work are shown in Table 1. Cells were grown in defined medium for all the genetic manipulation work (27Lipscomb G.L. Stirrett K. Schut G.J. Yang F. Jenney Jr., F.E.

PCR products were purified using a commercial extraction protocol (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and were used in overlapping PCR reactions using the Pfx supermix (Invitrogen). Final overlapping PCR products were gel-purified and used for COM1 (the parent strain of P. furiosus) transformation as described previously (27Lipscomb G.L. Stirrett K. Schut G.J. Yang F.

Transformations were carried out using freshly grown COM1 strain (uracil auxotroph), a competent strain of P. furiosus (27Lipscomb G.L. Stirrett K. Schut G.J. Yang F. Jenney Jr., F.E. Scott R.A.

For transformation, 200 ng of DNA (knock-in cassette, supplemental Fig. S1A) was mixed with 100 μl of an overnight culture of COM1 cells and grown on defined medium. After incubation at 90 °C for 72 h, plates were examined for colonies on defined medium plates for gain of the pyrF marker as transformed cells are able to grow without uracil. Three colonies were picked from defined medium plates and grown overnight in 5 ml of defined medium, and 1.5-ml samples were used to isolate genomic DNA. PCR was used to confirm the correct insertion using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1, which were designed to bind outside of the homologous flanking regions and amplified using the Prime Star HS polymerase mix (Clontech). PCR-positive colonies were further purified by three separate consecutive transfers in the defined medium lacking uracil to confirm the culture phenotype. PCR screening was done after each round to ensure that proper incorporation of the knock-in cassette was maintained. The PCR product amplified from genomic DNA of one positive clone was confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen Sequencing Facility, Rockville, MD). Total RNA was extracted from 10 ml of mid-log phase cultures grown in rich maltose medium using the Absolute RNA prep kit (Stratagene) and quantified by Thermo Scientific NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Before quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses, the RNA was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion; Applied Biosystems, Bedford, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C and further purified using the DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion; Applied Biosystems, Bedford, CA). cDNA was prepared using the Affinity Script qPCR cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were carried out with an Mx3000P instrument (Stratagene) with the Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Agilent Technologies). The genes encoding the housekeeping enzymes pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (γ subunit, PF0971) and DNA polymerase sliding clamp (PF0983) were used as internal controls to normalize the amounts of cDNA that were used for qPCR (supplemental Fig. S2). Growth of and H2 production by the OE-SHI (for overexpressed SHI) strain were carried out in 250-ml cultures at 90 °C in sealed bottles. At various times, the medium was sampled (1 ml) for protein estimation by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar), and the headspace was analyzed for H2 by transferring samples (1 ml) into 10-ml vials containing 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. After equilibration for 16 h to remove any residual H2S (which poisons the chromatography column), H2 was estimated by using a 6850 network gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) (23Sun J.

Samples of the media were also removed throughout the growth phase, and the concentration of maltose was determined. OE-SHI was purified under strictly reducing and anaerobic conditions. Frozen cells (25 g) were thawed and lysed osmotically in 75 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCL, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm sodium dithionite) and 50 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) with stirring for 1 h at 23 °C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract (S100), 40 ml, 11.7 mg of protein/ml) was obtained after removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Avidin (1.0 mg, Sigma) was added to the S100, and it was directly loaded using an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) onto three 5-ml StrepTactin Sepharose high performance/StrepTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) joined in series. The columns were pre-equilibrated and washed, and OE-SHI was eluted using the binding and elution buffers described in the manufacturer's protocol, except that all buffers contained 2 mm sodium dithionite. In addition, to optimize the overall recovery, the flow-through was reloaded onto the columns prior to washing and elution. Maltose concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using an assay kit (BioVision). Samples (50 μl) of the medium were diluted 500-fold with distilled water prior to analysis. To measure protein stability using fluorescence spectroscopy, the hydrogenase (0.1 mg/ml in 100 mm EPPS, pH 8.4) was incubated at 90 °C. Samples (50 μl) were periodically removed, and the tryptophan emission spectra were recorded using an RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). The excitation wavelength was 280 nm using a bandwidth of 5 nm. Hydrogenase activity was routinely measured by H2 production from methyl viologen (MV, 1 mm) reduced by sodium dithionite (10 mm) at 80 °C in 100 mm EPPS buffer, pH 8.4, using gas chromatography (23Sun J.

Although Imps/Exps are overexpressed in a number of transformed cell lines and patient tumor tissues, the efficiency of nucleocytoplasmic transport in transformed cell types compared with nontransformed cells has not been investigated. Here we use quantitative live cell imaging of 3 isogenic nontransformed/transformed cell pairs to show that nuclear accumulation of nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins, but not their NLS-mutated derivatives, is increased up to 7-fold in MCF10CA1h human epithelial breast carcinoma cells and in simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed fibroblasts of human and monkey origin, compared with their nontransformed counterparts. The basis for this appears to be a significantly faster rate of nuclear import in transformed cell types, as revealed by analysis using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching for the human MCF10A/ MCF10CA1h cell pair. Nuclear accumulation of NLS/ nuclear export signal-containing (shuttling) proteins was also enhanced in transformed cell types, experiments using the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B demonstrating that efficient Exp-1-mediated nuclear export was not impaired in transformed compared with nontransformed cells. Enhanced nuclear import and export efficiencies were found to correlate with 2- to 4-fold higher expression of specific Imps/Exps in transformed cells, as indicated by quantitative Western blot analysis, with ectopic expression of Imps able to enhance NLS nuclear accumulation levels up to 5-fold in nontransformed MCF10A cells. The findings indicate that transformed cells possess altered nuclear transport properties, most likely due to the overexpression of Imps/Exps. The findings have important implications for the development of tumor-specific drug nanocarriers in anticancer therapy.— Kuusisto, H. V., Wagstaff, K. M., Alvisi, G., Roth, D. M., Jans, D. A.

We recently reported the aggregation of proteins in a yajL mutant in an oxidative stress-dependent manner and that YajL exhibits chaperone activity. Here, we show that YajL displays covalent chaperone and weak protein oxidoreductase activities that are dependent on its exposed cysteine 106. It catalyzes reduced RNase oxidation and scrambled RNase isomerization and insulin reduction and forms mixed disulfides with many cellular proteins upon oxidative stress. The formation of mixed disulfides was detected by immunoblotting bacterial extracts with anti-YajL antibodies under nonreducing conditions. Disulfides were purified from bacterial extracts on a YajL affinity column, separated by nonreducing-reducing SDS-PAGE, and identified by mass spectrometry. Covalent YajL substrates included ribosomal proteins, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, chaperones, catalases, peroxidases, and other proteins containing cysteines essential for catalysis or FeS cluster binding, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, aconitase, and FeS cluster-containing subunits of respiratory chains. In addition, we show that DJ-1 also forms mixed disulfides with cytoplasmic proteins upon oxidative stress. These results shed light on the oxidative stress-dependent chaperone function of YajL and identify YajL substrates involved in translation, stress protection, protein solubilization, and metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2025949390,"Mimivirus is one the largest DNA virus identified so far, infecting several Acanthamoeba species. Analysis of its genome revealed the presence of a nine-gene cluster containing genes potentially involved in glycan formation. All of these genes are co-expressed at late stages of infection, suggesting their role in the formation of the long fibers covering the viral surface. Among them, we identified the L136 gene as a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent sugar aminotransferase. This enzyme was shown to catalyze the formation of UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose (UDP-viosamine) from UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose, a key compound involved also in the biosynthesis of L-rhamnose. This finding further supports the hypothesis that Mimivirus encodes a glycosylation system that is completely independent of the amoebal host. Viosamine, together with rhamnose, (N-acetyl)glucosamine, and glucose, was found as a major component of the viral glycans. Most of the sugars were associated with the fibers, confirming a capsular-like nature of the viral surface. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that L136 was not a recent acquisition from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer, but it was acquired very early during evolution. Implications for the origin of the glycosylation machinery in giant DNA virus are also discussed."

Doxorubicin (DOX) remains the cornerstone of chemotherapy in such individuals. However, it is often associated with cardiac failure, which once manifests carries a poor prognosis. Because BRCA2 regulates genome-wide stability and facilitates DNA damage repair, we hypothesized that loss of BRCA2 may increase susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiac failure. To this aim, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 knock-out (CM-BRCA2−/−) mice using the Cre-loxP technology and evaluated their basal and post-DOX treatment phenotypes. Although CM-BRCA2−/− mice exhibited no basal cardiac phenotype, DOX treatment resulted in markedly greater cardiac dysfunction and mortality in CM-BRCA2−/− mice compared with control mice. Apoptosis in left ventricular (LV) sections from CM-BRCA2−/− mice compared with that in corresponding sections from wild-type (WT) littermate controls was also significantly enhanced after DOX treatment. Microscopic examination of LV sections from DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice revealed a greater number of DNA double-stranded breaks and the absence of RAD51 focus formation, an essential marker of double-stranded break repair. The levels of p53 and the p53-related proapoptotic proteins p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bax were significantly increased in samples from CM-BRCA2−/− mice. This corresponded with increased Bax to Bcl-2 ratios and elevated cytochrome c release in the LV sections of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice.

Loss of BRCA2 culminates in defective repair of DNA damage and deranged genome integrity, which when prolonged can lead to accumulation of a lethal amount of damaged DNA and spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities, which can ultimately result in cancer or apoptosis (5.Connor F.

However, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which results in refractory cardiac dysfunction, has compromised the clinical utilization of DOX (7.Lefrak E.A. Pitha J. Rosenheim S. Gottlieb J.A.

DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is often fatal, and no specific treatments are available for this condition. It is unknown whether a pharmacogenomic basis for DOX-induced cardiac failure exists. Several mechanisms have been suggested to link DOX treatment to cardiac failure, including cardiomyocyte apoptosis secondary to DOX-induced DNA damage, the generation of DSBs via DNA interstrand cross-linking, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, and the activation of the tumor suppressor p53 (8.Yoshida M.

BRCA2 has been previously implicated in the repair of chemotherapy-induced DSBs through homologous recombination (11.Tutt A. Bertwistle D. Valentine J. Gabriel A. Swift S. Ross G. Griffin C.

Mutation in Brca2 stimulates error-prone homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks occurring between repeated sequences.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4704-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This coupled with the recognized role of BRCA2 in promoting the repair of DNA damage led us to hypothesize that BRCA2 is a guardian of the cardiomyocyte genome following DOX-induced acute DNA damage and that loss of BRCA2 may enhance susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiac failure. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 knock-out (CM-BRCA2−/−) mice. Cardiac function at base line and following DOX treatment was examined. We found that DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction was exacerbated in CM-BRCA2−/− mice, and this was accompanied by greater DNA damage and reduced repair of DNA damage, leading to p53-mediated cardiomyocyte death. BRCA2 may hence serve as a pharmacogenomic clue to identify individuals at greater risk of DOX-induced cardiac failure. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the St. Michael's Hospital Animal Care Committee. Cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 knock-out mice were generated using the Cre-loxP technology on a mixed background. Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1A, mice homozygous for the exon 11 floxed BRCA2 allele (BRCA2fl/fl; National Cancer Institute, Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium, Mouse Repository; strain, 01XB9; strain name, BRCA2tm1brn) (12.Jonkers J.

Mice that expressed αMHC-Cre only (αMHC-Cretg/;BRCA2+/+) displayed similar characteristics as BRCA2fl/fl, BRCA2fl/+, and BRCA2+/+ mice at base line and after DOX treatment. Hence, they were considered part of the WT littermate control group. Mice were genotyped using routine PCR methods as detailed in Fig. 1, B and C, with the primers described in Table 1. Total RNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) were extracted from cardiomyocytes isolated from the hearts of 10–12-week-old mice using the non-reperfusion cardiomyocyte isolation kit from Cellutron Life Technologies, Baltimore, MD. PCR performed on cDNA derived from total RNA and on gDNA using BRCA2 exon 11-specific primers (Table 1) produced the expected PCR product in samples from WT mice but not in cardiomyocytes isolated from CM-BRCA2−/− mice (see Fig. 1, D and E). BRCA2 deletion was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblots performed with LV lysates and immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on LV sections from 10–12-week-old CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls. Immunoblots and IHC analysis both showed reduced BRCA2 levels in the hearts of CM-BRCA2−/− mice (see Fig. 1, F and G).TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for genotyping PCRs and BRCA2 exon 11-specific PCRsPrimer nameSequencePrimer pairProduct sizeGenotyping PCRB0125′-GGCTGTCTTAGAACTTAGGCTG-3′B012/B013376 bp, 5′ LoxB0135′-CTCCACACATACATCATGTGTC-3′298 bp, WTB0145′-CTCATCATTTGTTGCCTCACTTC-3′B014/B015529 bp, 3′ LoxB0155′-TGTTGGATACAAGGCATGTACAC-3′450 bp, WTExon 11-specific and p21 real time PCRBRCA2-Ex11F5′-CCCATCCTTCACGCACTTAT-3′BRCA2-Ex11F/R296 bp, WTBRCA2-Ex11 R5′-TGTGACCAGTTTTCCACCTG-3′p21-F5′-CGGTGTCAGAGTCTAGGGGA-3′p21-F/R94 bpp21-R5′-ATCACCAGGATTGGACATGG-3′GAPDH-F5′-TGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′GAPDH-F/R177 bpGAPDH-R5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGCC-3′ Open table in a new tab A single intraperitoneal dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg DOX (Sigma-Aldrich) or its diluent (water) was administered to 10–12-week-old CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls. Double blinded echocardiography was performed before (base line) and 7 days post-DOX (10 mg/kg) treatment under light sedation (1–1.5% isoflurane) using an HDI 5000cv echocardiographic system (Philips Ultrasound) equipped with a compact 15-MHz broadband linear transducer (CL15-7). Two-dimensional imaging was performed in the parasternal long and short axis views. An M-mode cursor was positioned perpendicular to the interventricular septum and posterior wall of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles. M-mode images were obtained for measurements of chamber dimensions throughout the cardiac cycle. LV end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and LV end systolic dimension (LVESD) were measured. During diastole, LV dimension and wall thickness were measured from the maximum chamber cavity, and during systole, they were measured during maximum anterior motion of the posterior wall. Images were stored on the hard drive for off-line analysis. Fractional shortening was defined as (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD. LV ejection fraction was defined as ((LVEDD3 − LVESD3)/LVEDD3) × 100. In all cases, the measurements were averaged from readings of three representative cardiac cycles. Histological studies were performed on LV samples that were fixed in situ, extirpated, and stored in 3.7% paraformaldehyde or on hearts and livers that were frozen in optimal cutting temperature and cryosectioned (5 μm). For gross histological examination, sections (5–8 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the cross-sectional areas of septal cardiomyocytes were determined in ∼150 transversely cut cardiomyocytes with NIH ImageJ software. Sections were examined for TUNEL staining and other proteins via routine immunohistochemical methods using antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (BRCA2, sc-28235), Cell Signaling Technology (total caspase-3, 9662; p53, 2524; cytochrome c, 4272), and Millipore (γH2A.X, 05-636; RAD51, AB3756). Semiquantitative analysis was performed with ImageJ software to determine the extent of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining in each section. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with the Quantitect reverse transcription kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada). Real time PCR were carried out with SYBR Green Master Mix on the PRISM 7900HT system (both from Applied Biosystems) using p21-specific and GAPDH primers (Table 1). Total protein extracted with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was quantified with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent. Protein samples (30–50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (BRCA2, sc-28235), Cell Signaling Technology (p53, 2524; p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), 4976; Bax, 2772), Millipore (Bcl-2, AB1722; GADD45α, ab3863; GAPDH, MAB374), and Abcam (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ab78; phospho (p) ATM, 6810; Chk2, ab47433; pChk2, ab3508; p21, ab7960). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-associated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare) and quantified by densitometry. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences between multiple means were evaluated by Student's t test or analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni corrections. To elucidate the involvement of BRCA2 in cardiac function and survival and to circumvent the embryonic lethality associated with systemic loss of BRCA2 (14.Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L. Mak T.W. Developmental studies of Brca1 and Brca2 knock-out mice.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we utilized the Cre-loxP system to specifically disrupt BRCA2 in the cardiomyocytes of mice. Conditional inactivation of BRCA2 was achieved by crossing mice homozygous for the exon 11 floxed BRCA2 allele (BRCA2fl/fl) with hemizygous mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC-Cretg/) promoter (Fig. 1A) (13.Agah R.

Inducible gene targeting in mice using the Cre/lox system.Methods. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Mice of the αMHC-Cretg/;BRCA2fl/fl background are denoted as cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 homozygous knock-out (CM-BRCA2−/−) mice. Mice, regardless of their genotypes, were viable, fertile, and born in the expected Mendelian ratios (data not shown). We verified the successful deletion of BRCA2 in the cardiomyocytes of CM-BRCA2−/− mice at both the genomic and transcript levels. The expected PCR products for BRCA2 were obtained in samples from WT mice but not in those from the exon 11-deleted CM-BRCA2−/− mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Successful BRCA2 deletion was further confirmed at the protein level via BRCA2 immunoblotting with LV lysates and also through BRCA2 IHC examination of LV sections from 10–12-week-old CM-BRCA2−/− and WT mice (Fig. 1, F and G). Histomorphometric assessment was performed on in situ fixed and H&E-stained hearts. Similar base-line cardiac morphologies and structures were found in CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls (Fig. 2, A–C). There were no differences in the LV inner (2.4 ± 0.4 versus 2.5 ± 0.9 mm, WT versus CM-BRCA2−/− mice, p not significant) and outer (4.4 ± 0.8 versus 4.4 ± 0.7 mm, WT versus CM-BRCA2−/− mice, p not significant) diameters, septal wall thickness (1.05 ± 0.12 versus 0.97 ± 0.24 mm, WT versus CM-BRCA2−/− mice, p not significant), and average cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas between the groups (Fig. 2, A–C). Echocardiographic measurements demonstrated indistinguishable cardiac function between CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls (Fig. 2, D and E), which included mice with the BRCA2+/+, BRCA2fl/+, BRCA2fl/fl, and αMHC-Cretg/;BRCA2+/+ genotypes. Although high levels of Cre recombinase in the heart have been associated with cardiomyopathy in aged mice, this pathology is evident only in mice that express Cre recombinase at levels 50–100 times greater than that in TG9, an αMHC-Cre transgenic strain that does not develop congestive heart failure (16.Buerger A. Rozhitskaya O. Sherwood M.C. Dorfman A.L. Bisping E. Abel E.D. Pu W.T. Izumo S. Jay P.Y. Dilated cardiomyopathy resulting from high-level myocardial expression of Cre-recombinase.J. Card. Fail. 2006; 12: 392-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, to exclude the possible involvement of Cre-mediated cardiomyopathy in our model, parallel studies were conducted on littermates expressing Cre only (αMHC-Cretg/;BRCA2+/+). Because no base-line and post-DOX differences were detected between these mice and the other WT littermate controls, the former were included as part of the WT control apoptosis group as evaluation by caspase-3 and TUNEL staining of LV sections showed similar results across the groups (Fig. 2F). The extent of DSBs and DNA damage repair as measured by γH2AX and RAD51 immunostaining, respectively (Fig. 2F), along with p53 and ATM protein levels as measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, G and H) did not reveal any base-line differences in the hearts between the CM-BRCA2−/− and the WT littermate controls. Hence, in the absence of stress, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of BRCA2 resulted in no grossly apparent base-line cardiac phenotype. Although DOX is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that is used for a wide variety of malignancies, its clinical utility has been limited by its dose-dependent cardiotoxic effects that result in congestive heart failure (17.Henderson I.C. Frei 3rd, E. Testing for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 300: 1393-1394PubMed Google Scholar). DOX is a known inducer of DNA damage in cardiomyocytes and is also associated with both p53 accumulation and apoptotic cell death (8.Yoshida M. Shiojima I. Ikeda H. Komuro I. Chronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is mediated by oxidative DNA damage-ATM-p53-apoptosis pathway and attenuated by pitavastatin through the inhibition of Rac1 activity.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To gather insight on the role of BRCA2 in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, 20 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) DOX, a dose applied by other groups (18.Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Yu A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N.

Investig. 1996; 98: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), was administered to 10–12-week-old CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls (n = 12/group). This dose of DOX significantly increased mortality in CM-BRCA2−/− mice (seven of 12 within the first 7 days; p < 0.05 versus WT) relative to that of the WT control group (two of 12 within the first 7 days). Our subsequent investigations were performed on animals administered a single dose of 10 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) DOX. Echocardiographic examinations performed 7-days post-treatment revealed that 10 mg/kg DOX produced strikingly greater cardiac dysfunction (as per reduced ejection fraction and fractional shortening values) in CM-BRCA2−/− mice compared with their WT littermate controls (Fig. 3, A and B). DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction in CM-BRCA2−/− mice was further linked with significantly greater weight loss relative to that observed in WT littermate controls (Fig. 3C). DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction was exacerbated in CM-BRCA2−/− mice, and this was associated with significantly greater percentages of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the LV sections (Fig. 3D) examined. In consideration of the possibility of DOX interference with DNA and the specificity of the TUNEL assay, microscopic assessments were conducted and indicated typical nuclear and cellular morphological features of apoptosis that correlated well with TUNEL positivity (Fig. 3D). These data were further corroborated through evaluations of caspase-3 activity via immunostaining. Caspase-3 activity in the LV sections of CM-BRCA2−/− mice was significantly increased after DOX treatment relative to that in samples from the WT littermate controls (Fig. 3E). The enhanced apoptosis observed was confined to the cardiomyocytes (see supplemental Fig. 1 indicating similar extents of DOX-induced hepatic apoptosis across the groups). The increased susceptibility of CM-BRCA2−/− mice to DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and apoptosis correlated with elevated levels of DNA damage in the LV sections of these mice relative to that in corresponding sections from the WT littermate controls (Fig. 3, F and G). Because γH2AX focus formation is the first cellular response to DNA lesions (21.Dickey J.S. Baird B.J. Redon C.E. Sokolov M.V. Sedelnikova O.A. Bonner W.M. Intercellular communication of cellular stress monitored by γ-H2AX induction.Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1686-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the extent of DNA damage in the left ventricles of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− and WT mice were evaluated by measuring γH2AX levels via immunoblotting and IHC methodologies. Immunoblots performed with LV lysates revealed increased γH2AX levels in samples from CM-BRCA2−/− mice (Fig. 3F). IHC examinations also showed more extensive γH2AX staining in the LV sections of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice, indicating exaggerated DNA lesions compared with that seen in corresponding sections from the WT littermate control group (Fig. 3G). DNA damage causes BRCA2 to translocate RAD51 into the nucleus, and BRCA2/RAD51 focus formation is essential for prompting the repair of damaged DNA (22.Yuan S.S. Lee S.Y. Chen G. Song M. Tomlinson G.E. Lee E.Y. BRCA2 is required for ionizing radiation-induced assembly of Rad51 complex in vivo.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3547-3551PubMed Google Scholar). Through routine IHC methods, we observed greater RAD51 focus formation in the LV sections of DOX-treated WT littermate controls relative to those from DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice. This is indicative of defective repair of DNA damage, thereby resulting in the accumulation of damaged DNA in the hearts of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice (Fig. 3H). IHC for γH2AX and RAD51 performed on the liver sections of CM-BRCA2−/− mice and their WT littermate controls showed similar degrees of DNA lesions and DNA repair, again confirming the cardiomyocyte-specific phenotype of our model (supplemental Fig. 1). Up-regulation of p53 itself is sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte death (23.Long X. Boluyt M.O. Hipolito M.L. Lundberg M.S. Zheng J.S. O'Neill L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. p53 and the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the embryonic lethality originally described in systemic BRCA2 knock-outs may be modulated by loss of p53 (24.Ludwig T. Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Efstratiadis A. Targeted mutations of breast cancer susceptibility gene homologs in mice: lethal phenotypes of Brca1, Brca2, Brca1/Brca2, Brca1/p53, and Brca2/p53 nullizygous embryos.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1226-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It is also plausible that unrepaired chromosome breaks trigger p53 activation. Thus, we sought to determine whether the increased apoptosis and DSBs we observed in the hearts of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice are associated with elevated p53 expression. We found greater total p53 staining in LV sections (Fig. 4A) and higher levels of total p53 in LV lysates from DOX-treated CM-BRCA2−/− mice in comparison with those from the WT littermate group (Fig. 4B). A major molecular property of p53 is that of a transcription factor that activates downstream targets like PUMA and Bax. To determine whether increases in p53 protein levels following DOX treatment result in the induction of p53 proapoptotic targets in CM-BRCA2−/− mice, we performed immunoblotting assays. These revealed elevated levels of PUMA and Bax in the left ventricles of CM-BRCA2−/− mice relative to those obtained from the WT littermate controls (Fig. 4, C and D). The critical factor in the p53-dependent survival and/or apoptotic signaling pathway is the shift in the ratio of the level of proapoptotic Bax to that of the prosurvival molecule Bcl-2 (25.Basu A. Haldar S. The relationship between BcI2, Bax and p53: consequences for cell cycle progression and cell death.Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are recognized as fundamental regulators of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and/or survival decisions during heart failure (26.Hochhauser E.

The DOX-mediated increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in CM-BRCA2−/− mice was associated with a decrease in prosurvival Bcl-2 levels and an increase in proapoptotic Bax protein, which led to a ∼5-fold increase in the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio, shifting the balance from a survival to an apoptosis mode (Fig. 4D). Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol is a downstream event that allows evaluation of apoptotic cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2015292055,"Nel (neural epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like molecule) is a multimeric, multimodular extracellular glycoprotein with heparin-binding activity and structural similarities to thrombospondin-1. Nel is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and has been implicated in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, retinal axon guidance, synaptic functions, and spatial learning. The Nel protein contains an N-terminal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-N) domain, five cysteine-rich domains, and six EGF-like domains. However, little is known about the functions of specific domains of the Nel protein. In this study, we have performed structure-function analysis of Nel, by using a series of expression constructs for different regions of the Nel protein. Our studies demonstrate that the TSP-N domain is responsible for homo-multimer formation of Nel and its heparin-binding activity. In vivo, Nel and related Nell1 are expressed in several regions of the mouse central nervous system with partly overlapping patterns. When they are expressed in the same cells in vitro, Nel and Nell1 can form hetero-multimers through the TSP-N domain, but they do not hetero-oligomerize with thrombospondin-1. Whereas both the TSP-N domain and cysteine-rich domains can bind to retinal axons in vivo, only the latter causes growth cone collapse in cultured retinal axons, suggesting that cysteine-rich domains interact with and activate an inhibitory axon guidance receptor. These results suggest that Nel interacts with a range of molecules through its different domains and exerts distinct functions."

RA controls the expression of genes involved in patterning and morphogenesis during organogenesis. Disruptions in the regulation of RA signaling results in several developmental disorders, including limb and skeletal defects, abnormal patterning of the central nervous system, ocular and craniofacial defects, cardiac malformation, foregut endoderm defects, and renal agenesis. Identification of pleiotropic functions for RA during organogenesis has provided a better understanding of cellular and molecular events controlling embryonic development. Loss-of-function studies using mutants of RA-synthesizing enzymes and RA receptors (RARs) have been particularly helpful in unraveling the mechanism of RA signaling. Further studies using genetic models are required to fully understand the molecular logic of RA signaling from embryogenesis to adulthood."

R-proteins are P-loop NTPase superfamily members, and current models describe their main function as ATPases in defense signaling pathways. Here we show that a subset of R-proteins have evolved a new function to combat pathogen infection. This subset of R-proteins possesses a nucleotide phosphatase activity in the nucleotide-binding domain. Related R-proteins that fall in the same phylogenetic clade all show the same nucleotide phosphatase activity indicating a conserved function within at least a subset of R-proteins. R-protein nucleotide phosphatases catalyze the production of nucleoside from nucleotide with the nucleotide monophosphate as the preferred substrate. Mutation of conserved catalytic residues substantially reduced activity consistent with the biochemistry of P-loop NTPases. Kinetic analysis, analytical gel filtration, and chemical cross-linking demonstrated that the nucleotide-binding domain was active as a multimer. Nuclear magnetic resonance and nucleotide analogues identified the terminal phosphate bond as the target of a reaction that utilized a metal-mediated nucleophilic attack by water on the phosphoester. In conclusion, we have identified a group of R-proteins with a unique function. This biochemical activity appears to have co-evolved with plants in signaling pathways designed to resist pathogen attack."

AZ expression is regulated by polyamines in a unique manner during translation of the AZ mRNA, which involves a programmed +1 frameshift, resulting in the expression of the functional full-length AZ protein (18Ivanov I.P.

They showed that ODC activity was increased in neuroblastoma cells by asparagine (Asn) and glutamine. Additional studies by the same group (32Rinehart Jr., C.A. Canellakis E.S.

Whereas induction of ODC activity was dependent on Na+, it was independent of metabolism or the ability of the amino acid to be incorporated into protein. However, other amino acids like lysine (Lys) and valine (Val) were unable to induce ODC in EBSS. Of particular interest was the finding, in a variety of cell types, that the induction of activity by hormones and growth factors required the presence of Asn or a similar amino acid (32Rinehart Jr., C.A. Canellakis E.S. Induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity by insulin and growth factors is mediated by amino acids.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Interaction of asparagine and EGF in the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in IEC-6 cells.Am. J. Physiol. G. 1999; 276: G773-G780PubMed Google Scholar), our laboratory reported that Asn but not EGF could stimulate ODC activity in intestinal epithelial cells incubated in EBSS. EGF elicited a potentiated response in the presence of Asn. Although induction of ODC activity did not involve the synthesis of new ODC protein, it did require both transcription and translation (35Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Patel T.B. Johnson L.R. Interaction of asparagine and EGF in the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in IEC-6 cells.Am. J. Physiol. G. 1999; 276: G773-G780PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that amino acids either induced or repressed a specific regulator of ODC enzyme activity. Recent studies have shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates the translation machinery by controlling the phosphorylation of both eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP1) and p70-S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K) via mTORC1 and mTORC2 (36Gingras A.C.

Gln has been shown to be essential for the metabolism of intestinal mucosa and for proliferation of colon cancer cells (38Nakajo T. Yamatsuji T. Ban H. Shigemitsu K. Haisa M. Motoki T. Noma K.

Commun. 2005; 326: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In most studies, cellular deprivation of a single essential amino acid or branched chain amino acid decreased mTOR signaling and inhibited protein translation. However, the effect of Asn and Gln on mTOR signaling is unknown. The significance of the current study is the finding of a unique mode of regulation of AZ1 expression. Generally, amino acid starvation inhibits protein synthesis, and the addition of amino acids restores it. However, AZ1 synthesis occurred in the absence of amino acids, and its synthesis was prevented by the addition of specific amino acids. This makes sense because AZ inhibits ODC and in the absence of amino acids ODC activity is unable to stimulate or support growth. Therefore, this study provides an important insight into the complexity of amino acid signaling and, thereby, its role in the regulation of various cellular processes. We show that Asn stimulated ODC activity by preventing the expression of AZ1 without a change in the level of ODC protein. The disappearance of antizyme is essential for EGF to increase the activity of the enzyme. Asn significantly decreased the levels of AZ1 mRNA and protein. Although amino acids normally regulate protein translation via the mTOR pathway, AZ1 synthesis occurred independently of mTORC1 but depended on mTORC2 signaling. Asn-mediated inhibition of AZ1 synthesis involved the dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTORC2. This is the first demonstration of the mechanism whereby Asn and related amino acids regulate ODC activity.

SYBR Green PCR Master Mix was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. PCR primers were designed using Primer 3 software from the Whitehead Institute (Cambridge, MA). Three AZ1 siRNA oligonucleotide sequences were designed and cloned into a plasmid vector (pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-MiR) and confirmed by sequencing using appropriate primer pairs. Selected clones for the vector (MiR-LacZ-EGFP) and AZ1 (MiR-LacZ-AZ1-EGFP) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for the transfection of IEC-6 cells using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit from Qiagen. The IEC-6 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) at passage 13. The stock was maintained in T-150 flasks in a humidified, 37 °C incubator in an atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2. The medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 μg of insulin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. The stock was passaged weekly and fed three times per week. Passages 15–20 were used in the experiments. For most experiments, the cells were taken up with 0.05% trypsin plus 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. They were counted and plated (day 0) at 6.25 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM plus 5% dialyzed FBS, 10 μg of insulin, and 50 μg of gentamicin sulfate/ml. The cells were fed on day 2. On day 3, the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM with 10 μg of insulin and 50 μg of gentamicin sulfate/ml. On day 4, the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the medium was replaced with EBSS containing whatever additions were required by the experiment. The activity of the enzyme ODC was assayed with a radiometric technique in which the amount of 14CO2 liberated from dl-[1-14C]ornithine was estimated (39Richman R.A. Underwood L.E. Van Wyk J.J. Voina S.J. Synergistic effect of cortisol and growth hormone on hepatic ornithine decarboxylase activity.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 138: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, after experimental treatment, the dishes were placed on ice; the monolayers were washed three times with cold Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS), and 0.5 ml of 1 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm pyridoxal phosphate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol was added. The cells were frozen at −80 °C until assayed. At the time of assay, the cells were thawed on ice, scraped into Microfuge tubes, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The ODC activity of an aliquot of supernatant was incubated in a stoppered tube in the presence of 6.8 nmol of [14C]ornithine for 15 min at 37 °C. The 14CO2 liberated by the decarboxylation of ornithine was trapped on a piece of filter paper impregnated with 20 μl of 2 n NaOH, which was suspended in a center well above the reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 5%. The 14CO2 trapped in the filter paper was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Aliquots of the supernatant were assayed for total protein with the method described by Bradford (40Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity is expressed as pmol of CO2/h/mg of protein. Serum-starved cells incubated in EBSS with or without Asn for 4 h were washed twice with DPBS followed by the addition of TRIzol reagent for the extraction of total RNA following the manufacturer's (TRIzol) instructions. The yield and quality of total RNA was measured by absorbance at 260/280 nm. One μg of total RNA and 0.5 μg of the random primers were used for reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted to 100 μl with Diethylpyrocarbonate treated water and used as a template for real-time PCR. Briefly, PCR primers were designed with a melting temperature (Tm) of 59–61 °C. Amplicon size was 50–150 bases. Forward and reverse primers spanning exon-exon junctions were selected to avoid amplification of genome sequences (for AZ1, 5′-ACTGCTTCGCCAGAGAGAA (forward primer) and ATCTTCAGGGGTGGGTGAG-3′ (reverse primer); for actin, 5′-GCTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCA (forward primer) and CACAGCCTGGATGGCTACGT-3′ (reverse primer). PCRs were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The reaction contained 25 μl of SYBR reagent, 5 μl of diluted cDNA, and 300–900 nm primers in a 50-μl volume. The thermal cycling conditions involved an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 15 s and an annealing and extension steps at 60 °C for 1 min. Quantitative values were obtained from the threshold cycle value (Ct), which is the point where a significant increase of fluorescence is first detected. The transcript number of rat β-actin was quantified as an internal RNA control, and each sample was normalized on the basis of its β-actin content. The relative gene expression level of each sample was then normalized to the EBSS (control). Final results, expressed as n-fold difference in gene expression relative to β-actin and the control group, termed n, were calculated as n = 2(ΔCtsample − ΔCtcalibrator), where Ct values of the sample and calibrator were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of a target gene from the corresponding Ct value of the β-actin gene. AZ1- and AZ2- specific siRNA (20–25 nucleotides) derived from Rattus norvegicus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for the transient transfection of IEC-6 cells. FuGENE-HD transfection reagent was mixed with 10 μm siRNA (3:5 μl) in serum-free medium to a total volume of 100 μl and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. IEC-6 cells at a relatively early passage were grown to 60% confluence in 6-well plates. For transfection, the cell monolayer was rinsed with serum-free medium, and the siRNA/FuGENE-HD mixture was added drop by drop onto the cell monolayer and incubated for 24 h followed by incubation in serum containing medium for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Transiently transfected cells were serum-starved for 24 h and rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and further incubated with serum-free medium or EBSS for 3 h. Cells were washed with DPBS and lysed with MPER containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors to determine the expression of AZ1. AZ1 siRNA sequence was also cloned in MiR-LacZ-EGFP vector as per the manufacturer's instructions for the stable transfection of cells to knock down AZ1. Empty vector (MiR-LacZ-EGFP) or AZ1 (MiR-AZ1-EGFP) plasmid DNA (10 μg) was transfected as described above. The success of transfection was ascertained by monitoring GFP expression, and stable clones were selected using blasticidin. Isolated clones were characterized by determining the expression of AZ1 and induction of ODC activity by Asn. Confluent serum-starved IEC-6 cells grown in 6-well plates (triplicate for each treatment) or T-75 flasks were incubated in EBSS with or without Asn in the presence of 10 μci/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 and 4 h. Six-well plates were washed five times, and cells were lysed using MPER containing protease inhibitors. The supernatant was used to determine the protein concentration by the BCA method. An equal amount of protein from each sample was precipitated using TCA and resuspended in SDS sample buffer at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine was measured by liquid"

We also show that the Hxk2 nuclear import and the binding of Hxk2 with Kap60 are glucose-dependent and involve one lysine-rich nuclear localization sequence (NLS), located between lysine 6 and lysine 12. Moreover, Kap95 facilitates the recognition of the Hxk2 NLS1 motif by Kap60 and both importins are essential for Hxk2 nuclear import. It is also demonstrated that Hxk2 nuclear import and its binding to Kap95 and Kap60 depend on the Gsp1-GTP/GDP protein levels.

Thus, our study uncovers Hxk2 as a new cargo for the α/β-importin pathway of S. cerevisiae. Transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm is mediated by soluble receptors that recognize specific cargoes and carry them through the nuclear pore complex, which are embedded between the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Whereas the protein components of the nuclear pore complex are largely stationary within the pore, soluble transport factors can be freely exchanged between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The majority of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors belong to the family of karyopherin proteins (1Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Identification of a protein complex that is required for nuclear protein import and mediates docking of import substrate to distinct nucleoporins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, as well as in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, karyopherins that mediate the nuclear import of proteins and RNAs are generally known as importins (2Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Isolation of a protein that is essential for the first step of nuclear protein import.Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), whereas those mediating nuclear export are known as exportins (3Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Exportin 1 (Crm1p) is an essential nuclear export factor.Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Importins associate with their macromolecular cargo in the cytoplasm, either directly or indirectly via adaptor proteins. They dock to components of the nuclear pore complex (known as nucleoporins), translocate to the opposite side of the nuclear envelope, and release their cargo there. Cargo release is achieved by association of the importins with the GTPase Ran (Gsp1 in yeast) in the GTP-bound form (Gsp1-GTP). Nuclear export is essentially the reciprocal process, with cargo recognition occurring in the nucleus in the presence of Gsp1-GTP and cargo complexes dissociating in the cytoplasm upon GTP hydrolysis. Gsp1 is present at high concentrations in the nucleus in the GTP-bound form, and mainly in the GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm (4Weis K. Regulating access to the genome. Nucleocytoplasmic transport throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This compartmentalization depends on the localization of proteins that regulate the nucleotide state of Gsp1. GTP hydrolysis requires a GTPase-activating protein that is present in the cytoplasm. Conversely, the exchange of GDP to GTP is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is bound to chromatin in the nucleus (5Kalab P. Weis K. Heald R.

Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signaling pathway.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the main regulatory role of Hxk2 is caused by its interaction with Mig1 generating a repressor complex located in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae. In high glucose, nuclear Hxk2 stabilizes the repressor complex by blocking Mig1 phosphorylation in serine 311 by the Snf1 protein kinase. In low glucose, Hxk2 leaves the complex and does not block serine 311 of Mig1 so Snf1 can phosphorylate it. Under these conditions the repressor complex is disorganized and Hxk2 and phosphorylated Mig1 leave the nucleus (12Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F.

The mechanism by which Hxk2 leaves the nucleus is Xpo1-dependent and was recently described (15Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F.

Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but its nuclear import mechanism is largely unknown. Because Hxk2 is too large to translocate through the nuclear pore complex by diffusion from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, its transport across the nuclear envelope must be a mediated process, which may depend on carrier proteins. In this study, we show that the Hxk2 protein is an import cargo of the α/β-importin pathway in S. cerevisiae. We also show that Hxk2 interacts with Kap95 and Kap60 directly without the participation of other auxiliary proteins. Moreover, the Hxk2-Kap60 interaction is glucose-dependent and requires a NLS in the Hxk2 protein located between Lys6 and Lys12. We also demonstrate that Hxk2 recognition occurs in the cytoplasm in the presence of Gsp1-GDP and cargo complexes dissociate in the nucleus upon the exchange of GDP/GTP in the Gsp1 protein. The S. cerevisiae strains used throughout this study were derived from W303-1A (16Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R.

We created two mutant NLS alleles of HXK2 by mutating the HXK2 gene in the YEp352-HXK2 plasmid to generate HXK2(K6A,K7A,K12A) (encodes Hxk2nls1(Ala) protein) and HXK2(K406A,K407A,K410A) (encodes Hxk2nls2(Ala) protein) genes using a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol. The KanR gene was inserted into the XbaI site, located in the yeast genome 371 bp from the HXK2 stop codon, of plasmids YEp352-HXK2nls1(Ala) and YEp352-HXK2nls2(Ala). Then, by using these constructs, recombination cassettes were obtained by PCR; these cassettes contained the mutated HXK2 locus and the KanR marker together with 515 bp from the 5′-genomic region downstream from the HXK2 gene. These linear DNAs were integrated into the HXK2 locus of strains DBY1315 and JCY1410. To confirm the correct insertion, we PCR amplified the HXK2 locus from strains FMY304, which contains the HXK2 gene replaced by the HXK2nls1(Ala) gene, FMY305, which contains the HXK2 gene replaced by the HXK2nls2(Ala) gene to detect, respectively, the presence of the HXK2(K6A,K7A,K12A) and HXK2(K406A,K407A, K410A) mutant alleles by sequencing analysis.

Amino acids and other growth requirements were added at a final concentration of 20–150 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. The yeast expression plasmids YEp352-HXK2, YEp352-HXK2/GFP were constructed as indicated previously (12Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F.

Yeast strains expressing Hxk2-GFP, Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP, Hxk2nes2(Ala)nls1(Ala)-GFP, or Hxk2nes2(Ala)nls2(Ala)-GFP were grown to early-log phase (A600 of less than 0.8) in synthetic high-glucose medium (SD-ura). Half of the culture was shifted to synthetic low-glucose medium (SGly-ura) for 1 h. The media contained the appropriate carbon source and lacked the appropriate supplements to maintain selection of plasmids. Cells (25 μl) were loaded onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and the remaining suspension was immediately withdrawn by aspiration. One microliter of DAPI (2.5 μg/ml in 80% glycerol) was added, and a covert slide was placed over the microscope slide. GFP and DAPI localization in live cultures was monitored by direct fluorescence using a Leica DM5000B microscope. To avoid the nonlinear range of fluorescent signals, cells highly overexpressing GFP-tagged fusion protein were excluded from further analyses. The localization of proteins was monitored by visual inspection of the images. At least 100 cells were scored in each of at least three independent experiments. The distribution of fluorescence was scored in the following way: N, denotes a nuclear fluorescence signal; C, cytoplasmic fluorescence signal without nuclear fluorescence signal. Images representative of the results obtained were shown. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop CS. Data result from at least 3 independent experiments. Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 15.0 (SPSS). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the correction of Lilliefors was used to evaluate the fit of the data to a normal distribution and the test of Levene to evaluate the homogeneity of variance. Significance was tested by the one-way analysis of variance test followed by a Turkey's multiple range test or Student's t test to compare sample means. Significant differences were considered when p < 0.01. Yeast protein extracts were prepared as follows: yeast were grown in 10 to 20 ml of YEPD or synthetic high-glucose medium (SD-ura) at 28 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8–1.0. Half of the culture was shifted to YEPGly or synthetic low-glucose medium (SGly-ura) for 1 h. Cells were collected, washed twice with 1 ml of 1 m sorbitol, and suspended in 500 μl of PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3). The cells were broken in the presence of glass beads by one pulse of 20 s at 6.0 m/s using a FastPrep homogenizer (Thermo Electron Co.). After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as the crude protein extract. After centrifugation at 6,100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as the crude protein extract in immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown experiments. Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as previously described (22Gascón S. Lampen J.O. Purification of the internal invertase of yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1567-1572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as micromoles of glucose released per minute per 100 mg of cells (dry weight). Mutant or wild-type yeast cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8–1.0 in selective medium containing high-glucose (2%) and shifted to low-glucose conditions for 1 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 4 °C, 2 min), and crude extracts were prepared as described above. For Western blotting, 20 to 40 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a enhanced chemiluminescence PVDF transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences, HybondTM-P) by electroblotting, which was then incubated with anti-Hxk2, anti-Kap60 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Kap95 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as primary antibodies and then the appropriate secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A was used as the secondary reactant. The West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce) was used for detection. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using whole cell extracts from different strains. The extracts were incubated with anti-Kap60, anti-Kap95, or anti-Pho4 polyclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were then added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C in a spinning wheel. After extensive washing with PBS buffer, immunoprecipitated samples were boiled in SDS-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). The supernatant was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to an enhanced chemiluminescence PVDF membrane and immunoblotted as described above using anti-Hxk2 polyclonal antibody. Values shown are representative results from individual experiments. E. coli cells from the BL21(DE3) pLysS strain were transformed with fusion protein expression vectors pGEX-KAP95 or pGEX-KAP60. Cells were grown to A600 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Soluble extract was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with PBS buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer. The Kap95-GST and Kap60-GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with yeast whole cell extracts from the wild-type and mutant yeast strains expressing, respectively, Hxk2, HXK2nls1(Ala) or Hxk2nls2(Ala) proteins, for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS buffer. The cell extracts were obtained from yeast cells grown in YEPD medium containing high glucose (2%) and shifted to 0.05% glucose plus 3% glycerol (low glucose) for 1 h. Beads were gently washed five times with 2.5 ml of PBS buffer, boiled in 25 μl of sample loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using anti-Hxk2 antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A. Bound antibodies were detected using the West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce). GST fusion protein expression vectors pGEX-HXK2 and pGEX-GSP1 were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. Cells were grown to A600 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer and sonicated. The GST-Hxk2 and GST-Gsp1 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 2.5 units of thrombin (2 h at 4 °C) for site-specific separation of the GST affinity tag from Hxk2 and Gsp1 proteins. Affinity purified Gsp1 was immediately loaded with GTP or GDP by adding 30 mm K2PO4 (pH 7.5), 1 mm GTP or 1 mm GDP, and 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), incubating at room temperature for 1 h, adding 20 mm magnesium acetate, incubating on ice for 30 min, and freezing at −80 °C (20Künzler M. Gerstberger T. Stutz F. Bischoff F.R. Hurt E. Yeast Ran-binding protein 1 (Yrb1) shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is exported from the nucleus via a CRM1 (XPO1)-dependent pathway.Mol.

Gsp1-mediated Kap95-Kap60 interactions with Hxk2 were analyzed by incubating purified Hxk2 with GST-Kap95 or GST-Kap60 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in the presence of Gsp1(GTP) or Gsp1(GDP) for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS buffer. Beads were washed and analyzed as described above. In contrast to the fairly well defined Hxk2 export system (15Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F.

Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the mechanism underlying Hxk2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in high-glucose conditions is still unknown. We have tested the possible role of Msn5 and Nmd5 in Hxk2 nuclear import. Msn5, an import-export protein, has been shown to be involved in the export of Mig1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to glucose removal (23DeVit M.J. Johnston M.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nmd5 is a classical import factor implicated in the nuclear import of some stress response proteins like Hog1 and Crz1 (24Polizotto R.S. Cyert M.S.

Because the Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP mutant protein shows nuclear accumulation in both high- and low-glucose conditions because it is unable to interact with the export factor Xpo1 (15Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. Nuclear export of the yeast hexokinase 2 protein requires the Xpo1 (Crm1)-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we have determined the Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP nuclear accumulation in Δmsn5 and Δnmd5 mutants cells. Wild-type cells and Δmsn5 and Δnmd5 mutants cells show identical nuclear distribution to Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP growing at high- or low-glucose conditions. The Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP mutant protein accumulates in the nucleus in high-glucose conditions and it keeps its nuclear location after glucose exhaustion (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP can enter into the nucleus in the wild-type cells and both mutants, so Msn5 and Nmd5 are not implicated in Hxk2 nuclear import. In high-glucose conditions Hxk2 interacts with Mig1 to generate a glucose repressor complex in the nucleus. After glucose exhaustion, both Mig1 and Hxk2 exit the nucleus (12Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. The glucose-regulated nuclear localization of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Mig1-dependent.J. Biol.

Because the nucleocytoplasmic traffic of both Hxk2 and Mig1 is glucose-dependent we have studied whether Mig1 is required for Hxk2 nuclear import. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, in Δmig1 cells, the fluorescent Hxk2nes2(Ala)-GFP protein does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, it presents a constitutive nuclear location not affected by glucose levels. To confirm this result, we have also generated a novel mutant xpo1–1 Δmig1 to study the subcellular location of Hxk2-GFP in the presence of a defective Xpo1-dependent nuclear export pathway. The xpo1–1 Δmig1 double mutant cells were grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C) and then shifted to 37 °C (nonpermissive temperature) for 1 h. No accumulation of Hxk2 was detected in the nuclei of cells grown at the permissive temperature (Fig. 2b), and Hxk2-GFP showed identical subcellular distribution in a wild-type strain (15Peláez R.

All-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) markedly induces NIS activity in some breast cancer cell lines and promotes uptake of β-emitting radioiodide 131I sufficient for targeted cytotoxicity. To identify a signal transduction pathway that selectively stimulates NIS expression, we investigated regulation by the Rac1-p38 signaling pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and compared it with regulation in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. Loss of function experiments with pharmacologic inhibitors and small interfering RNA, as well as RT-PCR analysis of p38 isoforms, demonstrated the requirement of Rac1, MAPK kinase 3B, and p38β for the full expression of NIS in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, p38α was critical for NIS expression in FRTL-5 cells. Treatment with tRA or overexpression of Rac1 induced the phosphorylation of p38 isoforms, including p38β. A dominant negative mutant of Rac1 abolished tRA-induced phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of p38β or Rac1 significantly enhanced (1.9- and 3.9-fold, respectively), the tRA-stimulated NIS expression in MCF-7 cells. This study demonstrates differential regulation of NIS by distinct p38 isoforms in breast cancer cells and thyroid cells.

https://openalex.org/W2086108528,"Dynein light chain 1 (LC1/DNAL1) is one of the most highly conserved components of ciliary axonemal outer arm dyneins, and it associates with both a heavy chain motor unit and tubulin located within the A-tubule of the axonemal outer doublet microtubules. In a variety of model systems, lack of LC1 or expression of mutant forms leads to profound defects in ciliary motility, including the failure of the hydrodynamic coupling needed for ciliary metachronal synchrony, random stalling during the power/recovery stroke transition, an aberrant response to imposed viscous load, and in some cases partial failure of motor assembly. These phenotypes have led to the proposal that LC1 acts as part of a mechanical switch to control motor function in response to alterations in axonemal curvature. Here we have used NMR chemical shift mapping to define the regions perturbed by a series of mutations in the C-terminal domain that yield a range of phenotypic effects on motility. In addition, we have identified the subdomain of LC1 involved in binding microtubules and characterized the consequences of an Asn → Ser alteration within the terminal leucine-rich repeat that in humans causes primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together, these data define a series of functional subdomains within LC1 and allow us to propose a structural model for the organization of the dynein heavy chain-LC1-microtubule ternary complex that is required for the coordinated activity of dynein motors in cilia."
https://openalex.org/W1986822617,"Dynamic protein-protein interactions play an essential role in cellular regulatory systems. The cyanobacterial circadian clock is an oscillatory system that can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing ATP and three clock proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. Association and dissociation of KaiB from KaiC-containing complexes are critical to circadian phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KaiC. We developed an automated and noninvasive method to monitor dynamic complex formation in real time using confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and uniformly labeled KaiB as a probe. A nanomolar concentration of the labeled KaiB for FCS measurement did not interfere with the oscillatory system but behaved similarly to the wild-type one during the measurement period (>5 days). The fluorescent probe was stable against repeated laser exposure. As an application, we show that this detection system allowed analysis of the dynamics of both long term circadian oscillations and short term responses to temperature changes (∼10 min) in the same sample. This suggested that a phase shift of the clock with a high temperature pulse occurred just after the stimulus through dissociation of KaiB from the KaiC complex. This monitoring method should improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this cellular circadian oscillator and provide a means to assess dynamic protein interactions in biological systems characterized by rates similar to those observed with the Kai proteins."
