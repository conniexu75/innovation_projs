https://openalex.org/W2094074687,"Physicians' poor mental health not only hinders their professional performance and affects the quality of healthcare provided but also adversely affects patients' health outcomes. Few studies in China have evaluated the mental health of physicians. The purposes of this study are to quantify Chinese physicians' anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as evaluate associated risk factors.In our study, 2641 physicians working in public hospitals in Shenzhen in southern China were recruited and interviewed by using a structured questionnaire along with validated scales testing anxiety and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms.An estimated 25.67% of physicians had anxiety symptoms, 28.13% had depressive symptoms, and 19.01% had both anxiety and depressive symptoms. More than 10% of the participants often experienced workplace violence and 63.17% sometimes encountered it. Among our study population, anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with poor self-reported physical health, frequent workplace violence, lengthy working hours (more than 60 hours a week), frequent night shifts (twice or more per week), and lack of regular physical exercise.Our study demonstrates that anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among physicians in China, and the doctor-patient relationship issue is particularly stressful. Interventions implemented to minimize workload, improve doctor-patient relationships, and assist physicians in developing healthier lifestyles are essential to combat anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians, which may improve their professional performance."
https://openalex.org/W2064553856,"As in many other locations in the world, honeybee colony losses and disorders have increased in Belgium. Some of the symptoms observed rest unspecific and their causes remain unknown. The present study aims to determine the role of both pesticide exposure and virus load on the appraisal of unexplained honeybee colony disorders in field conditions. From July 2011 to May 2012, 330 colonies were monitored. Honeybees, wax, beebread and honey samples were collected. Morbidity and mortality information provided by beekeepers, colony clinical visits and availability of analytical matrix were used to form 2 groups: healthy colonies and colonies with disorders (n = 29, n = 25, respectively). Disorders included: (1) dead colonies or colonies in which part of the colony appeared dead, or had disappeared; (2) weak colonies; (3) queen loss; (4) problems linked to brood and not related to any known disease. Five common viruses and 99 pesticides (41 fungicides, 39 insecticides and synergist, 14 herbicides, 5 acaricides and metabolites) were quantified in the samples.The main symptoms observed in the group with disorders are linked to brood and queens. The viruses most frequently found are Black Queen Cell Virus, Sac Brood Virus, Deformed Wing Virus. No significant difference in virus load was observed between the two groups. Three acaricides, 5 insecticides and 13 fungicides were detected in the analysed samples. A significant correlation was found between the presence of fungicide residues and honeybee colony disorders. A significant positive link could also be established between the observation of disorder and the abundance of crop surface around the beehive. According to our results, the role of fungicides as a potential stressor for honeybee colonies should be further studied, either by their direct and/or indirect impacts on bees and bee colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2094397390,"Puberty is a complex physiological event by which animals mature into an adult capable of sexual reproduction. In order to enhance our understanding of the genes and regulatory pathways and networks involved in puberty, we characterized the transcriptome of five reproductive tissues (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovary, uterus, and endometrium) as well as tissues known to be relevant to growth and metabolism needed to achieve puberty (i.e., longissimus dorsi muscle, adipose, and liver). These tissues were collected from pre- and post-pubertal Brangus heifers (3/8 Brahman; Bos indicus x 5/8 Angus; Bos taurus) derived from a population of cattle used to identify quantitative trait loci associated with fertility traits (i.e., age of first observed corpus luteum (ACL), first service conception (FSC), and heifer pregnancy (HPG)). In order to exploit the power of complementary omics analyses, pre- and post-puberty co-expression gene networks were constructed by combining the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), RNA-Seq, and bovine transcription factors. Eight tissues among pre-pubertal and post-pubertal Brangus heifers revealed 1,515 differentially expressed and 943 tissue-specific genes within the 17,832 genes confirmed by RNA-Seq analysis. The hypothalamus experienced the most notable up-regulation of genes via puberty (i.e., 204 out of 275 genes). Combining the results of GWAS and RNA-Seq, we identified 25 loci containing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with ACL, FSC, and (or) HPG. Seventeen of these SNP were within a gene and 13 of the genes were expressed in uterus or endometrium. Multi-tissue omics analyses revealed 2,450 co-expressed genes relative to puberty. The pre-pubertal network had 372,861 connections whereas the post-pubertal network had 328,357 connections. A sub-network from this process revealed key transcriptional regulators (i.e., PITX2, FOXA1, DACH2, PROP1, SIX6, etc.). Results from these multi-tissue omics analyses improve understanding of the number of genes and their complex interactions for puberty in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1991432283,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy are crucially important for proteostasis in cells. These pathways are interdependent, and dysfunction in either pathway causes accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates, a hallmark of human pathological conditions. To elucidate in vivo compensatory action(s) against proteasomal dysfunction, we developed mice with reduced proteasome activity in their livers. The mutant mice exhibited severe liver damage, accompanied by formation of aggregates positive for ubiquitin and p62/Sqstm1, an adaptor protein for both selective autophagy and the anti-oxidative Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. These aggregates were selectively entrapped by autophagosomes, and pathological features of livers with impaired proteasome activity were exacerbated by simultaneous suppression of autophagy. In contrast, concomitant loss of p62/Sqstm1 had no apparent effect on the liver pathology though p62/Sqstm1 was indispensable for the aggregates formation. Furthermore, defective proteasome function led to transcriptional activation of the Nrf2, which served as a physiological adaptation. Our in vivo data suggest that cells contain networks of cellular defense mechanisms against defective proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2002512381,"The ecological mechanisms driving community succession are widely debated, particularly for microorganisms. While successional soil microbial communities are known to undergo predictable changes in structure concomitant with shifts in a variety of edaphic properties, the causal mechanisms underlying these patterns are poorly understood. Thus, to specifically isolate how nutrients--important drivers of plant succession--affect soil microbial succession, we established a full factorial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization plot experiment in recently deglaciated (∼3 years since exposure), unvegetated soils of the Puca Glacier forefield in Southeastern Peru. We evaluated soil properties and examined bacterial community composition in plots before and one year after fertilization. Fertilized soils were then compared to samples from three reference successional transects representing advancing stages of soil development ranging from 5 years to 85 years since exposure. We found that a single application of +NP fertilizer caused the soil bacterial community structure of the three-year old soils to most resemble the 85-year old soils after one year. Despite differences in a variety of soil edaphic properties between fertilizer plots and late successional soils, bacterial community composition of +NP plots converged with late successional communities. Thus, our work suggests a mechanism for microbial succession whereby changes in resource availability drive shifts in community composition, supporting a role for nutrient colimitation in primary succession. These results suggest that nutrients alone, independent of other edaphic factors that change with succession, act as an important control over soil microbial community development, greatly accelerating the rate of succession."
https://openalex.org/W2071816516,"Stem cell-based tissue engineering shows promise for bone regeneration and requires artificial microenvironments to enhance the survival, proliferation and differentiation of the seeded cells. Silk fibroin, as a natural protein polymer, has unique properties for tissue regeneration. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of porous silk scaffolds on rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) by lenti-GFP tracking both in vitro and in vivo in cranial bone defects. The number of cells seeded within silk scaffolds in rat cranial bone defects increased from 2 days to 2 weeks after implantation, followed by a decrease at eight weeks. Importantly, the implanted cells survived for 8 weeks in vivo and some of the cells might differentiate into endothelial cells and osteoblasts induced by the presence of VEGF and BMP-2 in the scaffolds to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. The results demonstrate that porous silk scaffolds provide a suitable niche to maintain long survival and function of the implanted cells for bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2160996490,"The concept of cognitive reserve emerged from observed disparities between brain pathology and clinical symptoms. It may explain better neuropsychological performance in healthy individuals. The objectives of this study were to measure reserve in healthy subjects using a new Cognitive Reserve Scale (CRS), analyze the internal consistency of the CRS, and analyze validity evidence. A total of 117 healthy individuals were divided into two groups: 87 adults (aged 18-64 years) and 30 elderly adults (≥65 years). All subjects completed the CRS and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The internal consistency of the scale was satisfactory (α = 0.77). No significant differences were observed between genders (t = 0.51, p = 0.611), and age was corrected by averaging the CRS score. The study of validity evidence showed that education affected the CRS (t = -2.98, p = 0.004, partial h2 = 0.07) and there was no significant relationship between the CRS and IQ (r = 0.09, p = 0.33). Occupational attainment and the CRS were not related (F2,116 = 0.11, p = 0.898). In line with previous studies on reserve, heterogeneity was observed in the analyses of relationships between the CRS and cognitive performance. There were significant relationships between CRS score and the Verbal Learning Spanish-Complutense Test last trial (r = 0.24, p = 0.009), sum (r = 0.32, p = 0.000), short-term (r = 0.29, p = 0.002) and long-term memory (r = 0.22, p = 0.018), Matrix Reasoning subtest (r = 0.20, p = 0.027) and Block Design subtest (r = 0.20, p = 0.029). No other neuropsychological variables correlated with the CRS (p>0.05). The CRS is a reliable instrument that reflects the frequency of participation in brain-stimulating activities across the lifetime. The associations between the CRS and education and neuropsychological performance support validity evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2057795443,"Background Bitter taste is the primary culprit for rejection of pediatric liquid medications. We probed the underlying biology of bitter sensing and the efficacy of two known bitter blockers in children and adults. Methods A racially diverse group of 154 children (3-10 years old) and their mothers (N = 118) evaluated the effectiveness of two bitter blockers, sodium gluconate (NaG) and monosodium glutamate (MSG), for five food-grade bitter compounds (quinine, denatonium benzoate, caffeine, propylthiouracil (PROP), urea) using a forced-choice method of paired comparisons. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01407939). Results The blockers reduced bitterness in 7 of 10 bitter-blocker combinations for adults but only 3 of 10 for children, suggesting that efficacy depends on age and is also specific to each bitter-blocker combination. Only the bitterness of urea was reduced by both blockers in both age groups, whereas the bitterness of PROP was not reduced by either blocker in either age group regardless of TAS2R38 genotype. Children liked the salty taste of the blocker NaG more than did adults, but both groups liked the savory taste of MSG equally. Conclusions and Relevance Bitter blocking was less effective in children, and the efficacy of blocking was both age and compound specific. This knowledge will pave the way for evidence-based strategies to help develop better-tasting medicines and highlights the conclusion that adult panelists and genotyping alone may not always be appropriate in evaluating the taste of a drug geared for children."
https://openalex.org/W2036116831,"Where malaria is transmitted by zoophilic vectors, two types of malaria control strategies have been proposed based on animals: using livestock to divert vector biting from people (zooprophylaxis) or as baits to attract vectors to insecticide sources (insecticide-treated livestock). Opposing findings have been obtained on malaria zooprophylaxis, and despite the success of an insecticide-treated livestock trial in Pakistan, where malaria vectors are highly zoophilic, its effectiveness is yet to be formally tested in Africa where vectors are more anthropophilic. This study aims to clarify the different effects of livestock on malaria and to understand under what circumstances livestock-based interventions could play a role in malaria control programmes. This was explored by developing a mathematical model and combining it with data from Pakistan and Ethiopia. Consistent with previous work, a zooprophylactic effect of untreated livestock is predicted in two situations: if vector population density does not increase with livestock introduction, or if livestock numbers and availability to vectors are sufficiently high such that the increase in vector density is counteracted by the diversion of bites from humans to animals. Although, as expected, insecticide-treatment of livestock is predicted to be more beneficial in settings with highly zoophilic vectors, like South Asia, we find that the intervention could also considerably decrease malaria transmission in regions with more anthropophilic vectors, like Anopheles arabiensis in Africa, under specific circumstances: high treatment coverage of the livestock population, using a product with stronger or longer lasting insecticidal effect than in the Pakistan trial, and with small (ideally null) repellency effect, or if increasing the attractiveness of treated livestock to malaria vectors. The results suggest these are the most appropriate conditions for field testing insecticide-treated livestock in an Africa region with moderately zoophilic vectors, where this intervention could contribute to the integrated control of malaria and livestock diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2045335698,"Modern analysis of high-dimensional SNP data requires a number of biometrical and statistical methods such as pre-processing, analysis of population structure, association analysis and genotype imputation. Software used for these purposes often rely on specific and incompatible input and output data formats. Therefore extensive data management including multiple format conversions is necessary during analyses.In order to support fast and efficient management and bio-statistical quality control of high-dimensional SNP data, we developed the publically available software fcGENE using C++ object-oriented programming language. This software simplifies and automates the use of different existing analysis packages, especially during the workflow of genotype imputations and corresponding analyses.fcGENE transforms SNP data and imputation results into different formats required for a large variety of analysis packages such as PLINK, SNPTEST, HAPLOVIEW, EIGENSOFT, GenABEL and tools used for genotype imputation such as MaCH, IMPUTE, BEAGLE and others. Data Management tasks like merging, splitting, extracting SNP and pedigree information can be performed. fcGENE also supports a number of bio-statistical quality control processes and quality based filtering processes at SNP- and sample-wise level. The tool also generates templates of commands required to run specific software packages, especially those required for genotype imputation. We demonstrate the functionality of fcGENE by example workflows of SNP data analyses and provide a comprehensive manual of commands, options and applications.We have developed a user-friendly open-source software fcGENE, which comprehensively supports SNP data management, quality control and analysis workflows. Download statistics and corresponding feedbacks indicate that software is highly recognised and extensively applied by the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W1971853564,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in carcinogenesis. However, their underlying mechanisms of action in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic silencing of miRNAs through tumor suppression by CpG island hypermethylation may be a common hallmark of human tumors. Here, we demonstrated that miR-941 was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines and was generally hypermethylated in HCC. The overexpression of miR-941 suppressed in vitro cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited the metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Furthermore, the histone demethylase KDM6B (lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6B) was identified as a direct target of miR-941 and was negatively regulated by miR-941. The ectopic expression of KDM6B abrogated the phenotypic changes induced by miR-941 in HCC cells. We demonstrated that miR-941 and KDM6B regulated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and affected cell migratory/invasive properties."
https://openalex.org/W1973076878,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a major impact on regulatory networks in human carcinogenesis. In this study, we sought to investigate the prognostic significance of miRNAs in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In a discovery phase, RNA was extracted from 58 OSCC tumor samples and paired normal tissues. MiRNAs expression was evaluated with TaqMan Array Card and TaqMan MicroRNA assays. The prognostic significance of the miRNA signature identified in the discovery phase was validated by qRT-PCR in a replication set consisting of 141 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We identified a miRNA regulatory network centered on the three hub genes (SP1, MYC, and TP53) that predicted distinct clinical endpoints. Three miRNAs (miR-218, miR-125b, and let-7g) and their downstream response genes had a concordant prognostic significance on disease-free survival and disease-specific survival rates. In addition, patients with a reduced expression of miR-218, miR-125b, and let-7g have a higher risk of poor outcomes in presence of specific risk factors (p-stage III-IV, pT3-4, or pN+). Our findings indicate that specific miRNAs have prognostic significance in OSCC patients and may improve prognostic stratification over traditional risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1973632194,"Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are promising candidates for gene delivery into mammalian somatic cells and may be useful for reproductive cloning using the somatic cell nuclear transfer technique. However, limited investigations of their potential applications in animal genetics and breeding, particularly multiple-gene delivery by magnetofection, have been performed. Here, we developed a stable, targetable and convenient system for delivering multiple genes into the nuclei of porcine somatic cells using magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as gene carriers. After surface modification by polyethylenimine, the spherical magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles showed strong binding affinity for DNA plasmids expressing the genes encoding a green (DNAGFP) or red (DNADsRed) fluorescent protein. At weight ratios of DNAGFP or DNADsRed to magnetic nanoparticles lower than or equal to 10∶1 or 5∶1, respectively, the DNA molecules were completely bound by the magnetic nanoparticles. Atomic force microscopy analyses confirmed binding of the spherical magnetic nanoparticles to stretched DNA strands up to several hundred nanometers in length. As a result, stable and efficient co-expression of GFP and DsRed in porcine kidney PK-15 cells was achieved by magnetofection. The results presented here demonstrate the potential application of magnetic nanoparticles as an attractive delivery system for animal genetics and breeding studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003047548,"Heat stress is a primary factor causing summer bentgrass decline. Changes in gene expression at the transcriptional and/or translational level are thought to be a fundamental mechanism in plant response to environmental stresses. Heat stress redirects protein synthesis in higher plants and results in stress protein synthesis, particularly heat shock proteins (HSPs). The goal of this work was to analyze the expression pattern of major HSPs in creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) during different heat stress periods and to study the influence of nitrogen (N) on the HSP expression patterns. A growth chamber study on 'Penn-A4' creeping bentgrass subjected to 38/28°C day/night for 50 days, was conducted with four nitrate rates (no N-0, low N-2.5, medium N-7.5, and high N-12.5 kg N ha-1) applied biweekly. Visual turfgrass quality (TQ), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), shoot electrolyte leakage (ShEL), and root viability (RV) were monitored, along with the expression pattern of HSPs. There was no difference in measured parameters between treatments until week seven, except TQ at week five. At week seven, grass at medium N had better TQ, NDVI, and Fv/Fm accompanied by lower ShEL and higher RV, suggesting a major role in improved heat tolerance. All the investigated HSPs (HSP101, HSP90, HSP70, and sHSPs) were up-regulated by heat stress. Their expression patterns indicated cooperation between different HSPs and their roles in bentgrass thermotolerance. In addition, their production seems to be resource dependent. This study could further improve our understanding about how different N levels affect bentgrass thermotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2031294360,"The sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) functions as a lipid mediator and as a key intermediate of the sole sphingolipid to glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway (S1P metabolic pathway). In this pathway, S1P is converted to palmitoyl-CoA through 4 reactions, then incorporated mainly into glycerophospholipids. Although most of the genes responsible for the S1P metabolic pathway have been identified, the gene encoding the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, responsible for the saturation step (conversion of trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA to palmitoyl-CoA) remains unidentified. In the present study, we show that TER is the missing gene in mammals using analyses involving yeast cells, deleting the TER homolog TSC13, and TER-knockdown HeLa cells. TER is known to be involved in the production of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). A significant proportion of the saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs are used for sphingolipid synthesis. Therefore, TER is involved in both the production of VLCFAs used in the fatty acid moiety of sphingolipids as well as in the degradation of the sphingosine moiety of sphingolipids via S1P."
https://openalex.org/W2027252687,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors initiating the processes of desensitization and β-arrestin-dependent signaling. Interaction of GRKs with activated receptors serves to stimulate their kinase activity. The extreme N-terminal helix (αN), the kinase small lobe, and the active site tether (AST) of the AGC kinase domain have previously been implicated in mediating the allosteric activation. Expanded mutagenesis of the αN and AST allowed us to further assess the role of these two regions in kinase activation and receptor phosphorylation in vitro and in intact cells. We also developed a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to monitor the recruitment of GRK2 to activated α(2A)-adrenergic receptors (α(2A)ARs) in living cells. The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer signal exhibited a biphasic response to norepinephrine concentration, suggesting that GRK2 is recruited to Gβγ and α(2A)AR with EC50 values of 15 nM and 8 μM, respectively. We show that mutations in αN (L4A, V7E, L8E, V11A, S12A, Y13A, and M17A) and AST (G475I, V477D, and I485A) regions impair or potentiate receptor phosphorylation and/or recruitment. We suggest that a surface of GRK2, including Leu(4), Val(7), Leu(8), Val(11), and Ser(12), directly interacts with receptors, whereas residues such as Asp(10), Tyr(13), Ala(16), Met(17), Gly(475), Val(477), and Ile(485) are more important for kinase domain closure and activation. Taken together with data on GRK1 and GRK6, our data suggest that all three GRK subfamilies make conserved interactions with G protein-coupled receptors, but there may be unique interactions that influence selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2049320510,"Background Cathepsin K (CatK), a cysteine protease with the potent elastolytic activity, plays a predominant role in intracellular elastin degradation in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and contributes to solar elastosis. In previous studies, CatK expression was downregulated in photoaged skin and fibroblasts, but upregulated in acute UVA-irradiated skin and fibroblasts. The underlying mechanisms regulating UVA-induced CatK expression remain elusive. Objective This study investigates mechanisms involved in the regulation of UVA-induced CatK expression in HDFs. Methods Primary HDFs were exposed to UVA. Cell proliferation was analyzed using a colorimetric assay of relative cell number. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect CatK expression in HDFs on three consecutive days after 10 J/cm2 UVA irradiation, or cells treated with increasing UVA doses. UVA-activated MAPK/AP-1 pathway was examined by Western blot. Effects of inhibition of MAPK pathway and knockdown of Jun and Fos on UVA-induced CatK expression were also measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Results UVA significantly increased CatK mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. UVA-induced CatK expression occurred along with UVA-activated phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and Jun, UVA-increased expression of Fos. Inactivation of JNK and p38MAPK pathways both remarkably decreased UVA-induced CatK expression, which was suppressed more by inhibition of JNK pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of Jun and Fos significantly attenuated basal and UVA-induced CatK expression. Conclusion UVA is capable of increasing CatK expression in HDFs, most likely by activation of MAPK pathway and of AP-1, which has been shown to be the case for matrix metalloproteinases. As current strategies for selecting anti-photoaging agents focus on their ability to decrease MMPs' expression through inhibiting UV- activated MAPK pathway, future strategies should also consider their effect on CatK expression."
https://openalex.org/W2951839115,"Horizontal gene transfer often leads to phenotypic changes within recipient organisms independent of any immediate evolutionary benefits. While secondary phenotypic effects of horizontal transfer (i.e., changes in growth rates) have been demonstrated and studied across a variety of systems using relatively small plasmids and phage, little is known about the magnitude or number of such costs after the transfer of larger regions. Here we describe numerous phenotypic changes that occur after a large-scale horizontal transfer event (∼1 Mb megaplasmid) within Pseudomonas stutzeri including sensitization to various stresses as well as changes in bacterial behavior. These results highlight the power of horizontal transfer to shift pleiotropic relationships and cellular networks within bacterial genomes. They also provide an important context for how secondary effects of transfer can bias evolutionary trajectories and interactions between species. Lastly, these results and system provide a foundation to investigate evolutionary consequences in real time as newly acquired regions are ameliorated and integrated into new genomic contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2049223018,"The mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of autoimmunity in myasthenia gravis are poorly understood. In this investigation, we evaluate the role of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in humans and in two animal models. We identified survivin expression in cells with B lymphocyte and plasma cells markers, and in the thymuses of patients with myasthenia gravis. A portion of survivin-expressing cells specifically bound a peptide derived from the alpha subunit of acetylcholine receptor indicating that they recognize the peptide. Thymuses of patients with myasthenia gravis had large numbers of survivin-positive cells with fewer cells in the thymuses of corticosteroid-treated patients. Application of a survivin vaccination strategy in mouse and rat models of myasthenia gravis demonstrated improved motor assessment, a reduction in acetylcholine receptor specific autoantibodies, and a retention of acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction, associated with marked reduction of survivin-expressing circulating CD20+ cells. These data strongly suggest that survivin expression in cells with lymphocyte and plasma cell markers occurs in patients with myasthenia gravis and in two animal models of myasthenia gravis. Survivin expression may be part of a mechanism that inhibits the apoptosis of autoreactive B cells in myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1974139579,"Dietary medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) and linoleic acid follow different metabolic routes, and linoleic acid activates PPAR receptors. Both these mechanisms may modify lipoprotein and fatty acid metabolism after dietary intervention. Our objective was to investigate how dietary MCFA and linoleic acid supplementation and body fat distribution affect the fasting lipoprotein subclass profile, lipoprotein kinetics, and postprandial fatty acid kinetics. In a randomized double blind cross-over trial, 12 male subjects (age 51±7 years; BMI 28.5±0.8 kg/m2), were divided into 2 groups according to waist-hip ratio. They were supplemented with 60 grams/day MCFA (mainly C8:0, C10:0) or linoleic acid for three weeks, with a wash-out period of six weeks in between. Lipoprotein subclasses were measured using HPLC. Lipoprotein and fatty acid metabolism were studied using a combination of several stable isotope tracers. Lipoprotein and tracer data were analyzed using computational modeling. Lipoprotein subclass concentrations in the VLDL and LDL range were significantly higher after MCFA than after linoleic acid intervention. In addition, LDL subclass concentrations were higher in lower body obese individuals. Differences in VLDL metabolism were found to occur in lipoprotein lipolysis and uptake, not production; MCFAs were elongated intensively, in contrast to linoleic acid. Dietary MCFA supplementation led to a less favorable lipoprotein profile than linoleic acid supplementation. These differences were not due to elevated VLDL production, but rather to lower lipolysis and uptake rates."
https://openalex.org/W2088483219,"KshA is the oxygenase component of 3-ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase, a Rieske oxygenase involved in the bacterial degradation of steroids. Consistent with its role in bile acid catabolism, KshA1 from Rhodococcus rhodochrous DSM43269 had the highest apparent specificity (kcat/Km) for steroids with an isopropyl side chain at C17, such as 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorcholesta-1,4-diene-22-oate (1,4-BNC). By contrast, the KshA5 homolog had the highest apparent specificity for substrates with no C17 side chain (kcat/Km >10(5) s(-1) M(-1) for 4-estrendione, 5α-androstandione, and testosterone). Unexpectedly, substrates such as 4-androstene-3,17-dione (ADD) and 4-BNC displayed strong substrate inhibition (Ki S ∼100 μM). By comparison, the cholesterol-degrading KshAMtb from Mycobacterium tuberculosis had the highest specificity for CoA-thioesterified substrates. These specificities are consistent with differences in the catabolism of cholesterol and bile acids, respectively, in actinobacteria. X-ray crystallographic structures of the KshAMtb·ADD, KshA1·1,4-BNC-CoA, KshA5·ADD, and KshA5·1,4-BNC-CoA complexes revealed that the enzymes have very similar steroid-binding pockets with the substrate's C17 oriented toward the active site opening. Comparisons suggest Tyr-245 and Phe-297 are determinants of KshA1 specificity. All enzymes have a flexible 16-residue ""mouth loop,"" which in some structures completely occluded the substrate-binding pocket from the bulk solvent. Remarkably, the catalytic iron and α-helices harboring its ligands were displaced up to 4.4 Å in the KshA5·substrate complexes as compared with substrate-free KshA, suggesting that Rieske oxygenases may have a dynamic nature similar to cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W2080430019,"We investigated 18 HIV-negative patients with MDR-TB for M. tuberculosis (Mtb)- and PPD-specific CD4 T cell responses and followed them over 6 months of drug therapy. Twelve of these patients were sputum culture (SC) positive and six patients were SC negative upon enrollment. Our aim was to identify a subset of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells that would predict time to culture conversion. The total frequency of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells at baseline could not distinguish patients showing positive or negative SC. However, a greater proportion of late-differentiated (LD) Mtb- and PPD-specific memory CD4 T cells was found in SC positive patients than in those who were SC negative (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0012, respectively). Similarly, a higher co-expression of HLA-DR+ Ki67+ on Mtb- and PPD-specific CD4 T cells could also discriminate between sputum SC positive versus SC negative (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that baseline levels of Ki67+ HLA-DR+ Mtb- and PPD-specific CD4 T cells were predictive of the time to sputum culture conversion, with area-under-the-curve of 0.8 (p = 0.027). Upon treatment, there was a significant decline of these Ki67+ HLA-DR+ T cell populations in the first 2 months, with a progressive increase in mycobacteria-specific polyfunctional IFNγ+ IL2+ TNFα+ CD4 T cells over 6 months.

We aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the task shifting from government facilities to CBOs in China.HIV preventive intervention for MSM and follow-up care for PLHA were shifted from government facilities to CBOs. Based on 'cash on service delivery' model, 10 USD per MSM tested for HIV with results notified, 82 USD per newly HIV cases diagnosed, and 50 USD per PLHA received a defined package of follow-up care services, were paid to the CBOs. Cash payments were made biannually based on the verified results in the national web-based HIV/AIDS information system.After task shifting, CBOs gradually assumed preventive intervention for MSM and follow-up care for PLHA from 2008 to 2012. HIV testing coverage among MSM increased from 4.1% in 2008 to 22.7% in 2012. The baseline median CD4 counts of newly diagnosed HIV positive MSM increased from 309 to 397 cells/µL. HIV tests among MSM by CBOs accounted for less than 1% of the total HIV tests in Nanjing but the share of HIV cases detected by CBOs was 12.4% in 2008 and 43.6% in 2012. Unit cost per HIV case detected by CBOs was 47 times lower than that by government facilities. The coverage of CD4 tests and antiretroviral therapy increased from 71.1% and 78.6% in 2008 to 86.0% and 90.1% in 2012, respectively.It is feasible to shift essential HIV services from government facilities to CBOs, and to verify independently service results to adopt 'cash on service delivery' model. Services provided by CBOs are cost-effective, as compared with that by government facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2002874098,"Background HIV infection occurs in 30% of children with severe acute malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Effects of HIV on the pathophysiology and recovery from malnutrition are poorly understood. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 75 severely malnourished Ugandan children. HIV status/CD4 counts were assessed at baseline; auxologic data and blood samples were obtained at admission and after 14 days of inpatient treatment. We utilized metabolomic profiling to characterize effects of HIV infection on metabolic status and subsequent responses to nutritional therapy. Findings At admission, patients (mean age 16.3 mo) had growth failure (mean W/H z-score −4.27 in non-edematous patients) that improved with formula feeding (mean increase 1.00). 24% (18/75) were HIV-infected. Nine children died within the first 14 days of hospitalization; mortality was higher for HIV-infected patients (33% v. 5%, OR = 8.83). HIV-infected and HIV-negative children presented with elevated NEFA, ketones, and even-numbered acylcarnitines and reductions in albumin and amino acids. Leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and IGF-1 levels were low while growth hormone, cortisol, and ghrelin levels were high. At baseline, HIV-infected patients had higher triglycerides, ketones, and even-chain acylcarnitines and lower leptin and adiponectin levels than HIV-negative patients. Leptin levels rose in all patients following nutritional intervention, but adiponectin levels remained depressed in HIV-infected children. Baseline hypoleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Our findings suggest a critical interplay between HIV infection and adipose tissue storage and function in the adaptation to malnutrition. Hypoleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia may contribute to high mortality rates among malnourished, HIV-infected children."
https://openalex.org/W2022332102,"The person-to-person transmission of the hepatitis A virus primarily occurs in enclosed spaces, particularly in the presence of inadequate hygiene conditions and a high proportion of susceptible individuals. Thus, intimate family contact stands out as a risk factor for HAV infection dissemination. The present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of household HAV transmission. Blood samples were collected from patients with hepatitis A (index cases) and their family members (contacts) that were referred to an ambulatory care clinic specializing in viral hepatitis. A total of 97 samples were collected from 30 families with a confirmed hepatitis A case (index case). Serological and molecular techniques for the diagnosis of hepatitis A were conducted on all samples. HAV infection (anti-HAV IgM + and/or HAV RNA +) was detected in 34.3% (23/67) of the contacts; 34.3% (23/67) of the contacts were immune to HAV, and 31.4% (21/67) were susceptible. In the household contacts, HAV immunity was significantly associated with older age; susceptibility to infection and HAV infection were associated with younger age. Household outbreaks were detected in 16/30 families studied. Co-circulation of subgenotypes IA and IB was found in the household outbreaks, and person-to-person transmission was evidenced in six of the household outbreaks, with 100% homology between the index case and contact strains. The results demonstrated the relevance of HAV household transmission, reaffirming the need for hepatitis A vaccine administration in susceptible contacts and effective infection control procedures to prevent the extension of household outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2053734429,"Although TAK1 has been implicated in inflammation and oxidative stress, its roles in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and in response to vascular injury have not been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the role of TAK1 in modulating oxidative stress in VSMCs and its involvement in neointima formation after vascular injury. Double immunostaining reveals that vascular injury induces a robust phosphorylation of TAK1 (Thr187) in the medial VSMCs of injured arteries in wildtype mice, but this effect is blocked in CD40-deficient mice. Upregulation of TAK1 in VSMCs is functionally important, as it is critically involved in pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects on VSMCs and eventual neointima formation. In vivo, pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol blocked the injury-induced phosphorylation of both TAK1 (Thr187) and NF-kB/p65 (Ser536), associated with marked inhibition of superoxide production, 3-nitrotyrosine, and MCP-1 in the injured arteries. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that either siRNA knockdown or 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibition of TAK1 significantly attenuated NADPH oxidase activation and superoxide production induced by CD40L/CD40 stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that blockade of TAK1 disrupted the CD40L-induced complex formation of p22phox with p47phox, p67phox, or Nox4. Blockade of TAK1 also inhibited CD40L-induced NF-kB activation by modulating IKKα/β and NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and this was related to reduced expression of proinflammatory genes (IL-6, MCP-1 and ICAM-1) in VSMCs. Lastly, treatment with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol attenuated neointimal formation in wire-injured femoral arteries. Our findings demonstrate previously uncharacterized roles of TAK1 in vascular oxidative stress and the contribution to neointima formation after vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2081098875,"Homer proteins are scaffold molecules with a domain structure consisting of an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 protein-binding domain and a C-terminal leucine zipper/coiled-coil domain. The Ena/VASP homology 1 domain recognizes proline-rich motifs and binds multiple Ca(2+)-signaling proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors, ryanodine receptors, and transient receptor potential channels. However, their role in Ca(2+) signaling in nonexcitable cells is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Homer2 on Ca(2+) signaling in parotid gland acinar cells using Homer2-deficient (Homer2(-/-)) mice. Homer2 is localized at the apical pole in acinar cells. Deletion of Homer2 did not affect inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor localization or channel activity and did not affect the expression and activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps. In contrast, Homer2 deletion markedly increased expression of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) pumps, in particular PMCA4, at the apical pole. Accordingly, Homer2 deficiency increased Ca(2+) extrusion by acinar cells. These findings were supported by co-immunoprecipitation of Homer2 and PMCA in wild-type parotid cells and transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. We identified a Homer-binding PPXXF-like motif in the N terminus of PMCA that is required for interaction with Homer2. Mutation of the PPXXF-like motif did not affect the interaction of PMCA with Homer1 but inhibited its interaction with Homer2 and increased Ca(2+) clearance by PMCA. These findings reveal an important regulation of PMCA by Homer2 that has a central role on PMCA-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in parotid acinar cells."

Mechanisms that ensure the fidelity and timing of DNA replication in proliferating cells are critical in the maintenance of genome integrity and the prevention of tumorigenesis. Central to these genome surveillance pathways is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, Chk1. 2The abbreviations used are: Chk1checkpoint kinase 1ATRataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-relatedMCMminichromosome maintenanceWCEwhole cell extractsIPimmunoprecipitationCo-IPco-immunoprecipitationHUhydroxyurea.

The major function of Chk1 is to relay the DNA damage signal from the upstream kinase ATR to various downstream effectors through its phosphorylation at two Ser residues, Ser-317 and Ser-345, by ATR (5.Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. ATR: an essential regulator of genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). As a result, activation of Chk1 will lead to cell cycle arrest or delay, gene transcription, damage repair, or cell death (1.Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int.

Recent studies suggest a spatiotemporal regulation model of Chk1, in which DNA damage induces ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 on chromatin followed by a rapid release of phospho-Chk1 from chromatin into soluble nucleus and the cytoplasm, where Chk1 activates the cell cycle checkpoints, as well as being degraded; the latter functions as an autoinhibitory mechanism to terminate the checkpoint signaling (6.Zhang Y.W. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y.C. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T. Genotoxic stress targets human Chk1 for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Mol.

However, a key question is how exactly does Chk1 associate with and disassociate from chromatin? The MCM complex is the core component of eukaryotic DNA replication machinery and has recently been indicated as an important player in replication checkpoint (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J.

Here we report that human Chk1 associates with the MCM complex in unperturbed cells. DNA damage reduces the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex. The MCM complex partially contributes to chromatin association and phosphorylation of Chk1. Further, Chk1 phosphorylation at ATR sites reduces the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex, facilitating chromatin release of phospho-Chk1, which likely will contribute to subsequent checkpoint activation.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2% NP-40) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated (HEAT Systems, output 3) for 15 s on ice, and supernatants were collected by centrifugation. Under certain circumstances, the supernatants were treated with 2 units of micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs) for 15 min at 37 °C or 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr), and antibodies were added (1 μg/1 mg lysates) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Then 40 μl of protein A/G beads were added and incubated for an additional 2 h.

The supernatant was a chromatin-enriched fraction. Proteins in these fractions were quantitated and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. U2-OS cells stably expressing FLAG-Chk1 were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Chk1-interacting proteins were isolated by FLAG M2 (Sigma) beads and eluted with 5 mg/ml 3×FLAG peptides in PBS. The eluate was first denatured in 8 m urea and then reduced and alkylated with 10 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (Roche Applied Science) and 55 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. The samples were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega) and pressure-loaded onto a 250-μm silica capillary columns (Polymicro Technologies).

Our latest research results showed that it is the nuclear, but not the cytoplasmic, pool of Chk1 that supports cell viability (13.Wang J. Han X. Feng X. Wang Z. Zhang Y.

To further understand the roles of Chk1 in cells, we sought to identify specific Chk1-interacting proteins in the nucleus. To this end, we generated a stable U2-OS cell line expressing FLAG-tagged human Chk1. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from the stable clone or the vector control were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads, eluted with 3×FLAG peptide, and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 1A). The results showed that peptides corresponding to Chk1 were only identified in the FLAG-Chk1-expressing cells, but not from control cells. Peptide recovery of Chk1 from the nuclear and the cytoplasmic IPs was 32 and 30%, respectively, indicating a successful isolation of Chk1 and likely its associating proteins. We were able to identify some known Chk1-interacting proteins (Cul4A, DDB1, and Skp1 (6.Zhang Y.W. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y.C. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T.

Among those proteins that were specifically identified from the nuclear Chk1 IP, the MCM complex appears to be most interesting to us due to its known roles in DNA replication and replication checkpoint. Further, all six components of the MCM complex (MCM2–7) were present exclusively in the nuclear, but not in the cytoplasmic, Chk1 IP with relatively high peptide sequence coverage (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this is not a nonspecific interaction with Chk1. To confirm the mass spectrometry results, we performed Co-IP to determine the interaction between Chk1 and MCM proteins in cells. To do so, we overexpressed tagged Chk1 and each MCM protein in HEK293T cells. The results showed that overexpressed Chk1 interacted with all MCM proteins (Fig. 1, C–H). During IP, we sonicated the cell lysates and treated samples with micrococcal nuclease. This indicates that the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex is DNA-independent. To further confirm this idea, we performed Co-IP between Myc-Chk1 and HA-MCM7 (as an example of the MCM complex) by adding EtBr in the cell lysate to eliminate the impact of DNA on the Chk1/MCM interaction. The results showed that the presence of EtBr during Co-IP did not affect the interaction between Chk1 and MCM7 (Fig. 2A), supporting the notion that Chk1 interacts with MCM proteins independently of DNA. In our hands, the levels of overexpressed MCM proteins were 2–3-fold of that of endogenous proteins (data not shown). Further, we also detected interaction between endogenous Chk1 and endogenous MCM proteins (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Chk1 associates with the MCM complex in unperturbed cells. To understand whether Chk1 can directly interact with the MCM complex, we used GST-Chk1 bound on glutathione-agarose beads to pull down MCM proteins individually produced through in vitro transcription and translation. We detected an interaction between Chk1 and MCM2, MCM6, and MCM7, but not MCM3, MCM4, or MCM5 in vitro (Fig. 2B), indicating a multi-interface association between Chk1 and the MCM complex. Subsequently, we asked whether DNA damage would affect the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex. To do so, we transfected HEK293T cells with Myc-Chk1, treated or not with a replicative stress agent, hydroxyurea (HU), and examined the interaction between Myc-Chk1 and endogenous MCM proteins. Because the six MCM proteins form a stable complex in cells, we reasoned that detection of two components (e.g. MCM2 and MCM7) suffices to indicate the presence of the entire MCM complex. Our results showed that the interaction between overexpressed Chk1 and endogenous MCM2 or MCM7 is reduced by HU treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). We also show that the interaction between endogenous Chk1 and MCM proteins was reduced by another replicative stress, camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 4). The MCM complex, together with Cdc45 and the GINS (5-1-2-3) complex, form the CMG DNA helicase for DNA replication (23.Forsburg S.L. The MCM helicase: linking checkpoints to the replication fork.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24.Tye B.K. Sawyer S. The hexameric eukaryotic MCM helicase: building symmetry from nonidentical parts.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34833-34836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If Chk1 forms a protein complex with MCMs, it should also associate with Cdc45 and the GINS complex in cells. Our Co-IP data show that indeed Chk1 formed a complex with both Cdc45 (Fig. 2E) and GINS1, a component of the GINS complex (Fig. 2F), supporting the idea that Chk1 associates with the entire CMG complex in cells. Importantly, the interaction between Chk1 and Cdc45 or the GINS complex was also reduced by replicative stress treatment (Fig. 2, E and F). These data suggest that replicative stress reduces the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex, as well as Cdc45 and the GINS complex. To determine which region of Chk1 interacts with the MCM complex, we transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-MCM2 and Myc-tagged full-length Chk1 (FL), the N-terminal catalytic domain (N), or the C-terminal regulatory domain (C) (Fig. 3A), immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies. We readily detected interaction between FLAG-MCM2 and full-length Myc-Chk1, N-terminal catalytic domain mutant, or C-terminal regulatory domain mutant (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with the in vitro pulldown results (Fig. 2B), reinforcing the idea of a multi-interface association between Chk1 and the MCM complex. Although the C terminus displayed stronger interaction with FLAG-MCM2 than the full-length Chk1, its interaction with endogenous MCM7 is nearly the same (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). These results indicate that the C terminus might have higher affinity or adopt a conformation that enhanced its interaction with MCM2, but not MCM7. Nevertheless, the C terminus showed stronger interaction with MCMs than the N terminus, indicating that the C terminus contributes mainly to the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex. The C terminus of Chk1 contains two highly conserved motifs (CM1 and CM2)(Fig. 3A), which regulate the cellular localization of Chk1 (13.Wang J. Han X. Feng X. Wang Z. Zhang Y.

Chem. 2012; 287: 25501-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutating two residues (G446N and F380D) in these motifs not only led to cytoplasmic localization but also increased protein instability of Chk1 (13.Wang J. Han X. Feng X. Wang Z. Zhang Y.

Chem. 2012; 287: 25501-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To understand whether these mutants affect the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex, we transfected FLAG-MCM2, Myc-Chk1 WT, S317A, S345A, G446N, or F380D mutant in HEK293T cells separately. We collected FLAG-MCM2 on the FLAG M2-agarose beads and used the beads to pull down equal amounts of Myc-Chk1 WT or mutant proteins from the lysate. By doing so, we can avoid the cellular localization and protein instability issues of these two mutants. The results showed that indeed the G446N and F380D mutants displayed reduced interaction with MCM2 as compared with the Chk1 WT (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 5, and 6), suggesting that these two residues might be important for the Chk1/MCM interaction. Interestingly, mutating Ser-345, the key ATR phosphorylation site for full activation of Chk1 (25.Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), to Ala did not affect the interaction of Chk1 with MCMs (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that phosphorylation at ATR site is not required for the interaction of Chk1 with the MCM complex. Research results from this group and others suggest that a substantial portion of Chk1 (∼30–50% depending on the cell type) is located on chromatin in the absence of DNA damage (6.Zhang Y.W. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y.C. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T. Genotoxic stress targets human Chk1 for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19.Smits V.A. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Rapid PIKK-dependent release of Chk1 from chromatin promotes the DNA-damage checkpoint response.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 150-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Chromatin association of Chk1 is critical for checkpoint activation because it allows the rapid phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR in response to DNA damage or replicative stress. However, how exactly Chk1 is recruited to chromatin remains unclear as Chk1 itself does not directly bind to chromatin (1.Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Known Chk1-interacting proteins, including Claspin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, do not seem to recruit Chk1 onto chromatin because depletion of these two genes did not reduce the level of Chk1 associated on chromatin (21.Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Claspin, a novel protein required for the activation of Chk1 during a DNA replication checkpoint response in Xenopus egg extracts.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22.Scorah J. Dong M.Q. Yates 3rd, J.R. Scott M. Gillespie D. McGowan C.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our data showed that Chk1 interacts with the MCM complex and that this interaction is reduced by DNA damage. This led us to ask whether the MCM complex plays a role in the recruitment of Chk1 to chromatin. To address this question, we used lentivirus-based shRNA targeting human MCM2 or MCM7 to inhibit expression of the MCM complex and determined expression of Chk1 in chromatin versus non-chromatin compartments. Despite a partial knockdown of MCMs (ranging from ∼40 to 60% likely due to technical limitations including the efficacy of the shRNA and the essentiality of MCMs in cell viability), we repeatedly observed a clear reduction in the level of Chk1 on chromatin with a concomitant increase of Chk1 in the non-chromatin fraction (Fig. 4, A and B). This is unlikely due to cell cycle arrest or changes in total Chk1 levels by MCM depletion. First, depletion of MCM2 or MCM7 only had minimal effect on cell cycle profile (Fig. 4C), similar to results reported in HeLa and Drosophila cells (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of the MCM complex did not change the total cellular level of Chk1 (Figs. 4A and 5A). Third, when we used synchronized cell populations (e.g. cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary or in S phase), the level of Chk1 on chromatin fraction was still reduced in MCM-depleted cells as compared with control cells (similar data as in Fig. 4B, not shown). Together, these data suggest that the MCM complex, at least partially, contributes to the chromatin association of Chk1.FIGURE 5.Phosphorylation of Chk1 at ATR sites reduces its interaction with the MCM complex. A, A549 cells were infected with control or increasing doses of shMCM2 lentiviral particles for 3 days, treated with 2 mm HU for 4 h, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. shMCM2 alone does not induce Chk1 phosphorylation. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-MCM2 and GFP-Chk1 WT, G448D, L449R, or L449R/S345A mutant for 48 h, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-p-Ser-345 antibody of Chk1.

C, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-Chk1 WT or L449R for 48 h. Around 15% of cells were lysed as WCE, while the remaining cells were fractionated into chromatin versus non-chromatin fractions, and expression of phospho-Chk1 (pChk1) was examined. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-Chk1 antibodies. Note that endogenous Chk1 proteins behaved nearly equally in GFP-Chk1 WT or L449R mutant cells. D, proposed model. The question mark represents other putative factors that might also facilitate Chk1 chromatin association. The dashed arrow indicates checkpoint activation after Chk1 phosphorylation. See “Results” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because chromatin association is important for Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR in response to DNA damage, we asked whether depletion of MCMs could reduce Chk1 phosphorylation by DNA damage because fewer Chk1 proteins are recruited to chromatin. We showed that this is indeed the case as depletion of MCM2 dose-dependently reduced Chk1 phosphorylation by HU (Fig. 5A). We noticed that depletion of MCM2 by shRNA also reduced the expression of MCM7 (Fig. 5A). This is probably because inhibiting the expression of one member of the MCM complex to a certain level results in the instability of the entire complex (26.Ibarra A. Schwob E. Méndez J. Excess MCM proteins protect human cells from replicative stress by licensing backup origins of replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8956-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Following its phosphorylation, Chk1 will be rapidly released from chromatin into soluble nucleus (1.Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Based on the findings presented above, we speculate that phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR reduces its association with the MCM complex, leading to the release of Chk1 from chromatin. The observations that DNA damage reduced the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex (Fig. 2) and that the Chk1 S345A mutant showed a stronger interaction with MCMs than the Chk1 WT (Fig. 3C) support this hypothesis. To address this issue, we took advantage of two constitutively active Chk1 mutants (G448D and L449R) that we previously identified, which undergo constitutive phosphorylation at ATR sites even in the absence of DNA damage (25.Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We predict that these two mutants would barely interact with the MCM complex because the majority of them are in the phosphorylated form (25.Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We transfected FLAG-MCM2 and GFP-Chk1 WT, G448D, or L449R mutant into HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Ser-345-Chk1 antibodies. As reported previously (25.Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the G448D and L449R mutants, but not Chk1 WT, were phosphorylated at ATR sites under normal growth condition (Fig. 5B, the anti-phospho-Chk1 blot from whole cell extracts (WCE), lanes 3 and 5). Mutating the Ser-345 to Ala completely abolished the phospho-signal in the L449R mutant (Fig. 5B, the anti-phospho-Chk1 blot from WCE, lane 4). However, we did not detect any phospho-Chk1 from FLAG-MCM2 IP (Fig. 5B, the anti-phospho-Chk1 blot from IP). The same membrane was stripped and reblotted with anti-GFP antibodies. The results show that although the two Chk1 mutants were expressed at comparable levels with the WT (Fig. 5B, the anti-GFP blot from WCE), only the Chk1 WT, but not the two mutants, was detected from the FLAG-MCM2 IP (Fig. 5B, the anti-GFP blot from IP, lanes 2, 3, and 5). Because G446N impaired the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex (Fig. 3C), the reduced interaction between L449R or G448D and MCMs might be due to changes of the same CM2 domain caused by the L449R or G448D mutation, but not due to Ser-345 phosphorylation of these two mutants. To address this issue, we examined the interaction of the Chk1 L449R/S345A double mutant with MCMs. The results showed that S345A mutation restored the interaction between Chk1 L449R and the MCM complex (Fig. 5B, the anti-GFP blot from IP, lanes 3 and 4). These results, together with our previous data that L449R did not induce cytoplasmic shuttling of Chk1 (13.Wang J. Han X. Feng X. Wang Z. Zhang Y. Coupling cellular localization and function of checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) in checkpoints and cell viability.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25501-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggest that the L449R mutation per se does not affect its interaction with MCMs, supporting the idea that phosphorylation at ATR sites of Chk1 reduces the interaction between Chk1 and MCMs. If our hypothesis were true, we would predict that chromatin association of the Chk1 L449R mutant would be significantly reduced as compared with the Chk1 WT. Our data show that indeed the majority of the L449R mutant of Chk1 is in the non-chromatin cellular compartment (Fig. 5C). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of Chk1 at ATR sites inhibits its interaction with the MCM complex, contributing to chromatin release of phospho-Chk1 after DNA damage treatment. In this study we provide evidence for a novel interaction between Chk1 and the core component of DNA helicase, the MCM complex. We show that this interaction is important for chromatin association of Chk1, a critical step for the initiation of cell cycle checkpoint. Further, we propose that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 reduces its interaction with the MCM complex, facilitating the rapid release of phospho-Chk1 from chromatin into soluble nucleus. These results illustrate a model that sheds significant light on DNA damage-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, and likely subsequent checkpoint activation (Fig. 5D). Chk1 is a key checkpoint mediator whose phosphorylation is critical for cellular response to DNA damage or replicative stress, and ultimately, cell survival. ATR, the predominant kinase that phosphorylates Chk1 in cells (27.Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. Taking the time to make important decisions: the checkpoint effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and the DNA damage response.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), mainly localizes on chromatin (6.Zhang Y.W. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y.C. Mercurio F. Abraham R.T. Genotoxic stress targets human Chk1 for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, chromatin association is essential for Chk1 phosphorylation and the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints. Here we show that the MCM complex facilitated chromatin association of Chk1 and contributed to Chk1 phosphorylation. We only observed a partial chromatin release of Chk1 when the MCM expression was inhibited by shRNA. This could be due to the incomplete depletion of the MCM complex. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that other proteins also participate in the association of Chk1 with chromosomal DNA. Nevertheless, our data clearly illustrated an important role of the MCM complex in chromatin association and DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Chk1. Previously, it was reported that knockdown of MCM7 inhibited replication stress-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our observation. However, depletion of MCM7 did not affect ionizing radiation-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Several possibilities could lead to this discrepancy. (a) The first one may be related to different knockdown effects of MCMs between published literature (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and our study. In our hands, the lentiviral shMCM2 significantly reduced the levels of both MCM2 and MCM7 proteins, suggesting the inhibition of the entire MCM complex. On the other hand, in the previous study, the specific siRNA against MCM7 barely reduced the level of MCM2 although MCM7 was significantly reduced (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the remaining MCM7 was sufficient to form functional MCM complex that can still facilitate chromatin association of Chk1, which resulted in the lack of inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation by ionizing radiation in that particular experiment. (b) As mentioned above, other factors might also contribute to the chromatin association and retention of Chk1 (Fig. 5D, question mark). This may become an issue especially when different types of DNA damage agents are used as they activate checkpoint and Chk1 phosphorylation (initiation and maintenance) through slightly different mechanisms. This might be exacerbated when different cell lines are used (the epithelial A549 line in our hands versus the osteoblast U2-OS in the previous study (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)). (c) As stated in the previous study (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), each subunit of the MCM complex may have unique functions that are not fully understood yet. Therefore, knockdown of different MCM proteins might display different phenotype. Interestingly, the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex is reduced by DNA damage. This is in line with the notion that Chk1 undergoes chromatin release after DNA damage (1.Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that phosphorylation of Chk1 at ATR sites likely reduces its binding with the MCM complex, leading to its fall off from the chromatin (Fig. 5D). Consistent with this model, we showed that DNA damage-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at ATR sites was reduced in a manner dependent on the expression level of the MCM complex. Further, mutating the ATR phosphorylation site of Chk1 slightly increased the interaction between Chk1 and the MCM complex. Most importantly, Chk1 phosphorylated at ATR sites failed to interact with MCMs. Previously, the MCM complex was reported to be required for Chk1 phosphorylation due to its role in the activation of replication checkpoints (7.Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 9.Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T. Interaction between human MCM7 and Rad17 proteins is required for replication checkpoint signaling.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our data add a novel mechanism by which the MCM complex regulates Chk1 phosphorylation through recruiting Chk1 onto chromatin."

This perceptual peculiarity may influence the way in which bottom-up and top-down processes interact and, consequently, the perception and evaluation of art. This study is aimed at investigating, by means of the eye-tracking technique, the visual explorative behavior of adolescents while looking at paintings. Sixteen color paintings, categorized as dynamic and static, were presented to twenty adolescents; half of the images represented natural environments and half human individuals; all stimuli were displayed under aesthetic and movement judgment tasks. Participants' ratings revealed that, generally, nature images are explicitly evaluated as more appealing than human images. Eye movement data, on the other hand, showed that the human body exerts a strong power in orienting and attracting visual attention and that, in adolescence, it plays a fundamental role during aesthetic experience. In particular, adolescents seem to approach human-content images by giving priority to elements calling forth movement and action, supporting the embodiment theory of aesthetic perception."
https://openalex.org/W2044346844,"The essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), leucine, valine and isoleucine, are traditionally associated with skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, energy production, and generation of neurotransmitter and gluconeogenic precursors. Recent evidence from human and animal model studies has established an additional link between BCAA levels and obesity. However, details of the mechanism of regulation of BCAA metabolism during adipogenesis are largely unknown. We interrogated whether the expression of genes and proteins involved in BCAA metabolism are sensitive to the adipocyte differentiation process, and responsive to nutrient stress from starvation or BCAA excess. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes under control conditions and under conditions of L-leucine supplementation or serum withdrawal. RNA and proteins were isolated at days 0, 4 and 10 of differentiation to represent pre-differentiation, early differentiation and late differentiation stages. Expression of 16 BCAA metabolism genes was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of the protein levels of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2 (Bcat2) and branched-chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase (Bckdha) was quantified by immunoblotting. Under control conditions, all genes displayed induction of gene expression during early adipogenesis (Day 4) compared to Day 0. Leucine supplementation resulted in an induction of Bcat2 and Bckdha genes during early and late differentiation. Western blot analysis demonstrated condition-specific concordance between gene and protein expression. Serum withdrawal resulted in undetectable Bcat2 and Bckdha protein levels at all timepoints. These results demonstrate that the expression of genes related to BCAA metabolism are regulated during adipocyte differentiation and influenced by nutrient levels. These results provide additional insights on how BCAA metabolism is associated with adipose tissue function and extends our understanding of the transcriptomic response of this pathway to variations in nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2041457343,"Recent experimental work in lung morphogenesis has described an elegant pattern of branching phenomena. Two primary forms of branching have been identified: side branching and tip splitting. In our previous study of lung branching morphogenesis, we used a 4 variable partial differential equation (PDE), due to Meinhardt, as our mathematical model to describe the reaction and diffusion of morphogens creating those branched patterns. By altering key parameters in the model, we were able to reproduce all the branching styles and the switch between branching modes. Here, we attempt to explain the branching phenomena described above, as growing out of two fundamental instabilities, one in the longitudinal (growth) direction and the other in the transverse direction. We begin by decoupling the original branching process into two semi-independent sub-processes, 1) a classic activator/inhibitor system along the growing stalk, and 2) the spatial growth of the stalk. We then reduced the full branching model into an activator/inhibitor model that embeds growth of the stalk as a controllable parameter, to explore the mechanisms that determine different branching patterns. We found that, in this model, 1) side branching results from a pattern-formation instability of the activator/inhibitor subsystem in the longitudinal direction. This instability is far from equilibrium, requiring a large inhomogeneity in the initial conditions. It successively creates periodic activator peaks along the growing stalk, each of which later on migrates out and forms a side branch; 2) tip splitting is due to a Turing-style instability along the transversal direction, that creates the spatial splitting of the activator peak into 2 simultaneously-formed peaks at the growing tip, the occurrence of which requires the widening of the growing stalk. Tip splitting is abolished when transversal stalk widening is prevented; 3) when both instabilities are satisfied, tip bifurcation occurs together with side branching."

Distinct central nervous system regions retain the capacity to generate new neurons and glia from an endogenous pool of progenitor cells and to compensate neural cell loss following certain lesions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous cell replacement (neurogenesis or gliogenesis) in the brain (subventricular zone, SVZ; corpus callosum, CC; hippocampus, HC; and motor cortex, MC) or cervical spinal cord might represent a structural correlate for spontaneous locomotor recovery after a thoracic spinal cord injury. Adult Fischer 344 rats received severe contusion injuries (200 kDyn) of the mid-thoracic spinal cord using an Infinite Horizon Impactor. Uninjured rats served as controls. From 4 to 14 days post-injury, both groups received injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells. Over the course of six weeks post-injury, spontaneous recovery of locomotor function occurred. Survival of newly generated cells was unaltered in the SVZ, HC, CC, and the MC. Neurogenesis, as determined by identification and quantification of doublecortin immunoreactive neuroblasts or BrdU/neuronal nuclear antigen double positive newly generated neurons, was not present in non-neurogenic regions (MC, CC, and cervical spinal cord) and unaltered in neurogenic regions (dentate gyrus and SVZ) of the brain. The lack of neuronal replacement in the brain and spinal cord after spinal cord injury precludes any relevance for spontaneous recovery of locomotor function. Gliogenesis was increased in the cervical spinal cord remote from the injury site, however, is unlikely to contribute to functional improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2082506071,"The memory B-cell (MBC) ELISpot assay is the main technique used to measure antigen-specific MBCs as a readout of humoral immune memory. This assay relies on the ability of MBCs to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASC) upon polyclonal stimulation. The total number of IgG+ ASCs generated by mitogen-stimulation is often used as a reference point; alternatively antigen-specific MBCs are expressed as a frequency of post-culture peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as a surrogate for absolute frequencies. Therefore, it is important to know whether IgG+ B-cells are uniformly expanded during the preceding mitogen-culture as a true reflection of MBC frequencies ex vivo. We systematically compared B-cell phenotype and proportions before and after mitogen stimulation in cultures of 269 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 62 volunteers by flow cytometry and analyzed the number of resulting ASCs. Our data show that the number of total IgG+ ASCs detected by ELISpot after mitogen stimulation correlates with the proportion of IgG+ MBCs ex vivo, highlighting its general robustness for comparisons of study cohorts at group level. The expansion of total and IgG+ B-cells during mitogen-stimulation, however, was not identical in all cultures, but influenced by size and composition of the ex vivo B-cell compartment. The uncorrected readout of antigen-specific MBCs per million post-culture PBMCs therefore only preserves the quality, but not the magnitude of differences in the ex vivo MBC response between groups or time points, particularly when comparing samples where the B-cell compartment substantially differs between cohorts or over time. Therefore, expressing antigen-specific cells per total IgG+ ASCs is currently the best measure to correct for mitogen-culture effects. Additionally, baseline information on the size and composition of the ex vivo B-cell compartment should be supplied to additionally inform about differences or changes in the size and composition of the ex vivo MBC compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2083757654,"Lymph node metastasis indicates poor prognosis in esophageal cancer. To understand the underlying mechanisms, most studies so far focused on investigating the tumors themselves and/or invaded lymph nodes. However they neglected the potential events within the metastatic niche, which precede invasion. Here we report the first description of these regulations in patients on transcription level. We determined transcriptomic profiles of still metastasis-free regional lymph nodes for two patient groups: patients classified as pN1 (n = 9, metastatic nodes exist) or pN0 (n = 5, no metastatic nodes exist). All investigated lymph nodes, also those from pN1 patients, were still metastasis-free. The results show that regional lymph nodes of pN1 patients differ decisively from those of pN0 patients--even before metastasis has taken place. In the pN0 group distinct immune response patterns were observed. In contrast, lymph nodes of the pN1 group exhibited a clear profile of reduced immune response and reduced proliferation, but increased apoptosis, enhanced hypoplasia and morphological conversion processes. DKK1 was the most significant gene associated with the molecular mechanisms taking place in lymph nodes of patients suffering from metastasis (pN1). We assume that the two molecular profiles observed constitute different stages of a progressive disease. Finally we suggest that DKK1 might play an important role within the mechanisms leading to lymph node metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969165613,"CNN3 is an ubiquitously expressed F-actin binding protein, shown to regulate trophoblast fusion and hence seems to play a role in the placentation process. In this study we demonstrate that CNN3 levels are upregulated under low oxygen conditions in the trophoblast cell line BeWo. Since hypoxia is discussed to be a pro-migratory stimulus for placental cells, we examined if CNN3 is involved in trophoblast invasion. Indeed, when performing a matrigel invasion assay we were able to show that CNN3 promotes BeWo cell invasion. Moreover, CNN3 activates the MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 in trophoblast cells and interestingly, both kinases are involved in BeWo invasion. However, when we repeated the experiments under hypoxic conditions, CNN3 did neither promote cell invasion nor MAPK activation. These results indicate that CNN3 promotes invasive processes by the stimulation of ERK1/2 and/or p38 under normoxic conditions in BeWo cells, but seems to have different functions at low oxygen levels. We further speculated that CNN3 expression might be altered in human placentas derived from pregnancies complicated by IUGR and preeclampsia, since these placental disorders have been described to go along with impaired trophoblast invasion. Our studies show that, at least in our set of placenta samples, CNN3 expression is neither deregulated in IUGR nor in preeclampsia. In summary, we identified CNN3 as a new pro-invasive protein in trophoblast cells that is induced under low oxygen conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2019771910,"Many cost-benefit decisions reduce to simple choices between approach or avoidance (or active disregard) to salient stimuli. Physiologically, critical factors in such decisions are modulators of the homeostatic neural networks that bias decision processes from moment to moment. For the predatory sea-slug Pleurobranchaea, serotonin (5-HT) is an intrinsic modulatory promoter of general arousal and feeding. We correlated 5-HT actions on appetitive state with its effects on the approach-avoidance decision in Pleurobranchaea. 5-HT and its precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) augmented general arousal state and reduced feeding thresholds in intact animals. Moreover, 5-HT switched the turn response to chemosensory stimulation from avoidance to orienting in many animals. In isolated CNSs, bath application of 5-HT both stimulated activity in the feeding motor network and switched the fictive turn response to unilateral sensory nerve stimulation from avoidance to orienting. Previously, it was shown that increasing excitation state of the feeding network reversibly switched the turn motor network response from avoidance to orienting, and that 5-HT levels vary inversely with nutritional state. A simple model posits a critical role for 5-HT in control of the turn network response by corollary output of the feeding network. In it, 5-HT acts as an intrinsic neuromodulatory factor coupled to nutritional status and regulates approach-avoidance via the excitation state of the feeding network. Thus, the neuromodulator is a key organizing element in behavioral choice of approach or avoidance through its actions in promoting appetitive state, in large part via the homeostatic feeding network."
https://openalex.org/W2108333546,"Leukemia is the most common pediatric malignancy, constituting more than 30% of all childhood cancers. Although cure rates have improved greatly, approximately one in five children relapse and poor survival rates post relapse remain a challenge. Given this, more effective and innovative therapeutic strategies are needed in order to improve prognosis. Aurora kinases, a family of serine/threonine kinases essential for the regulation of several mitotic processes, have been identified as potential targets for cancer therapeutics. Elevated expression of Aurora kinases has been demonstrated in several malignancies and is associated with aberrant mitotic activity, aneuploidy and alterations in chromosomal structure and genome instability. Based on this rationale, a number of small molecule inhibitors have been formulated and advanced to human studies in the recent past. A comparative analysis of these agents in cytotoxicity and target modulation analyses against a panel of leukemia cells provides novel insights into the unique mechanisms and codependent activity pathways involved in targeting Aurora kinases, constituting a distinctive preclinical experimental framework to identify appropriate agents and combinations in future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1977569442,"The mechanisms by which the expression of animal cell death suppressors in economically important plants conferred enhanced stress tolerance are not fully understood. In the present work, the effect of expression of animal antiapoptotic gene Ced-9 in soybean hairy roots was evaluated under root hairs and hairy roots death-inducing stress conditions given by i) Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculation in presence of 50 mM NaCl, and ii) severe salt stress (150 mM NaCl), for 30 min and 3 h, respectively. We have determined that root hairs death induced by inoculation in presence of 50 mM NaCl showed characteristics of ordered process, with increased ROS generation, MDA and ATP levels, whereas the cell death induced by 150 mM NaCl treatment showed non-ordered or necrotic-like characteristics. The expression of Ced-9 inhibited or at least delayed root hairs death under these treatments. Hairy roots expressing Ced-9 had better homeostasis maintenance, preventing potassium release; increasing the ATP levels and controlling the oxidative damage avoiding the increase of reactive oxygen species production. Even when our results demonstrate a positive effect of animal cell death suppressors in plant cell ionic and redox homeostasis under cell death-inducing conditions, its expression, contrary to expectations, drastically inhibited nodule formation even under control conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1990265292,"The retinoblastoma (RB) family transcriptional corepressors regulate diverse cellular events including cell cycle, senescence, and differentiation. The activity and stability of these proteins are mediated by post-translational modifications; however, we lack a general understanding of how distinct modifications coordinately impact both of these properties. Previously, we showed that protein turnover and activity are tightly linked through an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal instability element (IE) in the Drosophila RB-related protein Rbf1; surprisingly, mutant proteins with enhanced stability were less, not more active. To better understand how activity and turnover are controlled in this model RB protein, we assessed the impact of Cyclin-Cdk kinase regulation on Rbf1. An evolutionarily conserved N-terminal threonine residue is required for Cyclin-Cdk response and showed a dominant impact on turnover and activity; however, specific residues in the C-terminal IE differentially impacted Rbf1 activity and turnover, indicating an additional level of regulation. Strikingly, specific IE mutations that impaired turnover but not activity induced dramatic developmental phenotypes in the Drosophila eye. Mutation of the highly conserved Lys-774 residue induced hypermorphic phenotypes that mimicked the loss of phosphorylation control; mutation of the corresponding codon of the human RBL2 gene has been reported in lung tumors. Our data support a model in which closely intermingled residues within the conserved IE govern protein turnover, presumably through interactions with E3 ligases, and protein activity via contacts with E2F transcription partners. Such functional relationships are likely to similarly impact mammalian RB family proteins, with important implications for development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2028582371,"The diarrhea associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a major cause of acute uremic failure in children, but not very common in adults. The enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli-epidemic in Germany in 2011 affected mostly young and healthy adults. While their immediate deficits have been published, not much is known about the time course and degree of recovery concerning cognitive and behavioral impairment.Twenty patients with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection and neurological symptoms underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment 3 months and 1 year after the acute disease. Overall, there was an excellent recovery of cognitive functions. In a detailed neuropsychological analysis no significant deficits could be noticed 1 year after the infection in terms of cognitive function, alertness, executive functions and speech. Interestingly there were no correlations between different indicators for severity of disease (hemoglobin and creatinine levels, days of hospitalization, neurological symptoms and MRI changes) and neuropsychological outcome. However, there were a small number of patients with limitations in every day and professional life even one year after the acute disease.Our study does not provide definitive answers regarding risk factors for these limitations. Still since Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli infection is a rare condition in adults, the information this study provides is important for the clinical practice. On one hand for consulting patients and on the other to raise the awareness of the physicians to possible long term complains and the consideration of neuropsychological assessment and supportive psychological treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2055118444,"Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is one of the main complications after hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CAMPATH-1H is used in the pre-transplant conditioning regimen to effectively reduce GvHD by targeting CD52 antigens on T cells resulting in their depletion. Information regarding CD52 expression and the effects of CAMPATH-1H on immune cells is scant and limited to peripheral blood (PB) T and B cells. To date, the effects of CAMPATH-1H on cord blood (CB) cells has not been studied. Here we aimed to analyze CD52 expression and the effects of CAMPATH-1H on fresh or frozen, resting or activated, PB mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CB mononuclear cells (CBMC). In resting state, CD52 expression was higher in CB than PB T cell subsets (653.66 ± 26.68 vs 453.32 ± 19.2) and B cells (622.2±20.65 vs 612.0 ± 9.101) except for natural killer (NK) cells where CD52 levels were higher in PB (421.0 ± 9.857) than CB (334.3 ± 9.559). In contrast, CD52 levels were comparable across all cell types after activation. CAMPATH-1H depleted resting cells more effectively than activated cells with approximately 80-95% of apoptosis observed with low levels of necrosis. There was no direct correlation between cell surface CD52 density and depleting effects of CAMPATH-1H. In addition, no difference in cell viability was noted when different concentrations of CAMPATH-1H were used. CD52 was not expressed on HSC but began to be expressed as the cells differentiate, implying that CAMPATH-1H could potentially affect HSC differentiation and proliferation. Our study provides insightful information, which contributes to the better understanding in the use of CAMPATH-1H as part of the conditioning regime in HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W1981819670,"The zinc finger protein A20 is an important negative regulator of inflammation; polymorphisms in the corresponding gene, TNFAIP3, have been reported to be associated with several inflammation diseases. However, only a few studies have focused on the relationship between TNFAIP3 polymorphisms and acute pancreatitis (AP).We enrolled 201 healthy controls and 190 acute pancreatitis patients (including 47 systemic inflammatory response syndrome patients) for this study and used DNA sequencing to investigate polymorphisms in the TNFAIP3 promoter. The functional effects of these variants on transcriptional activity, A20 expression, NF-κB activity, and TNF-α and IL-1β levels, after in vitro lipopolysaccharide stimulation, were assessed.Two SNPs (rs59693083 and rs5029924) in the TNFAIP3 promoter were selected based on bioinformatic analysis. Neither of these SNPs was associated with susceptibility to AP; however, acute pancreatitis patients who possessed the T allele of rs5029924 were more likely to experience systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Moreover, rs5029924 was found to affect TNFAIP3 promoter activity. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the expression of A20 protein significantly decreased, while the activity of NF-κB and the production of TNF-α and IL-1β significantly increased in whole blood leukocytes from subjects with the T allele.The rs5029924 polymorphism in the TNFAIP3 promoter may alter the risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in acute pancreatitis patients by influencing the expression of A20 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2083725991,"Community respiration (CR) of organic material to carbon dioxide plays a fundamental role in ecosystems and ocean biogeochemical cycles, as it dictates the amount of production available to higher trophic levels and for export to the deep ocean. Yet how CR varies across large oceanographic gradients is not well-known: CR is measured infrequently and cannot be easily sensed from space. We used continuous oxygen measurements collected by autonomous gliders to quantify surface CR rates across the Pacific Ocean. CR rates were calculated from changes in apparent oxygen utilization and six different estimates of oxygen flux based on wind speed. CR showed substantial spatial variation: rates were lowest in ocean gyres (mean of 6.93 mmol m(-3) d(-1)±8.0 mmol m(-3) d(-1) standard deviation in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre) and were more rapid and more variable near the equator (8.69 mmol m(-3) d(-1)±7.32 mmol m(-3) d(-1) between 10°N and 10°S) and near shore (e.g., 5.62 mmol m(-3) d(-1)±45.6 mmol m(-3) d(-1) between the coast of California and 124°W, and 17.0 mmol m(-3) d(-1)±13.9 mmol m(-3) d(-1) between 156°E and the Australian coast). We examined how CR varied with coincident measurements of temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentrations (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), and found that CR was weakly related to different explanatory variables across the Pacific, but more strongly related to particular variables in different biogeographical areas. Our results indicate that CR is not a simple linear function of chlorophyll or temperature, and that at the scale of the Pacific, the coupling between primary production, ocean warming, and CR is complex and variable. We suggest that this stems from substantial spatial variation in CR captured by high-resolution autonomous measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2051436356,"Structural genetic variants as short tandem repeats (STRs) are not targeted in SNP-based association studies and thus, their possible association signals are missed. We systematically searched for STRs in gene regions known to contribute to total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in two independent studies (KORA F4, n = 2553 and SAPHIR, n = 1648), resulting in 16 STRs that were finally evaluated. In a combined dataset of both studies, the sum of STR alleles was regressed on each phenotype, adjusted for age and sex. The association analyses were repeated for SNPs in a 200 kb region surrounding the respective STRs in the KORA F4 Study. Three STRs were significantly associated with total cholesterol (within LDLR, the APOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13 gene region and ABCG5/8), five with HDL cholesterol (3 within CETP, one in LPL and one inAPOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13), three with LDL cholesterol (LDLR, ABCG5/8 and CETP) and two with triglycerides (APOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13 and LPL). None of the investigated STRs, however, showed a significant association after adjusting for the lead or adjacent SNPs within that gene region. The evaluated STRs were found to be well tagged by the lead SNP within the respective gene regions. Therefore, the STRs reflect the association signals based on surrounding SNPs. In conclusion, none of the STRs contributed additionally to the SNP-based association signals identified in GWAS on lipid traits."
https://openalex.org/W2080584975,"Background Noradrenergic pathways and glucocorticoid-mediated signal pathways have been implicated in the growth and progression of oral cancer. Patients with oral neoplasms can have high psychological distress levels, but the effects of stress-related hormones on oral neoplasm growth are unknown. Methods We have investigated the relationships between pre-surgical measurements of psychological problems with Symptom Checklist-90-revised Inventory (SCL90-R), tumor histology, circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels among 75 oral neoplasm patients, including 40 oral cancer patients and 35 benign oral tumor patients. Results The results showed that most dimension scores of SCL90-R did not show a significant difference between the two groups except depression (p = 0.0201) and obsessive-compulsion (p = 0.0093), with the scores for these symptoms being higher among oral cancer group versus the benign oral tumor group. The differences of total score, average score and other monomial factor scores were not statistically significant. The mean concentrations of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in peripheral blood of the oral cancer group were higher than those in benign oral tumor group (p<0.01). We also examined whether associations observed between biobehavioral measures and circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels extended to other compartments in the oral cancer group. Conclusions These findings suggest that stress hormones may affect oral cancer behavior by influencing the tumor micro-environment though the circulating blood."
https://openalex.org/W2059755169,"Vicarious trial-and-error (VTE) is a behavior observed in rat experiments that seems to suggest self-conflict. This behavior is seen mainly when the rats are uncertain about making a decision. The presence of VTE is regarded as an indicator of a deliberative decision-making process, that is, searching, predicting, and evaluating outcomes. This process is slower than automated decision-making processes, such as reflex or habituation, but it allows for flexible and ongoing control of behavior. In this study, we propose for the first time a robotic model of VTE to see if VTE can emerge just from a body-environment interaction and to show the underlying mechanism responsible for the observation of VTE and the advantages provided by it. We tried several robots with different parameters, and we have found that they showed three different types of VTE: high numbers of VTE at the beginning of learning, decreasing numbers afterward (similar VTE pattern to experiments with rats), low during the whole learning period, and high numbers all the time. Therefore, we were able to reproduce the phenomenon of VTE in a model robot using only a simple dynamical neural network with Hebbian learning, which suggests that VTE is an emergent property of a plastic and embodied neural network. From a comparison of the three types of VTE, we demonstrated that 1) VTE is associated with chaotic activity of neurons in our model and 2) VTE-showing robots were robust to environmental perturbations. We suggest that the instability of neuronal activity found in VTE allows ongoing learning to rebuild its strategy continuously, which creates robust behavior. Based on these results, we suggest that VTE is caused by a similar mechanism in biology and leads to robust decision making in an analogous way."
https://openalex.org/W2123906616,"Classically viewed as a cytosolic pathway, glycolysis is increasingly recognized as a metabolic pathway exhibiting surprisingly wide-ranging variations in compartmentalization within eukaryotic cells. Trypanosomatid parasites provide an extreme view of glycolytic enzyme compartmentalization as several glycolytic enzymes are found exclusively in peroxisomes. Here, we characterize Trypanosoma brucei flagellar proteins resembling glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK): we show the latter associates with the axoneme and the former is a novel paraflagellar rod component. The paraflagellar rod is an essential extra-axonemal structure in trypanosomes and related protists, providing a platform into which metabolic activities can be built. Yet, bioinformatics interrogation and structural modelling indicate neither the trypanosome PGK-like nor the GAPDH-like protein is catalytically active. Orthologs are present in a free-living ancestor of the trypanosomatids, Bodo saltans: the PGK-like protein from B. saltans also lacks key catalytic residues, but its GAPDH-like protein is predicted to be catalytically competent. We discuss the likelihood that the trypanosome GAPDH-like and PGK-like proteins constitute molecular evidence for evolutionary loss of a flagellar glycolytic pathway, either as a consequence of niche adaptation or the re-localization of glycolytic enzymes to peroxisomes and the extensive changes to glycolytic flux regulation that accompanied this re-localization. Evidence indicating loss of localized ATP provision via glycolytic enzymes therefore provides a novel contribution to an emerging theme of hidden diversity with respect to compartmentalization of the ubiquitous glycolytic pathway in eukaryotes. A possibility that trypanosome GAPDH-like protein additionally represents a degenerate example of a moonlighting protein is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031788057,"Background Although ultrasonography is recommended in internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization, the landmark-guided technique should still be considered. The central landmark using the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is widely used, but it is inaccurate for IJV access. As an alternative landmark, we investigated the accuracy of the new landmark determined by inspection of the respiratory jugular venodilation and direct IJV palpation in right IJV access by ultrasonography. Methods and Findings Thirty patients were enrolled. After induction of anesthesia, the central landmark was marked at the cricoid cartilage level (M1) and the alternative landmark determined by inspection of the respiratory jugular venodilation and direct palpation of IJV was also marked at the same level (M2). Using ultrasonography, the location of IJV was identified (M3) and the distance between M1 and M3 as well as between M2 and M3 were measured. The median (interquartile range) distance between the M2 and M3 was 3.5 (2.0–6.0) mm, compared to 17.5 (12.8–21.3) mm between M1 and M3. (P<0.001) The dispersion of distances between M2 and M3 was significantly smaller than between M1 and M3. (P<0.001) The visibility of respiratory jugular venodilation was associated with CVP more than 4 mmHg. Limitations of the present study are that the inter-observer variability was not investigated and that the visibility of the alternative landmark can be limited to right IJV in adults. Conclusion The alternative landmark may allow shorter distance for the right side IJV access than the central landmark and can offer advantages in right IJV catheterization when ultrasound device is unavailable.

https://openalex.org/W2125844354,"The ATP-dependent HslVU complexes are found in all three biological kingdoms. A single HslV protease exists in each species of prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes, but two HslUs (HslU1 and HslU2) are present in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Previously, a tyrosine residue at the C-terminal tail of HslU2 has been identified as a key determinant of HslV activation in Trypanosoma brucei and a phenylalanine at the equivalent position to E. coli HslU is found in T. brucei HslU1. Unexpectedly, we found that an F441Y mutation in HslU enhanced the peptidase and caseinolytic activity of HslV in E. coli but it showed partially reduced ATPase and SulA degradation activity. Previously, only the C-terminal tail of HslU has been the focus of HslV activation studies. However, the Pro315 residue interacting with Phe441 in free HslU has also been found to be critical for HslV activation. Hence, our current biochemical analyses explore the importance of the loop region just before Pro315 for HslVU complex functionality. The proline and phenylalanine pair in prokaryotic HslU was replaced with the threonine and tyrosine pair from the functional eukaryotic HslU2. Sequence comparisons between multiple HslUs from three different biological kingdoms in combination with biochemical analysis of E. coli mutants have uncovered important new insights into the molecular evolutionary pathway of HslU."
https://openalex.org/W2038164610,"Most studies of density dependent regulation in plants consider a single target species, but regulation may also occur at the level of the entire community. Knowing whether a community is at carrying capacity is essential for understanding its behaviour because low density plant communities may behave quite differently than their high density counterparts. Also, because the intensity of density dependence may differ considerably between species and physical environments, generalizations about its effects on community structure requires comparisons under a range of conditions. We tested if: (1) density dependent regulation occurs at the level of an entire plant community as well as within individual species; (2) the intensity (effect of increasing community density on mean plant mass) and importance (the effect of increasing density, relative to other factors, on mean plant mass) of competition increases, decreases or remains unchanged with increasing fertilization; (3) there are species-specific responses to changes in community density and productivity. In 63 1 m2 plots, we manipulated the abundance of the nine most common species by transplanting or removing them to create a series of Initial Community Densities above and below the average natural field density, such that the relative proportion of species was consistent for all densities. Plots were randomly assigned to one of three fertilizer levels. At the community level, negative density dependence of mean plant size was observed for each of the 4 years of the study and both the intensity and importance of competition increased each year. At the species level, most species' mean plant mass were negatively density dependent. Fertilizer had a significant effect only in the final year when it had a negative effect on mean plant mass. Our data demonstrate a yield-density response at the entire community-level using perennial plant species in a multi-year experiment."
