https://openalex.org/W1968134101,"Neural systems adapt to changes in stimulus statistics. However, it is not known how stimuli with complex temporal dynamics drive the dynamics of adaptation and the resulting firing rate. For single neurons, it has often been assumed that adaptation has a single time scale. We found that single rat neocortical pyramidal neurons adapt with a time scale that depends on the time scale of changes in stimulus statistics. This multiple time scale adaptation is consistent with fractional order differentiation, such that the neuron's firing rate is a fractional derivative of slowly varying stimulus parameters. Biophysically, even though neuronal fractional differentiation effectively yields adaptation with many time scales, we found that its implementation required only a few properly balanced known adaptive mechanisms. Fractional differentiation provides single neurons with a fundamental and general computation that can contribute to efficient information processing, stimulus anticipation and frequency-independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal firing."
https://openalex.org/W1981525849,"When either exogenous or endogenous double-strand breaks occur, the p53 binding protein 53BP1 is one of the earliest proteins to be recruited to the site of the break. 53BP1 helps to promote rejoining of DNA ends during class switch recombination; in a pair of papers in this week's Nature, the laboratories of André Nussenzweig and Titia de Lange show it is also required for V(D)J recombination and for joining of DNA breaks in telomeres. In V(D)J recombination, the ends of the programmed double-strand break are degraded when 53BP1 is absent, and joining between distal V and DJ segments is affected. At broken telomeres, 53BP1 increases the volume of the nucleus searched by the DNA ends so that they are more likely to encounter a partner to which they can be ligated. Thus, 53BP1 facilitates repair by changing the dynamics of movement of broken ends, making long-range interactions more frequent. 53BP1 is required for V(D)J recombination and for joining of DNA breaks in telomeres. In V(D)J recombination, the ends of the programmed double-strand break are degraded when 53BP1 is absent, and joining between distal V and DJ segments is affected. At broken telomeres, 53BP1 increases the mobility of the DNA ends in the nucleus so that they are more likely to encounter a partner to which they can be ligated. Thus, 53BP1 facilitates repair by changing the dynamics of movement of broken ends, making long-range interactions more frequent. Double-strand breaks activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which promotes the accumulation of DNA damage factors in the chromatin surrounding the break. The functional significance of the resulting DNA damage foci is poorly understood. Here we show that 53BP1 (also known as TRP53BP1), a component of DNA damage foci, changes the dynamic behaviour of chromatin to promote DNA repair. We used conditional deletion of the shelterin component TRF2 (also known as TERF2) from mouse cells (TRF2fl/-) to deprotect telomeres, which, like double-strand breaks, activate the ATM kinase, accumulate 53BP1 and are processed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)1,2. Deletion of TRF2 from 53BP1-deficient cells established that NHEJ of dysfunctional telomeres is strongly dependent on the binding of 53BP1 to damaged chromosome ends. To address the mechanism by which 53BP1 promotes NHEJ, we used time-lapse microscopy to measure telomere dynamics before and after their deprotection. Imaging showed that deprotected telomeres are more mobile and sample larger territories within the nucleus. This change in chromatin dynamics was dependent on 53BP1 and ATM but did not require a functional NHEJ pathway. We propose that the binding of 53BP1 near DNA breaks changes the dynamic behaviour of the local chromatin, thereby facilitating NHEJ repair reactions that involve distant sites, including joining of dysfunctional telomeres and AID (also known as AICDA)-induced breaks in immunoglobulin class-switch recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2073761355,"In all animals, the initial events of embryogenesis are controlled by maternal gene products that are deposited into the developing oocyte. At some point after fertilization, control of embryogenesis is transferred to the zygotic genome in a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition. During this time, many maternal RNAs are degraded and transcription of zygotic RNAs ensues. There is a long-standing question as to which factors regulate these events. The recent findings that microRNAs and Smaug mediate maternal transcript degradation have shed new light on this aspect of the problem. However, the transcription factor(s) that activate the zygotic genome remain elusive. The discovery that many of the early transcribed genes in Drosophila share a cis-regulatory heptamer motif, CAGGTAG and related sequences, collectively referred to as TAGteam sites raised the possibility that a dedicated transcription factor could interact with these sites to activate transcription. Here we report that the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Zld; Zinc-finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. Mutant embryos lacking zld are defective in cellular blastoderm formation, and fail to activate many genes essential for cellularization, sex determination and pattern formation. Global expression profiling confirmed that Zld has an important role in the activation of the early zygotic genome and suggests that Zld may also regulate maternal RNA degradation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition."
https://openalex.org/W2121396070,"Cellular abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not limited to motor neurons. Astrocyte dysfunction also occurs in human ALS and transgenic rodents expressing mutant human SOD1 protein (SOD1(G93A)). Here we investigated focal enrichment of normal astrocytes using transplantation of lineage-restricted astrocyte precursors, called glial-restricted precursors (GRPs). We transplanted GRPs around cervical spinal cord respiratory motor neuron pools, the principal cells whose dysfunction precipitates death in ALS. GRPs survived in diseased tissue, differentiated efficiently into astrocytes and reduced microgliosis in the cervical spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) rats. GRPs also extended survival and disease duration, attenuated motor neuron loss and slowed declines in forelimb motor and respiratory physiological functions. Neuroprotection was mediated in part by the primary astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1. These findings indicate the feasibility and efficacy of transplantation-based astrocyte replacement and show that targeted multisegmental cell delivery to the cervical spinal cord is a promising therapeutic strategy for slowing focal motor neuron loss associated with ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2025665677,"Bjorn Olsen and his coworkers shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the proangiogenic properties of endothelial cells in hemangiomas, tracing these properties to decreased activity of a signaling pathway involving NFAT transcription factor regulation of VEGFR1 receptor expression. They also identify germline mutations in genes encoding elements of this signaling pathway in a subset of individuals with hemangioma and suggest that interventions in this pathway could have therapeutic effects ( pages 1147–1148 ). Infantile hemangiomas are localized and rapidly growing regions of disorganized angiogenesis. We show that expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1) in hemangioma endothelial cells (hemECs) and hemangioma tissue is markedly reduced compared to controls. Low VEGFR1 expression in hemECs results in VEGF-dependent activation of VEGFR2 and downstream signaling pathways. In hemECs, transcription of the gene encoding VEGFR1 (FLT1) is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Low VEGFR1 expression in hemECs is caused by reduced activity of a pathway involving β1 integrin, the integrin-like receptor tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM8), VEGFR2 and NFAT. In a subset of individuals with hemangioma, we found missense mutations in the genes encoding VEGFR2 (KDR) and TEM8 (ANTXR1). These mutations result in increased interactions among VEGFR2, TEM8 and β1 integrin proteins and in inhibition of integrin activity. Normalization of the constitutive VEGFR2 signaling in hemECs with soluble VEGFR1 or antibodies that neutralize VEGF or stimulate β1 integrin suggests that local administration of these or similar agents may be effective in hemangioma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1973932627,"Neuronal expression of familial Alzheimer's disease-mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and hAPP-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides causes synaptic dysfunction, inflammation and abnormal cerebrovascular tone in transgenic mice. Fatty acids may be involved in these processes, but their contribution to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is uncertain. We used a lipidomics approach to generate a broad profile of fatty acids in brain tissues of hAPP-expressing mice and found an increase in arachidonic acid and its metabolites, suggesting increased activity of the group IV isoform of phospholipase A(2) (GIVA-PLA(2)). The levels of activated GIVA-PLA(2) in the hippocampus were increased in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and in hAPP mice. Abeta caused a dose-dependent increase in GIVA-PLA(2) phosphorylation in neuronal cultures. Inhibition of GIVA-PLA(2) diminished Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Genetic ablation or reduction of GIVA-PLA(2) protected hAPP mice against Abeta-dependent deficits in learning and memory, behavioral alterations and premature mortality. Inhibition of GIVA-PLA(2) may be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease."

Thus, 53BP1 facilitates repair by changing the dynamics of movement of broken ends, making long-range interactions more frequent. A previously unrecognized defect in the joining phase of V(D)J recombination in 53BP1-deficient lymphocytes that is distinct from that found in classical non-homologous-end-joining-, H2ax-, Mdc1- and Atm-deficient mice, is reported. Variable, diversity and joining (V(D)J) recombination and class-switch recombination use overlapping but distinct non-homologous end joining pathways to repair DNA double-strand-break intermediates. 53BP1 is a DNA-damage-response protein that is rapidly recruited to sites of chromosomal double-strand breaks, where it seems to function in a subset of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase-, H2A histone family member X (H2AX, also known as H2AFX)- and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1)-dependent events1,2. A 53BP1-dependent end-joining pathway has been described that is dispensable for V(D)J recombination but essential for class-switch recombination3,4. Here we report a previously unrecognized defect in the joining phase of V(D)J recombination in 53BP1-deficient lymphocytes that is distinct from that found in classical non-homologous-end-joining-, H2ax-, Mdc1- and Atm-deficient mice. Absence of 53BP1 leads to impairment of distal V–DJ joining with extensive degradation of unrepaired coding ends and episomal signal joint reintegration at V(D)J junctions. This results in apoptosis, loss of T-cell receptor α locus integrity and lymphopenia. Further impairment of the apoptotic checkpoint causes propagation of lymphocytes that have antigen receptor breaks. These data suggest a more general role for 53BP1 in maintaining genomic stability during long-range joining of DNA breaks."
https://openalex.org/W1969796729,"A ubiquitin binding domain in the IAP proteins binds Lys 63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains and is essential for the oncogenic potential of cIAP. This domain is also required for activating NF-κB, possibly by binding poly-ubiquitinated NEMO. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins influences various cellular processes, including DNA repair, NF-κB signalling and cell survival1. The most common mode of regulation by ubiquitin-conjugation involves specialized ubiquitin-binding proteins that bind to ubiquitylated proteins and link them to downstream biochemical processes. Unravelling how the ubiquitin-message is recognized is essential because aberrant ubiquitin-mediated signalling contributes to tumour formation2. Recent evidence indicates that inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are frequently overexpressed in cancer and their expression level is implicated in contributing to tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, disease progression and poor patient-survival3. Here, we have identified an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain in IAPs, which enables them to bind to Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin. We found that the UBA domain is essential for the oncogenic potential of cIAP1, to maintain endothelial cell survival and to protect cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the UBA domain is required for XIAP and cIAP2–MALT1 to activate NF-κB. Our data suggest that the UBA domain of cIAP2–MALT1 stimulates NF-κB signalling by binding to polyubiquitylated NEMO. Significantly, 98% of all cIAP2–MALT1 fusion proteins retain the UBA domain, suggesting that ubiquitin-binding contributes to the oncogenic potential of cIAP2–MALT1 in MALT lymphoma. Our data identify IAPs as ubiquitin-binding proteins that contribute to ubiquitin-mediated cell survival, NF-κB signalling and oncogenesis."

To gain insight into the structure and function of these networks, we analyzed gene expression in single- and multiple-mutant strains to build a quantitative model of the Hog1 MAPK-dependent osmotic stress response in budding yeast. Our model reveals that the Hog1 and general stress (Msn2/4) pathways interact, at both the signaling and promoter level, to integrate information and create a context-dependent response. This study lays out a path to identifying and characterizing the role of signal integration and processing in other gene regulatory networks."

https://openalex.org/W2055339736,"The cochaperone CDC37 promotes the association of HSP90 with the protein kinase subset of client proteins to maintain their stability and signalling functions. HSP90 inhibitors induce depletion of clients, which include several oncogenic kinases. We hypothesized that the targeting of CDC37 using siRNAs would compromise the maturation of these clients and increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors. Here, we show that silencing of CDC37 in human colon cancer cells diminished the association of kinase clients with HSP90 and reduced levels of the clients ERBB2, CRAF, CDK4 and CDK6, as well as phosphorylated AKT. CDC37 silencing promoted the proteasome-mediated degradation of kinase clients, suggesting a degradation pathway independent from HSP90 binding. Decreased cell signalling through kinase clients was also demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates and colon cancer cell proliferation was subsequently reduced by the inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition. Furthermore, combining CDC37 silencing with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG induced more extensive and sustained depletion of kinase clients and potentiated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These results support an essential role for CDC37 in concert with HSP90 in maintaining oncogenic protein kinase clients and endorse the therapeutic potential of targeting CDC37 in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087741263,"Neisseria meningitidis PglL belongs to a novel family of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases (OTases) responsible for O-glycosylation of type IV pilins. Although members of this family are widespread among pathogenic bacteria, there is little known about their mechanism. Understanding the O-glycosylation process may uncover potential targets for therapeutic intervention, and can open new avenues for the exploitation of these pathways for biotechnological purposes. In this work, we demonstrate that PglL is able to transfer virtually any glycan from the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UndPP) carrier to pilin in engineered Escherichia coli and Salmonella cells. Surprisingly, PglL was also able to interfere with the peptidoglycan biosynthetic machinery and transfer peptidoglycan subunits to pilin. This represents a previously unknown post-translational modification in bacteria. Given the wide range of glycans transferred by PglL, we reasoned that substrate specificity of PglL lies in the lipid carrier. To test this hypothesis we developed an in vitro glycosylation system that employed purified PglL, pilin, and the lipid farnesyl pyrophosphate (FarPP) carrying a pentasaccharide that had been synthesized by successive chemical and enzymatic steps. Although FarPP has different stereochemistry and a significantly shorter aliphatic chain than the natural lipid substrate, the pentasaccharide was still transferred to pilin in our system. We propose that the primary roles of the lipid carrier during O-glycosylation are the translocation of the glycan into the periplasm, and the positioning of the pyrophosphate linker and glycan adjacent to PglL. The unique characteristics of PglL make this enzyme a promising tool for glycoengineering novel glycan-based vaccines and therapeutics.

The unique characteristics of PglL make this enzyme a promising tool for glycoengineering novel glycan-based vaccines and therapeutics. Bacterial surface components are frequently composed of, or decorated with, carbohydrates. Among these glycosylated components are the type IV pili, hair-like structures protruding from the bacterial surface, mainly formed by a single protein generically named pilin (1.Craig L. Li J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Type IV pili are important for host cell adhesion and virulence. Furthermore, pilins are O-glycosylated in diverse pathogenic bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoea. The glycan moieties in both species consist of short oligosaccharides, up to three sugar residues in length. Several pilin glycosylation (pgl) genes have been identified in N. meningitidis encoding for glycosyltransferases and sugar-modifying enzymes that are required for the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharides (2.Power P.M. Roddam L.F. Rutter K. Fitzpatrick S.Z. Srikhanta Y.N. Jennings M.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 833-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, how the glycans are transferred to pilin has been just recently described. Power et al. identified in a gene in N. meningitidis containing the Wzy_C PFAM domain (PF04932), a signature of enzymes that participate in O antigen biosynthesis, and which is also present in the PilO oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) involved in pilin glycosylation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1244 (3.Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Inactivation of this gene, named pglL, resulted in an increase in the electrophoretic mobility of pilin, compatible with loss of the pilin glycan. Based on this, it was suggested that PglL was responsible for the attachment of the glycan to pilin (4.Power P.M. Seib K.L. Jennings M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aas et al. (5.Aas F.E. Vik A. Vedde J. Koomey M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 607-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) showed that mutagenesis of the PglL ortholog in N. gonorrhoea (PglO) abolished pilin glycosylation. The final demonstration that PglL is the OTase responsible for the transfer of the glycan to pilin was provided by Faridmoayer et al. (6.Faridmoayer A. Fentabil M.A. Mills D.C. Klassen J.S. Feldman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8088-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) who showed PglL-dependent pilin glycosylation by reconstituting the process in E. coli. Pilin glycosylation is initiated in the cytoplasm with the assembly of oligosaccharides by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases on undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UndPP), 2The abbreviations used are: UndPP, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate; DATDH, 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose; FarPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; OTase, oligosaccharyltransferase; PG, peptidoglycan; ProK, proteinase K; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Amp, ampicillin; Cm, chloramphenicol; Gm, gentamycin; Km, kanamycin; Sp, spectinomycin; Strep, streptomycin; Tet, tetracycline; Tp, trimethoprim. which is also the carrier for the synthesis of other important bacterial surface components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PG), and capsule. The lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) is then flipped into the periplasm, where the oligosaccharide is attached to pilin (4.Power P.M. Seib K.L. Jennings M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5.Aas F.E. Vik A. Vedde J. Koomey M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Mol.

These OTases are integral inner membrane proteins containing multiple membrane-spanning regions (4.Power P.M. Seib K.L. Jennings M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PglB is homologous to the Stt3 component of the eukaryotic OTase complex, but not the OTases involved in O-linked protein glycosylation. PglB is responsible for the N-glycosylation of more than 30 proteins, and is thus referred to as an N-OTase. PglB has been also functionally expressed in E. coli, and it has been shown that it can glycosylate folded proteins in an in vitro assay (7.Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M.

In contrast, PglL and PilO are both involved in O-glycosylation, and therefore are called O-OTases. Analogous enzymes have not been described in eukaryotes. Similarity between PglL and PilO is restricted to a single domain also present in the O antigen ligases involved LPS biosynthesis. In P. aeruginosa 1244, the pilin glycan is a single O antigen-repeating unit (10.Castric P. Cassels F.J. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, C. jejuni and N. meningitidis do not possess O antigen, and instead, there is machinery dedicated to the synthesis of the LLO that will act as the sugar donor for glycosylation. In this work, we have analyzed the substrate specificity of PglL. We took advantage of the availability of well-defined UndPP-linked glycans naturally used in LPS and capsule biosynthesis, which can be produced in E. coli, to demonstrate that PglL can transfer virtually any glycan to pilin in vivo. This finding prompted us to hypothesize that PglL substrate specificity is located in the lipid carrier. To test this hypothesis, we established an in vitro pilin O-glycosylation assay using a synthetic lipid-linked glycan obtained through successive chemical and enzymatic steps. Our results allowed us to map the region of the substrate recognized by PglL to a very short part of the molecule located at the interface between the glycan and lipid moieties. Plasmids Construction and Bacteria Growth—The details of the construction of plasmids pAMF10, expressing PglL C-His10, and pAMF15 and pAMF16 expressing C-His10-tagged N. meningitidis PilE (pilin) under IPTG or arabinose-inducible promoters, as well as the bacteria growth conditions are given in supplemental data. Purification of Recombinant Pilin and PglL—Biosynthesis of recombinant N. meningitidis MC58 pilin glycosylated with different glycans (e.g. O antigens) was achieved by expressing PglL and N. meningitidis MC58 pilin in different E. coli and S. enterica strains (Table 1). pAMF8 (expressing PglL) and pAMF16 (expressing C-His10-tagged pilin) were co-transformed into a target bacterium synthesizing UndPP-linked glycans (Table 1). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in the shaker incubator (200 rpm) until an A600 of 0.4–0.6 was reached, after which the cells were induced by IPTG (0.1 mm) and l-arabinose (0.2% w/v). After induction, the temperature was reduced to 30 °C, and l-arabinose (0.2% w/v) was added again to the culture 6 h after the first induction. Cells were harvested after overnight incubation at 30 °C. Pellets were washed with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.3 m NaCl (buffer 1) and resuspended in the same buffer containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Membrane was separated by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g for 1 h) of the supernatant from the previous step and resuspended in buffer 1 containing 2% Elugent (Calbiochem) and 25 mm imidazole (buffer 2). Proteins were solubilized by mild tumbling overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged (200,000 × g for 1 h), supernatant removed, and the concentration of Elugent reduced to 1% by adding an equal volume of buffer 2 without the detergent. The solution was applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer 2 (containing 1% Elugent) and washed with the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole to remove unbound proteins. Proteins were eluted from the column with buffer 2 containing 250 mm imidazole. Similarly, unglycosylated pilin was purified from DH5α transformed with pAMF15 (expressing pilin-His10) and used for the in vitro O-glycosylation assay.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainDescriptionRef./sourceE. coli W3110rph-I IN(rrnD-rrnE)1Miguel Valvano (University of Western Ontario) DH5αF-φ80lacZΔM15 Δ (lacZYA-argF) U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17 (rk -, mk +) gal- phoA supE44 λ-thi-1 gyrA96 relA1Invitrogen CLM24W3110, ΔwaaL ligase(17.Feldman M.F.

Synthesis of FarPP-linked E. coli O86 Pentasaccharide Subunit—The strategy used for the synthesis of the E. coli O86 O antigen subunit linked to the FarPP carrier as well as the characterization of the compound was based on previous work by Yi et al.

In Vitro Protein Glycosylation—E. coli CLM24 (waaLmut) transformed with pACYCpglBmut were used for extraction of LLO. The LLO was extracted from CLM24, accumulating undecaprenyl-linked heptasaccharide of C. jejuni as described elsewhere (13.Ielpi L. Couso R.O. Dankert M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the synthetic substrate FarPP coupled to the O86 O antigen subunit (FarPP-O86) was used as a sugar donor for the in vitro glycosylation assay. This compound was synthesized using a combination of chemical and enzymatic steps starting from commercially available trans-trans farnesol (Sigma). The details of the synthesis and the characterization of the synthetic glycolipid by NMR and MS are provided in the supplemental data. For the in vitro assay, purified unglycosylated pilin (180 ng), PglL (1.2 μg), FarPP-O86 (150 μm), and 5 μl of 10 × reaction buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 m sucrose and 10 mm MnCl2, pH7.5) were mixed. The volume was adjusted to 50 μl with water, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 30 °C. The concentration of FarPP-linked glycan was about 30–50 times higher than the Km determined for the C. jejuni N-OTase PglB (14.Chen M.M. Weerapana E. Ciepichal E. Stupak J. Reid C.W. Swiezewska E.

Nano LC-ESI MS and MS/MS Analyses—In-gel digestion of purified pilin was carried out using proK or thermolysin. A hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Q-TOF Premier (Waters), equipped with a nanoACQUITY Ultra performance liquid chromatography system (Waters) was used for MS and MS/MS analyses of the peptides as described elsewhere(6.Faridmoayer A. Fentabil M.A. Mills D.C. Klassen J.S. Feldman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8088-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Digestion of pilin with proK and thermolysin reproducibly release 63SAGVA67 (m/z 404.2+) and 59LNHGEWPGNNTSAG72 (m/z 1453.5+), respectively. Both peptides carry Ser-63, the O-glycosylation site (6.Faridmoayer A. Fentabil M.A. Mills D.C. Klassen J.S. Feldman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8088-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The MS/MS data across the elution profile were manually screened for the presence of the peptides resulted from the fragmentation of glycopeptides. The data analysis was done using Mass-Lynx V4.1 (Waters). PglL Can Transfer Polysaccharides Containing β-(1→4) and α-(1→6) Sugars Linked to the Residue at Position 1—We have previously shown that PglL is able to transfer the C. jejuni heptasaccharide and E. coli O7 antigen from the UndPP carrier to pilin in engineered E. coli cells (6.Faridmoayer A. Fentabil M.A. Mills D.C. Klassen J.S. Feldman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8088-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In these glycans, the two sugars proximal to the lipid carrier are attached via an α-(1→3)- or a β-(1→3)-linkage, respectively (Fig. 1). E. coli O2 and O16 antigens have a rhamnose β-(1→4)-linked and a Glc residue α-(1→6) linked to the GlcNAc at the reducing end, respectively. To further characterize PglL glycan specificity, transfer of these polysaccharides to pilin was tested (Fig. 1) (15.Jansson P.E. Lennholm H. Lindberg B. Lindquist U. Svenson S.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16.Feldman M.F. Marolda C.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Parodi A.J. Valvano M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35129-35138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding PglL and a His10-tagged version of N. meningitidis pilin were introduced into E. coli NM cells, which belong to the serotype O2 (Table 1). Pilin was purified from these cells by affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 2). The typical pattern of bands corresponding to pilin attached to O antigen was detected with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2A, lane 1), a monoclonal anti-pilin antibody, and anti-O2-specific antiserum (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). All the bands disappeared after treatment with proteinase K (proK), indicating that they corresponded to pilin glycosylated with O2 polysaccharide with different degrees of polymerization, and not to contaminating LPS (Fig. 2B). For further analysis of the glycoprotein, a band with slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility compared with unglycosylated pilin was excised from the gel and digested with proK (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The peptides and glycopeptides resulting from the digestion were analyzed by nano liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). This analysis confirmed the attachment of a single O2 unit bound to Ser-63 of pilin (Fig. 2C). Similarly, PglL and pilin were expressed in the E. coli strain CLM24, which carries an insertion in the wbbL gene encoding for the rhamnosyltransferase required for O16 antigen biosynthesis. Synthesis of the O16 polysaccharide can be restored in CLM24 by expressing wbbL from plasmid pMF19 (16.Feldman M.F. Marolda C.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Parodi A.J. Valvano M.A. J. Biol.

SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or Western blot of pilin purified from CLM24 carrying pMF19 indicated that the O16 antigen was transferred to pilin by PglL (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 9). To determine the composition of the O16 subunit attached to pilin, the strain EVV11 was used. This strain lacks the Wzy polymerase, and therefore produces only a single O16 subunit (18.Wacker M. Feldman M.F. Callewaert N. Kowarik M. Clarke B.R. Pohl N.L. Hernandez M. Vines E.D. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7088-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). MS analysis of purified pilin from this strain confirmed the presence of the branching Glc residue (Fig. 2D). The experiments described in this section demonstrated that substitutions at positions C-4 or C-6 of the monosaccharide at the reducing end do not hinder PglL activity. PglL Can Transfer Glycans Containing a Hexose at the Reducing End—OTases catalyze the breakdown of the linkage between the pyrophosphate and the monosaccharide at the reducing end, and the formation of a new linkage between this sugar and the amino acid in the target protein. Therefore, the structure of the monosaccharide at the reducing end of the glycan chain is thought to contain some catalytic determinants. For example, PglB requires an acetamido sugar at this position (18.Wacker M. Feldman M.F. Callewaert N. Kowarik M. Clarke B.R. Pohl N.L. Hernandez M. Vines E.D. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7088-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); it has been established that PglL can transfer glycans containing 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose (DATDH), glyceramido acetamido trideoxyhexose or HexNAc at the reducing end (6.Faridmoayer A.

We tested if P. aeruginosa O11 antigen, containing FucNAc was also a PglL substrate. N. meningitidis pilin was expressed in CLM24 cells expressing PglL and carrying plasmid pLPS2, which allows synthesis of P. aeruginosa O11 polysaccharide in E. coli (20.Goldberg J.B. Hatano K. Meluleni G.S. Pier G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10716-10720Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and MS analysis (Fig. 3) of pilin purified from these cells demonstrated attachment of the polysaccharide to pilin. The sugars previously transferred by PglL all have an acetamido group at position C-2. To analyze if the presence of this group is essential for PglL activity, we tested the capability of PglL for transferring Salmonella O antigen, which contains a galactose residue at the reducing end. It has been shown that E. coli JM109 cells carrying plasmid pPR1374 produce the S. enterica LT2 O antigen (21.Neal B.L. Brown P.K. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7115-7118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we expressed PglL and N. meningitidis pilin in these cells and analyzed glycosylation by Western blot using two specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing N. meningitidis pilin or abequose, one of the sugars present in Salmonella O antigen, respectively. In both cases, a ladder of bands indicating transfer of S. enterica O antigen to pilin was detected (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). The same bands were detected using a polyclonal antiserum reacting against Salmonella O antigen (Fig. 4A, lane 5). Similar results were derived from the direct reconstitution of the pilin glycosylation process with the endogenous O antigen in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 strain (not shown). To obtain conclusive evidence of the presence of Gal directly bound to Ser-63, we switched to the SL901 strain, which carries a mutation in the Wzy polymerase. N. meningitidis pilin from the SL901 strain expressing PglL was purified (Fig. 4A, lane 7), digested with proK and analyzed by the nano LC-ESI MS and MS/MS. MS/MS analysis identified an ion carrying the peptide 63SAGVA67. The major ions observed in the MS/MS spectrum of this ion matched with expected fragments of the peptide carrying a single Salmonella O antigen subunit (Fig. 4B). This demonstrated that glycans containing Gal at the reducing end can be transferred by PglL. We next chose to examine the transfer of E. coli group 1 K30 antigen, which can be found as a capsular structure composed of high molecular weight K30 polysaccharide, and shorter K30 oligosaccharides linked to lipid A-core in a LPS molecule (K30LPS). Polymerized K30 units are assembled onto UndPP and taken into a dedicated export machinery composed of Wza, Wzb, and Wzc (22.Dong C. Beis K. Nesper J. Brunkan-Lamontagne A.L. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inactivation of the export machinery results in accumulation K30LPS. N. meningitidis pilin and PglL were expressed and purified from CWG281, a Wza mutant strain of E69, which expresses the O9 antigen via the polymerase-independent pathway, and the K30 capsule (Fig. 1) (23.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed pilins glycosylated with O9 antigen (Fig. 5A). MS/MS analysis of a band with slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than unglycosylated pilin (Fig. 5A), digested with thermolysin, showed a peak corresponding to the peptide 52LNHGEWPGNNTSAG65 modified with a single K30 capsular unit (Fig. 5B). Therefore both glycans were transferred by PglL in this strain. The transfer of Salmonella O antigen and K30 capsule repeating unit to pilin demonstrates that, unlike other OTases, PglL does not require the acetamido group at position C-2 of the sugar at the reducing end for activity. PglL Can Transfer a Peptidoglycan Subunit to Pilin—SDS-PAGE analysis of N. meningitidis pilin purified from the O16 strain expressing PglL showed a band with slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than unglycosylated pilin. This band (indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 2A, lane 2) was extracted from the gel, digested with proK, and analyzed by nano LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS. From MS/MS data analysis, two ions carrying the peptide 63SAGVA67 were identified. The MS/MS of spectra these ions did not match with the expected fragments derived from the modification of the pentapeptide with O16 antigen unit. Instead, these peaks were compatible with the attachment of incomplete peptidoglycan (PG) subunits to this peptide, carrying either a muramyl-GlcNAc tetra-(Fig. 6A) or tripeptide (Fig. 6C). The MS/MS spectra exhibited the characteristic peaks derived from the fragmentation of a PG subunit c"
https://openalex.org/W2042114196,"The general transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) is retained at gene promoters during mitosis, where it recruits PP2A to inactivate condensin. Chromatin decondensation at promoters may be associated with gene bookmarking, a mechanism to re-establish gene activity patterns in daughter cells. To maintain phenotypes of cell lineages, cells must 'remember' which genes were active before mitosis entry and transmit this information to their daughter cells so that expression patterns can be faithfully re-established in G1. This phenomenon is called gene bookmarking. However, during mitosis transcription ceases, most sequence-specific proteins dissociate from DNA and the chromatin is tightly compacted, making it difficult to understand how gene activity 'memory' is maintained through this stage of the cell cycle1,2. A feature of gene bookmarking is that in mitotic cells, the promoters of formerly active genes lack compaction, but how compaction of these regions is inhibited is unknown3,4. Here we show that during mitosis, TATA-binding protein (TBP), which remains bound to DNA during mitosis, recruits PP2A. TBP also interacts with condensin to allow efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin near these promoters to inhibit their compaction. Further, ChIP-on-chip data show that TBP is bound to many chromosomal sites during mitosis, and is higher in transcribed regions but low in regions containing pseudogenes and genes whose expression is tissue-restricted. These results suggest that TBP is involved not only in gene transcription during interphase but also in preserving the memory of gene activity through mitosis to daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018702961,"11q13 amplification is a late-stage event in several cancers that is often associated with poor prognosis. Among 11q13-amplified genes, the actin assembly protein cortactin/CTTN is considered a likely candidate for direct involvement in tumor progression because of its cell motility-enhancing functions. We modulated cortactin expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Cortactin expression levels directly correlated with tumor size, vascularization and cell proliferation in an orthotopic HNSCC in vivo model. In contrast, under normal in vitro culture conditions, cortactin expression levels had no effect on cell proliferation. However, cell lines in which cortactin expression was reduced by knockdown (KD) grew poorly in vitro under harsh conditions of growth factor deprivation, anchorage independence and space constraint. In contrast, overexpression of cortactin enhanced in vitro growth under the same harsh conditions. Surprisingly, defects in growth factor-independent proliferation of cortactin-KD cells were rescued by coculture with cortactin-expressing cells. As the cocultured cells are separated by permeable filters, cortactin-expressing cells must secrete growth-supporting autocrine factors to rescue the cortactin-KD cells. Overall, cortactin expression modulates multiple cellular traits that may allow survival in a tumor environment, suggesting that the frequent overexpression of cortactin in tumors is not an epiphenomenon but rather promotes tumor aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1991179403,"The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in normal embryonic development and controls the homeostatic self-renewal of stem cells in adult tissues. Constitutive activation of Wnt signaling contributes to cancer development and progression. We identified a CXXC4 homozygous deletion at 4q24 in an aggressive renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. CXXC4 encodes Idax, which negatively regulates Wnt signaling by binding to the PDZ domain of Dishevelled. CXXC4 mRNA levels in tumor samples were significantly lower in patients with metastases compared with those without (P=0.0016). Patients whose tumors had lower CXXC4 expression than normal kidney showed a poorer cause-specific survival outcome than those with higher expression (P=0.0095). Decreased expression of CXXC4 also correlated with cytoplasmic staining of beta-catenin. Knockdown of CXXC4 induced the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and altered expression of a set of genes involved in cell proliferation, invasion and survival. Furthermore, reduced expression of CXXC4 by small interfering RNAs promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis after 5-FU and doxorubicin treatment in RCC cells. These data suggest that CXXC4 plays a critical role in tumor progression of RCC through Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling could thus be a potential molecular target in RCC indicating decreased CXXC4 expression."

Here we present extended biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant FphA using a synthetic gene with host-adapted codon usage. The recombinant photosensory domain FphAN753 was shown to display all features of a bona fide phytochrome. It covalently binds biliverdin as chromophore and undergoes red/far-red light-inducible photoconversion with both parent states being protonated. The large N-terminal variable extension of FphA exerts a stabilizing effect on the active Pfr state. Upon substitution of the highly conserved histidine 504, involved in the hydrogen-bonding network of the protein moiety and the chromophore, chromophore attachment and photoreversibility were completely impaired. FphA is a functional sensor histidine kinase with a strong red-light-dependent autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, intermolecular trans-phosphorylation to the response regulator domain of a second monomer could be demonstrated. Interestingly, co-incubation of FphA and FphA variants led to enhanced autophosphorylation, including the “inactive” Pr form.

Cell. 2005; 4: 2140-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) confirmed the existence of a red light-sensing system beyond photosynthetic organisms. Phytochromes belong to the family of red/far-red light sensing photoreceptors that are able to reversibly photoisomerize between two stable conformations, a red light-absorbing Pr form and a far-red light-absorbing Pfr form. This photointerconversion is mediated by a linear tetrapyrrole prosthetic group (bilin), which undergoes a Z-E isomerization around the C15–C16 double bond. The apo-protein autocatalytically assembles the bilin chromophore to form a covalent thioether linkage with a conserved cysteine residue. Interestingly, in bacteria and fungi the chromophore attachment site as well as the chromophore itself differ from cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes indicating the prokaryotic origin of fungal phytochromes (4.Blumenstein A.

The bilins of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes are the structurally related linear tetrapyrroles phytochromobilin and phycocyanobilin, respectively. Both are coupled via the A-ring ethylidene side chain (C31) to a conserved cysteine in the GAF domain of the phytochrome. On the other hand, all bacterial and fungal phytochromes thus far identified, assemble the less reduced linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin (BV) through their A-ring vinyl-group (C32) to a conserved cysteine within the PAS domain (7.Lamparter T.

All phytochromes share a common domain organization. They typically consist of an N-terminal photosensory domain, harboring the bilin chromophore and a C-terminal output module. The photosensory domain comprises a PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM), GAF (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases; cyanobacterial adenylate cyclases; formate hydrogen lyase), and PHY (phytochrome) domain (9.Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In particular fungal phytochromes possess an N-terminal variable extension (NTE) preceding the PAS domain (Fig. 1) (4.Blumenstein A. Vienken K. Tasler R. Purschwitz J. Veith D. Frankenberg-Dinkel N.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The C-terminal output modules are usually more diverged, but most bacterial and fungal phytochromes consist of light-regulated histidine kinase domains (4.Blumenstein A. Vienken K. Tasler R.

Fungal phytochromes are multifunctional proteins combining a histidine kinase domain and a response regulator domain (RRD) in one protein (Fig. 1A). Genes coding for corresponding response regulators in bacteria are most often encoded separately within the bacteriophytochrome-encoding (bph) operon (12.Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The presence of a histidine kinase domain in combination with a response regulator domain indicates that fungal phytochromes originate from an early bacterial hybrid kinase (13.Pao G.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Red light-sensing has been extensively studied in the filamentous ascomycete A. nidulans. In addition, putative fungal phytochrome genes have been identified in the genomes of other ascomycetous fungi such as N. crassa, Gibberella zeae, Cochliobolus heterostrophus, and A. fumigatus, and also in the basidiomycetes Ustilago maydis and Cryptococcus neoformans (4.Blumenstein A.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but the involved red light photoreceptor was discovered and initially characterized only a few years ago (4.Blumenstein A.

An A. nidulans fphA null mutant in comparison to the wild-type (wt) strain showed a clear developmental phenotype. Red light conditions led to enhanced sexual development in the ΔfphA mutant. Initial experiments revealed a cytoplasmic localization of the phytochrome (4.Blumenstein A. Vienken K. Tasler R. Purschwitz J. Veith D. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Fischer R. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1833-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas further studies also identified a fraction of FphA in the nucleus (16.Purschwitz J. Muller S. Kastner C. Schoser M. Haas H. Espeso E.A. Atoui A. Calvo A.M. Fischer R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 255-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It was shown that FphA is part of a large blue- and red light-sensing protein complex, thereby interacting with the WC-2 homologue LreB and with the global regulator Velvet (VeA) (16.Purschwitz J. Muller S. Kastner C. Schoser M. Haas H. Espeso E.A. Atoui A. Calvo A.M. Fischer R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 255-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Recombinant FphA was characterized as a bona fide phytochrome with absorbance maxima at 707 and 754 nm for the Pr and Pfr forms, respectively. FphA most probably integrates the signal light via two-component signaling phosphorelays, because the protein contains both elements of a two-component regulatory system (Fig. 1A).Although initial characterization on the putative FphA activity has been performed, proceeding experiments appeared extremely difficult because of unfavorable expression rates (data not shown). In this study we present an extended photobiochemical characterization of FphA using a synthetic fphA version with a host-adapted codon usage. This synthetic gene enabled us to produce adequate amounts of several FphA variants for stepping deeper into spectroscopic and functional analyses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBilin Preparations—BV IXα was purchased from Frontier Scientific (Carnforth, UK) and dissolved in DMSO prior to use.Construction of Expression Vectors—A synthetic gene encoding the full-length FphA was adapted to the codon bias of Escherichia coli genes to provide a successful expression. The synthetic gene fphA of 3840 bp was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides (GENEART GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). The synthetic DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ under the accession number EU433998.fphAN753s encoding the first 753 amino acids containing photosensory domain was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGAGCGAGCTGCCGAGC-3′ (fwd) and 5′-CCCTCGAGCGCTTCCTGCTGACGCCACAC-3′ (rev) and cloned after XbaI and XhoI restriction (restriction sites underlined in primer sequence) into pASK-IBA3 to get the E. coli expression vector pASK-fphAN753s. The site-directed mutants C195A and H504A were constructed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers (the underlined codon represents the introduced mutations): C195A, 5′-CCGTGGATAGCTTTAAAGCGGCCGAAGATGAACCGATTCATATTCC-3′ and H504A, 5′-CGTGCGATGAGCCCGATTGCTATCAAATATCTGGCCAACATGC-3′; the second primer was the complement. To yield an expression plasmid containing fphAN753s without the coding region for the N-terminal variable extension (173 amino acids), ΔfphAN753s, the PAS-GAF-PHY coding region was amplified via PCR and cloned into XbaI, XhoI restriction sites (in sequence underlined) in pASK-IBA3. Primers were the following: 5′-CCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGTGCGAAGATGAACCGATTCATATTCCG-3′ (fwd) and 5′-CCCTCGAGCGCTTCCTGCTGACGCCACAC-3′ (rev).The full-length gene fphAs was cloned into pASK-IBA3 after XbaI and NcoI restriction to yield pASK-fphAs. The full-length gene without the coding region for the N-terminal variable extension, namely ΔfphAs, was amplified by using primers 5′-CCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGTGCGAAGATGAACCGATTCATATTCCG-3′ (fwd) and 5′-CGCCATGGTCGCTATGGGTATACGGGGTAAACC-3′ (rev) and cloned into pASK-IBA3 into XbaI and NcoI restriction sites to yield pASK-ΔfphAs.The variant D1181A was constructed using the primer 5′-GGGATGTGGTGCTGATGGCTATTCAGATGCCGATTCTGG-3′, the second primer was the complement, and the underlined codons represent the exchange. With the purpose of hampering autophosphorylation the variant H770A of pASK-ΔfphAs was constructed with the primer 5′-GCTGGCCAACAGCGCGGCTGAAGTGCGTACCCCG-3′, the second primer was the complement, and the underlined codon represents the exchange. The integrity of the resultant plasmid constructs as well as the variants were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany).Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant A. nidulans FphA and all variants were produced using a tet promoter-driven C-terminal Strep tag expression system (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) in the E. coli strain BL21(λDE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg·ml–1) to an A578 of 0.5. Gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 μg·ml–1 anhydrotetracycline, and cells were incubated for further 3 h at 30 °C. The bacterial pellet of 3 liters of culture was resuspended in elution and washing buffer (EW, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20; 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride were added freshly) (6 ml buffer per gram of cell weight) and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (90 min, 28,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with 40 μg·ml–1 avidin (final concentration) for at least 10 min on ice. Subsequently, the supernatant was loaded on to a Streptactin-Sepharose column (3 ml), which had previously been incubated with EW buffer. The purification was performed according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Fractions containing the desired protein were combined and concentrated to a protein concentration of ∼100 μm using Vivaspin concentrator devices (MWCO 10,000, Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Göttingen, Germany). To obtain holo-FphA variants E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells were cotransformed with the plasmids pASK-fphAs, pASK-fphAs_D1181A, pASK-fphAN753s, or pASK-ΔfphAN753s and pAT-BV encoding hemeoxygenase 1 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under control of an isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible Plac promoter as described before (4.Blumenstein A. Vienken K. Tasler R. Purschwitz J. Veith D. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Fischer R. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1833-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17.Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For holo-phytochrome synthesis the medium contained 50 μg·ml–1 ampicillin and 25 μg·ml–1 kanamycin. Bilin biosynthesis was induced using 250 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside 1 h before induction of the FphA synthesis to provide a sufficient amount of chromophore for the assembly. During production and purification of holo-FphA all steps were carried out under a green safelight or in the dark. Purified protein was subsequently concentrated to a final concentration of ∼100 μm (as described before) and either used directly or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –20 °C.Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined by measuring A280 using the calculated ϵ280 nm for each individual protein: ϵ280 nm = 72,400 m–1·cm–1 for FphAN753, ϵ280 nm = 60,310 m–1·cm–1 for ΔFphAN753, ϵ280 nm = 113,650 m–1·cm–1 for FphA, and ϵ280 nm = 101,560 m–1·cm–1 for ΔFphA (18.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar).Chromophore-Protein Interactions—All experiments were performed under a green safelight. For photochemical analyses of FphAN753- or ΔFphAN753-BV in vivo reconstituted and purified holo-phytochrome was adjusted to ∼10 μm in buffer M (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl) as judged by absorbance at 280 nm. Spectral analyses were performed with an 8453 UV/visible System (Agilent Technologies, Boeblingen, Germany) equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. For irradiation, light from a tungsten-halogen source (LOT-ORIEL, Darmstadt, Germany) was passed through an interference filter (LOT-ORIEL) of 636 nm (636FS10–50) and through a 750 nm filter (Wratten No. 87, Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany) with light intensities of 12 μmol·m–2·s–1 and 4 μmol·m–2·s–1, respectively. Absorbance spectra were obtained after 3-min illumination with red light at 636 nm (Pfr spectrum) and after 3-min incubation with far-red light at 750 nm (Pr spectrum) in a volume of 500 μl, and the difference was calculated. To characterize the different forms of holo-FphAN753 spectroscopically, absorbance spectra between 250 and 800 nm were measured at ∼18 °C during incubation in the dark or during irradiation with red and far-red light, respectively.In vitro chromophore assembly of FphAN753 and the variants FphAN753_C195A and -H504A or ΔFphAN753 with BV was generally tested using 10 μm of recombinant apo-protein incubated with 10 μm chromophore in EW buffer for 30 min in the dark at ∼20 °C (final volume, 500 μl), and again absorbance spectra between 250 and 800 nm were taken during incubation in the dark or under irradiation with red and far-red light. Covalent chromophore attachment to the FphA variants was tested by visualizing covalently bound bilins via zinc-induced red fluorescence as described previously (19.Berkelman T.R. Lagarias J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman (RR) spectra were recorded with 1064 nm excitation (Nd-YAG cw laser, line width <1cm–1) using an RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics, Ettlinger, Germany) Fourier-transform Raman spectrometer (4 cm–1 spectral resolution). The near-infrared excitation line was sufficiently close to the first electronic transition to generate a strong pre-resonance enhancement of the chromophoric vibrational bands such that Raman bands of the protein matrix remained very weak in the spectra of the parent states. All spectra were measured at –140 °C using a liquid-nitrogen cooled cryostat (Linkam, Waterfield, Surrey, UK). The laser power at the sample was set at ∼700 milliwatts, which did not damage the chromoproteins as checked by comparing the spectra of the samples obtained before and after RR data acquisition. The total accumulation time was <2 h for each spectrum. For all RR spectra shown in this work, a polygonal baseline was subtracted. Photoproducts were accumulated by irradiating the samples for a few minutes at the specified temperatures. These raw RR spectra included substantial contributions from residual Pr, which was subtracted using the characteristic RR bands of Pr as a reference. Further RR experimental details have been described previously (20.Wagner J.R. Zhang J. von Stetten D. Günther M. Murgida D.H. Mroginski M.A. Walker J.M. Forest K.T. Hildebrandt P. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12212-12226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Protein Kinase Assay—Autophosphorylation was performed as described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa BphP (21.Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Before the addition of [32P]ATP[γP] 10 μg of FphA_D1181A-BV was either irradiated with red (636 nm) or far-red (750 nm) light for 30 min at 18 °C and incubated in darkness at room temperature for different periods of time. The reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer without incubation at 95 °C, and the samples were subsequently loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Radioisotope imaging was monitored by using a hyperscreen x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Europe, Düsseldorf, Germany), thereafter the blot was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal protein load.In Vitro His-Asp Phosphotransfer—To demonstrate phosphotransfer from the conserved histidine residue of the histidine kinase domain to the conserved aspartate of the RRD, holo-FphA_D1181A photoconverted to the Pr and Pfr form was autophosphorylated for 1.5 h as described under “Protein Kinase Assays.” Afterwards the samples were mixed with 10 μg of holo-ΔFphA_H770A or apo-ΔFphA_H770A and incubated for 1.5 h in the dark at room temperature. Further procedures were the same as described under “Protein Kinase Assay.” As negative control one sample was treated the same without addition of holo-FphA_D1181A.RESULTSLow Production Rates of Recombinant FphA Are Due to an Unfavorable Codon Usage—Initial characterization on the putative phytochrome activity has been performed, but proceeding with distinct experiments was extremely difficult because of unfavorable expression rates. Minor expression rates were due to an unadapted codon usage toward E. coli. Application of the Codon Adaptation Tool (JCAT) of the PRODORIC data base (www.prodoric.de) indicated a Codon Adaptation Index-Value (CAI-Value) of ∼0.23 for fphA to E. coli K12 (42.Grote A. Hiller K. Scheer M. Muench R. Noertemann B. Hempel D.C. Jahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Consequently, a synthetic gene of 3840 kb with an optimized CAI-Value of 0.98 was constructed (accession number EU433998) to overcome expression limitations. Based on this construct several variants were cloned and expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1B). All FphA variants were purified (Fig. 1C) and used for further photobiological characterization.FphAN753 Behaves Like a True Phytochrome—A. nidulans FphAN753, comprising only the photosensory domain (Fig. 1, A and B) was either purified as holo-phytochrome assembled with BV in vivo or as apo-protein. For holo-phytochrome production in E. coli a dual plasmid system was employed as described for the biosynthesis of holo-BphP (21.Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A band migrating at ∼86,000 was obtained on SDS-PAGE, which correlates with the predicted molecular mass from the amino acid composition of the photosensory domain containing an additional Strep-tag (Fig. 1C, right panel, lane 1). Because in vivo reconstituted holo-FphAN753 revealed a greater stability than the in vitro assembled holo-protein, the purified in vivo complex was used for further photochemical analyses. The yield of purified holo-FphAN753 was typically 2.5 mg per liter of bacterial culture.Recombinant holo-FphAN753 assembled with BV, most likely the natural chromophore, exhibits a characteristic red/far-red light reversible phytochrome signature. Illumination with saturated red light (636 nm) resulted in formation of the Pfr form (Amax 754 nm), which could be converted back into the Pr form (Amax 707 nm) through illumination with far-red light (750 nm) (Fig. 2A). The resultant calculated Pr-Pfr difference spectrum confirms the photoactivity of holo-FphAN753 (Fig. 2B). Both forms show absorption maxima at longer wavelengths characteristic of BV-binding bacterial and fungal phytochromes (8.Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The form initially synthesized in the dark is the Pr form (Fig. 2C). Neither the Pr- nor the Pfr form undergo a defined dark reversion, known to be a thermal relaxation process of non-photochemical Pfr-to-Pr dark reversion especially found by dicot plant phytochromes to regulate the signal output (25.Vierstra R.D.

To investigate the role of this large subdomain (calculated Mr 18,300) on FphA photoreversibility or stability, NTE deletion mutants of the photosensory domain and the full-length protein (ΔFphAN753 and ΔFphA) were constructed (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2050407137,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are associated with conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a proteinase K-resistant, amyloid-like aggregate, PrPSc. Although the structure of PrPSc remains enigmatic, recent studies have afforded increasingly detailed characterization of recombinant PrP amyloid. However, all previous studies were performed using amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of denaturing agents that significantly alter the folding state(s) of the precursor monomer. Here we report that PrP amyloid can also be generated under physiologically relevant conditions, where the monomeric protein is natively folded. Remarkably, site-directed spin labeling studies reveal that these fibrils possess a β-core structure nearly indistinguishable from that of amyloid grown under denaturing conditions, where the C-terminal α-helical domain of the PrP monomer undergoes major refolding to a parallel and in-register β-structure upon conversion. The structural similarity of fibrils formed under drastically different conditions strongly suggests that the common β-sheet architecture within the ∼160–220 core region represents a distinct global minimum in the PrP conversion free energy landscape. We also show that the N-terminal region of fibrillar PrP displays conformational plasticity, undergoing a reversible structural transition with an apparent pKa of ∼5.3. The C-terminal region, on the other hand, retains its β-structure over the pH range 1–11, whereas more alkaline buffer conditions denature the fibrils into constituent PrP monomers. This profile of pH-dependent stability is reminiscent of the behavior of brain-derived PrPSc, suggesting a substantial degree of structural similarity within the β-core region of these PrP aggregates."

The proton uptake for both pumping and chemistry is accomplished via two proton-conducting channels: the D- and K-channels (see for example Ref. 2.Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Catalysis by CcO is initiated by binding of an oxygen molecule to heme a3 when both redox centers of the binuclear active site are reduced. Oxygen binding leads to the formation of the first compound of the catalytic cycle, the ferrous-oxygen adduct, or compound A (3.Chance B. Saronio C. Leigh J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1635-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4.Oliveberg M. Brzezinski P. Malmström B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5.Babcock G.T. Wikström M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 6.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For the intermediates of the catalytic cycle, their sequence, and corresponding structures, see Fig. 7. The next reaction in catalysis is scission of the O–O bond, which requires delivery of four electrons and a proton to dioxygen. Thus, the so-called peroxy intermediate (P) is formed, in which heme a3 is in the ferryl state (7.Ogura T. Takahashi S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14721-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kitagawa T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and CuB is cupric (9.Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Palmer G. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two electrons are provided by heme a3 and one by CuB. The source of the fourth electron depends on the initial reduction state of CcO. In the case of the fully reduced enzyme, where all four redox centers are reduced, the fourth electron is extracted from heme a (6.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10.Han S. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D.L. Nature. 1990; 348: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); in this case, the so-called PR species is formed (9.Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Palmer G. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the case of the mixed valence enzyme, where only heme a3 and CuB are initially reduced but CuA and heme a are oxidized, the fourth electron is extracted from a nearby residue, most likely Tyr-280 (11.Proshlyakov D.A. Pressler M.A. DeMaso C. Leykam J.F. DeWitt D.L. Babcock G.T. Science. 2000; 290: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12.Iwaki M. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10873-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that is located in close proximity to the binuclear center, at a distance of ∼6 Å. This state of the binuclear center has been called PM. The source of the proton for O–O bond scission is in both cases (fully reduced and mixed valence enzyme) likely to be the same residue, viz. Tyr-280. Tyr-280 has a covalent cross-link to one of the His ligands of CuB, namely His-276 (13.Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cross-link should lower the pKa of the tyrosine (15.McCauley K.M. Vrtis J.M. Dupont J. van der Donk W.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2403-2404Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), thus facilitating proton donation. The role of Tyr-280 in O–O bond rupture was first predicted from the crystal structure (13.Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P.

Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10733-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to resolve the stage of the catalytic cycle at which Tyr-280 becomes reprotonated. For this, we used FTIR spectroscopy in kinetic and equilibrium modes, i.e. we monitored the band at 1308 cm-1, which was previously assigned to the deprotonated Tyr-280 anion (17.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich I. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10733-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), for each step of the catalytic cycle beyond the formation of the PR intermediate (see Fig. 7). Enzyme Preparation—Site-directed mutagenesis, bacterial growth conditions, and purification of the N131V mutant and wild type of cytochrome aa3 from Paracoccus denitrificans were as described in Ref. 18.Riistama S. Laakkonen L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Puustinen A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10670-10677Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. The sample was depleted of detergent as first described in Ref. 19.Rich P.R. Breton J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar to immobilize it on the hydrophobic surface of the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) prism (“ATR sample”). The subsequent procedure of drying and rewetting of the sample was performed essentially as described in Ref. 19.Rich P.R. Breton J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. Then, the immobilized enzyme film was covered by a chamber especially designed for the flow-flash procedure (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this time-resolved measurement of the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase with oxygen, the enzyme was initially fully reduced under anaerobic conditions and inhibited with CO (FRCO state). The medium is specified in the legends for Figs. 1, 2, and 5. The formation of FRCO was detected by appearance of the band at 1965 cm-1, which is characteristic for the C≡O-heme a3 vibration (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I.

These and all other spectra were normalized to the enzyme concentration of 1.45 mm based on the 1965-cm-1 band (C≡O-heme a3) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Conditions were the same as in Fig. 1, except that the reaction was started by a laser flash with a delay of 3 s after the beginning of the injection of 100 μl of oxygen-saturated buffer. Concentrations of hexaammineruthenium were 10 μm for pH 9 and 50 μm for pH 6.5. For the experiment at pH 9, borate buffer (100 mm boric acid + 100 mm potassium sulfate) was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Kinetic FTIR spectra of the R→O transition of wild type CcO.

Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The laser flash caused CO photodissociation, and the fully reduced (R) enzyme readily reacted with oxygen. The oxygen reaction was registered in the visible range as described (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using an HR2000+ (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL) spectrophotometer, which allows measurement of one spectrum each millisecond. To get the rate constant and spectrum of the slow step of the reaction of the N131V variant with O2, the data were fitted by the SPLMOD program (21.Provencher S.W. Vogel R.H. Deuflhard P. Hairer E. Progress in Scientific Computing. Birkhauser, Boston1983: 304-319Google Scholar, 22.Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15633-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which is a global kinetic fit program (independent executable program run under a MATLAB (The Mathworks, South Natick, MA) front end). The Oxygen Reaction of the N131V Mutant and Wild Type ATR Samples Followed by Time-resolved FTIR Spectroscopy—The reaction of the N131V mutant and wild type CcO with oxygen was measured in the infrared range 1800-1000 cm-1 by the FTIR spectrometer IFS/66s (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with an ATR prism (three-bounce version, surface diameter 3 mm, SensIR Technologies, Danbury, CT). The infrared range 1800–1000 cm-1 was cut out with an interference filter (Northumbria Optical Coatings Ltd., Boldon, UK). The reaction was basically followed in the same way as in the visible range. Oxygenated buffer was added to the ATR sample of the FRCO forms of mutated and wild type enzymes, and 3 s later, the laser was fired. The 3-s delay is necessary for oxygen diffusion through the enzyme film. Our FTIR flow-flash technique for measurements of the oxygen reaction (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which is based on a rapid scan approach, allows one to monitor the course of the reaction with a time resolution of ∼46 ms/spectrum. With this time resolution, the early parts of the oxygen reaction are seen as an absorbance jump immediately after the laser flash, whereas the slower parts are detected in a time-resolved fashion. The concentration of active enzyme was estimated based on the amplitude of the trough at 1965 cm-1 caused by CO photodissociation from heme a3 after oxygen addition (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A global fit by the sequential reactions model (23.Jasaitis A. Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Verkhovskaya M.L. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was applied to obtain the kinetic spectrum of the slow component of the oxygen reaction using MATLAB software. Monitoring the oxygen reaction by time-resolved visible and infrared spectroscopy was done using the same ATR sample of CcO in “ice-cooled” conditions (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to increase the oxygen concentration in the injected buffer and to slow down the rate of the reaction. Anaerobic Equilibrium pH and Redox Titration of the Band at 1308 cm-1 in Wild Type CcO—The FTIR spectra of the fully reduced to fully oxidized (R→O) transition were monitored at anaerobic equilibrium conditions. The reduced (0 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode) and oxidized (+480 mV) potentials were set by a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN) that was connected to a flow-through electrochemical cell (24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5641-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two redox mediators (one for reducing and one for oxidizing potentials) were used to speed up the redox events. The R→O spectra were registered in the pH range 5.2–9.6 as described previously in detail (25.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4177-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The redox titration of CcO in the infrared region was performed in the potential range 0 to +480 mV with a step of 40 mV, at three pH values, 6.5, 8, and 9, as described in Ref. 24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5641-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. The potential adjustment was done in the same way as for the pH titration but with a set of mediators that covers the whole studied potential range. The amplitude of the peak at 1308 cm-1 at different pH and redox values was estimated as the difference between the amplitude of the peak maximum and one half of the sum of the amplitudes of adjacent troughs. Data Analysis—All data analysis and presentation were done in the MATLAB software. The N131V Mutation Slows Down Relaxation of the Ferryl Intermediate—Asn-131 is located near the entrance of the proton conducting D-channel, at an ∼20 Å distance from Glu-278 (2.Iwata S.

Rigaud J.L. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10128-10131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28.Ädelroth P. Ek M.S. Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13824-13829Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutation of Asn-131 to the non-polar valine results in complete loss of proton pumping and a strongly inhibited oxygen reduction activity (29.Pfitzner U. Hoffmeier K. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Michel H. Bamberg E. Richter O.M. Ludwig B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6756-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reaction of the N131V variant, immobilized on the ATR prism, with oxygen was followed by visible time-resolved spectroscopy to define the reaction step at which catalysis is inhibited. The kinetic surface of spectral changes obtained in this way revealed two major features: (i) an absorbance jump immediately (within 1 ms) after the laser flash and (ii) a subsequent time-resolved component of the reaction. At pH 6.5, the time-resolved spectral component developed with τ (time constant = 1/k, where k is the rate constant) ∼90 ms (Fig. 1) and was characterized by the disappearance of bands at 608 (with shoulder at 575) and 444 nm and appearance of bands of oxidized heme a3 at 416 and 666 nm. The observed troughs belong to the ferryl (F) intermediate, including oxidation of the heme a and the peaks to the fully oxidized (O) species (30.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31.Siletsky S. Kaulen A.D. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4853-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed time-resolved reaction component is the F→O transition, which is slowed down considerably by the N131V mutation, a behavior very similar to the effect of the D124N mutation (32.Garcia-Horsman J.A. Puustinen A. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4428-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33.Smirnova I.A. Ädelroth P. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6826-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which “blocks” the D-channel. It is clear, therefore, that the N131V mutation also blocks the D-channel, which is in line with the observation that the formation of both the F and the O intermediates demand proton uptake via the D-channel (34.Konstantinov A.A. Siletsky S. Mitchell D. Kaulen A. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, even when the D-channel is blocked, the formation of the F intermediate occurs on a normal time scale (∼120 μs (33.Smirnova I.A. Ädelroth P. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6826-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) because the proton required to generate the F state is taken from Glu-278 (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33.Smirnova I.A. Ädelroth P. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6826-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at the top of the D-channel. Because the fast steps of the oxygen reaction with the N131V mutant proceed up to the ferryl intermediate and the relaxation of this intermediate is strongly inhibited, the R→F and F→O transitions can be separated in time and thus their infrared spectra can be obtained, and the protonation status of the Tyr-280 in the F and O states can be assessed. Protonation State of Tyr-280 in the Ferryl Intermediate—The oxygen reaction of the N131V variant was followed by time-resolved FTIR with ∼46-ms resolution/spectrum in the spectral range 1800–1000 cm-1. As a result, 338 and 218 kinetic surfaces were averaged, at pH 6.5 and pH 9, respectively. The data surfaces were again composed of two reaction-related events: (i) an absorbance jump that happened immediately after the laser flash (i.e. within ∼46 ms) and (ii) the time-resolved part of the reaction. The former event includes processes faster than 46 ms, i.e. starting from CO photolysis, and ending up by the formation of the ferryl state. Thus, the absorbance jump on the laser flash represents the spectrum of the FRCO→F transition. Here, and further in all other kinetic experiments, the spectrum of CO photolysis itself was subtracted, thus yielding in this case the spectrum of the R→F transition (Fig. 2, in blue for pH 6.5 and in red for pH 9). Both spectra revealed a band at 1308 cm-1 in the F intermediate that was earlier assigned to the deprotonated anionic Tyr-280 (17.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich I. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10733-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the spectrum of the R→F transition, this band appears with equal amplitude at both acidic and alkaline pH values. The same amplitude was found during the formation of the PR intermediate (17.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich I. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10733-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) where Tyr-280 is fully deprotonated. We conclude that Tyr-280 is also fully deprotonated in the F intermediate in the pH range 6.5–9. Protonation State of Tyr-280 in the Fully Oxidized Intermediate—The protonation state of Tyr-280 in the fully oxidized species (O) was studied by three different approaches: (i) in the N131V mutant by time-resolved flow-flash FTIR, (ii) in wild type enzyme by time-resolved flow-flash FTIR, and (iii) in wild type enzyme at anaerobic equilibrium conditions. In all three cases, the protonation state of Tyr-280 was probed as a function of pH. With the N131V mutant enzyme, the slow event in the oxygen reaction is the relaxation of the F intermediate into the fully oxidized state. At pH 6.5, the spectral component that corresponds to this transition developed with τ ∼90 ms (Fig. 3, blue line); the same component at pH 9 was slowed down to τ ∼600 ms (Fig. 3, red line). The equality of these spectra with the FTIR spectrum of the F→O transition of the D124N mutant (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) serves as one more proof (in addition to the time-resolved spectra in the visible range, see above) that the F compound relaxes to the O state in the N131V variant. In the mutant, the FTIR spectrum of the F→O transition at pH 6.5 shows a trough at 1308 cm-1, which is absent at pH 9 (Fig. 3, inset). Because the amplitude of this band in the R→F transition is the same at both pH values, it suggests that Tyr-280 becomes partially reprotonated in the O intermediate at acidic conditions. To compare the protonation state of Tyr-280 in the fully oxidized state of the N131V mutant and wild type, the spectra of the R→F and F→O transitions of the mutant were summed to obtain the spectrum of the entire R→O transition (Fig. 4). This procedure was required because the oxygen reaction of wild type enzyme is faster than the time resolution of the FTIR flow-flash approach, which precluded an assessment of the F→O transition (see below). The R→O spectra measured for the mutant at pH 6.5 (in blue) and 9 (in red) revealed a clear difference in the amplitude of the 1308-cm-1 band (Fig. 4). At pH 9, the 1308-cm-1 band shows full amplitude (relative to the amplitude during the formation of PR), whereas the amplitude at pH 6.5 is decreased. As already concluded, this is due to partial reprotonation of Tyr-280 in the O state at acidic conditions. The oxygen reaction of wild type CcO was measured by the same FTIR flow-flash approach. Because the oxygen reaction of wild type enzyme (∼10 ms (35.Ribacka C. Verkhovsky M.I. Belevich I. Bloch D.A. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16502-16512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) proceeds faster than the resolution of our method (∼46 ms/spectrum), the FTIR spectrum of the entire FRCO→O transition was obtained as an absorbance jump immediately (within 46 ms) after the laser flash. The spectrum of CO photodissociation was again subtracted to obtain the R→O spectra at pH 6 and 9 (Fig. 5). Both spectra are quite similar to the spectra of the equivalent transition of the N131V variant (cf. Fig. 4). They also demonstrate a decrease in the amplitude of the 1308-cm-1 band at acidic conditions, indicating partial reprotonation of the tyrosine in the O state. The spectra of the R→O transition measured with wild type enzyme at equilibrium conditions (25.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4177-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36.Hellwig P. Rost B. Kaiser U. Ostermeier C. Michel H. Mäntele W.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14370-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed high equivalence to the kinetic R→O spectra of both mutated and wild type enzymes reported here. pH and Redox Properties of Tyr-280 in the Fully Oxidized State in Wild Type at Anaerobic Equilibrium Conditions—The spectra of the R→O transition were measured at anaerobic equilibrium conditions in the pH range 5.2–9.6. The pH dependence of the protonation level of Tyr-280 in the O state was in this case obtained from the amplitude of the band at 1308 cm-1 in the R→O spectrum within the studied pH range (Fig. 6A). This pH dependence can be fitted by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pKa ∼6.6 and a Hill coefficient of ∼0.5. The amplitude of the 1308-cm-1 band in the R→O transition, but measured in the time-resolved mode for the N131V mutant and wild type enzymes, are plotted in the same figure (squares and rhombs, correspondingly). Thus, the protonation levels of Tyr-280 in the O intermediate at equilibrium and time-resolved conditions are identical within experimental error. Equilibrium redox titrations of the band at 1308 cm-1 were performed at three pH values (6.5, 8, and 9) (Fig. 6B) and revealed that the redox behavior can be fitted by a single Nernstian equation with corresponding midpoint redox potentials (Em) of 412, 366, and 314 mV. Such a pH dependence of Em ∼60 mV/pH unit in the alkaline range is characteristic for oxidoreduction of CuB (24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I.

Biophys. 1976; 175: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase is composed of a number of intermediate states of the binuclear reaction center, shown schematically in Fig. 7. One of the problems with describing this cycle has all along been the assignment of the precise protonation state of each intermediate, which is essential not only for the mechanism of O2 reduction but especially for understanding the proton pump machinery. This work has made it possible to assign the protonation state of the cross-linked Tyr-280 at each intermediate, which plays an important role in both aspects of catalysis. The first intermediate of the catalytic cycle, compound A (ferrous-oxygen compound), is formed when the O2 molecule binds to reduced heme a3. During compound A formation, i.e. the R→A transition, the protonation state of Tyr-280 is not expected to change, and this reaction is indeed found not to be coupled to charge transfer perpendicular to the membrane (23.Jasaitis A. Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Verkhovskaya M.L. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The next reaction (starting from the fully reduced enzyme) is the formation of the PR intermediate, which is associated with splitting of the O–O bond. The cross-linked Tyr-280 provides the proton required for this reaction and becomes deprotonated, as shown by appearance of the band at 1308 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum of the R→PR transition (17.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich I. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10733-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we have explored the protonation state of Tyr-280 further in the catalytic cycle, in the ferryl (F), fully oxidized (O), and one-electron reduced (E) intermediates by FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of enzyme transitions are often very complicated and composed of a number of bands (see for example Ref. 39.Gerwert K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Earlier studies assigned infrared bands in the spectrum of the R→O transition at anaerobic equilibrium conditions (12.Iwaki M. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10873-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5641-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40.Hellwig P. Grzybek S. Behr J. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W.

So far, only a few of them have been time-resolved during the catalytic cycle. One such band is the carboxylic acid feature at ∼1739 cm-1 belonging to Glu-278, which becomes deprotonated in the F state of mutants with a blocked D-channel. In the same mutated variants, Glu-278 becomes reprotonated in the fully oxidized species giving rise to a corresponding band at ∼1743 cm-1 (Figs. 2 and 3) (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the spectrum of the R→O transition, where Glu-278 is protonated in both intermediates, the signature of this band is seen as a shift (Figs. 4 and 5) (20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42.Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.M.H. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another feature identified in the kinetic FTIR spectra of CcO is the band at 1308 cm-1 assigned to the anionic cross-linked Tyr-280 and which is further analyzed in this work. The protonation state of Tyr-280 was followed using the N131V variant, in which it was shown that the relaxation of compound F into the O state was decelerated. By applying a time-resolved FTIR flow-flash approach, we found that the tyrosine remains fully deprotonated in the F species between pH 6.5 and 9 (Fig. 2) (see also Fig. 5 in Ref. 20.Gorbikova E.A. Belevich N.P. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13141-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for the same band but in the D124N mutant). Thus, it can be concluded that the pKa of Tyr-280 is lower than ∼5.5 in the F intermediate. The protonation state of Tyr-280 in the O intermediate was resolved in three independent cases: in (i) N131V mutant, the protonation state of Tyr-280 exhibits a pH dependence (Fig. 4) very similar to that in (ii) the kinetically resolved O intermediate of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 5) and in (iii) the O intermediate of wild type enzyme measured at anaerobic equilibrium conditions (Fig. 6A). This equivalence of the protonation state of Tyr-280 reflects a similar charge configuration of the binuclear center and its surroundings in the O intermediate in these three cases. This is an important point with respect to discussions about differences between kinetically resolved and equilibrium O species. Our finding shows the equality of both kinetically resolved and equilibrium O intermediates with respect to the protonation state of Tyr-280, which has a pKa of ∼6.6 in the O species in all three independently measured cases. When F turns into O, the pKa of the tyrosine thus shifts from <5.5 to ∼6.6, and the question arises as to the cause of this shift. In this transition, the binuclear site receives one electron and one proton, presumably generating ferric heme a3 with an axial OH- ligand (10.Han S. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D.L. Nature. 1990; 348: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas the CuB site remains cupric in both states. Although the overall formal charge of the binuclear site thus remains the same in the ferryl and fully oxidized states, the charge distribution may differ such that the negative charge of the OH- ligand on ferric heme a3 causes the increase in the pKa of Tyr-280. Because the number of protons taken up from the medium on reduction of the fully oxidized CcO is virtually pH-independent (44.Mitchell R. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the partial reprotonation of Tyr-280 in the O species at acidic conditions is likely to be due to internal proton transfer from a neighboring protolytic residue, most likely Lys-354, without proton uptake from the outside. Moreover, the pH dependence of the protonation state of Tyr-280 measured at equilibrium conditions exhibits a slope with a Hill coefficient of ∼0.5 (Fig. 6A), which implies electrostatic interactions of the tyrosine with one or several surrounding residues. Although it has been shown here that the protonation level of Tyr-280 varies with pH in the O state, it is expected to be fully deprotonated in most physiological conditions. Tyr-280 is located in the hydrophobic area of the membrane, ⅔ of its thickness from the negatively charged N-side (mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm). Such a location, and proton connectivity with the N-side of the membrane via the proton-conducting K-channel (see for example Ref. 2.Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), will change the pKa of the tyrosine at the bottom of the channel in the presence of ΔμH+. For example, in the case in which the transmembrane electric potential is 180 mV, the pKa of the tyrosine should be lowered by approximately two pKa units relative to the case without membrane potential. The next step in the catalytic cycle, after the O species (Fig. 7), is the formation of the one-electron reduced (E) state. At equilibrium conditions, the E state is characterized as a mixture where heme a, heme a3, and CuB are all partially reduced due to the similarity of their Em values (24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5641-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 45.Moody A.J. Brandt U. Rich P.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We previously assigned the redox properties of the band at 1308 cm-1 to oxidoreduction of CuB because it titrates in the potential region expected for this center, and the pH dependence of the midpoint potential is ∼60 mV/pH unit (24.Gorbikova E.A. Vuorilehto K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5641-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38.Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Owen C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Disappearance of the band at 1308 cm-1 on reduction in such equilibrium redox titrations therefore suggests that protonation of Tyr-280 correlates with reduction of the CuB site. This observation suggests that during the catalytic cycle (Fig. 7), Tyr-280 should become fully reprotonated at the transition of the fully oxidized to the one-electron reduced state (O→E), which in non-equilibrium conditions is associated with exclusive reduction of CuB (46.Belevich I. Bloch D.A. Belevich N. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2685-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The last step in the catalytic cycle is the reduction of the binuclear site to the fully reduced form (the E→R transition), which was the reference state in all our experiments. Tyr-280 is thus fully protonated in the R state of the binuclear site. We thank Anne Puustinen and Camilla Ribacka for production of the N131V mutant of CcO from P. denitrificans."

Recent studies demonstrate that, by altering the subcellular localization patterns, light controls the activity of photoreceptors. The cytosolic phytochromes are translocated into the nucleus upon light-mediated activation. Whereas cry2 is constitutively localized in the nucleus, cry1 is nuclear in the dark and is mostly cytoplasmic in the presence of light. cry3 has recently been shown to be transported into the chloroplast and mitochondria. Phototropins are mostly associated with the plasma membrane, and at least some fraction of phot1 is released into the cytoplasm upon light-mediated activation (7Briggs W.R. Christie J.M.

Among these regulatory proteins, HYH, AtPP7, MYC2, and GBF1 are specifically involved in blue light-mediated photomorphogenic growth.Photomorphogenesis is associated with several physiological responses that include: opening of apical hooks, expansion of cotyledons, inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, far-red light controlled blocking of greening, and accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanin (20Nagatani A.

In this study, we show the functional relationships of GBF1 with two well-characterized negative regulators of light signaling, COP1 and SPA1, in Arabidopsis seedling development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Generation of Double Mutants—Surface-sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were sown on MS plates, stratified at 4 °C in darkness for 3–5 days, and transferred to specific light conditions at 22 °C. The Arabidopsis growth conditions and the intensities of continuous light sources used in this study have been described in a previous study (18Yadav V. Mallappa C. Gangappa S.N. Bhatia S. Chattopadhyay S. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For the generation of double mutants, such as gbf1-1 cop1-4, gbf1-1 cop1-6, or gbf1-1 spa1-1 homozygous gbf1-1 mutant plants were crossed individually with cop1-4, cop1-6, or spa1-1 homozygous mutant lines. In F2 generation, seedlings were grown in WL (60 mmol m-2 s-1) for the identification of cop1-4 or cop1-6 homozygous lines, or FR (40 mmol m-2 s-1) for spa1-1 homozygous lines, and seedlings with typical short hypocotyls phenotype of cop1 mutants were selected and transferred to soil. For spa1, seedlings were kept in WL for 2 days and then short hypocotyls phenotype spa1 mutants were transferred to soil. To determine the genotype at gbf1 locus, ∼40 seedlings from each line were tested by genomic PCR. F3 progeny that are homozygous for gbf1-1 mutant plants were further examined and considered as gbf1 cop1-4, gbf1 cop1-6, or gbf1 spa1 double mutants. Blocking of greening phenotype of cop1 and gbf1 cop1 was done as described before (47Ang L.H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 613-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Root growth and flowering phenotype experiments were carried out essentially as described (19Mallappa C. Yadav V. Negi P. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol.

DMSO under required conditions as indicated in text for 12 h. At the end of the incubation, the seedlings were thoroughly washed with liquid MS medium three times to remove residual proteasome inhibitor or DMSO, and the seedlings were either incubated in liquid MS medium for different time points as indicated in text or frozen in liquid nitrogen for total protein extraction.Affinity Purification of GBF1 Antibody—The antibody of GBF1 was raised against N-terminal GBF1 protein (from 1 to 172 amino acids) by Bangalore GeneI, Bangalore, India. The steps of affinity purification of antibodies are given below.Ligand coupling: 2–3 mg of 6× His-ΔN-ZBF2 protein was dialyzed against 13! polyethylene glycol 8000 in coupling buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) to concentrate to 1 ml. The top cap of the NHS-HP column was removed, and a drop of ice-cold 1 mm HCl was added to avoid air bubbles. A Hi-Trap adaptor was connected to the top of the column. Isopropanol in the column was washed with ice-cold 1 mm HCl with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Immediately afterward, 1 ml of ligand solution was injected into the column, and the column was left to stand for 4 h at 4 °C. Any excess active groups not coupled to the ligand were deactivated and washed out by washing with Buffer A (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) and Buffer B (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0). Finally, 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer with neutral pH was injected.Antibody purification: A blank run was performed before the experiment to ensure loosely bound ligand is washed off. The column was prepared by washing with 3 ml of start buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) and 3 ml of elution buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5). The column was equilibrated with 10 column volumes of start buffer. Antibody sample was adjusted to the composition of start buffer. This was done by diluting the sample with start buffer. The sample was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before it was applied to the column. Antibody sample was applied using a syringe fitted to luer adaptor. A flow rate of 0.2–1 ml/min was maintained. The column was incubated for 4–6 h in a cold room. Then the column was washed with 5–10 column volumes of start buffer, until no material was left in the effluent. Antibody was eluted with 1–3 ml of elution buffer. Column was re-equilibrated by washing with 5–10 column volumes of start buffer. Column is stored in storage buffer (0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1! sodium azide, pH 7.0).Total Protein Extraction from Arabidopsis—The seedlings (100 mg) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in 300 μl of grinding buffer (400 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10! glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added (0.5 μl for every 100 μl of grinding buffer). The protein extract was transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to pellet down the debris. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and an aliquot of 5 μl was taken out in a separate tube for the estimation of protein by Bradford assay. To the rest of the protein extract, appropriate volume of 4× sample buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 4! SDS, 0.025! Bromphenol Blue, 20! glycerol), i.e. 1/4th of grinding buffer = volume of 4× sample buffer, was added and boiled for 5 min before loading on SDS-PAGE.Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) and following the instructions as described in the user's manual provided by the manufacturer. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) at 100 mA for 2 h in transfer buffer (Tris (7.56 g), glycine (47 g), 20! methanol in 2.5 liters) in Mini blot protein gel apparatus (GE Healthcare). 40 μg of total protein was used for Western blot analysis. The membrane was stained with Ponceau-S to confirm the protein transfer and washed with sterile milli-Q water. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in 2 ml of blocking buffer (5! nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05! Tween 20) at room temperature with shaking. The blocking reagent was removed, and the affinity-purified primary antibody diluted (1:300 to 1:500) in 15 ml of blocking buffer with 0.05! Tween 20 was added and incubated for 2 h with shaking at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with 15 ml of wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline and 0.05! Tween 20) for thrice, 5 min each. The secondary antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted (1:20,000) in 15 ml of blocking buffer with 0.05! Tween 20, was added and incubated for 1 h with shaking at room temperature. The membrane was washed with 15 ml of wash buffer for five times at room temperature. The working solution of substrate was prepared by mixing peroxide solution and luminol/enhancer solution in 1:1 ratio, and the blot was incubated in that working solution for 5 min in darkness. The blot was then removed from the working solution and covered with plastic wrap in a cassette and exposed to x-ray film for different times. The actin band probed with anti-actin (Catalog no. A0A80, Sigma) antibodies was used as a loading control.Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—In vitro binding assay: GST and GST-GBF1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain (BL21/DE3) and purified using glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) as described (18Yadav V. Mallappa C. Gangappa S.N. Bhatia S. Chattopadhyay S. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). About 5 mg of GST or GST-GBF1 was bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads by incubating for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed and incubated with COP1–6His (5 mg) for overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed thrice with the binding buffer, boiled with the loading dye, and loaded onto the SDS-PAGE. The blot was probed with anti-COP1 antibodies. To generate constructs for yeast two-hybrid assays, full-length GBF1 and HY5 were cloned into pGADT7 vector with ECOR1-BamH1 and Nde1-Cla1 restriction sites, respectively, to produce translational fusions with the activation domain. To generate DBD-COP1, an EcoR1-Pst1 PCR fragment of full-length COP1 was cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) to produce translational fusion with DNA binding domain. The constructs were transformed into Yeast strain AH109 according to the Clontech protocol. Expression of AD-GBF1 and AD-HY5 fusion proteins were examined by hemagglutinin and DBD-COP1 by c-Myc antibodies. The protein-protein interactions were examined by β-galactosidase assays. The relative β-galactosidase activities were calculated according to Clontech instructions. In vitro The coimmunoprecipitation experiment was as follows: ∼5 mg of anti-GST antibodies was bound to protein A-agarose beads by incubating for 6 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads bound to the antibodies, GST-GBF1 and COP1–6His proteins were added and incubated for overnight at 4 °C in a 250-ml reaction volume. Beads (pellet) were washed thrice with the binding buffer, boiled with the loading dye, and loaded separately along with the supernatant onto SDS-PAGE. The blot was probed with anti-COP1 antibodies.Chlorophyll and Anthocyanin Measurements—Chlorophyll and anthocyanin levels were measured following protocols as described in a previous study (15Holm M. Ma L.-G Qn L.-J. Deng X.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).Quantitative Real-time PCR Analyses—Wild-type and different mutant seedlings were grown under required conditions. Total RNA was extracted from seedlings at different time points using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA were synthesized from total RNA using a Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR analyses of gene expression were carried out by using LightCycler® FastStart DNA Master-PLUS SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) and LightCycler® 2.0 system (Roche Applied Science). Primer sequences used for PCR amplification of CAB1 were 5′-CCCATTTCTTGGCTTACAACAAC-3′ and 5′-TCGGGGTCAGCTGAAAGTCCG-3′; primers for RBCS-1A were 5′-GAGTCACACAAAGAGTAAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTAGCCAATTCGGAATCGGT-3′; primers for ADH1 were 5′-CCGAAAGACCATGACAAGCCAA-3′ and 5′-GATGCAACGAATACTCTCTCCC-3′; primers for ACTIN2 were 5′-GCCATCCAAGCTGTTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-GCTCGTAGTCAACAGCAACAA-3′. The transcript levels are normalized to the level of ACTIN2 transcript abundance.RESULTSThe Photomorphogenic Growth of cop1 Mutants in Dark Is Enhanced in gbf1 cop1 Double Mutants—Acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1 helps to degrade or stabilize several regulatory proteins in darkness and thereby suppresses photomorphogenesis. The cop1 mutants display photomorphogenic growth in the dark and hypersensitive responses to various wavelengths of light. We ask whether the BL-specific transcription factor, GBF1, which plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in light signaling, is functionally related to COP1. Among the various alleles of cop1 mutants identified and characterized, cop1-4 and cop1-6 mutants are relatively weak alleles, and cop1-6 mutants display shorter hypocotyl than cop1-4 in the darkness. Because the null alleles of cop1 are seedling-lethal, we chose cop1-4 and cop1-6 mutants for our studies. Whereas cop1-4 encodes a truncated COP1 terminated at amino acid 282, cop1-6 allele contains an in-frame five-amino acid insertion between codons 301 and 302.To determine the genetic interactions between COP1 and GBF1, we constructed gbf1-1 cop1-4 and gbf1-1 cop1-6 double mutants and investigated the morphology of the double mutants in darkness and various light conditions. Although gbf1 seedlings did not exhibit any altered morphology in darkness, gbf1 cop1 double mutants exhibited shorter hypocotyl than cop1 mutants, suggesting that gbf1 and cop1 function synergistically in repressing photomorphogenic growth in the darkness (Fig. 1A). We then examined the growth of 6-day-old gbf1 cop1 double mutants under various light conditions, including red light (RL), far-red light (FR), and blue light (BL). The gbf1 cop1 double mutants were significantly shorter than cop1 or gbf1 single mutants in BL (Fig. 1B), indicating an additive effect of gbf1 and cop1 mutations on BL-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. However, in WL (white light), RL, or FR, gbf1 cop1 seedlings were morphologically indistinguishable from cop1 single mutants, suggesting that cop1 is epistatic to gbf1 in WL-, RL-, or FR-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation (Fig. 1, C–E).Although GBF1 plays a negative regulatory role in BL-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, it acts as a positive regulator of cotyledon expansion. The cotyledons of gbf1 mutants are less expanded compared with corresponding wild-type seedlings (19Mallappa C. Yadav V. Negi P. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22190-22199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The BL-grown cop1-4 mutant seedlings have more expanded cotyledons than wild type, however this effect is less prominent in cop1-6 mutant seedlings. Examination of the cotyledon size revealed that gbf1 cop1 double mutants have cotyledon size similar to wild-type seedlings suggesting that GBF1 and COP1 function antagonistically in regulating the BL-mediated cotyledon expansion (Fig. 1F).The Fusca and Blocking of Greening Phenotypes of cop1 Are Further Enhanced in gbf1 cop1 Double Mutants—The cop1 mutants display dark purple color fusca phenotype due to high level accumulation of anthocyanin, however such effects are not visible in gbf1 mutants. The number of fusca phenotype, when examined, was dramatically increased in gbf1 cop1 double mutants as compared with cop1 single mutants. Although the effect was only visible in gbf1 cop1-6 double mutants at lower fluence rates of WL, both gbf1 cop1-4 and gbf1 cop1-6 double mutants displayed higher percentage of fusca phenotype at higher intensity of WL (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with this observation, the quantification of anthocyanin levels revealed an increase in anthocyanin accumulation in gbf1 cop1 double mutants as compared with cop1 alone (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Physiological properties of gbf1 cop1 double mutants. A and B, percentage of fusca phenotype in 6-day-old seedlings grown at various fluences of WL. C, accumulation of anthocyanin in 6-day-old seedlings grown in WL (90 μmol m-2 s-1).

E, accumulation of chlorophyll in 6-day-old seedlings grown in WL (90 μmol m-2 s-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dark-grown cop1 mutants are sensitive to high intensity light, and some of them do not turn green when transferred to light. The COP1-mediated blocking of greening phenotype becomes more intense with longer incubation in the darkness (47Ang L.H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 613-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the blocking of greening effects in gbf1 cop1 double mutants. A lower percentage of gbf1 cop1 double mutants than cop1 alone were able to turn green when 5-day-old dark-grown seedlings were transferred to light (Fig. 2D), suggesting that gbf1 can enhance the blocking of greening phenotype of cop1. Examination of chlorophyll contents reveals that the chlorophyll content of gbf1 cop1 double mutants was lower than either of the single mutants (Fig. 2E).The Altered Root Growth and Flowering Time of cop1 Mutants Are Enhanced by Additional Loss of Function of GBF1—Both cop1 and gbf1 plants show less number of lateral roots compared with wild-type plants, although the effect is more pronounced in cop1 mutants. To determine the genetic relationships between cop1 and gbf1 mutant plants in lateral root formation, we examined the root growth of 16-day-old gbf1 cop1 double mutants and compared with cop1 or gbf1 single mutants. As shown in Fig. 3A, gbf1 cop1 double mutants developed fewer lateral roots compared with gbf1 or cop1 single mutants. There was hardly any lateral root visible in gbf1 cop1-6 double mutants up to 16 days. Mutations in GBF1 or COP1 result in early flowering under long day conditions. Examination of flowering time in gbf1 cop1 double mutants revealed that the early flowering phenotype of gbf1 is significantly (p < 0.02) enhanced in gbf1 cop1 double mutant background under long day conditions (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Characterization of gbf1 cop1 adult plants.

https://openalex.org/W2025260671,"The regulation of phosphatidylserine (PS) distribution across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells has been implicated in numerous cell functions (e.g. apoptosis and coagulation). In a recent study, fluorescent phospholipids labeled in the acyl chain with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl (NBD) were used to identify two members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases, Dnf1p and Dnf2p, that are necessary for the inward-directed transport of phospholipids across the plasma membrane (flip) of yeast (Pomorski, T., Lombardi, R., Riezman, H., Devaux, P. F., Van Meer, G., and Holthuis, J. C. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell14, 1240-1254). Herein, we present evidence that the flip of NBD-labeled PS (NBD-PS) across the plasma membrane does not require the expression of Dnf1p or Dnf2p. In strains in which DNF1 and DNF2 are both deleted, the flip of NBD-PS is increased ∼2-fold over that of the isogenic parent strain, whereas the flip of NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine and NBD-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine are reduced to ∼20 and ∼50%, respectively. The mechanism responsible for NBD-PS flip is similar to that for NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine and NBD-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine in its dependence on cellular ATP and the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient, as well as its regulation by the transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p. Based on the observation that deletion or inactivation of all four members of the DRS2/DNF essential subfamily of P-type ATPases does not affect NBD-PS flip, we conclude that the activity reflected by NBD-PS internalization is not the essential function of the DRS2/DNF subfamily of P-type ATPases.

The most common phospholipids that comprise the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells are asymmetrically distributed between the two leaflets of the bilayer (for recent reviews see Refs. 1.Daleke D.L.

Bull. 2006; 29: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This nonrandom distribution is maintained in a dynamic steady state in part by the activity of translocases that move phospholipids in the inward (referred to as flip) and outward (referred to as flop) direction across the plasma membrane. The net result in most actively growing cells is to sequester the majority of the amino phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine) on the inner cytoplasmic leaflet and the choline phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) on the outer exoplasmic leaflet. As cells age or when triggered into apoptosis, the phospholipids of the plasma membrane are redistributed toward equilibrium resulting in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the exoplasmic surface. In vertebrates the presence of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells is a signal for clearance by macrophages. Phospholipids with fluorescent or spin-labeled reporter groups attached to their sn2 acyl chain have been used to investigate the mechanisms by which phospholipids are transported across the plasma membrane (4.Pomorski T. Menon A.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2908-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6.Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using this approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, members of two classes of proteins have been identified that are required for phospholipid flip across the plasma membrane. The first to be identified was LEM3/ROS3, which is a member of the CDC50 family (10.Kato U. Emoto K. Fredriksson C. Nakamura H. Ohta A. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Umeda M. J. Biol.

Deletion of LEM3/ROS3 produces a strain in which the flip of NBD 2The abbreviations used are: NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; NBD-PC, 1-myristoyl-2-[6-(NBD)-aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylcholine; NBD-PE, 1-myristoyl-2-[6-(NBD)-aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylethanolamine; NBD-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-(NBD)-aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylserine; P-NBD-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-(NBD)-aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylcholine; P-NBD-PE, 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-(NBD)-aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylethanolamine; FM4-64, N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; SC-azide, SDC lacking glucose, but containing 2% sorbitol and 20 mm sodium azide.-labeled phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC) is inhibited by ∼90%, that of NBD-PE is inhibited by ∼50%, and that of NBD-PS is unaffected. The second class of proteins comprises a subfamily of P-type ATPases. The subfamily 4 of the P-type ATPases includes two members, DNF1 and DNF2, reported to be required for normal flip of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine as assayed by NBD-labeled fluorescent analogues (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 in combination was reported to almost completely inhibit the ATP-dependent flip of NBD-PC, NBD-PE, and NBD-PS. In the current study, we present evidence that the flip of NBD-PS across the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae does not require the expression of DNF1 or DNF2 suggesting that it is flipped across the plasma membrane by a different mechanism from that of NBD-PC and NBD-PE. Based on the observation that deletion or inactivation of all four members of the DRS2/DNF essential subfamily of P-type ATPases (13.Hua Z. Fatheddin P. Graham T.R. Mol. Biol.

Materials—Yeast medium was purchased from Difco, Inc. NBD-PC, P-NBD-PC, NBD-PE, P-NBD-PE, and NBD-PS were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipids were stored at -20 °C and were monitored periodically for breakdown via TLC. Unless otherwise noted, all other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Yeast Strains and Culture—Strains used in this study were from our laboratory collection or kindly donated by Todd Graham (Vanderbilt University) (Table 1). Unless otherwise noted, all cells were grown to early log phase (A600 = 0.2-0.4) from overnight cultures in YPD (complete medium with 1.0% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% glucose, and 2% Bacto-peptone) or SDC (synthetic complete medium with 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, complete amino acid supplements) media at 30 °C, as described before (15.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). For growth phase studies, cells were diluted to early log phase every 2 h and grown until 2 h after the last dilution was made. Confirmation of the deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 was done via PCR using KanB and KanC primers (Invitrogen) with the following sequences. Dnf1: AAATTTCACAGAGCAAAGTCTCACT (A) and TACGTATCACGGCTTGATTAATTCT (D); Dnf2: ATAGACAAACCAGATTCATCGCTTA (A) and CCGTAAAGTAGTTACTTGCCACAAT (D). For culture density experiments, at the end of the growing phase, cells were normalized to the lowest A600 value prior to labeling, to ensure the same number of cells was labeled with NBD-phospholipids.TABLE 1Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource/referenceBY4242MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0ATCCBY4141MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 met15Δ0ATCCLMY165MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 dnf1Δ::KanMX4YER4242W BY4242 from ATCCLMY166MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0 dnf2Δ::KanMX4YDR093W BY4242 from ATCCHCY13MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 met15Δ0 dnf1Δ::KanMX4 dnf2Δ::KanMX4T.

Riezman Open table in a new tab Drug Treatment—Collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane was accomplished by treating cells with CCCP prior to labeling. CCCP was dissolved in 95% ethanol (5 mm stock) and added to cells at 50 μm final concentration for 10 min at 30 °C, prior to labeling. For ethanol experiments, early log phase cells were harvested and resuspended in SDC with varying percentages of ethanol (0-10% v/v) for a total volume of 0.5 ml and incubated 10 min at 30 °C, prior to labeling. For ATP depletion experiments, cells were pretreated with SC-azide for 10 min at 30 °C. Lipid was added directly to the media, and cells were incubated at either 2 °C or 30 °C. Latrunculin A was suspended in DMSO (5 mm stock) and added at a final concentration of 20 μm. Internalization of Phospholipids into Yeast Cells—NBD-phospholipid internalization by yeast was performed as described previously (16.Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBD-phospholipids were dried down under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in DMSO at 5 mm. NBD-phospholipids were added to early log phase cultures (A600 = 0.2-0.4) in 0.5 ml of SDC at a final concentration of 5 μm for NBD-PC and NBD-PE or 10 μm for NBD-PS. Cells were vortex-mixed and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C or for 1 h on ice (2 °C). Cells were centrifuged and washed three times with two volumes of ice-cold SC-azide to prevent lipid efflux. Because essentially no NBD-PS fluorescence was detected in the plasma membrane of washed cells (Fig. 1B), nor was additional NBD-PS fluorescence removed by washing with buffer containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), flow cytometric measurement of cell-associated fluorescence was interpreted to reflect net intracellular accumulation. Flow Cytometry—Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur cytometer BD Biosciences) as previously described (17.Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To gate dead cells from the analysis, 10 μl of 50 μg/ml stock of propidium iodide was added to ∼4 × 105 NBD-phospholipid-labeled cells in ∼100 μl of SC-azide immediately prior to analysis. Readings were taken on the flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser at 488 nm. CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) were used to analyze and quantify the data. For comparison of deletion strains with parent cells, gating was performed for the analysis between forward scatter of 150-750 to ensure that similar sized cells were compared. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope complete with barrier filters allowing for NBD-phospholipid detection. Filter sets were obtained from Chroma Technology Corp. A multi-band dichroic mirror (8600 BS) was used to detect the NBD fluorophore at a filter combination exciter S490/20 and emitter S528/38. The images were captured by a Qimaging Retiga Exi charge-coupled device camera and analyzed via Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). All images compared in the same figure were adjusted to the same background and intensity and are representative of the entire population of cells. NBD-PS Flip Is Not Dependent on Dnf1p or Dnf2p Expression—The rate of NBD-labeled phospholipid uptake into S. cerevisiae is determined by three independently regulated processes: the rate of unidirectional influx across the plasma membrane (referred to as flip), the rate of unidirectional efflux across the plasma membrane (referred to as flop), and the rate of internalization by endocytosis (8.Nichols J.W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the net uptake of the NBD-PC and NBD-PE at 2 °C is dependent solely on the process of flip. This is because both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis (18.Riezman H. Cell. 1985; 40: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19.Riezman H. Chvatchko Y. Dulic V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) and outward-directed transport across the plasma membrane (flop) (16.Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are essentially blocked at this temperature. The low temperature block of endocytosis was confirmed by measuring the uptake of the endocytosis marker, FM4-64, in the two primary strains used in this study (Fig. 1D). We also confirmed that, like NBD-PC and NBD-PE, NBD-PS is rapidly effluxed (flopped) (t½ ≈ 20 min) at 30 °C and is essentially blocked at 2 °C (data not shown). Measurement of the time course of the low temperature internalization of the three NBD-labeled phospholipids demonstrated that after 1 h of labeling, the internalization had not reached equilibrium and was still increasing almost linearly (Fig. 1B). Thus, under the conditions used in the following experiments, the net uptake of NBD-PS at 2 °C reflects its unidirectional influx or flip across the plasma membrane. To determine the extent to which the expression of DNF1 and DNF2 are required for the flip of these NBD-labeled phospholipid reporters, the net uptake of NBD-PC, NBD-PE, and NBD-PS at low temperature, which we will refer to as low temperature flip, was measured in strains in which DNF1 and DNF2 were deleted alone and in combination. The results (Fig. 1A) indicated that the low temperature flip of NBD-PC and NBD-PE was moderately reduced in either the dnf1Δ or dnf2Δ strains. However, when both genes were deleted, NBD-PC internalization was reduced to ∼20% and NBD-PE internalization was reduced to ∼50% of its isogenic parent strain. These results confirm the conclusion of Pomorski et al. (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) that Dnf1p and Dnf2p are required for normal levels of low temperature flip of NBD-PC and NBD-PE. However, contrary to the 50% reduction in NBD-PS internalization observed by Pomorski et al. (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the internalization of NBD-PS in a dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain was actually increased ∼2-fold (Fig. 1A). Thus, the expression of DNF1 and DNF2 is not required for the low temperature flip of NBD-PS. Observation of the cells labeled at 2 °C by fluorescence microscopy confirmed the inhibition of NBD-PC and NBD-PE flip and the enhancement of NBD-PS flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain (Fig. 1C). Although the amount of NBD-PS internalization is not sufficient to produce high resolution images of its intracellular location, it is sufficient to rule out any significant transfer to the vacuole. Thus, the increased internalization is not the result of excess NBD-PS accumulation in the vacuole in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ mutant strain. To rule out the possibility that the observed differences in NBD-phospholipid internalization resulted from differences in the extent of degradation of the NBD-labeled phospholipids, lipids were extracted from cells following labeling with NBD-PC, NBD-PE, or NBD-PS at 2 °C and analyzed by silica gel TLC. No significant breakdown of any of the reporter phospholipids in either the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain or its isogenic parent was detected (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that all three NBD-phospholipids were internalized intact and that differences in degradation do not explain the observed increase in flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ mutant strain. The NBD-PC and NBD-PE analogues that were used for the experiments presented in Fig. 1 differ from the NBD-PS analogue in the length of the sn-1 acyl chain. The NBD-PC and NBD-PE analogues have a myristoyl acyl chain in the sn-1 position, whereas NBD-PS has a palmitoyl acyl chain at that position. Since the first application of NBD-labeled phospholipids in yeast (21.Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the myristoyl analogue has been used because it increased the amount of internalization and improved the resolution of fluorescence microscopic images. NBD-PS with a myristoyl acyl chain is not commercially available and is difficult to synthesize in reasonable quantities. Thus, NBD-PS with a palmitoyl acyl chain has been used in most previous published studies (11.Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 17: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and was used in the experiments presented herein. To address the possibility that the observed increase in NBD-PS flip compared with NBD-PC in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain is the result of the different acyl chain lengths, we repeated the flow cytometry internalization experiment with the same three NBD-phospholipids with palmitoyl at the sn-1 position. The palmitoyl analogues are abbreviated P-NBD-PC and P-NBD-PE. The low temperature flip of P-NBD-PC was 0.49, P-NBD-PE was 0.82, and NBD-PS was 1.52 in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain relative to its isogenic parent strain. The addition of two carbons to the sn-1 acyl chain reduced the extent to which the low temperature flip of the PC and PE analogues was reduced in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain. However, flip was reduced for both of these analogues, whereas the low temperature flip of NBD-PS was increased. We concluded that the longer acyl chain in the NBD-PS analogue does not explain the dramatic increase in flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain. There are two significant differences in experimental protocol that may explain why Pomorski et al. (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) did not observe increased NBD-PS flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain. First, our experiments were performed on early logarithmic phase cultures (A600 ≈ 0.2-0.4) as opposed to mid logarithmic phase cultures (A600 ≈ 0.5-1.0). Secondly, we labeled a smaller number of cells with a lower concentration of NBD-PS. To assure that the discrepancy was not the result of these experimental differences, we repeated the experiment using the same conditions as the Pomorski group and obtained a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase of NBD-PS flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain relative to the isogenic parent. We concluded that the observed discrepancy in NBD-PS flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain was not a result of these different experimental conditions. We did note that when early log phase cells were grown in SDC as opposed to YPD, the relative NBD-PS flip was less, ∼1.1-fold as opposed to ∼2-fold increase in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain (see Fig. 6). Under no conditions did we observe a decrease of NBD-PS flip in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain. Deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 Increases Net Internalization of NBD-PS at 30 °C—The net internalization of NBD-PC, NBD-PE, and NBD-PS into the DNF1 and DNF2 mutant strains was measured by flow cytometry at 30 °C (Fig. 2A). The effect of deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 on the net internalization of NBD-PC and NBD-PE was similar to that observed previously (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Deletion of either DNF1 or DNF2 alone had modest effects on internalization, whereas deletion of both reduced NBD-PC internalization by ∼90% and NBD-PE internalization by ∼60%. However, the net internalization of NBD-PS was increased ∼2-fold in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain. This increase is similar to that observed for the same strain at 2 °C, however, the transport processes responsible for this increase at 30 °C are more difficult to establish, because the extent to which flip, flop, and vesicular trafficking to and from the plasma membrane affect net internalization of NBD-PS cannot be determined from this experiment. Fluorescence microscopy of the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain and its isogenic parent strain following labeling with P-NBD-PC, P-NBD-PE, and NBD-PS at 30 °C are consistent with the flow cytometry results (Fig. 2B). Cells were treated with latrunculin A to block endocytosis (see “Discussion” below) and labeled with the three NBD-labeled phospholipids that differ only in their headgroup. Although not quantitative, the images indicate that P-NBD-PC and P-NBD-PE are significantly reduced in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain while that of NBD-PS is increased. Localization of the internal NBD-PS fluorescence is very similar to that of P-NBD-PC suggesting that its increased amount of internalization is not a result of trafficking to a cellular compartment inaccessible to P-NBD-PC. The net internalization of NBD-PC and NBD-PE at 30 °C has been shown to depend on the relative rates of flip and flop across the plasma membrane (16.Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), because endocytosis and exocytosis do not contribute significantly to the net internalization of these phospholipid analogues (25.Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26.Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Elimination of receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis by deletion or inactivation of the END4 gene (27.Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) does not alter the net internalization of NBD-PC and NBD-PE (26.Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A similar measurement of NBD-PS internalization in an end4Δ (LMY136) strain confirmed that endocytosis does not contribute significantly to its net internalization at 30 °C as well. The net uptake at 30 °C was 1.05 times that of its isogenic parent strain. Because endocytosis does not contribute to the net internalization of NBD-PS at 30 °C, it is presumably internalized by transport across the plasma membrane (flip) similar to that established for NBD-PC and NBD-PE (12.Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26.Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the net amount of internalization determined by the relative rates of flip and flop. Although the previous experiment argues that endocytosis does not contribute significantly to the internalization of NBD-PS in the presence of wild-type copies of DNF1 and DNF2, it does not address the possibility that their deletion induces an endocytic internalization pathway. The role of endocytosis in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ strain was addressed by treating these cells with latrunculin A prior to measuring NBD-PS internalization. Latrunculin A binds to monomeric actin, which results in the depolymerization of actin filaments that are required for endocytosis (28.Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Depolymerization of actin filaments also blocks polarized secretion targeted to bud tips, but has little effect on secretion and growth in general (29.Karpova T.S. Reck-Peterson S.L. Elkind N.B. Mooseker M.S. Novick P.J. Cooper J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1727-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following latrunculin A treatment, the net internalization of NBD-PS at 30 °C was essentially the same in the parent and the dnf1Δdnf2Δ mutant strains (Fig. 3). Thus, with endocytosis and secretion blocked, the net sum of NBD-PS flip and flop resulted in a ∼1.6-fold increase in net internalization in both the dnf1Δdnf2Δ and its isogenic parent strain relative to the untreated control. By treating the cells with latrunculin A at 30 °C prior to labeling with NBD-PS at 2 °C, the effect of latrunculin A treatment on the flip activity alone was determined. This treatment protocol had little or no effect on the low temperature flip of NBD-PS (Fig. 3) suggesting that the latrunculin A had little or no effect on the NBD-PS flippase activity. Thus, the changes in the 30 °C internalization of NBD-PS induced by latrunculin A in the dnf1Δdnf2Δ and parent strains likely reflect alterations in the number and/or activity of NBD-PS floppases at the plasma membrane.

So far, a precise picture of the native configuration of red algal thylakoids is still lacking. In this work, we investigated the supramolecular architectures of phycobilisomes (PBsomes) and native thylakoid membranes from the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy. The topography of single PBsomes was characterized by AFM imaging on both isolated and membrane-combined PBsomes complexes. The native organization of thylakoid membranes presented variable arrangements of PBsomes on the membrane surface. It indicates that different light illuminations during growth allow diverse distribution of PBsomes upon the isolated photosynthetic membranes from P. cruentum, random arrangement or rather ordered arrays, to be observed. Furthermore, the distributions of PBsomes on the membrane surfaces are mostly crowded.

Photosynthesis is an important biological process performed by a series of pigment-protein complexes in photosynthetic membranes with strong cooperativity. In prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic red algae, the photosynthetic membrane network can be divided into two distinct functional platforms: the thylakoid membrane itself, which contains a set of intrinsic photosynthetic protein complexes such as photosystem I (PSI), 2The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; AFM, atomic force microscopy; LL, low light; ML, medium light; PBsome, phycobilisome; PBP, phycobiliprotein; PE, phycoerythrin; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. photosystem II (PSII), ATP synthase, and cytochrome b6/f (1.Bald D.

Solar energy is captured by the PBsome complexes and transferred efficiently to the chlorophyll pigments in the photosynthetic reaction centers, and subsequent energy transformation is carried out by the photosynthetic machinery embedded within the membrane.

Increasing interest has recently been focused on the supramolecular architecture of native photosynthetic membranes and the dynamic arrangements of photosynthetic proteins with the aim of surveying the functional coordination and physiological regulation among those photosynthetic complexes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to directly acquire the morphology of supramolecular assemblies in native membranes under near-physiological conditions (26.Scheuring S.

Investigation using AFM to visualize the native three-dimensional structure of PBsomes and the supramolecular architecture of thylakoid membrane is unique and interesting (36.Mullineaux, C. W.

Green B.R. Parson W.W. Light-Harvesting Antennas in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2003: 307-322Google Scholar). In this work, we applied AFM for the first time to investigate the native configuration and architecture of PBsome-combining thylakoid membranes from red alga P. cruentum, as well as the diverse organizations of thylakoid membranes with respect to various light illuminations using AFM and TEM. The results provide important clues as to the photosynthetic function of red algal PBsomes in vivo in relation to their supramolecular architecture. Growth of Cells—P. cruentum were grown in an artificial sea-water medium (39.Jones R.F. Speer H.L. Kury W. Physiol. Plant. 1963; 16: 636-643Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Flasks were supplied with 3% CO2 in air at 18 °C. Cultures were illuminated continuously with light provided by daylight fluorescent lamps at different light intensities, 6 watts·m-2 (low light, LL) and 15 watts·m-2 (medium light, ML). Separation of Intact PBsomes and PBsome-thylakoid Membrane—Intact PBsomes were separated following the previous protocol (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The preparation of PBsome-membrane vesicles followed the earlier procedure (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were harvested (5000 × g, 10 min), rinsed, and then suspended in SPC medium (0.5 m sucrose, 0.5 m potassium phosphate, 0.3 m sodium citrate). After homogenization cells was broken in French pressure cell with relative low pressure (4000 p.s.i.) for achieving large membrane sheets with ideally less disturbance. The broken cell mixture was layered on a two-step gradient of sucrose (1.0 and 1.3 m) in 0.5 m phosphate/0.3 m citrate, pH 7.0. After centrifugation for 30 min, the PBsome-containing thylakoids were collected from the 1.0–1.3 m sucrose interface. Spectral Analysis—Absorbance spectra and their second derivatives were recorded with UV-160A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Room-temperature fluorescence spectra were obtained with LS 55 Luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the excitation wavelength of 545 nm. SDS-PAGE—Intact PBsomes were suspended in 20 mm K-buffer (pH 6.8) before loading. The protein composition was determined by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Molecular mass was estimated using a molecular size marker set (PageRuler™ Unstained Protein Ladder SM0661, Fermentas). AFM—5 μl of isolated PBsomes or PBsome-containing membranes fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde was spread on freshly cleaved mica for 30–60 min. Afterward the sample was rinsed with dialysis water to remove salt and membranes that were not firmly adsorbed to the substrate. The samples were measured in AFM with tapping mode in ambient condition at room temperature. AFM cantilevers with a length of 240 μm, spring constant 2.0 newtons/m, and operating frequencies of 65–80 kHz (Olympus Micro cantilever tip, Japan) were used. TEM—According to our reported procedure (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde on carbon-coated copper grids before washing with distilled water, and then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed on a JEOL JEM-1010 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Spectral Properties of Isolated PBsomes—Isolated PBsomes shows an absorbance maximum at 549 nm with additional absorbance at 564 nm due to the presence of phycoerythrin (PE) molecules (Fig. 1A). The shoulder at 500 nm is attributed to phycourobilins of PEs. Other pronounced shoulders at 624 nm and 650 nm are attributed to R-phycocyanins and allophycocyanins, respectively. The second derivative of this spectrum clearly reveals a slight shoulder at 675 nm, which will be characterized as the absorbance of allophycocyanin B, consistent with previous results (11.Ducret A. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Hefti A. Sidler W.A. Zuber H. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 369-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40.Redecker D. Wehrmeyer W. Reuter W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 442-450PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1B) with excitation at 545 nm exhibits four distinct spectroscopic components at 580 nm (PE), 663 nm (allophycocyanin), 671 nm (LCM), and 681 nm (allophycocyanin B) (41.Gindt Y.M.

A. 1990; 87: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Such a fluorescence behavior could verify the structural and functional integrity of the isolated PBsomes (40.Redecker D. Wehrmeyer W. Reuter W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 442-450PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Liu L.N. Elmark A.T. Aartsma T.J. Thomas J.C. Lamers G.E.B. Zhou B.C. Zhang Y.Z. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE Analysis—The major components of PBsomes are PBPs, which are mainly composed of α and β subunits with molecular masses of 15–20 kDa (Fig. 2). Other proteins include LCM with 90 kDa, linker polypeptides of 28–36 kDa, and smaller linkers (LR, LC) of 12–15 kDa. It further demonstrates the integrity of isolated PBsome complexes (40.Redecker D. Wehrmeyer W. Reuter W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 442-450PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Redlinger T. Gantt E. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AFM Topography of Isolated PBsomes—To retain the conformational integrity, the PBPs in the PBsome structures were chemically cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. Fig. 3A shows the AFM micrographs of isolated PBsome complexes absorbed on the mica surface. Single PBsomes imaged with AFM have average dimensions of 64 × 42 × 28 nm (length × width × height) (Table 1), and are slightly elongated in one direction. This is in reasonable agreement with the TEM result of 60 × 41 × 34 nm (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), if one takes into account some uncertainty in setting the boundaries of the complex, arising, for example, from tip convolution and compression effects in the case of AFM. Also, sample conditions are somewhat different in both experiments. Fig. 3B presents a top view of a single PBsome. The structure of a single PBsome complex exhibits a higher central part and lower peripheral sides, in close agreement with the early description of ellipsoidal conformation (15.Gantt E. Lipschultz C.A. Zilinskas B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 430: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The peripheral PBP units are observed as protrusions with the size of ∼13 nm, consistent with previous data (12.Yi Z.W. Huang H. Kuang T.Y. Sui S.F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 46.Ficner R. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each may represent one individual PBsome rod. More interestingly, PBsome aggregates are also visible as larger particles, e.g. Fig. 3C shows a dimeric structure. Similar with previous TEM images (47.Ritz M. Lichtle C. Spilar A. Joder A. Thomas J.C. Etienne A.L. J. Phycol. 1998; 34: 835-843Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 48.Wanner G. Köst H.P. Protoplasma. 1980; 102: 97-109Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the two PBsomes in such a dimer are coupled bottom-to-bottom with one another. This dimeric configuration may be caused by the hydrophobic property of linker polypeptides in PBsome core complexes, LCM, which is involved in the anchoring of the PBsome complexes to photosynthetic reaction centers (49.Redlinger T. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Measurements of PBsome dimensionsMeasurementLengthWidthHeightnmTEM singleaData from our previous work (16)604134AFM single64 ± 442 ± 328 ± 3TEM MLaData from our previous work (16)604134TEM LLaData from our previous work (16)604134AFM ML60 ± 439 ± 330 ± 3AFM LL57 ± 332 ± 232 ± 2a Data from our previous work (16.Arteni A.A.

Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Medium-light Acclimation of PBsome-thylakoid Membrane—Fig. 4 shows the room temperature absorption and fluorescence spectra of whole cells and PBsome-thylakoid membranes grown under ML and LL. The optical properties of the separated samples are consistent with those reported in the previous literature (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), confirming the physiological attachment of PBsomes to the thylakoid membranes. In both illumination conditions, moreover, the spectral features of PBsome-thylakoid membranes are comparable to those of whole cells, indicating that the gentle isolation procedure did not cause remarkable perturbation in the coupling of PBsomes to the photosystems. TEM has been applied to study the isolated thylakoid membranes densely covered with PBsomes (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first AFM topograph of the three-dimensional organization of native PBsome-thylakoid membranes is shown in Fig. 5. After adsorption on freshly cleaved mica, the thylakoid membranes were mostly found to expose the stromal surface to the probe side, and the membrane-combined PBsome complexes can be used as topographic features that can be readily identified (Fig. 5A). The lipid layer was recognized as the dark regions in between the PBsomes (Fig. 3D, arrows). The thylakoid fragments have diameters as large as 2.5–3.0 μm. Fig. 5B presents the height profile of one patch of thylakoid membrane fragment. It clearly characterizes three different plateaus representing the mica surface, the single PBsome membrane (a mean height of 48 nm), and folding membrane edges (average height of 90 nm on the left and 130 nm on the right), respectively. The membrane surface is covered with more or less randomly distributed PBsome complexes (Fig. 5C). The size of single PBsomes is recorded with the length of 60 ± 4 nm, the width of 39 ± 3 nm, and the height of 30 ± 3 nm (n = 30) (see Table 1), comparable with that of isolated PBsomes as shown in Fig. 5B. Moreover, it appears, by closer inspection of the AFM topography, that some PBsomes have a tendency to form clustered domains (Fig. 5D, circles). The clustering arrangement of PBsomes might enable light-harvesting complexes to form physiological units to promote energy trapping. Furthermore, individual PBsome complexes and their subcomponents were visualized in AFM topography with a slight heterogeneity with regard to lateral dimension and height (Fig. 5E). Actually, the AFM analyses of ML-adapted thylakoid membranes did not resolve very detailed substructure of individual PBsomes, probably due to the flexible dimension and soft configuration of PBsome supramolecular complexes. Low-light Acclimation of PBsome-thylakoid Membrane—The thylakoid membranes from P. cruentum grown under LL (6 watts·m-2) were also analyzed. Normalized fluorescence emission spectra of the LL-adapted membranes present a somewhat similar profile compared with that of ML-grown membranes, suggesting no significant functional changes in the light-harvesting capacity of both samples. Absorption spectroscopy allows the comparative analysis of pigment compositions of thylakoid membranes with respect to light variation (Fig. 4). In view of the invariable size of PBsomes (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50.Ohki K. Gantt E. Lipschultz C.A. Ernst M.C. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 943-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the increase of PE/chlorophyll ratio in the absorbance of LL-adapted membranes might indicate an inclined PBsome density per thylakoid area, to meet a higher demand for light-harvesting capacity. This was further demonstrated by the increased density of PBsomes (560 ± 40 PBsomes/μm2) on LL-adapted membranes (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The native two-dimensional-crystalline motif of PBsomes on the isolated thylakoid membranes was observed in AFM images (Fig. 6). On the large fragment, PBsomes were observed to arrange in parallel rows (Fig. 6A, lines), although some random PBsome domains were still visible. Close inspection of the thylakoid organization showed that PBsomes within the regular rows along the short axis of PBsomes are closely packed side-to-side, the distance between adjacent parallel rows being very short (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we found that the substructure of individual PBsomes, presumably individual rods, can be visualized by applying gentle force in this case, as shown in Fig. 6 (C and D). Each PBsome rod was characterized by a diameter of 13 nm. In the higher central part of the PBsome, there are two rods vertically protruding with respect to the membrane surface, and several neighboring rods seem to intersect with each other to form a condensed configuration. The profound complexity of the architecture of the hemiellipsoidal PBsome is incompatible with a structure consisting of two closely packed hemidiscoidal PBsomes as suggested before (40.Redecker D. Wehrmeyer W. Reuter W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 442-450PubMed Google Scholar); in that case the rods would be located in the same plane vertical to the core cylinders. This conclusion is consistent with our single-particle analysis of TEM data (16.Arteni A.A. Liu L.N. Aartsma T.J. Zhang Y.Z. Zhou B.C. Boekema E.J. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6 (E and F), the spacing between rows of PBsomes was measured to be 56 ± 4 nm along the long axis and 35 ± 2 nm on the short axis (n = 20), corresponding to the spacing of PSII rows as reported before (51.Giddings T.H. Wasmann C. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 409-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Tsekos I. Reiss H.D. Orfanidis S. Orologas N. New Phytologist. 1996; 133: 543-551Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The PBsome dimension was obtained by the height measurement relative to the membrane surface: the length of 57 ± 3 nm, the width of 32 ± 2 nm, and the height of 32 ± 2 nm (n = 30) (Table 1). The somewhat reduced lateral dimension that we observe is probably due to the crowding of PBsomes. The packing effects may also hamper the precise height recording of PBsomes, because the membrane surface under the PBsome layer is hard to observe in the images. Yet, the AFM topographs still provide new insights into the spatial rendering of PBsomes, and the observed parallel arrangement of PBsomes strongly supports the hypothetical model of the thylakoid membrane in PBsome-containing species (48.Wanner G. Köst H.P. Protoplasma. 1980; 102: 97-109Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 53.Lefort-Tran M. Cohen-Bazire G. Pouphile M. J. Ultrastruct.

Phycologia. 2004; 43: 543-551Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Diverse Distribution Pattern of PBsomes on Thylakoid Membrane by TEM—Despite the results presented above, further structural investigation of thylakoid morphology by means of TEM showed various patterns of PBsome arrangements, for instance random distribution, crystalline arrays, and even mixed arrangements (Fig. 7). Although large membrane patches were frequently monitored with gentle preparation, tubular-shape fragments appear occasionally. It was seen that most of the tubular fragments are densely covered with well crystallized PBsomes, and along the tubular direction PBsomes have a preference to form either straight or helical packing, probably due to large dimension of extrinsic PBsomes and high PBsome-to-lipid ratio. Except the artificial disturbance and auto-crystallization during sample treatments, they were presumed to exist in vivo as the internal linkages between different layers of the photosynthetic membranes (56.Nevo R. Charuvi D. Shimoni E. Schwarz R. Kaplan A. Ohad I. Reich Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 57.Shimoni E. Rav-Hon O. Ohad I. Brumfeld V. Reich Z. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2580-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Distinct lengths of tubular fragments might also indicate the development of the photosynthetic membranes. It is worthy to note that parallel arrangement of PBsomes is actually the most common, but not the sole pattern existing in vivo at low irradiance, because disordered PBsome-thylakoid sheets, and even the mixture of both ordered and disorder arrangements were occasionally visible (Fig. 7, F and G). Lateral mobility of PBsomes in vivo has been proposed in cyanobacteria (58.Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 59.Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 60.Joshua S. Bailey S. Mann N.H. Mullineaux C.W. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 61.Joshua S. Mullineaux C.W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2112-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There is evidence that concentrated buffers, such as the SPC medium used in this work (see “Experimental Procedures”), have the effect of artificially stabilizing the interaction of PBsomes and photosynthetic reaction centers (37.Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 95: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 61.Joshua S. Mullineaux C.W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2112-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), so that PBsomes could be immobilized upon thylakoid membrane surface and imaged by AFM. The primary structure of PBsomes from the unicellular red alga P. cruentum has been proposed on the basis of TEM images (15.Gantt E. Lipschultz C.A. Zilinskas B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 430: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here, our AFM topographs present the native hemi-spherical configurations of isolated PBsomes and membrane-combined PBsomes at three-dimensional level, although high resolution is difficult to achieve. This is probably due to the conformational flexibility and height properties of PBsomes. Nevertheless, AFM topography was demonstrated to be able to depict the physiological architecture of PBsomes and their organization upon the native thylakoid membrane. P. cruentum exhibits the simplest organization of eukaryotic chloroplasts, with unstacked and mostly parallel thylakoid membranes. In addition to the native three-dimensional configurations of single PBsomes, we investigated for the first time the three-dimensional supramolecular organization of native PBsome-combining thylakoid membrane by means of AFM. The most striking feature of the native thylakoids is the various types of PBsome arrangements observed. In one pattern, PBsome complexes were arranged randomly, similar to previous TEM results (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Dilworth M.F. Gantt E. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 608-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PBsomes in this pattern had a tendency to form locally clustered motifs that are expected to improve the light-harvesting capacity. When grown under LL conditions, PBsomes are organized into rather parallel rows on the isolated thylakoid membranes of P. cruentum. Despite the close packing of PBsomes located on opposite thylakoid layers in vivo (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), such an effect of confinement may also arise from interactions within the lateral dense monolayer of PBsome complexes. Furthermore, the ordered arrays of PBsomes present an inclined density of PBsomes on the thylakoid surface, which was corroborated with the absorption spectra (Fig. 4A). This apparently implies that light intensity is an essential factor in determining the PBsome densities as well as the lateral arrangements of PBsomes on the thylakoid membrane. We conclude that the variation of PBsome arrangement and density upon the chloroplasts is probably a physiological strategy to adapt to light irradiance, with the aim to modulate the capacity of energy utilization of photosynthetic complexes. Such a photoadaptation bears resemblance to the findings obtained from photosynthetic bacteria, which have demonstrated the significance of high and low light conditions (chromatic adaptation) for determining the organization of light-harvesting complexes in the photosynthetic membranes of purple bacteria (28.Scheuring S. Gonçalves R.P. Prima V. Sturgis J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30.Scheuring S. Sturgis J.N. Science. 2005; 309: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our data, moreover, clearly showed the fact that PBsomes are densely packed on the membrane surface. Such a dense packing of photosynthetic proteins may provide a greater concentration of chromophores and electron transport complexes in a limited membrane area, allowing a higher rate of photosynthetic activity; and enhance the efficiency of light-harvesting by promoting the interaction of light-harvesting antennae with reaction centers (36.Mullineaux, C. W. (2008) Photochem. Photobiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In cyanobacteria and red algae, the photosynthetic membrane network can be differentiated into two structural and functional entities: the thylakoid membrane containing the primary photosynthetic apparatus, and the PBsome pool closely coupled to the thylakoid membrane. Energy transfer between these two entities is mediated by the spatial organizations and interactions of photosynthetic pigment proteins. Two possible arrangements of PSII and PSI core complexes in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria have been proposed (62.Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One assumes that PSII dimers arrange in rows, whereas PSI trimers are randomly distributed between the PSII rows. The other presents PSII dimers and PSI trimers as randomly dispersed in the thylakoid membrane. In our case, that of red algae, both random and ordered arrangements of PBsomes are found, indicating a variable distribution of photosystems in the thylakoid membrane. More specifically, the presence of parallel rows of PBsomes may also hint the specific combination of PBsomes with PSII. Alternatively, it is worthy to note that the PSI shoulder at ∼740 nm is relatively higher in both cells and membranes from ML growth conditions, as shown in the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 4B). This preference of energy transfer from PBsomes to PSI reaction centers may indicate a potential interaction between PBsomes and PSI, inducing more randomized distribution of PBsomes in ML-adapted cells. We have also investigated the morphology of PBsome-thylakoid membranes from P. cruentum during state transition, 3L.-N. Liu, T. J. Aartsma, J.-C. Thomas, G. E. M. Lamers, B.-C. Zhou, and Y.-Z.

Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The variety of PBsome arrangement that we observed might be expected to occur in the energy redistribution process (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 63.Cunningham F.X. Dennenberg R.J. Jursinic P.A. Gantt E.

However, no significant structural changes were monitored under red and green light at the same intensity level, suggesting on the other hand, the significance of light illumination in determined the arrangements of PBsomes. Because PSI and PSII complexes are distributed throughout the thylakoid membrane (13.Mustardy L. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10021-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the spacing between neighboring photosystems are imaged too small, 3L.-N. Liu, T. J. Aartsma, J.-C. Thomas, G. E. M. Lamers, B.-C. Zhou, and Y.-Z. Zhang, unpublished data. the crowded coverage of PBsomes on the thylakoid surface indicates the possibility that both PSII and PSI coexist closely underneath one hemiellipsoidal PBsome complex. Such a specific organization could ensure excitation energy from PBsome complexes to be efficiently and dynamically redistributed to distinct relevant photosynthetic reaction centers (65.McConnell M.D. Koop R. Vasil'ev S. Bruce D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In state transition of red alga P. cruentum, it is possible that local conformational changes, for example nanoscale movement of PBsomes between adjacent PSII and PSI complexes, rather than long distance diffusion of PBsome complexes, can account for energy redistribution from PSII to PSI. More evidences are still needed to address the question."
https://openalex.org/W2023805007,"Hypoxia has been previously linked to the development of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. This study investigated the effect of maspin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) tumor suppressor, on the apoptotic response of prostate cancer cells to hypoxia. Gene expression profiling of human benign and malignant prostate epithelial cells after exposure to hypoxia or normoxia revealed dramatic changes in ECM regulators. Maspin was found to be overexpressed in response to hypoxia in prostate cancer cells, but not in benign prostate cells. To dissect the contribution of maspin to tumor cell responses within a hypoxic microenvironment, we used maspin-overexpressing DU-145 human prostate cancer cells. Exposure to hypoxic conditions (1% O2) led to a significant increase in apoptosis in the DU-145 maspin cells, compared to DU-145 neo-transfectants without a significant effect on cell migration. This enhanced sensitivity to hypoxia-induced apoptosis leads to a significant suppression of tumor growth and tumor vascularity in vivo by targeting Akt and focal adhesion kinase activation. Our findings implicate maspin in prostate cancer cell response to hypoxia via recruitment of intracellular signaling partners. This study may have significance in the identification of maspin-driven therapeutic targeting in advanced metastatic prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2047560750,"The ovarian hormone progesterone is essential for normal breast development, and progesterone analogues are implicated in increasing breast cancer risk. The progesterone receptor (PR) is a transcription factor that, when ligand activated, moves rapidly into nuclear foci associated with transcriptional activity. However, the role of intranuclear trafficking signals in the focal location of PR is unknown. We have identified a mutation in PR that ablates its binding to the nuclear matrix and prevents PR movement into nuclear foci. Nuclear matrix binding mutants lack transcriptional activity and inhibit dimerization, demonstrating the critical role of matrix binding for PR dynamics and activity. DNA binding of PR is required for fidelity of location in foci, as DNA binding domain (DBD) mutants form aberrant foci with reduced mobility and altered tethering to the nucleus. Mutations in either the nuclear matrix targeting sequence or DBD domains were dominant in preventing wild-type receptor from moving to appropriate nuclear locations, demonstrating that both partner proteins in a PR dimer must have intact intranuclear trafficking signals for correct receptor positioning within the nucleus. This study has demonstrated that positioning of PR in foci within the nucleus is critically regulated by intranuclear trafficking signals, which play a key role in transcriptional activity and are relevant to its action in normal and malignant breast cells."

Here we have examined the involvement of actuator domain residues Arg174, Ile188, Lys204, and Lys205 by mutagenesis. Alanine mutations to these residues had little effect on the interaction of the Ca2E1 state with nucleotide or on the HnE 2 to Ca2E1 transition of the dephosphoenzyme. The phosphoenzyme processing steps, Ca2E1P to E2P and E2P dephosphorylation, and their stimulation by MgATP/ATP were markedly affected by mutations to Arg174, Ile188, and Lys205. Replacement of Ile188 with alanine abolished nucleotide modulation of dephosphorylation but not the modulation of the Ca2E1P to E2P transition. Mutation to Arg174 interfered with nucleotide modulation of either of the phosphoenzyme processing steps, indicating a significant overlap between the modulatory nucleotide-binding sites involved. Mutation to Lys205 enhanced the rates of the phosphoenzyme processing steps in the absence of nucleotide and disrupted the nucleotide modulation of the Ca2E1P to E2P transition. Remarkably, the mutants with alterations to Lys205 showed an anomalous inhibition by ATP of the dephosphorylation, and in the alanine mutant the affinity for the inhibition by ATP was indistinguishable from that for stimulation by ATP of the wild type. Hence, the actuator domain is an important player in the function of ATP as modulator of phosphoenzyme processing, with Arg174, Ile188, and Lys205 all being critically involved, although in different ways. The data support a variable site model for the modulatory effects with the nucleotide binding somewhat differently in each of the conformational states occurring during the transport cycle.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar) is a membrane-bound ion pump that belongs to the family of P-type ATPases (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), named so because their reaction cycles involve the transient phosphorylation of the aspartic acid residue in the universally conserved DKTGT(L/I)T motif. Insight into the structural organization and domain movements that take place during pump activity in P-type ATPases has come from the elucidation over the past 8 years of several high resolution crystal structures of Ca2+-ATPase (3Toyoshima C.

The cytoplasmic headpiece is separated into three distinct domains, named A (“actuator”), P (“phosphorylation”), and N (“nucleotide binding”). The ion translocation is achieved by sequential conformational transitions between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated intermediate states (cf. Scheme 1 for Ca2+-ATPase) (15Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The key to understanding the long distance coupling between formation/decomposition of the acyl phosphate in the cytoplasmic P-domain and the changes in the ion-binding sites buried deep in the membranous region seems to be the relatively large movements of the A-domain, which are transmitted to the transmembrane helices (8Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 11Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). ATP plays dual roles in the reaction cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase by acting both as the phosphorylating substrate as well as in nonphosphorylating (modulatory) modes, the latter regulating the rates of various partial reaction steps (boxed ATP in Scheme 1). The modulatory action of ATP seems to be a general feature in the family of P-type pumps and is a vital means of overcoming rate-limiting reaction steps during pump activity. Thus, the K+ deoccluding KnE2 → E1 transition in Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase as well as the corresponding HnE2 → E1 transition in Ca2+-ATPase are accelerated by ATP with affinity constants in the 10–100 μm range (17Scofano H.M.

In a recent mutagenesis study (30Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Anthonisen A.N. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol.

Phe487, Arg560, and Arg678 are also known as key residues in ATP binding in the phosphorylating mode (5Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

None of these residues, however, were critical for the modulation by nucleotide of the Ca2E1P → E2P transition, suggesting that yet undefined additional residues might be important in this case, but Arg678 proved essential also for the acceleration by MgATP of the HnE2 → Ca2E1 transition. Because the A-domain plays a central role in the energy transduction and is closely associated with the catalytic site in E2 forms (38Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we extend the previous analysis to include Arg174, Ile188, Lys204, and Lys205 in the A-domain, and we demonstrate, for the first time, that the A-domain is a critical contributor to the binding and actions of modulatory nucleotide in Ca2+-ATPase.

To express wild type or mutant cDNA, COS-1 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Microsomal vesicles containing either expressed wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase were isolated by differential centrifugation (40Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transport of 45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was determined by following the liberation of Pi in the presence of 4 μm ionophore A23187 to prevent inhibition caused by rebinding of Ca2+ to the lumenally facing Ca2+ sites (42Baginski E.S.

The analysis of Ca2+ and MgATP concentration dependences of phosphorylation was based on the Hill equation, EP = EPmax·[L]n/(K0.5n + [L]n). A hyperbolic function plus a linear component was fitted to the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data, and the “true” dissociation constant, KD, for ATP binding was calculated from the measured K0.5 values using the validated equation for competitive inhibition (46McIntosh D.B.

For analysis of the modulatory effect of nucleotide or PPi (abbreviated “S” for substrate) on the rates of the partial reaction steps, the substrate concentration dependence of the rate constant was analyzed according to Equation 1, kobs=k0+(kmax-k0)[S]/(K0.5+[S])(Eq. 1) Here, kobs is the rate constant observed at the indicated substrate concentration; k0 is the rate constant in the absence of substrate (“basic rate”), and kmax is the extrapolated value of the rate constant corresponding to infinite substrate concentration. The enhancement factor kmax/k0 describes the extent of the modulatory effect, and the K0.5 value describes the affinity for the modulatory substrate. Expression and Assays of Overall Function—Eight single mutations were introduced to four amino acid residues in the A-domain of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Arg174, Lys204, and Lys205 were each substituted with alanine and glutamate, to examine the consequences of either removing the bulky, charged side chain or reversing the charge, and Ile188 was replaced by alanine and phenylalanine, to examine the importance of the size of the hydrophobic side chain at position 188. The expression levels in COS-1 cells of the six mutant pumps with alterations to Arg174, Ile188, and Lys205 were similar to that obtained with wild type, as evaluated by their immunoreactivity in the specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). The expression levels of mutants K204A and K204E were generally around 60 and 10–20!, respectively, of that obtained with wild type. Reliable and reproducible biochemical experiments could be performed with K204A, whereas the low expression level of K204E precluded a functional characterization of this mutant. For R174A, I188F, K205A, and K205E, the molecular rate of Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis (“ATP turnover rate”) at 37 °C with 5 mm MgATP was similar to, or slightly lower than (by less than 15!), that of wild type (Fig. 1). I188A and K204A displayed ∼30! reduced ATP turnover rates relative to wild type, whereas the ATP turnover rate of R174E was reduced by as much as ∼80!. The effects of the mutations to Arg174 on overall ATP turnover are similar to those presented previously (52Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The overall activity at 37 °C and saturating substrate concentrations was further evaluated by measuring the ATP-driven accumulation of 45Ca2+ in the microsomal vesicles (Fig. 1). For the mutants with alterations to Arg174, Ile188, and Lys205, the rates of Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis correlated well, implying that the coupling between ATP consumption and Ca2+ translocation is fully retained in the mutants. Mutant K204A, however, displayed only ∼40! Ca2+ transport relative to wild type, compared with its ∼70! rate of ATP turnover. The Ca2+ dependence of the steady-state phosphoenzyme level obtained by phosphorylation from 5 μm [γ-32P]MgATP and the [γ-32P]MgATP dependence of steady-state phosphorylation at 100 μm free Ca2+ were determined at 0 °C and pH 7 (supplemental Fig. S1, left and right panels, respectively). At 10–100 μm free Ca2+ and 5–50 μm MgATP, the concentration ranges of Ca2+ and MgATP applied in the phosphorylation experiments described below, both the wild type and the mutants displayed high levels of phosphoenzyme (>80! of the EPmax derived from the fits of the Hill equation to the data). Transient State Kinetics of Phosphorylation of Ca2E1 from MgATP—The time course of phosphorylation from 10 μm [γ-32P]MgATP of wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase pre-equilibrated with Ca2+ was studied at pH 6 and 25 °C using rapid kinetics instrumentation (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Under these conditions, the wild type displays an initial overshoot of phosphorylation because of the contribution to rate limitation by the Ca2+ binding transition (i.e. HnE2 → Ca2E1), causing a significant amount of dephosphoenzyme to accumulate at steady state. This overshoot can be reproduced by computer simulation based on the simplified three-intermediate reaction cycle shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 2, with rate constants kA = 65 s-1 for phosphorylation of Ca2E1, kB = 3 s-1 for phosphoenzyme processing (i.e. Ca2E1P → E2P → E2, the latter step being much faster than the former under the conditions applied here, thus allowing them to be represented by a single rate constant), and kC = 5 s-1 for the HnE2 → Ca2E1 reaction sequence. With these rate constants the steady state is reached within ∼0.5 s in the wild type, and after this point 36! of the enzyme is in the E2 state, 3! in the Ca2E1 state, and 61! is phosphorylated.TABLE 1Rate constants for partial reactions in the absence of excess (modulating) nucleotideCa2E1 → Ca2E1PaRate of phosphorylation from 10 μm [γ-32P]MgATP of Ca2+-saturated enzyme at 25 °C and at pH 6 derived from the computer simulation analysis of the data presented in Fig. 2 (detailed in the figure legends)Ca2E1P → E2PbRate of forward processing of Ca2E1P measured at pH 7 and 0 °C in the absence of excess (modulating) nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S4)E2P → E2cRate of E2P dephosphorylation measured at pH 7 and 0 °C in the absence of nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S5)HnE2 → Ca2E1dRate of HnE2 → Ca2E1 measured at pH 6 and 25 °C in the absence of nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S7A)s–1s–1min–1s–1Wild type650.122.01.0R174A800.083.61.9R174E800.0158.22.7I188A700.0441.31.2I188F700.121.21.0K204A650.121.90.55K205A750.237.21.3K205E650.4715.70.8a Rate of phosphorylation from 10 μm [γ-32P]MgATP of Ca2+-saturated enzyme at 25 °C and at pH 6 derived from the computer simulation analysis of the data presented in Fig. 2 (detailed in the figure legends)b Rate of forward processing of Ca2E1P measured at pH 7 and 0 °C in the absence of excess (modulating) nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S4)c Rate of E2P dephosphorylation measured at pH 7 and 0 °C in the absence of nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S5)d Rate of HnE2 → Ca2E1 measured at pH 6 and 25 °C in the absence of nucleotide (detailed in the legend to supplemental Fig. S7A) Open table in a new tab As seen in Fig. 2 and Table 1, all seven mutants displayed phosphorylation rates in the 65–80 s-1 range (column labeled “Ca2E1 → Ca2E1P” in Table 1), i.e. at least as fast as that of wild type, implying that Arg174, Ile188, Lys204, and Lys205 are not critical for the transfer of the γ-phosphate from MgATP to Asp351 in the Ca2E1 form. Because the phosphorylation was carried out at a subsaturating concentration of MgATP (the KD for MgATP at pH 6 and 20 °C is ∼10 μm (53Lacapere J.J. Bennett N. Dupont Y. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Lacapere J.J. Guillain F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), the wild type-like phosphorylation rates of the mutants furthermore suggest that Arg174, Ile188, Lys204, and Lys205 are not critical for binding of MgATP to Ca2+-saturated E1, as any change in nucleotide affinity induced by the mutations should also affect the phosphorylation rate (see below for direct measurements of MgATP binding to Ca2+-free E1). K205A and K205E both displayed more pronounced phosphorylation overshoots relative to wild type, with substantial levels of dephosphoenzyme accumulated at steady state (Fig. 2), implying either rapid phosphoenzyme processing or inhibition of the Ca2+ binding transition of the dephosphoenzyme. In such cases where the phosphorylation overshoot is substantial, fairly accurate values of kB and kC can be derived from the computer simulations, because the steepness of the descending phase following the overshoot directly reflects the rate of phosphoenzyme processing (51Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54426-54437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The computational analysis showed that phosphoenzyme processing was 2.7- and 6-fold enhanced for K205A and K205E, respectively, relative to wild type, whereas the Ca2+ binding HnE2 → Ca2E1 transition was rather unaffected by the mutations. For the remaining mutants, the size of the phosphorylation overshoot was either similar to or smaller than that of wild type (Fig. 2), and in such cases more latitude exists with respect to the determination of kB and kC (51Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54426-54437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A reduced overshoot can result either from an inhibition of phosphoenzyme processing or from an enhanced Ca2+ binding transition, or a combination of both. Direct measurements of the rates of the partial reactions involved in phosphoenzyme and dephosphoenzyme processing are presented below. Affinity of E1 for MgATP—The nucleotide binding properties of wild type and mutants were examined in the absence of Ca2+ (to avoid ATP hydrolysis) and at pH 8.5 (to accumulate E1 even in the absence of Ca2+ (55Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol.

Consequently, the antimicrobial peptides expressed in that environment are interesting as they evolved to defend against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi. Here we report the discovery of new α-defensins from rhesus macaque oral mucosa and determine the first α-defensin structure from that species. The new peptides were identified by sequencing of reverse transcriptase-PCR products obtained from oral mucosal tissues, disclosing three mucosal α-defensins, termed rhesus macaque oral α-defensins (ROADs). The peptide corresponding to fully processed ROAD-1 was synthesized, subjected to folding/oxidation conditions, and purified. ROAD-1 was active against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in a concentration-dependent manner. We determined the structure of ROAD-1 using NMR spectroscopy and find that the synthetic peptide adopts the canonical disulfide pairing and α-defensin fold. The antimicrobial mechanism of defensins has been correlated with their ability to disrupt and permeabilize the cell envelope, activities that depend on the surface features of the folded peptide. Although ROAD-1 maintains the defensin fold, the oral defensin displays distinct surface features when compared with other α-defensin structures.

Although ROAD-1 maintains the defensin fold, the oral defensin displays distinct surface features when compared with other α-defensin structures. Mammalian defensins comprise three structural families (α, β, and θ) of antimicrobial peptides defined by sequence homology and unique disulfide connectivities (1Selsted M.E. Oullette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Representative members of all three families possess activities against a range of microorganisms: Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. In humans, α-defensins are expressed predominantly in leukocytes and in Paneth cells of the small intestine. In addition to their antimicrobial activity in innate immunity, emerging evidence suggests that α- and β-defensins participate in the adaptive immune system, as several peptides have been shown to be chemoattractive for or mobilize immune cells via receptor-mediated signaling pathways (2Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). An interesting additional role for β-defensins in determining hair color was reported recently expanding the functionality of defensins beyond the immune response (3Candille S.I. Kaelin C.B. Cattanach B.M. Yu B. Thompson D.A. Nix M.A. Kerns J.A. Schmutx S.M. Millhauser G.L. Barsh G.S. Science. 2007; 318: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The antimicrobial function of α-defensins is not dependent on the tri-disulfide array, overall topology, cytotoxicity, or cytolytic activities of the peptide (4Maemoto A. Qu X. Rosengren K.J. Tanabe H. Henschen-Edman A. Craik D.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44188-44196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that defensins interact with the membranes of target pathogen leading to its disruption (5Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 6Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24224-24233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The initial interaction of the defensins with the microbial membrane is mediated by nonspecific interactions based on surface charges and amphipathicity. Most of mammalian α-defensins have a positively charged surface that is in proximity to, but distinct from, hydrophobic regions of the protein. How these peptides are able to target the membranes of the pathogens and not damage the host cells is an intriguing conundrum. Because the bacterial cell membrane has more anionic lipids, the initial attraction can be electrostatically driven. The most prevalent hypothesis regarding disruption of the microbe involves membrane depolarization following fusion of defensin with membrane and subsequent lysis of the cell (7White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, details of the molecular mechanism are yet to be unveiled. All defensins are expressed as prepropeptides. The mature peptide results from sequential removal of the signal and pro-segments giving rise to a mature, tridisulfide-containing peptide containing 29-35 (α-defensins), 38-45 (β-defensins), or 18 (θ-defensins) amino acids. Defensin structures have been solved using both x-ray crystallography and NMR. To date, structures for seven α-defensins have been reported: for human neutrophil defensins HNP-1 (8Pardi A. Zhang X.L. Selsted M.E. Skalicky J.J. Yip P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11357-11364Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), HNP-3 (9Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D.

Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These structures display the canonical α-defensin disulfide arrangement and a similar fold, but differ markedly in surface charge distribution and loop sizes/orientations. Rhesus macaque leukocytes contain eight α-defensin sequences that were previously grouped into two families based on homology to either human neutrophil (HNP-1) or enteric (HD-5) defensins (13Tang Y. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity of the eight peptides is a consequence of two mechanisms; some of the isoforms differ at amino acid positions internal to the mature peptide sequence, whereas others are the result of differential post-translational processing at the α-defensin amino termini. The role of antimicrobial peptides in oral host defense has been an area of active investigation, stimulated in great part by characterization of histatins, histidine-rich antimicrobial peptides expressed in human saliva (14Dale B.A. Fredericks L.P. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2005; 7: 119-133PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kavanagh K. Dowd S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2004; 56: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we report the first example of an α-defensin expressed in oral tissues of rhesus monkeys and describe its synthesis, structure, and antimicrobial activities. cDNA Cloning—Standard methods were used to isolate total RNA from snap frozen necropsy specimens of oral tissues and bone marrow from otherwise healthy adult rhesus macaques (California National Primate Research Center). Three μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using Super Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen). A GenBank™BLAST search disclosed the presence of 33 Macaca mullata α-defensin gene sequences. To identify the α-defensins expressed in macaque oral tissues, the gene sequences were used to design 12 antisense primers. These were paired with a primer (sense 1, 5′-ATCCTTGCTGCCATTCTCCTT-3′) corresponding to a conserved region of the signal sequence (within exon 2) of myeloid and enteric defensin genes. One-μl samples of cDNAs derived from rhesus adult bone marrow and that pooled from several oral tissues were amplified, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, gel purified, subcloned, and sequenced. Clones encoding α-defensins were further characterized by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a second primer (sense 2, 5′-TCCTCCAGGTGACCCCAGCC-3′) corresponding to the 5′-untranslated sequence just upstream of the initiation methionine, and sequenced. Reverse primers 1 and 2 (antisense 1, 5′-GCCCTTGCTCAGCGACAG-3′; antisense 2, 5′-GCTCAGCGACAGCAGAGACT-3′) were used with the sense 2 primer to amplify the entire coding sequence corresponding to ROAD-1 3The abbreviations used are:ROADrhesus macaque oral α-defensinsCrpcryptdinDQF-COSYdouble quantum filtered-correlation spectroscopyHDhuman defensinHNPhuman neutrophil peptideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectroscopyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flightNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyPbf2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzo-furan-5-sulfonylPIPESpiperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)RKrabbit kidneyRMADrhesus macaque myeloid α-defensinstBut-ButylTOCSYtotal correlated spectroscopyTrttritylr.m.s.root mean squareHAalpha proton and a homologous bone marrow α-defensin, respectively.

Peptide Synthesis—The ROAD-1 mature peptide chain was assembled on polyethylene glycol resin using a continuous flow 9050 Plus PepSynthesizer (Millipore) essentially as described in Ref. 16Ouellette A.J. Darmoul D. Tran D. Huttner K.M. Yuan J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The synthesis utilized N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry, Trt/tBu/Pbf side chain protection, and 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium activation for all the residues except cysteines that were used in O-pentafluorophenyl-preactivated form. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin with Reagent-K for 4 h, and this product was extracted with 50! acetic acid, water and the aqueous phase was lyophilized. The crude material was reduced with dithiothreitol and purified on a 45 × 300-mm Vydac C18 cartridge column developed at 60 ml/min with linear water, acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1! (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, analytical HPLC, and acid-urea PAGE. Purified samples were pooled, vacuum concentrated, and stored at 4 °C prior to oxidation and folding. Folding of Reduced ROAD-1—A 0.1 mg/ml solution of reduced ROAD-1, dissolved in 0.1! (v/v) acetic acid, was alkalinized to pH 7.8 by dropwise addition of ammonium hydroxide. Air oxidation was carried out by stirring the solution at room temperature overnight in an open flask. This solution was acidified to pH 2, and the oxidized peptide was purified on a preparative C18 HPLC column. Fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and material in the main peak was found to have the mass of the theoretical oxidized peptide (3740.5 Da). This material was lyophilized giving a white fluffy powder. Antimicrobial Assays—Escherichia coli ML35, Staphylococcus aureus 502a, and Candida albicans 16820 were utilized as target organisms in agar diffusion assays as previously described (17Tran D. Tran P.A. Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Cole T. Selsted M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, organisms were grown to mid-log phase in trypticase soy broth (bacteria) or Sabouraud dextrose broth (C. albicans). Organisms were seeded at 1 × 106 in warmed 1! agarose agar buffered with 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.03! trypticase soy broth or Sabarauds agar and poured into a 9-cm2 square Petri dish. Five-μl aliquots of each peptide, dissolved in 0.01! acetic acid at 10-300 μg/ml, were added to 10-μl wells. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the seeded agar was overlaid with warmed agarose containing 6! nutrient broth. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18-24 h. HNP-1 was purified from acid extracts of human neutrophils using methods described in Tang et al. (13Tang Y. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the purification of RMAD-1. The identity and purity of HNP-1 were determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring the zones of clearing around each well and plotting the diameter as a function of peptide concentration. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of synthetic ROAD-1 in 0.35 ml of H2O and adjusting the pH to between 3.5 and 4.0. Experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 800 MHz NMR spectrometer. Data were collected on the sample in 90! H2O, 10! D2O. Following these experiments, data were collected again after the sample was lyophilized and resuspended in an equal volume of 100! D2O. Data were immediately collected to determine slowly exchanging backbone signals. NOESY (τm 250 and 350 ms), TOCSY (τm 75ms), and DQF-COSY experiments were performed; the water peak was eliminated using WATERGATE. Data (1024 × 256 complex points) were processed using NMRPipe (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and spectra were analyzed using the software Analysis (19Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were carried out using the ab initio simulated annealing protocol of the Xplor-NIH program, version 2.17 (20Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 21Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated on the basis of distance restraints derived from the NOE cross-peaks and dihedral angle constraints derived from the coupling constant data. Hydrogen bond constraints were incorporated during the refinement step. NOE intensities were qualitatively categorized to strong, medium, and weak and translated to the upper bound distance limits to 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0, respectively. Sum averaging method was used for the NOE potential energy calculations. The initial coordinates of ROAD-1 were generated with random φ and ψ angles and the extended side chain using the parameters in the protein-1.0.par file of the Xplor-NIH program. To begin the calculations the observed disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues were incorporated as disulfide bridges and were later changed to disulfide bonds during refinement. The starting structure was energy minimized (Powell minimization; 1000 steps) to ensure that the structure met covalent requirements. Simulated annealing was performed in three steps, a 20-ps high temperature dynamics at 3500 K with experimental restraints but with no Van der Waals term followed by a 100-step cycle or 0.2 ps with Van der Waals turned on and then a gradual cooling to 25 K with a time step of 12.5 ps. During the 100-step cycle the Van der Waals radius and force constants were incrementally raised. Also the force constants for angles and improper dihedral angles were changed in this cycle. In the cooling step, all the weights were incrementally raised to their final values. Electrostatic terms involving the side chain-side chain interactions were excluded from the energy function during refinement so as not to place undue emphasis on charge-charge interactions in the absence of solvent molecules in the calculations (21Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The structure generated was subjected to 500 steps of energy minimization using the conjugate gradient Powell algorithm. Several rounds of calculations were performed with each round generating 50 structures. After each cycle the structure with least violations was used as the beginning structure for subsequent calculations. Protein structures were analyzed using PROCHECK (22Laskowski R. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 23Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) and displayed using Chimera (24Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J.

Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) was used for displaying the electrostatic surface of ROAD-1. The coordinates representing the solution structure of ROAD-1 and the experimental restraints have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with access code 2K1I. Discovery of ROAD-1 and Related α-Defensins—To determine which of the known rhesus macaque α-defensin genes are expressed in the oral cavity, we characterized reverse transcriptase-PCR products using mRNA from cheek pouch, esophagus, gingiva, lip, parotid gland, submandibular gland, tongue, and tonsillar necropsy tissues from adult monkeys. Initially, cDNAs from each source were pooled and screened for α-defensin sequences in PCR using 12 primer pairs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Oral cDNAs were amplified, subcloned, and 23 clones were sequenced disclosing five α-defensin coding sequences. Four of these corresponded to known myeloid α-defensins: RMADs 1, 2, 3, and 4 (13Tang Y. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fifth α-defensin sequence corresponded to a new peptide, here termed ROAD-1, which was not among those previously detected in macaque leukocytes (13Tang Y. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or small intestine (26Tanabe H. Yuan J. Zaragoza M.M. Dandekar S. Henschen-Deman A. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The full-length coding sequence of the ROAD-1 cDNA, determined by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”), encodes a 93-amino acid α-defensin prepropeptide that is most similar to the precursor encoding RMAD-4; the two peptides are 92.5! (87/94) identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 1). Of note is the absence of one amino acid between the second and third cysteines in the ROAD-1 primary structure, as compared with most known primate myeloid and enteric α-defensins (e.g. see RMAD-4 in Fig. 1). Using ROAD-1 sense 2 and antisense 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”), we amplified a number of related cDNAs derived from macaque cheek pouch mRNA. The sequences of the amplicons disclosed the expression of ROAD-1 and two additional oral α-defensins, termed ROAD-2a and -2b. As shown in Fig. 1, ROAD-2a and -2b have identical mature peptide sequences, and differ from mature ROAD-1 by a single amino acid (Phe → Ser) six residues from the carboxyl terminus. Interestingly, the signal and pro-segment sequences of ROAD-2a and -2b differ at six residue positions (Fig. 1). In parallel with the PCR-based screen for oral α-defensins, we characterized bone marrow cDNAs using the 12 primer pairs, both as a positive control for known myeloid α-defensins, and to determine which oral α-defensins were also expressed in myeloid elements. In bone marrow cDNA we detected all of the previously characterized rhesus myeloid α-defensins (RMAD 1-8) and also discovered a new α-defensin, termed RMAD-9 that, like the ROADs is most similar to RMAD-4 (Fig. 1). However, based on the absence of the RMAD-9 cDNA sequence in pooled oral cDNAs, it appears that RMAD-9 is not expressed in the oral cavity. We produced a synthetic version of mature ROAD-1, assembled as a 32-residue chain that was purified as the fully reduced peptide, then folded and oxidized in room air, and repurified by HPLC. The final product had the correct mass (3740.5 Da [M + H]+; calculated = 3740.3 Da), and eluted on analytical reverse phase-HPLC as a single peak but eluted much earlier than RMAD-4 (Fig. 2). ROAD-1 also migrated more rapidly than RMAD-4 in acid-urea PAGE, which was unexpected given that ROAD-1 (32 residues) and RMAD-4 (33 residues) are very similar in size and have the same net charge at values below pH 6. Antimicrobial Activities of ROAD-1—Synthetic ROAD-1 was evaluated for its antibacterial and antifungal activities in an agar diffusion format, and in these assays was compared with RMAD-4 and human α-defensin HNP-1. As shown in Fig. 3, all three peptides showed a dose-dependent antimicrobial effect against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. However, ROAD-1 produced the greatest zone of clearing against all three targets. Of note was the relative antimicrobial potency of the peptides against E. coli; ROAD-1 was approximately five times more active than RMAD-4 or HNP-1 against this Gram-negative organism (Fig. 3). Using suspension assays (13Tang Y. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that each peptide killed the same panel of test organisms, indicating that the clearing observed in the diffusion assays (Fig. 3) was at least partly due to a microbicidal effect (data not shown). NMR Spectroscopy and Analysis—Two-dimensional homonuclear NMR experiments were recorded on the peptide at 800 MHz. The two-dimensional NMR spectra of ROAD-1 acquired at 30 °C in 90! H2O, 10! D2O demonstrated very good chemical shift dispersion indicating a well structured protein. NMR diffusion measurements predict ROAD-1 to exist as a monomer in solution (data not shown). Using standard homonuclear methods (27Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), a near complete proton assignment was obtained. The DQF-COSY spectrum was used to identify spin systems and TOCSY and NOESY spectra were used to determine sequential connectivity along the backbone (Fig. 4). The side chain Hϵ of Arg7 was observed to be shifted downfield at 9.64 ppm compared with the expected value of 7.30 ppm. This is very similar to the corresponding Arg in the published data on mouse cryptdin-4 (28Jing W. Hunter H.N. Tanabe H. Ouellette A.J. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15759-15766Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Spectra obtained at a slightly different temperature, 25 °C, were used to resolve overlapping peaks and to confirm all resonance assignments. DQF-COSY and NOESY spectra acquired on a sample transferred to 100! D2O were used to resolve signals under the water resonance and to identify the residues involved in hydrogen bonding. The ROAD-1 sequence contains six cysteines at positions: 4 (CysI), 6 (CysII), 10 (CysIII), 20 (CysIV), 30 (CysV), and 31 (CysVI) and their positions are very similar to those reported for other α-defensins. NOESY spectra showed several inter-cysteine NOEs that establish disulfide bond pairs such as 4:CysHA to 31:CysHA; 6:CysHB1/2 to 20:CysHB1/2; 10:CysHA to 30:CysHB1/2 implicating the disulfide bonds in ROAD-1 to follow the canonical α-defensin bond pattern, i.e. CysI-CysVI, CysII-CysIV, and CysIII-CysV. The deviation of HA chemical shift from the random coil shifts can be readily used to identify the secondary structure elements in a protein (29Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the chemical shift index and also gives a summary of the inter residue NOE connectivities. The predominance of positive values in the chemical shift index is consistent with the β-strand secondary structure we find in ROAD-1, typical of an α-defensin fold (2Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The HAi to HNi+1 NOEs analyzed for the resonance assignments gave a strong indication that residues 3-7, 14-22, and 26-31 form β sheets. Numerous long-range NOEs between residues (such as those between residues, e.g. 7 and 28, and 19 and 26) support the arrangement of the three β sheets in an anti-parallel conformation. Solution Structure of ROAD-1—A total of 473 distance restraints derived from NOESY data and 21 dihedral restraints were used for the structure calculations. Nine hydrogen bonding restraints were added during the refining step. All the structures were calculated using simulated annealing and refined without explicit solvent. Of a total of 50 structures, 10 structures were selected to represent the solution structure of ROAD-1 based on lowest energy and least restraint violations; these are shown in Fig. 5B. The statistical data summarizing the quality are presented in Table 1 and reveal good convergence. All the selected structures have NOE violations less than 0.5 Å and dihedral violations less than 5 degrees. In addition, the structures show correct covalent geometries as evident from low deviations from the standard bond lengths and angles and in consideration of Ramachandran statistics. Moreover, the superposition of backbone atoms of all 10 low energy structures shows very low deviation. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations for backbone atoms (N, C, and Cα) for residues 3-29 is 0.86 Å. The backbone r.m.s. deviations of 1.35 Å for residues 1-32 suggests that the terminal residues are flexible with the NH2 terminus appearing to be more disordered than the COOH terminus (Fig. 5B).TABLE 1Energy contributions to the structures and deviations from standard geometry, NOE, and X-plor statistics for a family of 10 ROAD-1 structuresDataNumber of NOE restraints: 473Intra204Sequential113Medium34Long122Average energies (Kcal/mol)Etotal84.74Ebonds5.81Eangles30.33Eimp3.20Enoe26.84Evdw18.36Restraint violationsNOE violations greater than 0.2 Å14Maximum violations (Å)0.30Dihedral violations greater than 1°7Maximum violation (°)2.0Mean r.m.s. deviations from exp distance restraintsNOE (Å)0.043 ± 0.001Dihedral (°)0.310 ± 0.222Mean r.m.s. deviations from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.003 ± 0.000Angles (°)0.468 ± 0.006Impropers (°)0.276 ± 0.016Pairwise r.m.s. deviations (Å)Backbone atoms 1-32 (N, Ca, C) (Å)1.348 (±0.578)Backbone atoms 3-29 (N, CA,C) (Å)0.855 (±0.357)Ramachandran plotResidues in the most favored region88.2!Residues in additional allowed region10.4!Residues in generously allowed region1.4!Residues in disallowed region0.0! Open table in a new tab The predominant secondary structure in ROAD-1 is β sheet. The three strands are composed of residues: 3 to 7, 15 to 21, and 26 to 31, arranged in an anti-parallel manner (Fig. 6B). The NH2-terminal β strand (referred to as β1 from hereon) has a twist at His5, most likely as a consequence of being positioned between two cysteine residues (CysI and CysII) with backbone conformations restricted by disulfide bonds to remote cysteines (CysVI and CysIV). β1 is connected to the second β strand (β2) by two turns: a type IV turn (residues 8 to 10) followed by a type I turn (residues 11 to 14). The disulfide bond between CysIII and CysV stabilizes the type I turn.β2 is followed by a tight hairpin turn (residues 22 to 25) connecting it to the COOH-terminal β strand (β3). The solvent accessibility of each residue in the peptide was probed by rolling a sphere of radius 1.4 Å over the protein surface (Fig. 7). Although there are variations in sequence length and turn conformations, the total solvent accessible surface areas are very close (within 6!) for HNP-3, HD-5, Crp-4, RK-1, and ROAD-1. RO"

Quite apart from the dangers inherent in making general prophecies about the likely advance (or lack of advance) in any field of science, this statement implies a degree of perfection in existing methods of dealing with statistical problems arising in operational research which would not, I think, be claimed by practising statisticians. In particular, the analysis of data (such as survey data) which can be classified in a number of different ways, and multi-variate analysis, both require further development."
