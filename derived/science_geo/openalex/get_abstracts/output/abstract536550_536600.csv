This online minable database provides general access to the intrinsic complexity of the neocortex and enables further data-driven inquiries. The cellular organization of the mammalian brain is more complicated than that of any other known biological tissue. As a result, much of the nervous system’s fine cellular structure is unexplored. While it has been known for more than a century that a directional network interconnects many kinds of nerve cells (Cajal, 1899Cajal R.S. Textura del sistema nervioso del hombre y de los vertebrados. Moya, Madrid1899Google Scholar), and that this network underlies behaviors (Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. Yale University Press, Yale1906Google Scholar), for the most part, the precise relationships between the brain’s many cellular components are not known. Several laboratories are now beginning to generate such data in mammals using electron microscopy (EM). This work has provided new insights into the visual system (Anderson et al., 2011Anderson J.R.

Descriptions of neuronal network structure could also be important if derangements in networks underlie psychiatric or developmental disorders and/or if modifications to these networks store learned information (i.e., memories). Exploring such possibilities may require methods for obtaining detailed synaptic-level connectomic data. A reconstruction effort on the scale of mammalian brains, however, would be enormously expensive and difficult to justify without assurances that this kind of information would be of value (Marblestone et al., 2013Marblestone, A., Daugharthy, E., Kalhor, R., Peikon, I., Kebschull, J., Shipman, S., Mishchenko, Y., Dalrymple, D., Zamft, B., Kording, K., Boyden, E., Zador, A., and Church, G.

Substantial savings in effort could come if the connectivity of the cerebral cortex could be ascertained without looking at every single synapse. For example, if the overlap of axons and dendrites at light microscope resolution provides sufficient information to infer connectivity (Hill et al., 2012Hill S.L. Wang Y. Riachi I. Schürmann F. Markram H. Statistical connectivity provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2885-E2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), huge data sets of EM images of cerebral cortex might be superfluous. We thus decided to reconstruct all the connectivity within a very small piece of neocortical tissue (1,500 μm3 at a resolution allowing identification of every synaptic vesicle) to be in a better position to decide whether or not obtaining complete brain maps at such a fine level of resolution reveals interesting properties that cannot be inferred from either lower resolution or more sparse analyses. Previous connectomic studies of retina and hippocampus concluded that connectivity was not entirely predictable from the proximity of presynaptic elements to postsynaptic targets (Briggman et al., 2011Briggman K.L.

Connectomic reconstruction of the inner plexiform layer in the mouse retina.Nature. 2013; 500: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We wished to examine this question again but now in neocortex for several reasons. First, a large effort is underway to model and simulate neocortical processing based on stochastic connectivity based on spatial overlap of axons and dendrites (Markram et al., 2012Markram, H., Ailamaki A., Alvandpour A., Amunts K., Andreoni W., Ashburner J., Axer M., Baaden M., Badia R., Bartolome J., et al. (2012). The human brain project: A report to the European Commission. https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17648/TheHBPReport_LR.pdf/18e5747e-10af-4bec-9806-d03aead57655.Google Scholar). Second, the retina and the hippocampus (archicortex) are phylogenetically older than neocortex and may have evolved deterministic targeting mechanisms that could explain why overlap is insufficient to predict connectivity in those regions. In neocortex, however, less is known and it remains possible that spatial overlap is sufficient to explain synaptic connections between particular pairs of axons and dendrites. Third, in analyzing our data, we have found significant redundancies in the synaptic connections and wanted to know if these were accidental. For all these reasons, we have attempted to analyze the connectivity of each of many axons and dendrites by looking at not only the synapses each axon establishes but also the occurrences when axons and dendrites get close with potential postsynaptic targets but do not establish synapses. Even for such a small volume, however, we found considerable technical challenges standing in the way of doing such an analysis. After “saturating” the segmentation of a sub-region in the middle of the imaged volume in which all intracellular space was assigned to one or another cellular entity, we then needed to catalog all the connectivity and structural information into a minable database before analyses. Surprisingly, analysis of the connectomic data turned out to be even more challenging than creating the image data or annotating it. This “omics” approach provided a wealth of data for potential analysis. Here, we investigate aspects of the connectivity of excitatory axons and find interesting patterns that would have been difficult to detect with lower resolution methods. To assist readers who wish to examine the data in detail, we serve out the images and their segmentations and annotated databases that link to the image data, as well as all the software we developed for the display and analysis (described herein http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/). The results are divided into two parts. We first describe the technical approaches for acquiring and analyzing this data and then turn to some of the biological findings. We built an automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) that retrieves brain sections from the water boat of a diamond knife immediately as they are cut via a continuous submerged conveyor belt (Figure 1A ; Movie S1). The tape’s pulling motion and its adhesiveness cause the caught sections to lie flat on the tape’s surface (Figure 1A, inset). To generate the cerebral cortex image dataset in this paper, we collected 2,250 29-nm coronal brain slices (each section ∼1 mm2, total volume 0.13 mm3) from somatosensory cortex of a young adult mouse on ∼6.5 m of Kapton tape (Figure 1B). We generated 1,000 sections per 24 hr. We chose 29 nm as section thickness in order to trace the finest neuronal wires (Mishchenko, 2009Mishchenko Y. Automation of 3D reconstruction of neural tissue from large volume of conventional serial section transmission electron micrographs.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 176: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and with a sharp knife we have successfully sectioned >10,000 sections from a small block without missing a cut and importantly manual segmentation is nearly flawless at this thickness (see below). Following section collection, the tape was cut into strips and placed on silicon wafers that were then photographed (Figure 1C). The wafer image was used to map the positions of the sections on the wafer for automated EM (Hayworth et al., 2014Hayworth K.J. Morgan J.L. Schalek R. Berger D.R. Hildebrand D.G. Lichtman J.W. Imaging ATUM ultrathin section libraries with WaferMapper: a multi-scale approach to EM reconstruction of neural circuits.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Once mapped, the wafers constitute an ultrathin section library for repeated imaging of the sections at a range of resolutions (Figures 1D and 2; Movies S2, S3, S4, and S5).Figure 2Imaging Brain Sections on TapeShow full caption(A) A section of somatosensory neocortex imaged in a scanning electron microscope.

Sections were imaged with a scanning electron microscope using backscattered electron detection (9–10 keV incident electron energy), which had sufficient resolution and contrast to detect individual synaptic vesicles (red arrows, Figure 2A). In this study, reduced osmium tetroxide-thiocarbohydrazide (TCH)-osmium (ROTO) was used as stain (Friedman and Ellisman, 1981Friedman P.L. Ellisman M.H. Enhanced visualization of peripheral nerve and sensory receptors in the scanning electron microscope using cryofracture and osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium impregnation.J.

High-contrast en bloc staining of neuronal tissue for field emission scanning electron microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The ROTO stain highlights a tubular organelle coursing through most unmyelinated axons, aiding in reconstruction of fine processes (blue arrows, Figure 2A) (Sinha et al., 2013Sinha, A., Roncal, W.G., Kasthuri, N., Lichtman, J.W., Burns, R., and Kazhdan, M. (2013). Automatic annotation of axoplasmic reticula in pursuit of connectomes using high resolution neural EM data. 3rd Annual Hopkins Imaging Conference.Google Scholar; Movies S4 and S5). The plasma membranes with this staining protocol were 6–8 nm in width. We acquired high-resolution images with 3-nm pixels, ensuring that membrane boundaries would be oversampled for easier reconstruction. The same sample was imaged at lower resolutions (30 or 2,000 nm) to rapidly acquire images of larger tissue volumes (Figure 2B). Image acquisition scan rate was 1 M pixels per s. Time is also spent moving the stage from one section to another and automatic focusing each successive section, roughly halving the overall throughput. Speed-up can be achieved in several ways, including imaging different wafers in parallel on multiple microscopes, use of secondary electron detection (with 1.5–3 keV incident electron energy and speeds of up to 40 M pixels per s; Figure S1A), and by imaging in a new microscope that parallelizes imaging by use of multiple scanning beams (Eberle et al., 2015Eberle A.L. Mikula S. Schalek R. Lichtman J.W. Tate M.L. Zeidler D. High-resolution, high-throughput imaging with a multibeam scanning electron microscope.J. Microsc. 2015; (Published online January 27, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.12224Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; Figure S1B). We created a multi-scale digital volume in order to provide tissue context surrounding the region in which we did circuit reconstruction. We first imaged all the sections in their entirety at low resolution (2 μm/pixel). We also imaged a sub-volume (a radial strip of cerebral cortex extending from the pia to white matter, 500 μm wide and 1 mm long) at 29 nm/pixel and finally we imaged an ∼80,000 μm3 box (40 × 40 × 50 μm3) that transected the apical dendritic bundle of a cortical mini-column (Krieger et al., 2007Krieger P. Kuner T. Sakmann B. Synaptic connections between layer 5B pyramidal neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex are independent of apical dendrite bundling.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11473-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at high resolution (3 nm/pixel) (Figure 2B; Movies S4 and S5). A manual tool to segment neuronal processes in the image data: we developed a computer-assisted manual space-filling segmentation and annotation program (“VAST,” http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/Code/VAST/). VAST allowed us to work with EM images online, avoiding the need for their local storage, to “color” the images in at multiple scales of resolution, to organize the results in a flexible annotation framework, to export results for 3D visualization and analysis, and to do these tasks without being limited by working memory. We tested the accuracy of this manual tracing approach, by analyzing saturated segmentations in which every membrane-bound object in every section was colored in. We used a Matlab script (http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/Code/findOrphans) to find “orphans” (i.e., segmented objects that were not connected to parent axons and dendrites; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). The analysis found that in a ∼500 μm3 cylinder surrounding an apical dendrite (see below), there were no axonal or dendritic orphans in the volume, which included a total of 568 spines and 601 terminal axon branches. With the VAST manual reconstructions, miswiring errors (e.g., connecting the spine head or terminal axon varicosity to the wrong parent process) were also apparently rare because there was substantial agreement between two experienced tracers working independently in the assignment of the finest processes to their parent dendrites or axons (spine necks >99%; 565/568 agreement and axonal terminal branches >99%; 598/601 agreement). In the six cases of disagreement, the two tracers reached consensus once they compared results, meaning there were no places in which the axonal and dendritic data were actually ambiguous. However, for the astrocytic cytoplasm (Figure 3J), there were many glial fragments for which experts could not agree on how they were connected. Suite of automatic tracing tools: based on the tracing, we found 6.4 profiles per μm2 in a section and estimated that in the 64,000 um3 high-resolution volume there are 13.7 million cell profiles in its 1,850 sections. Experienced tracers require about 15 min to trace the ∼200 cell profiles in 1 μm3 so about two people-years of 24/7 tracing would be required to segment out all the profiles in this volume. We therefore developed ways to generate more rapid and automated segmentation of neural processes (details and software are available at http://www.rhoana.org/). To aid this effort, we manually traced all of the cellular objects in several small volumes (∼150 μm3) and used this “stained glass” segmented image data (Figure 3B) to train automated reconstruction methods (Fusion: Vazquez-Reina et al., 2011Vazquez-Reina, A., Gelbart, M., Huang, D., Lichtman, J., Miller, E.L., Pfister, H.

Neuroinform. 2014; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on this training, we produced automated segmentations of all the cellular processes within a high-resolution volume with dimensions of 30.7 × 30.7 × 33.7 μm (via the RhoANA pipeline using random forest membrane probabilities and graph-cut segmentations with the Fusion segmentation algorithm). In a sub-volume of the cube centered on the “red” neuronʼs apical dendrite (see below), we produced a different segmentation (via RhoANA using the Maxout deep-learning convolutional neural network for membrane probabilities and the GALA segment agglomeration algorithm). These automatically segmented volumes are available at http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/data/automatic_segmentation (Figure 3C; Movie S7). We found that although fully automated methods are improving rapidly, they are still only first passes and require human assistance to correct merge and split errors. In single images, we found that 92.6% of the pixels or 87.6% (of 92,747) of the profiles were correctly segmented with a fully automated segmentation algorithm (RhoANA with Maxout and GALA; Figures S2A and S2B). However, despite the appearance of largely correct two-dimensional data, when we analyzed cellular profiles in three dimensions, we estimated the need for ∼0.9 split operations (to correct inappropriate mergers) and 5.8 merge operations (to correct splits) per μm3 (Figure S2C; Movie S8). We did these corrections for a sub-volume of the full segmented dataset (cylinder 3; see below), with a newly developed tool for computer-assisted editing and rendering (Mojo and an online version for this tool “Dojo”; Haehn et al., 2014Haehn, D., Knowles-Barley, S., Roberts, M., Beyer, J., Kasthuri, N., Lichtman, J.W., and Pfister, H. (2014). Design and evaluation of interactive proofreading tools for connectomics. Proceedings of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.Google Scholar; available at http://www.rhoana.org/). The most important metric for automated reconstruction is the accuracy of the resulting connectivity matrix, but we concluded that at present it is premature to generate fully automated connectivity matrices. In the medium resolution volume, we identified neuronal somata in order to locate the cortical layer boundaries (Figure 3A) and reconstructed the shapes of a subset of cells running in a cortical mini-column (Figure 3A; Movie S6). Most (∼70%, 21/30) of these cells were pyramidal and the rest fell into several different categories, including putative interneurons, atypical excitatory cells, and glial cells. We then fully annotated a sub-volume of somatosensory cortex within this same volume (Movie S9; http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/data/segments). Building on work done previously in the hippocampus (Mishchenko et al., 2010Mishchenko Y. Hu T. Spacek J. Mendenhall J. Harris K.M. Chklovskii D.B.

Chklovskii D.B. Neurogeometry and potential synaptic connectivity.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we itemized all the neuronal and non-neuronal cells in three cylindrical volumes that encompass apical dendrite segments of two cortical pyramidal cells, including their spines (Movie S10). We selected these particular apical dendrites because they ran very close to each other (see pink arrow in Figures 3A and 3D) and originated from nearby neuronal somata (in upper layer 6; red and green arrows in Figures 3A and 3D). Thus, they appeared to be in the same mini-column and perhaps participated in the same neural processing unit (Mountcastle, 1997Mountcastle V.B. The columnar organization of the neocortex.Brain. 1997; 120: 701-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). The three cylinder site was in layer 5, 100 μm and 135 μm superficial to the pseudo-colored “red” and “green” neuronal somata, respectively. Cross-sections of the annotations of two cylinders are shown in Figures 3B and 3D; reconstruction of the three cylinders is shown in Figure 3E; and the location of all three cylinders in the full volume is shown with pink arrows in Figures 3A, 3D, and 3O. These three slightly overlapping ∼600 μm3 cylinders, two of which (cylinders 1 and 3) are centered on the “red” neuron’s apical dendrite and one (cylinder 2) on the “green” apical dendrite, provided a total reconstructed volume of 1,500 μm3. In cylinder 3, rather than tracing the objects manually, we edited the computer-segmented data (Figure 3C). All of the 193 dendrites in this volume were traced out into the surrounding high-resolution cube, and some were traced onto the medium resolution data to locate somata (n = 30; Figure 3O). The 1,500 μm3 3 cylinder volume contains parts of many cells (Movies S10 and S11) and of a variety of types (Figures 3E–3N; Movie S11), including 193 dendrites, 92% spiny, the rest relatively smooth (Figures 3K and 3N), and 1,407 unmyelinated axons. Based on synapse appearance, 93% of the axons are excitatory (Figure 3I), and most of the remainder are inhibitory (Figure 3L). A few axons (5; ∼0.5%), despite possessing vesicle-filled varicosities, did not establish classic close synaptic junctions with postsynaptic cells. In total, there were 1,700 synapses at a density of one synapse per 1.13 μm3 (Table S1). We also observed astrocytic processes (Figure 3J), myelinated axons (Figure 3F), oligodendrocyte processes (Figure 3G), and about 20 entities that we could not as easily classify (Figure 3M). Neuronal processes (axons and dendrites) occupy 92% of the cellular volume with glial processes, occupying much of the remaining 8% (Movies S9 and S10). The non-cellular (extracellular) space accounts for 6% of the total volume, less than half the extracellular space estimates from living brains, probably because of fixation-induced swelling (Vanharreveld et al., 1965Vanharreveld A. Crowell J. Malhotra S.K. A study of extracellular space in central nervous tissue by freeze-substitution.J. Cell Biol. 1965; 25: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The ∼7-fold disparity between the number of axons and dendrites (1,407 versus 193) likely reflects a real difference in the numbers of pre- and postsynaptic cells that send processes into the volume. We analyzed the shape of the 660 excitatory axons that entered cylinder 1 and found that only three of them (0.5%) established branches that were non-terminal within the volume (Figure S3). To estimate the number of axons that branched outside the cylinders and sent more than one branch in, we analyzed axonal arbors from light microscopy reconstructions of mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons (NeuroMorpho.org; see the Methods) by superimposing them on the cylindrical volumes at random locations. The result of this analysis argues that only ∼8 of the 1,308 excitatory axons (< 1%) in the volume are likely to be branches originating from the same parent neuron. Also, the dendrites in the cylinder only rarely originated from the same neuron: we found two dendritic shafts in cylinder 1 that were from the same neuron (out of 100). Presumably, therefore, axons extend into a 7-fold greater volume than dendrites, on average. The ∼1,600 different neurons within this small region of mammalian brain (several billionths of the volume of a whole brain) is more than five times as many neurons as are contained within the entire nervous system of a Caenorhabditis elegans (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We created a spreadsheet of the 1,700 synaptic connections in the volume, providing the location of each, its pre- and postsynaptic partners, and a wide variety of other information (Table S1; http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/view/highResAnnotated; http://openconnecto.me/Kasthurietal2014/data/synapses). The spreadsheet shows that the connectivity is highly skewed toward excitatory elements: 92% (177/193) of the dendrites are spiny and purportedly excitatory (Figure 3K; DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992DeFelipe J. Fariñas I. The pyramidal neuron of the cerebral cortex: morphological and chemical characteristics of the synaptic inputs.Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and 93% (1,308/1,407) of the axons are excitatory. Looking at each presynaptic varicosity, we found that 95% (1,610/1,700) of them also meet the criteria for being excitatory. Each excitatory axon establishes slightly more synapses in the volume than each inhibitory axon (∼1.2 synapses/excitatory axon versus ∼0.9 synapses/inhibitory). The excitatory-to-inhibitory-synapse ratio (van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996van Vreeswijk C. Sompolinsky H.

https://openalex.org/W2189664213,"Kidney fibrosis is marked by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Here we find that, during renal fibrosis, TECs acquire a partial EMT program during which they remain associated with their basement membrane and express markers of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The functional consequence of the EMT program during fibrotic injury is an arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and lower expression of several solute and solvent transporters in TECs. We also found that transgenic expression of either Twist1 (encoding twist family bHLH transcription factor 1, known as Twist) or Snai1 (encoding snail family zinc finger 1, known as Snail) expression is sufficient to promote prolonged TGF-β1-induced G2 arrest of TECs, limiting the cells' potential for repair and regeneration. In mouse models of experimentally induced renal fibrosis, conditional deletion of Twist1 or Snai1 in proximal TECs resulted in inhibition of the EMT program and the maintenance of TEC integrity, while also restoring cell proliferation, dedifferentiation-associated repair and regeneration of the kidney parenchyma and attenuating interstitial fibrosis. Thus, inhibition of the EMT program in TECs during chronic renal injury represents a potential anti-fibrosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1666901150,"Heterogeneous pools of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to brain maintenance and regeneration after injury. The balance of NSC activation and quiescence, as well as the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors, may contribute to diversity of neuronal and glial fates. To identify molecular hallmarks governing these characteristics, we performed single-cell sequencing of an unbiased pool of adult subventricular zone NSCs. This analysis identified a discrete, dormant NSC subpopulation that already expresses distinct combinations of lineage-specific transcription factors during homeostasis. Dormant NSCs enter a primed-quiescent state before activation, which is accompanied by downregulation of glycolytic metabolism, Notch, and BMP signaling and a concomitant upregulation of lineage-specific transcription factors and protein synthesis. In response to brain ischemia, interferon gamma signaling induces dormant NSC subpopulations to enter the primed-quiescent state. This study unveils general principles underlying NSC activation and lineage priming and opens potential avenues for regenerative medicine in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1875506666,"Recent progress in understanding the diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons has highlighted the importance--and the challenges--of defining mammalian neuronal cell types. Although neurons may be best categorized using inclusive criteria spanning biophysical properties, wiring of inputs, wiring of outputs, and activity during behavior, linking all of these measurements to cell types within the intact brains of living mammals has been difficult. Here, using an array of intact-brain circuit interrogation tools, including CLARITY, COLM, optogenetics, viral tracing, and fiber photometry, we explore the diversity of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We identify two parallel nigrostriatal dopamine neuron subpopulations differing in biophysical properties, input wiring, output wiring to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) versus dorsolateral striatum (DLS), and natural activity patterns during free behavior. Our results reveal independently operating nigrostriatal information streams, with implications for understanding the logic of dopaminergic feedback circuits and the diversity of mammalian neuronal cell types."

Our findings explain both EBs end-tracking behavior and their effect on microtubule dynamics. Microtubules (MTs) are cytoskeletal polymers that play essential roles in intracellular transport, chromosome segregation, cellular organization and cell motility. They are assembled from αβ tubulin heterodimers, which stack head-to-tail into polar protofilaments, with ∼13 protofilaments associating laterally in parallel to form a hollow, polar cylinder. These lateral contacts are homotypic (α-α and β-β contacts), except at a single site or “seam” (with α-β and β-α contacts) (Mandelkow et al., 1986Mandelkow E.M. Schultheiss R. Rapp R. Müller M. Mandelkow E. On the surface lattice of microtubules: helix starts, protofilament number, seam and handedness.J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the functional relevance of which is not yet understood. Both in vivo and in vitro, the MT end capped by β-tubulin, termed the “plus end,” undergoes stochastic switching between phases of growth and shrinkage, a hallmark behavior known as dynamic instability (Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Dynamic instability of microtubule growth.Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). This property is essential for MT function, most notably during mitosis, as highlighted by the fact that anticancer agents like Taxol inhibit cell division by stabilizing MTs and suppressing their dynamics (Dumontet and Jordan, 2010Dumontet C. Jordan M.A. Microtubule-binding agents: a dynamic field of cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability is fundamentally linked to the nucleotide state of tubulin. α- and β-tubulin each contains a GTP binding site located at the longitudinal interface between subunits. The GTP bound at the N-site (non-exchangeable) in α-tubulin is buried at the intradimer interface where it plays a structural role (Menéndez et al., 1998Menéndez M. Rivas G. Díaz J.F. Andreu J.M. Control of the structural stability of the tubulin dimer by one high affinity bound magnesium ion at nucleotide N-site.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), while the GTP bound at the E-site (exchangable) in β-tubulin is exposed in the unassembled dimer and is hydrolyzed within the MT via longitudinal contacts with α-tubulin as assembly proceeds (Nogales et al., 1999Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. High-resolution model of the microtubule.Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). A cap of GTP-tubulin (i.e., tubulin dimers containing GTP at the E-site) is thought to stabilize the plus end of the MT structure and promote its growth, while its disappearance (by GTP hydrolysis or subunit loss) makes the MT lattice unstable and prone to depolymerization (Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Dynamic instability of microtubule growth.Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). To allow rapid remodeling of the MT cytoskeleton in response to various cellular signals, many MT-associated proteins (MAPs) are capable of modulating MT dynamics (Desai and Mitchison, 1997Desai A.

In this study, we focus on end-binding proteins (EBs), which are the central hub for a network of plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) that selectively accumulate at growing MT ends (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A.

Biol. 2010; 20: R528-R537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). EBs contain an N-terminal calponin-homology domain (CH domain) that directly interacts with the MT and mediates autonomous end-tracking (Hayashi and Ikura, 2003Hayashi I. Ikura M.

Recent studies have shown that EBs also play an important role in modulating MT dynamics. Although contradictory effects have been reported, partly due to different experimental conditions (in vitro versus in vivo, different EB constructs, different affinity tags, etc.), the emerging picture is that EBs both stimulate MT growth and increase catastrophe frequency (the transition from growth to shrinkage) (Maurer et al., 2014Maurer S.P.

Biol. 2014; 24: 372-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Maurer et al., 2011Maurer S.P. Bieling P. Cope J. Hoenger A. Surrey T. GTPgammaS microtubules mimic the growing microtubule end structure recognized by end-binding proteins (EBs).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3988-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar demonstrated that EB1 (and its fission yeast homolog Mal3) targets to growing MT ends by recognizing a nucleotide-dependent structural state. This state, mimicked in vitro by a GTPγS-bound MT lattice, but not the one stabilized by the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog GMPCPP, does not exist in the body of dynamic MTs, which are composed of GDP-bound tubulin. They further reported the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Mal3-bound GTPγS MT at 8.6 Å resolution (Maurer et al., 2012Maurer S.P. Fourniol F.J. Bohner G. Moores C.A. Surrey T. EBs recognize a nucleotide-dependent structural cap at growing microtubule ends.Cell. 2012; 149: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), showing that Mal3 binds to four neighboring tubulins, at the junction between two protofilaments and two longitudinal interfaces. We recently reported cryo-EM reconstructions of MTs at ∼5 Å resolution, for dynamic GDP-bound and stable GMPCPP-bound MTs (Alushin et al., 2014Alushin G.M. Lander G.C. Kellogg E.H. Zhang R. Baker D. Nogales E. High-resolution microtubule structures reveal the structural transitions in αβ-tubulin upon GTP hydrolysis.Cell. 2014; 157: 1117-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Comparison of these structures showed that the major change associated with GTP hydrolysis is a compaction at the interdimer interface around the E-site. At resolutions of ∼5 Å, direct atomic modeling into our cryo-EM maps was not possible. Instead, we used the density map in conjunction with Rosetta modeling (Song et al., 2013Song Y. DiMaio F. Wang R.Y. Kim D. Miles C. Brunette T. Thompson J. Baker D. High-resolution comparative modeling with RosettaCM.Structure. 2013; 21: 1735-1742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) to define an ensemble of 20 low-energy structural conformers and used their average to describe each MT structure. In this study, we have now determined structures at 3.5 Å or better resolution for MTs coassembled with EB3 and EB-free MTs in different nucleotide states. Comparison of these structures has allowed us to define three nucleotide-dependent conformational states within the MT lattice, with EB proteins recognizing and promoting a hydrolysis intermediate. These findings explain both the tip-tracking behavior and the complex effect of EB proteins on MT dynamics. Using decoration with kinesin motor-domain to discriminate between α- and β-tubulin and a single particle helical reconstruction scheme implementing MT pseudo-helical symmetry, we recently reported reconstructions at 4.9 Å and 4.7 Å resolution, respectively, of dynamic GDP-bound MTs, where GTP is hydrolyzed during polymerization and stable GMPCPP-bound MTs (Alushin et al., 2014Alushin G.M. Lander G.C. Kellogg E.H. Zhang R. Baker D. Nogales E. High-resolution microtubule structures reveal the structural transitions in αβ-tubulin upon GTP hydrolysis.Cell. 2014; 157: 1117-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We have now used a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) and improved data processing strategies (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), to obtain cryo-EM reconstructions of MTs at 3.5 Å or better resolution (Figure S1A; Table S1; Movie S1). By copolymerization with excess human EB3 (a monomeric construct lacking its C-terminal dimerization domain), we have determined the structures of EB3 bound to its preferred substrate, GTPγS-MT (Figures 1A and 1B ), as well as MTs in GMPCPP and GDP states. Our image analysis procedures allowed us to use only the small and often substoichiometric EB3 molecules as the tubulin dimer marker in the absence of kinesin. In addition, we have substantially improved the resolution of the EB-free, kinesin-decorated GMPCPP- and GDP-MTs. For completeness and comparison purposes, we obtained both a kinesin-decorated and a kinesin-free GTPγS-MT structure after coassembly with EB3. Comparison of these two structures (both at ∼3.5 Å resolution) shows very similar lattice parameters (Table S2). Furthermore, merging these two datasets resulted in an improved resolution of 3.3 Å for the tubulin part (Figures 1C–1E and S1A–S1C), indicating that these two structures are practically indistinguishable and that the presence of kinesin has no significant effect on the structure of EB3-bound MTs. Interestingly, we found that kinesin competes off some of the EB3 molecules, as reflected by the weaker EB3 densities when kinesin was included (Figure S2A; Movie S1). The reconstruction shows close proximity between the α0-β1 loop of kinesin and the C-terminal end of the α6-helix of EB3 (Figure S2B), which likely results in steric clashes between these two MT binders.Figure 1High-Resolution Cryo-EM Structure of EB3-Decorated GTPγS-MTShow full caption(A) Overview of the cryo-EM reconstruction of EB3-GTPγS-MT, with pseudo-helical symmetry applied. α-tubulin, β-tubulin and EB3 are colored green, blue and orange, respectively.(B) The asymmetric (C1) reconstruction of (A) viewed from the seam.(C and D) Density for an αβ-tubulin dimer segmented from a merged map of EB3-GTPγS-MT (with and without kinesin), viewed from the outside (C) and from the lumen (D) of the MT.(E) Cryo-EM density segmented from (C) and atomic model of H4, H7 and T7 of α-tubulin, as well as the N-site GTP and coordinating Mg2+ ion.See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2Interactions between EB3 CH Domain and Microtubule and Potential EB-Kinesin Interaction, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cryo-EM reconstruction of kinesin-decorated EB3-GTPγS-MT, viewed from the outside. α-tubulin, β-tubulin, EB3 and kinesin are colored in green, blue, orange, and tan, respectively.(B) Atomic models showing the close proximity between the α0-β1 loop of kinesin and the C-terminal end of the α6-helix of EB3.(C) Sequence alignment of the CH domains of several EBs and fimbrin.

GTPγS-bound tubulin is a very poor MT nucleator under the common conditions used for GTP-tubulin assembly (Hamel and Lin, 1984Hamel E. Lin C.M. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), a potent nucleotide inhibitor of microtubule assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11060-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although others have described a protocol for GTPγS-tubulin assembly from GMPCPP seeds in the absence of EB3 (Maurer et al., 2011Maurer S.P. Bieling P. Cope J. Hoenger A. Surrey T. GTPgammaS microtubules mimic the growing microtubule end structure recognized by end-binding proteins (EBs).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3988-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we obtained mostly ring like structures following this protocol. Only in the presence of high glycerol concentrations (∼50%) were we able to form MTs with GTPγS-tubulin (or even GDP-tubulin), but such conditions are incompatible with cryo-EM imaging. We refer to our six MT structures as EB3-GTPγS, EB3-GTPγS-K (K stands for kinesin decoration), EB3-GMPCPP, EB3-GDP, GMPCPP-K and GDP-K MTs. At a resolution of 3.4–3.5 Å, densities due to most side chains are present in these cryo-EM maps (Figure 1E), with the noticeable exception of those from acidic residues (Glu and Asp), presumably due to radiation damage during electron exposure (Allegretti et al., 2014Allegretti M. Mills D.J. McMullan G. Kühlbrandt W. Vonck J. Atomic model of the F420-reducing [NiFe] hydrogenase by electron cryo-microscopy using a direct electron detector.eLife. 2014; 3: e01963Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the EB3 density is at slightly lower resolution than the tubulin part (Figures S1B and S1C), it was possible to generate atomic models of both tubulin and EB3 directly from the cryo-EM maps (Table S3) that allowed the detailed visualization of EB3-tubulin interactions, the tubulin nucleotide binding pockets, the lateral contacts between protofilaments and the structure of the MT seam. Our cryo-EM structure of EB3-bound GTPγS-MTs allowed us to fully visualize the interactions between the CH domain of EB3 and the four tubulin molecules it contacts (Figure 2A; Movie S2). The identified interacting residues explain well the EB mutations that abolish its end-tracking behavior (Maurer et al., 2012Maurer S.P. Fourniol F.J. Bohner G. Moores C.A. Surrey T. EBs recognize a nucleotide-dependent structural cap at growing microtubule ends.Cell. 2012; 149: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Slep and Vale, 2007Slep K.C.

On one side of EB3, two highly conserved residues, K76 and Q79, potentially hydrogen bond with the main chain of the C-terminal end of α1:H10 helix (Figure 2B), while residues L67 and H69 interact with β1:H309 and a region of the β1:T5 loop, respectively (Figure 2C). Additionally, the acid C-terminal tail (or “E-hook”) of α1-tubulin, which is unresolved beyond residue α1:E441, is located close to EB3 residues R59, K60 and potentially its basic linker region following the last resolved residue Q131 (Figure 2C), presumably making electrostatic interactions. Such contact would be consistent with experiments showing greatly reduced affinity of MTs treated with subtilisin, which removes the C-terminal tails of tubulin, for EB1 constructs containing this linker region (Zhu et al., 2009Zhu Z.C. Gupta K.K. Slabbekoorn A.R. Paulson B.A. Folker E.S. Goodson H.V. Interactions between EB1 and microtubules: dramatic effect of affinity tags and evidence for cooperative behavior.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32651-32661Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other side of EB3, our cryo-EM structure reveals the conformation of the extended N terminus of EB3 (residues 1–16) as it bridges two tubulin dimers via interactions with the α2:H4, α2:H5 and β2:H12′ helices (Figure 2D). Despite its apparent flexibility based on the relatively weaker density, the conformation of this EB3 segment is clearly different from that in the reported crystal structure (Komarova et al., 2009Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. et al.Mammalian end binding proteins control persistent microtubule growth.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), indicating a reorganization upon tubulin binding. Finally, there is a major contact that involves residues R17, K100, F101 and Q102 of EB3 making extensive interactions with the β2:H3′-H3 helices (Figure 2E), with a potential cation-π interaction between EB3:R17 and β2:Y108. Interestingly, the tubulin-binding sites on the EB3 CH domain show some significant overlap with the actin-binding sites of the CH domain of fimbrin (Figure S2C) proposed in a previous cryo-EM study (Galkin et al., 2008Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Cherepanova O. Lebart M.C. Egelman E.H. High-resolution cryo-EM structure of the F-actin-fimbrin/plastin ABD2 complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CH domain of the Ndc80 kinetochore protein, which is more divergent from EBs, interacts with completely different regions of tubulin using an alternative surface (Alushin et al., 2010Alushin G.M. Ramey V.H. Pasqualato S. Ball D.A. Grigorieff N. Musacchio A. Nogales E. The Ndc80 kinetochore complex forms oligomeric arrays along microtubules.Nature. 2010; 467: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In our previous study, comparison of the GMPCPP-K and GDP-K MT structures showed that GTP hydrolysis results in a lattice compaction around the longitudinal interface sandwiching the E-site nucleotide (Alushin et al., 2014Alushin G.M. Lander G.C. Kellogg E.H. Zhang R. Baker D. Nogales E. High-resolution microtubule structures reveal the structural transitions in αβ-tubulin upon GTP hydrolysis.Cell. 2014; 157: 1117-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This finding is now confirmed by our higher-resolution structures of these two states (Figures S3A and S3B). Unexpectedly, the EB3-GTPγS-MT structure displays a compacted lattice, making it more similar to the GDP-K state (Table S2). However, a GDP-like lattice is consistent with GTPγS-tubulin behaving like GDP-tubulin regarding its difficulty to nucleate and elongate MTs. The lattice compaction between the GMPCPP-K and EB3-GTPγS-MT states, very similar to that seen between the GMPCPP-K and GDP-K MT structures, is best illustrated by comparing the atomic models of three longitudinally interacting tubulin dimers along a protofilament (PF) (Figures 3A and 3B ), superimposing the two models on the intermediate domain of the middle β-tubulin (Figure 3A, β2-cyan). This display strategy allows the simultaneous visualization of conformational changes within the tubulin dimer (as seen in the central β2-α2 dimer), as well as the associated compaction along the protofilament (illustrated by the up and down movement, respectively, of the top and bottom dimers). Cα-RMSD analysis (Figure 3B; Movie S3) clearly shows a lack of significant domain rearrangement within β-tubulin, with only small, local changes around the E-site, as can be best seen in β2-tubulin. On the other hand, there is a significant displacement of the dimer above (β3-α3) and below (β1-α1), compacting the E-sites, that is coupled to a notable rearrangement of α-tubulin, as can be best seen in α2-tubulin. Interestingly, there is an “anchor point” across the longitudinal interface, contacting the E-site and near the MT surface, that does not move (Figure 3B, red arrow, Figure 3C, red circle). This unaffected contact involves hydrophobic interactions between the H8 helix and S7-H8 loop of α-tubulin and the H11′ helix of β-tubulin (Figure 3D). Thus, the compaction brings every two adjacent dimers along the protofilament closer to each other around an anchor point between them, necessarily resulting in a conformational rearrangement of every α-tubulin. Within α-tubulin, the intermediate domain and the C-terminal H11-H12 helices undergo a small rotation with respect to the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (Figure S4A, black arrow), which maintains its relative position with respect to the β-tubulin within the same dimer (Figure 3B, see both α3- and α2-tubulin). The H8 helix and S7-H8 loop display the largest changes, which appear to be coupled to the movement of the next tubulin dimer (Figure 3B, red and cyan arrows).Figure S4Comparison of the Structural Elements among EM Structures and Crystal Structures, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full captionAll models are superimposed on the N-terminal domain of the β-tubulin.(A) Comparison of α-tubulin structures between GMPCPP-K (gold) and EB3-GTPγS states (green and blue for α- and β-tubulin, respectively), showing a relative rotation of the intermediate domain (black arrow) and C-terminal H11, H12 helices with respect to the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (cyan).(B) Same as (A), also comparing with the crystal structure of RB3-bound tubulin in a GDP state (PDB ID: 3RYI).(C) Comparison of three crystal structures of RB3-bound tubulin in different nucleotide states (PDB IDs: 3RYI, 3RYC and 3RYF).

https://openalex.org/W4241413696,"Charles Serhan and colleagues report four new resolvins produced under inflammatory conditions that speed resolution of bacterial infection in mice. Endogenous mechanisms leading to host protection and resolution of infections without immunosuppression are of wide interest1,2. Here we elucidate the structures of four new host-protective molecules produced in neutrophil-endothelial cocultures and present in human and mouse tissues after sterile inflammation or infection. The bioactive molecules contain conjugated triene and diene double bonds, carry an alcohol at C13 and are derived from n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5). These compounds, termed 13-series resolvins (RvTs), demonstrated potent protective actions increasing mice survival during Escherichia coli infections. RvTs also regulated human and mouse phagocyte responses stimulating bacterial phagocytosis and regulating inflammasome components. Their biosynthesis during neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions was initiated by endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased by atorvastatin via S-nitrosylation of COX-2 and reduced by COX-2 inhibitors. The actions of atorvastatin and RvTs were additive in E. coli infections in mice, where they accelerated resolution of inflammation and increased survival >60%. Taken together, these results document host-protective molecules in bacterial infections, namely RvTs, derived from n-3 DPA via transcellular biosynthesis and increased by atorvastatin. These molecules regulate key innate protective responses in the resolution of infectious inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1829491214,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and incurable disease. Poor prognosis is due to multiple reasons, including acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine, the first-line chemotherapeutic approach. Thus, there is a strong need for novel therapies, targeting more directly the molecular aberrations of this disease. We found that chronic exposure of PDAC cells to gemcitabine selected a subpopulation of cells that are drug-resistant (DR-PDAC cells). Importantly, alternative splicing (AS) of the pyruvate kinase gene (PKM) was differentially modulated in DR-PDAC cells, resulting in promotion of the cancer-related PKM2 isoform, whose high expression also correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival in PDAC patients. Switching PKM splicing by antisense oligonucleotides to favor the alternative PKM1 variant rescued sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin, suggesting that PKM2 expression is required to withstand drug-induced genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, upregulation of the polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (PTBP1), a key modulator of PKM splicing, correlated with PKM2 expression in DR-PDAC cell lines. PTBP1 was recruited more efficiently to PKM pre-mRNA in DR- than in parental PDAC cells. Accordingly, knockdown of PTBP1 in DR-PDAC cells reduced its recruitment to the PKM pre-mRNA, promoted splicing of the PKM1 variant and abolished drug resistance. Thus, chronic exposure to gemcitabine leads to upregulation of PTBP1 and modulation of PKM AS in PDAC cells, conferring resistance to the drug. These findings point to PKM2 and PTBP1 as new potential therapeutic targets to improve response of PDAC to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1096877704,"There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum has a vital role in motor learning by constructing an estimate of the sensory consequences of movement. Theory suggests that this estimate is compared with the actual feedback to compute the sensory prediction error. However, direct proof for the existence of this comparison is lacking. We carried out a trial-by-trial analysis of cerebellar neurons during the execution and adaptation of voluntary head movements and found that neuronal sensitivities dynamically tracked the comparison of predictive and feedback signals. When the relationship between the motor command and resultant movement was altered, neurons robustly responded to sensory input as if the movement was externally generated. Neuronal sensitivities then declined with the same time course as the concurrent behavioral learning. These findings demonstrate the output of an elegant computation in which rapid updating of an internal model enables the motor system to learn to expect unexpected sensory inputs."
https://openalex.org/W1022321647,"The authors show that fruit flies briefly silence visual processing during voluntary flight turns, which likely helps flies to ignore the image of the world sweeping over the retina during such turns. Each time a locomoting fly turns, the visual image sweeps over the retina and generates a motion stimulus. Classic behavioral experiments suggested that flies use active neural-circuit mechanisms to suppress the perception of self-generated visual motion during intended turns. Direct electrophysiological evidence, however, has been lacking. We found that visual neurons in Drosophila receive motor-related inputs during rapid flight turns. These inputs arrived with a sign and latency appropriate for suppressing each targeted cell's visual response to the turn. Precise measurements of behavioral and neuronal response latencies supported the idea that motor-related inputs to optic flow–processing cells represent internal predictions of the expected visual drive induced by voluntary turns. Motor-related inputs to small object–selective visual neurons could reflect either proprioceptive feedback from the turn or internally generated signals. Our results in Drosophila echo the suppression of visual perception during rapid eye movements in primates, demonstrating common functional principles of sensorimotor processing across phyla."

Plasticity in the motor cortex is important for acquisition and maintenance of motor skills, but how the loss of dopamine in PD leads to disrupted structural and functional plasticity in the motor cortex is not well understood. Here we used mouse models of PD and two-photon imaging to show that dopamine depletion resulted in structural changes in the motor cortex. We further discovered that dopamine D1 and D2 receptor signaling selectively and distinctly regulated these aberrant changes in structural and functional plasticity. Our findings suggest that both D1 and D2 receptor signaling regulate motor cortex plasticity, and loss of dopamine results in atypical synaptic adaptations that may contribute to the impairment of motor performance and motor memory observed in PD."

In spite of their disparate origins and structures, many of these compounds bind actin at the same site and exhibit structural relationships reminiscent of modular, combinatorial drug libraries. Here we investigate biosynthesis and evolution of three compound groups: misakinolides, scytophycin-type compounds and luminaolides. For misakinolides from the sponge Theonella swinhoei WA, our data suggest production by an uncultivated 'Entotheonella' symbiont, further supporting the relevance of these bacteria as sources of bioactive polyketides and peptides in sponges. Insights into misakinolide biosynthesis permitted targeted genome mining for other members, providing a cyanobacterial luminaolide producer as the first cultivated source for this dimeric compound family. The data indicate that this polyketide family is bacteria-derived and that the unusual macrolide diversity is the result of combinatorial pathway modularity for some compounds and of convergent evolution for others."

Several studies have shown that the ""ground state"" induced by 2i is characterized by global hypomethylation and specific transcriptional profiles, but little is known about the contributing effectors. Here we show that 2i conditions rapidly alter the global binding landscape of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. The dynamic binding influences enhancer activity and shows enrichment for regulators linked to Wnt and Erk signaling. Epigenomic characterization provided limited insights to the immediate transcriptional dynamics, suggesting that these are likely more secondary effects. Likewise, loss of the PRC2 component EED to prevent H3K27me3 deposition had minimal effect on the transcriptome, implying that it is largely dispensable for continued repression of bivalent genes and de novo silencing in 2i."
https://openalex.org/W1938837643,"The RAG1 endonuclease, together with its cofactor RAG2, is essential for V(D)J recombination but is a potent threat to genome stability. The sources of RAG1 mis-targeting and the mechanisms that have evolved to suppress it are poorly understood. Here, we report that RAG1 associates with chromatin at thousands of active promoters and enhancers in the genome of developing lymphocytes. The mouse and human genomes appear to have responded by reducing the abundance of “cryptic” recombination signals near RAG1 binding sites. This depletion operates specifically on the RSS heptamer, whereas nonamers are enriched at RAG1 binding sites. Reversing this RAG-driven depletion of cleavage sites by insertion of strong recombination signals creates an ectopic hub of RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination and chromosomal translocations. Our findings delineate rules governing RAG binding in the genome, identify areas at risk of RAG-mediated damage, and highlight the evolutionary struggle to accommodate programmed DNA damage in developing lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1803957926,"Neuronal plasticity helps animals learn from their environment. However, it is challenging to link specific changes in defined neurons to altered behavior. Here, we focus on circadian rhythms in the structure of the principal s-LNv clock neurons in Drosophila. By quantifying neuronal architecture, we observed that s-LNv structural plasticity changes the amount of axonal material in addition to cycles of fasciculation and defasciculation. We found that this is controlled by rhythmic Rho1 activity that retracts s-LNv axonal termini by increasing myosin phosphorylation and simultaneously changes the balance of pre-synaptic and dendritic markers. This plasticity is required to change clock network hierarchy and allow seasonal adaptation. Rhythms in Rho1 activity are controlled by clock-regulated transcription of Puratrophin-1-like (Pura), a Rho1 GEF. Since spinocerebellar ataxia is associated with mutations in human Puratrophin-1, our data support the idea that defective actin-related plasticity underlies this ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W1843956953,"Based on its marked overexpression in multiple malignancies and its roles in promoting cell survival and proliferation, survivin is an attractive candidate for targeted therapy. Toward this end, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms regulating survivin expression in different cancer cells will be critical. We have previously shown that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) CUG-BP1 is overexpressed in esophageal cancer cells and post-transcriptionally regulates survivin in these cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRs) in regulating survivin expression in esophageal cancer cells. Using miR expression profiling analysis, we found that miR-214-3p is one of the most markedly downregulated miRs in two esophageal squamous cancer cell lines compared with esophageal epithelial cells. Interestingly, using miR target prediction programs, both survivin and CUG-BP1 mRNA were found to contain potential binding sites for miR-214-3p. Forced expression of miR-214-3p in esophageal cancer cells leads to a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of both survivin and CUG-BP1. This effect is due to decreased mRNA stability of both targets. By contrast, silencing miR-214-3p in esophageal epithelial cells leads to an increase in both survivin and CUG-BP1 mRNA and protein. To determine whether the observed effect of miR-214-3p on survivin expression was direct, mediated through CUG-BP1, or both, binding studies utilizing biotin pull-down assays and heterologous luciferase reporter constructs were performed. These demonstrated that the mRNA of survivin and CUG-BP1 each contain two functional miR-214-3p-binding sites as confirmed by mutational analysis. Finally, forced expression of miR-214-3p enhances the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. This effect is abrogated with rescue expression of survivin or CUG-BP1. These findings suggest that miR-214-3p acts as a tumor suppressor and that its downregulation contributes to chemoresistance in esophageal cancer cells by targeting both survivin and CUG-BP1."

Localized occurrences of large in situ fossilized rangeomorph populations allow fundamental aspects of their biology to be resolved using spatial point process techniques. Here we use such techniques to identify recurrent clustering patterns in the rangeomorph Fractofusus, revealing a complex life history of multigenerational, stolon-like asexual reproduction, interspersed with dispersal by waterborne propagules. Ecologically, such a habit would have allowed both for the rapid colonization of a localized area and for transport to new, previously uncolonized areas. The capacity of Fractofusus to derive adult morphology by two distinct reproductive modes documents the sophistication of its underlying developmental biology."

Early diagnosis is essential for improvements of prognosis and survival of the patients. Currently, there is no effective biomarker available in clinical settings for early detection of lung cancer. Altered expressions in many cancer types including NSCLC and stable existence in plasma make microRNAs (miRNAs) a group of potentially useful biomarkers for clinical assessments of patients with NSCLC.To evaluate the potential values of miRNAs as blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in NSCLC patients.Peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers and early-staged NSCLC patients before and after surgery were collected, and plasma was separated. Expression of ten miRNAs in the plasma and tumor sections of the patients was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.MiRNA (miR)-486 and miR-150 were found to significantly distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy volunteers. Area under curve of miR-486 and miR-150 were 0.926 (sensitivity, 0.909; specificity, 0.818) and 0.752 (sensitivity, 0.818; specificity, 0.818), respectively. In response to therapy, patients with down-regulated miR-486 expression showed prolonged recurrence-free survival than those with un-reduced miR-486 expression (median, unreached vs. 19 months; hazard ratio, 0.1053; 95% confidence interval, 0.01045 to 1.060; P=0.056).The results suggest that miR-486 and miR-150 could be potential blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of NSCLC.

https://openalex.org/W1116859432,"Tat-interacting protein of 60 kDa (TIP60) is an essential lysine acetyltransferase implicated in transcription, DNA damage response and apoptosis. TIP60 protein expression is reduced in cancers. In cervical cancers, human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncogene targets cellular p53, Bak and some of the PDZ domain-containing proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation through E6AP ligase. Recently, E6 oncogene from high-risk and low-risk categories was also shown to target TIP60. However, the molecular mechanisms and whether destabilization of TIP60 contributes to HPV E6-mediated transformation remain unanswered. Our proteomic analyses revealed EDD1 (E3 identified by differential display), an E3 ligase generally overexpressed in cancers as a novel interacting partner of TIP60. By investigating protein turnover and ubiquitination assays, we show that EDD1 negatively regulates TIP60’s stability through the proteasome pathway. Strikingly, HPV E6 uses this function of EDD1 to destabilize TIP60. Colony-formation assays and soft agar assays show that gain of function of TIP60 or depletion of EDD1 in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells significantly inhibits cell growth in vitro. This phenotype is strongly supported by the in-vivo studies where re-activation of TIP60 in cervical cancer cells dramatically reduces tumor formation. In summary, we have discovered a novel ligase through which E6 destabilizes TIP60. Currently, in the absence of an effective therapeutic vaccine for malignant cervical cancers, cervical cancer still remains to be a major disease burden. Hence, our studies implying a distinct tumor suppressor role for TIP60 in cervical cancers show that reactivation of TIP60 could be of therapeutic value."

https://openalex.org/W1955371253,"Accumulating evidence suggests that changes of the protein synthesis machinery alter translation of specific mRNAs and participate in malignant transformation. Here we show that protein kinase C α (PKCα) interacts with TRM61, the catalytic subunit of the TRM6/61 tRNA methyltransferase. The TRM6/61 complex is known to methylate the adenosine 58 of the initiator methionine tRNA (tRNAi(Met)), a nuclear post-transcriptional modification associated with the stabilization of this crucial component of the translation-initiation process. Depletion of TRM6/61 reduced proliferation and increased death of C6 glioma cells, effects that can be partially rescued by overexpression of tRNAi(Met). In contrast, elevated TRM6/61 expression regulated the translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the tumorigenic process and increased the ability of C6 cells to form colonies in soft agar or spheres when grown in suspension. In TRM6/61/tRNAi(Met)-overexpressing cells, PKCα overexpression decreased tRNAi(Met) expression and both colony- and sphere-forming potentials. A concomitant increase in TRM6/TRM61 mRNA and tRNAi(Met) expression with decreased expression of PKCα mRNA was detected in highly aggressive glioblastoma multiforme as compared with Grade II/III glioblastomas, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. Altogether, we suggest that PKCα tightly controls TRM6/61 activity to prevent translation deregulation that would favor neoplastic development."

However, the documented resistance stocks derived from rye is faced severe challenge due to the variation of virulent isolates in the pathogen populations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop desirable germplasm and search for novel resistance gene sources against constantly accumulated variation of the virulent isolates. In the present study, a new wheat-rye line designated as WR49-1 was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. Using sequential GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), mc-FISH (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization), mc-GISH (multicolor GISH) and EST (expressed sequence tag)-based marker analysis, WR49-1 was proved to be a new wheat-rye 6R disomic addition line. As expected, WR49-1 showed high levels of resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 19 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage. According to its reaction pattern to different Bgt isolates, WR49-1 may possess new resistance gene(s) for powdery mildew, which differed from the documented powdery mildew gene, including Pm20 on chromosome arm 6RL of rye. Additionally, WR49-1 was cytologically stable, had improved agronomic characteristics and therefore could serve as an important bridge for wheat breeding and chromosome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1073687638,"RNF126 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The deletion of RNF126 gene was observed in a wide range of human cancers and is correlated with improved disease-free and overall survival. These data highlight the clinical relevance of RNF126 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. However, the specific functions of RNF126 remain largely unknown. Homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double-strand break repair is important for tumor suppression and cancer therapy resistance. Here, we demonstrate that RNF126 facilitates HR by promoting the expression of BRCA1, in a manner independent of its E3 ligase activity but depending on E2F1, a well-known transcription factor of BRCA1 promoter. In support of this result, RNF126 promotes transactivation of BRCA1 promoter by directly binding to E2F1. Most importantly, an RNF126 mutant lacking 11 amino acids that is responsible for the interaction with E2F1 has a dominant-negative effect on BRCA1 expression and HR by suppressing E2F1-mediated transactivation of BRCA1 promoter and blocking the enrichment of E2F1 on BRCA1 promoter. Lastly, RNF126 depletion leads to the increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition. Collectively, our results suggest a novel role of RNF126 in promoting HR-mediated repair through positive regulation on BRCA1 expression by direct interaction with E2F1. This study not only offers novel insights into our current understanding of the biological functions of RNF126 but also provides a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment."

Hippocampal pathology is likely to contribute to cognitive disability in Down syndrome, yet the neural network basis of this pathology and its contributions to different facets of cognitive impairment remain unclear. Here we report dysfunctional connectivity between dentate gyrus and CA3 networks in the transchromosomic Tc1 mouse model of Down syndrome, demonstrating that ultrastructural abnormalities and impaired short-term plasticity at dentate gyrus–CA3 excitatory synapses culminate in impaired coding of new spatial information in CA3 and CA1 and disrupted behavior in vivo.

We tested the efficacy and safety of the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine for suppressing shivering induced by a rapid infusion of cold intravenous fluids. Methods Ten subjects received a rapid intravenous infusion of two liters of cold (4°C) isotonic saline on two separate test days, and we measured their core body temperature, shivering, hemodynamics and sedation for two hours. On one test day, fluid infusion was preceded by placebo infusion. On the other test day, fluid infusion was preceded by 1.0 μg/kg bolus of dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes. Results All ten subjects experienced shivering on placebo days, with shivering beginning at a mean (SD) temperature of 36.6 (0.3)°C. The mean lowest temperature after placebo was 36.0 (0.3)°C (range 35.7-36.5°C). Only 3/10 subjects shivered on dexmedetomidine days, and the mean lowest temperature was 35.7 (0.4)°C (range 35.0-36.3°C). Temperature remained below 36°C for the full two hours in 6/10 subjects. After dexmedetomidine, subjects had moderate sedation and a mean 26 (13) mmHg reduction in blood pressure that resolved within 90 minutes. Heart rate declined a mean 23 (11) bpm after both placebo and dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine produced no respiratory depression. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine decreases shivering in normal volunteers. This effect is associated with decreased systolic blood pressure and sedation, but no respiratory depression."

The promotion of what has been termed ""new-type urbanization"" cannot, as a result of these regional differences, be expected to follow a universal approach--rather, such a development must objectively adhere to locational and category-specific principles and adopt differentiated urbanization development models. Regional categorization is often used in geography, but is rarely deployed in research addressing human and social problems relating to urbanization. In March 2014, China published the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014-2020), which calls for the scientific and reasonable planning of ""new-type urbanization,"" and appropriate regional categorizations are urgently needed in order to guide this reform.

FRET detection by fluorescence lifetime measurements is the most direct and robust method to measure FRET. The traditional cyan-yellow fluorescent protein based FRET pairs are getting replaced by green-red fluorescent protein variants. The green-red pair enables excitation at a longer wavelength which reduces cellular autofluorescence and phototoxicity while monitoring FRET. Despite the advances in FRET based sensors, the low FRET efficiency and dynamic range still complicates their use in cell biology and high throughput screening. In this paper, we utilized the higher lifetime of NowGFP and screened red fluorescent protein variants to develop FRET pairs with high dynamic range and FRET efficiency. The FRET variations were analyzed by proteolytic activity and detected by steady-state and time-resolved measurements. Based on the results, NowGFP-tdTomato and NowGFP-mRuby2 have shown high potentials as FRET pairs with large fluorescence lifetime dynamic range. The in vitro measurements revealed that the NowGFP-tdTomato has the highest Förster radius for any fluorescent protein based FRET pairs yet used in biological studies.

https://openalex.org/W1631699299,"Background Serum troponin assays, widely used to detect acute cardiac ischemia, might be useful biomarkers to detect chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac-specific troponin-I (cTnI) and troponin-T (cTnT) generally detect myocardial necrosis equally well. In dialysis patients however, serum cTnT levels are often elevated, unlike cTnI levels. The present study aims to elucidate the associations of cTnI and cTnT with CVD in clinically stable dialysis patients. Methods Troponin levels were measured using 5th generation hs-cTnT assays (Roche) and STAT hs-cTnI assays (Abbott) in a cohort of dialysis patients. Serum troponin levels were divided into tertiles with the lowest tertile as a reference value. Serum troponins were associated with indicators of CVD such as left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Associations were explored using regression analysis. Results We included 154 consecutive patients, 68±7 years old, 77% male, 70% hemodialysis. Median serum cTnT was 51ng/L (exceeding the 99th percentile of the healthy population in 98%) and median serum cTnI was 13ng/L (elevated in 20%). A high cTnI (T3) was significantly associated with a higher LVMI (Beta 31.60; p=0.001) and LVEF (Beta -4.78; p=0.005) after adjusting for confounders whereas a high serum cTnT was not. CAD was significantly associated with a high cTnT (OR 4.70 p=0.02) but not with a high cTnI. Unlike cTnI, cTnT was associated with residual renal function (Beta:-0.09; p=0.006). Conclusion In the present cohort, serum cTnI levels showed a stronger association with LVMI and LVEF than cTnT. However, cTnT was significantly associated with CAD and residual renal function, unlike cTnI. Therefore, cTnI seems to be superior to cTnT as a marker of left ventricular dysfunction in asymptomatic dialysis patients, while cTnT might be better suited to detect CAD in these patients."

Here we show that silencing of the EGF-related factor amphiregulin (AREG) markedly inhibits the expansion of human keratinocytes through mitotic failure and accumulation of cells with ⩾ 4n DNA content. RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis revealed that tetracycline-mediated AREG silencing significantly altered the expression of 2331 genes, 623 of which were not normalized by treatment with EGF. Interestingly, genes irreversibly upregulated by suppression of AREG overlapped with genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Moreover, a significant proportion of the irreversibly downregulated genes featured upstream binding sites recognized by forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), a key transcription factor in the control of mitosis that is widely dysregulated in cancer. The downregulation of FoxM1 and its target genes preceded mitotic arrest. Constitutive expression of FoxM1 in AREG knockdown cells normalized cell proliferation, reduced the number of cells with ⩾ 4n DNA content and rescued expression of FoxM1 target genes. These results demonstrate that AREG controls G2/M progression and cytokinesis in keratinocytes via activation of a FoxM1-dependent transcriptional program, suggesting new avenues for treatment of epithelial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1613009581,"Skeletal condensation occurs when specified mesenchyme cells self-organize over several days to form a distinctive cartilage template. Here, we determine how and when specified mesenchyme cells integrate mechanical and molecular information from their environment, forming cartilage condensations in the pharyngeal arches of chick embryos. By disrupting cytoskeletal reorganization, we demonstrate that dynamic cell shape changes drive condensation and modulate the response of the condensing cells to Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Rho Kinase (ROCK)-driven actomyosin contractions and Myosin II-generated differential cell cortex tension regulate these cell shape changes. Disruption of the condensation process inhibits the differentiation of the mesenchyme cells into chondrocytes, demonstrating that condensation regulates the fate of the mesenchyme cells. We also find that dorsal and ventral condensations undergo distinct cell shape changes. BMP signaling is instructive for dorsal condensation-specific cell shape changes. Moreover, condensations exhibit ventral characteristics in the absence of BMP signaling, suggesting that in the pharyngeal arches ventral morphology is the ground pattern. Overall, this study characterizes the interplay between cytoskeletal dynamics and molecular signaling in a self-organizing system during tissue morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2227022490,"Songbirds learn precisely sequenced motor skills (songs) subserved by distinct brain areas, including the premotor cortical analog HVC, which is essential for producing learned song, and a 'cortical'-basal ganglia loop required for song plasticity. Inputs from these nuclei converge in RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), making it a likely locus for song learning. However, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has never been described in either input. Using a slice preparation, we found that stimulation patterns based on singing-related activity were able to drive opposing changes in the strength of RA's inputs: when one input was potentiated, the other was depressed, with the direction and magnitude of changes depending on the relative timing of stimulation of the inputs. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations that blocked synaptic plasticity in vitro also prevented reinforcement-driven changes to song in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the importance of precise timing in the basal ganglia-motor cortical interactions subserving adaptive motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W1208344767,"The JAK2V617F mutation is found in most patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). This gain-of-function mutation dysregulates cytokine signaling and is associated with increased accumulation of DNA damage, a process likely to drive disease evolution. JAK2V617F inhibits NHE-1 upregulation in response to DNA damage and consequently represses Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis, thus giving rise to inappropriate cell survival. However, the mechanism whereby NHE-1 expression is inhibited by JAK2V617F is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells expressing JAK2V617F compromises the NHE-1/Bcl-xL deamidation pathway by repressing NHE-1 upregulation in response to DNA damage. In JAK2V617F-positive cells, increased ROS levels results from aberrant PI3K signaling, which decreases nuclear localization of FOXO3A and decreases catalase expression. Furthermore, when compared with autologous control erythroblasts, clonally derived JAK2V617F-positive erythroblasts from MPN patients displayed increased ROS levels and reduced nuclear FOXO3A. However, in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), FOXO3A is largely localized within the nuclei despite the presence of JAK2V617F mutation, suggesting that JAK2-FOXO signaling has a different effect on progenitors compared with stem cells. Inactivation of FOXO proteins and elevation of intracellular ROS are characteristics common to many cancers, and hence these findings are likely to be of relevance beyond the MPN field."
https://openalex.org/W1876726910,"Climate and human-driven changes play an important role in regional droughts. Northwest Yunnan Province is a key region for biodiversity conservation in China, and it has experienced severe droughts since the beginning of this century; however, the extent of the contributions from climate and human-driven changes remains unclear. We calculated the ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield (WY) of northwest Yunnan Province, China from 2001 to 2013 using meteorological and remote sensing observation data and a Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. Multivariate regression analyses were used to differentiate the contribution of climate and vegetation coverage to ET. The results showed that the annual average vegetation coverage significantly increased over time with a mean of 0.69 in spite of the precipitation fluctuation. Afforestation/reforestation and other management efforts attributed to vegetation coverage increase in NW Yunnan. Both ET and WY considerably fluctuated with the climate factors, which ranged from 623.29 mm to 893.8 mm and -51.88 mm to 384.40 mm over the time period. Spatially, ET in the southeast of NW Yunnan (mainly in Lijiang) increased significantly, which was in line with the spatial trend of vegetation coverage. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that climatic factors accounted for 85.18% of the ET variation, while vegetation coverage explained 14.82%. On the other hand, precipitation accounted for 67.5% of the WY. We conclude that the continuous droughts in northwest Yunnan were primarily climatically driven; however, man-made land cover and vegetation changes also increased the vulnerability of local populations to drought. Because of the high proportion of the water yield consumed for subsistence and poor infrastructure for water management, local populations have been highly vulnerable to climate drought conditions. We suggest that conservation of native vegetation and development of water-conserving agricultural practices should be implemented as adaptive strategies to mitigate climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2116027286,"Cellular signaling transduction critically depends on molecular interactions that are in turn governed by dynamic subcellular distributions of the signaling system components. Comprehensive insight into signal transduction requires an understanding of such distributions and cellular structures driving them. To investigate the activation of primary murine T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) we have imaged more than 60 signaling intermediates during T cell stimulation with microscopy across resolution limits. A substantial number of signaling intermediates associated with a transient, wide, and actin-associated lamellum extending from an interdigitated T cell:APC interface several micrometers into the T cell, as characterized in detail here. By mapping the more than 60 signaling intermediates onto the spatiotemporal features of cell biological structures, the lamellum and other ones previously described, we also define distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of T cell signal initiation, amplification, and core signaling in the activation of primary T cells by APCs. These characteristics differ substantially from ones seen when T cells are activated using common reductionist approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2133366443,"To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL."
https://openalex.org/W1064987153,"Approximately 30% of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma die from pulmonary metastases. The mechanisms that drive sarcoma metastasis are not well understood. Recently, we identified miR-182 as a driver of sarcoma metastasis in a primary mouse model of soft-tissue sarcoma. We also observed elevated miR-182 in a subset of primary human sarcomas that metastasized to the lungs. Here, we show that myogenic differentiation factors regulate miR-182 levels to contribute to metastasis in mouse models. We find that MyoD directly binds the miR-182 promoter to increase miR-182 expression. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that Pax7 can promote sarcoma metastasis in vivo through MyoD-dependent regulation of pro-metastatic miR-182. Taken together, these results suggest that sarcoma metastasis can be partially controlled through Pax7/MyoD-dependent activation of miR-182 and provide insight into the role that myogenic transcription factors have in sarcoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W1771009175,"Objective To investigate recognised co-morbidities and clinical management associated with inpatient pneumonia mortality in Malawian district hospitals. Methods Prospective cohort study, of patient records, carried out in Malawi between 1st October 2000 and 30th June 2003. The study included all children aged 0-59 months admitted to the paediatric wards in sixteen district hospitals throughout Malawi with severe and very severe pneumonia. We compared individual factors between those that survived (n = 14 076) and those that died (n = 1 633). Results From logistic regression analysis, predictors of death in hospital, adjusted for age, sex and severity grade included comorbid conditions of meningitis (OR =2.49, 95% CI 1.50-4.15), malnutrition (OR =2.37, 95% CI 1.94-2.88) and severe anaemia (OR =1.41, 95% CI 1.03-1.92). Requiring supplementary oxygen (OR =2.16, 95% CI 1.85-2.51) and intravenous fluids (OR =3.02, 95% CI 2.13-4.28) were associated with death while blood transfusion was no longer significant (OR =1.10, 95% CI 0.77-1.57) when the model included severe anaemia. Conclusions This study identified a number of challenges to improve outcome for Malawian infants and children hospitalised with pneumonia. These included improved assessment of co-morbidities and more rigorous application of standard case management."
https://openalex.org/W1849493445,"To evaluate, using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), both the condylar-fossa relationships and the mandibular and condylar asymmetries between unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients and non-cleft patients with class III skeletal relationship, and to investigate the factors of asymmetry contributing to chin deviation.The UCLP and non-cleft groups consisted of 30 and 40 subjects, respectively, in mixed dentition with class III skeletal relationships. Condylar-fossa relationships and the dimensional and positional asymmetries of the condyles and mandibles were examined using CBCT. Intra-group differences were compared between two sides in both groups using a paired t-test. Furthermore, correlations between each measurement and chin deviation were assessed.It was observed that 90% of UCLP and 67.5% of non-cleft subjects had both condyles centered, and no significant asymmetry was found. The axial angle and the condylar center distances to the midsagittal plane were significantly greater on the cleft side than on the non-cleft side (P=0.001 and P=0.028, respectively) and were positively correlated with chin deviation in the UCLP group. Except for a larger gonial angle on the cleft side, the two groups presented with consistent asymmetries showing shorter mandibular bodies and total mandibular lengths on the cleft (deviated) side. The average chin deviation was 1.63 mm to the cleft side, and the average absolute chin deviation was significantly greater in the UCLP group than in the non-cleft group (P=0.037).Compared with non-cleft subjects with similar class III skeletal relationships, the subjects with UCLP showed more severe lower facial asymmetry. The subjects with UCLP presented with more asymmetrical positions and rotations of the condyles on axial slices, which were positively correlated with chin deviation."
https://openalex.org/W1108037116,"The MDS1 and ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) complex locus (MECOM) gene encodes several transcription factor variants including MDS1-EVI1, EVI1 and EVI1Δ324. Although MDS1-EVI1 has been associated with tumor-suppressing activity, EVI1 is a known oncogene in various cancers, whose expression is associated with poor patient survival. Although EVI1Δ324 is co-transcribed with EVI1, its activity in cancer cells is not fully understood. Previous reports described that unlike EVI1, EVI1Δ324 protein cannot transform fibroblasts because of its disrupted N-terminal zinc finger (ZNF) domain. To better understand EVI1Δ324 biology and function, we obtained genome-wide binding occupancies and expression data in ovarian cancer cells. We characterized its DNA-binding sites, binding motif and target genes. Comparative analyses with previous study show that EVI1 and EVI1Δ324 share similar transcriptional activities linked to their common C-terminus ZNF domain. They bind to an E-twenty-six family (ETS)-like motif, target to a large extent the same genes and cooperate with AP1 transcription factor. EVI1Δ324-occupied genes were 70.7% similar to EVI1-bound genes. More strikingly, EVI1 and EVI1Δ324 differentially expressed genes were 99.87% identical, indicating comparable transcriptional regulatory functions. Consistently with gene ontologies linked to these target genes, EVI1Δ324 expression in HeLa cells could enhance anchorage-independent growth, such as EVI1, showing that EVI1Δ324 expression also lead to pro-oncogenic effects. The main specific feature of EVI1 variant is its N-terminus ZNF domain that binds DNA through GATA-like motif. We found that most GATA-like EVI1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing peaks are far from genes and are not involved in transcriptional regulation. These genomic regions were enriched in simple sequence repeats and displayed high meiotic recombination rates. Overall, our genomics analyses uncovered common and specific features of two major MECOM isoforms. Their influence on transcription and downstream cell proliferation was comparable. However, EVI1-specific GATA-like binding sites, from its N-terminus ZNF domain, associated with high recombination rates, suggesting possible additional oncogenic potential for EVI1 in modulating genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1060714599,"Physicians appear to find zoonotic diseases a challenge and consider that this topic belongs more to the veterinary profession. However, veterinarians have no formal role in clinical medicine. Data were collected as part of the Queensland Social Survey 2014 to determine the willingness of the public, if diagnosed with a zoonotic disease, to consult a veterinarian on the advice of a physician. Self-reported willingness to consult with a veterinarian at the respondent’s own expense was 79.8% (95% CI: 81.96%-77.46%) (976/1223). If the cost was funded by Medicare, the Australian public health insurance scheme, 90.7% (95% CI: 92.18%-88.92%) (1109/1223) would be willing to consult a veterinarian. Therefore, a large majority of Australian residents would be willing to consult with a veterinarian on the advice of their physician if they had a zoonotic disease. Does this indicate a possible new role for veterinarians under Clinical One Health?"
https://openalex.org/W1666262752,"Weed competition is a significant problem in maize (Zea mays, L.) production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Better understanding of weed management and costs in maize intercropped with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.) during transition to conservation agricultural systems is needed. Changes in weed population and maize growth were assessed for a period of three years at Bungoma where crops are grown twice per year and at Trans-Nzoia where crops are grown once per year. Treatments included three tillage practices: minimum (MT), no-till (NT) and conventional (CT) applied to three cropping systems: continuous maize/bean intercropping (TYPICAL), maize/bean intercropping with relayed mucuna after bean harvest (RELAY) and maize, bean and mucuna planted in a strip intercropping arrangement (STRIP). Herbicides were used in NT, shallow hand hoeing and herbicides were used in MT and deep hoeing with no herbicides were used in CT. Weed and maize performance in the maize phase of each cropping system were assessed at both locations and costs of weed control were estimated at Manor House only. Weed density of grass and forb species declined significantly under MT and NT at Manor House and of grass species only at Mabanga. The greatest declines of more than 50% were observed as early as within one year of the transition to MT and NT in STRIP and TYPICAL cropping systems at Manor House. Transitioning to conservation based systems resulted in a decline of four out of five most dominant weed species. At the same time, no negative impact of MT or NT on maize growth was observed. Corresponding costs of weed management were reduced by $148.40 ha-1 in MT and $149.60 ha-1 in NT compared with CT. In conclusion, farmers can benefit from effective and less expensive weed management alternatives early in the process of transitioning to reduced tillage operations."
https://openalex.org/W1829717538,"In a heterogeneous wireless network, handover techniques are designed to facilitate anywhere/anytime service continuity for mobile users. Consistent best-possible access to a network with widely varying network characteristics requires seamless mobility management techniques. Hence, the vertical handover process imposes important technical challenges. Handover decisions are triggered for continuous connectivity of mobile terminals. However, bad network selection and overload conditions in the chosen network can cause fallout in the form of handover failure. In order to maintain the required Quality of Service during the handover process, decision algorithms should incorporate intelligent techniques. In this paper, a new and efficient vertical handover mechanism is implemented using a dynamic programming method from the operation research discipline. This dynamic programming approach, which is integrated with the Technique to Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, provides the mobile user with the best handover decisions. Moreover, in this proposed handover algorithm a deterministic approach which divides the network into zones is incorporated into the network server in order to derive an optimal solution. The study revealed that this method is found to achieve better performance and QoS support to users and greatly reduce the handover failures when compared to the traditional TOPSIS method. The decision arrived at the zone gateway using this operational research analytical method (known as the dynamic programming knapsack approach together with Technique to Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) yields remarkably better results in terms of the network performance measures such as throughput and delay."

The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to investigate the effects of lifestyles on kidney function in healthy people.A total of 7473 healthy people were enrolled in this Saitama Cardiometabolic Disease and Organ Impairment Study, Japan. Data on alcohol consumption, exercise frequency, and sleep duration were collected. The outcome event was incident CKD or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by >25% in 3 years.Subjects were classified into four groups according to body mass index and gender. Mean ± standard deviation of age was 38.8±10.5 years; eGFR, 78.1±15.2 ml/min/1.73 m2. In the male groups, multivariate logistic regression models showed that the outcome events were associated with a small amount of alcohol consumed (20 to 140 g of alcohol/week) (ref. more than 140 g of alcohol/week); non-obese male, adjusted odds ratio 1.366 (95% confidence interval, 1.086, 1.718); obese male (body mass index ≥25), 1.634 (1.160, 2.302); and with frequent exercise (twice a week or more) (ref. no exercise); non-obese male, 1.417 (1.144, 1.754); obese male, 1.842 (1.317, 2.577). Sleep duration was not associated with the outcome events.These findings suggest that, regardless of obesity, a small amount of alcohol consumed and high exercise frequency were associated with the increased risk of loss of kidney function in the male groups."

Subsequently, we calculated the MMR (deaths per 100,000 live births) and the proportion of direct and indirect causes of maternal death by maternal age and year.Based on the linked data sets, we identified 236 maternal death cases, of which only 102 were reported in officially published mortality data, with an underreporting rate of 57% [(236-102) × 100 / 236]. The age-adjusted MMR was 18.4 in 2004-2005 and decreased to 12.5 in 2008-2009; however, the MMR leveled off at 12.6 in 2010-2011. The MMR increased from 5.2 in 2008-2009 to 7.1 in 2010-2011 for patients aged 15-29 years. Women aged 15-29 years had relatively lower proportion in dying from direct causes (amniotic fluid embolism and obstetric hemorrhage) compared with their counterpart older women.Approximately two-thirds of maternal deaths were not reported in officially published mortality data. Routine surveillance of maternal mortality by using enhanced methods is necessary to monitor the health status of reproductive-age women. Furthermore, a comprehensive maternal death review is necessary to explore the preventability of these maternal deaths."
https://openalex.org/W954402964,"Background Haiti has the highest number of people living with HIV infection in the Caribbean/Latin America region. Medical male circumcision (MMC) has been recommended to help prevent the spread of HIV. We sought to assess knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs about MMC among a sample of health care providers in Haiti. Methods A convenience sample of 153 health care providers at the GHESKIO Centers in Haiti responded to an exploratory survey that collected information on several topics relevant to health providers about MMC. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the responses and multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine opinions of health care providers about the best age to perform MMC on males. Bayesian network analysis and sensitivity analysis were done to identify the minimum level of change required to increase the acceptability of performing MMC at age less than 1 year. Results The sample consisted of medical doctors (31.0%), nurses (49.0%), and other health care professionals (20.0%). Approximately 76% showed willingness to offer MMC services if they received training. Seventy-six percent believed that their male patients would accept circumcision, and 59% believed infancy was the best age for MMC. More than 90% of participants said that MMC would reduce STIs. Physicians and nurses who were willing to offer MMC if provided with adequate training were 2.5 (1.15–5.71) times as likely to choose the best age to perform MMC as less than one year. Finally, if the joint probability of choosing “the best age to perform MMC” as one year or older and having the mistaken belief that ""MMC prevents HIV entirely"" is reduced by 63% then the probability of finding that performing MMC at less than one year acceptable to health care providers is increased by 35%. Conclusion Participants demonstrated high levels of knowledge and positive attitudes towards MMC. Although this study suggests that circumcision is acceptable among certain health providers in Haiti, studies with larger and more representative samples are needed to confirm this finding."

However, no study has analyzed a nationwide population-based database. To estimate the incidence and treatment pattern of unplanned excision in extremity STS in the Korean population, a nationwide epidemiologic study was performed using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, a centralized nationwide healthcare claims registry of Korea that covers the entire Korean population. Among 1,517 patients with extremity STS in the 4-year study period, 553 (36.5%) underwent unplanned excision (unplanned group). About 80% of unplanned excisions were performed in tertiary or general hospitals. Of the unplanned group, 240 (43.4%) underwent re-excision with or without radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, and 51 (9.2%) did not undergo re-excision but were treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy; whereas, 262 (47.4%) did not undergo any further treatment following unplanned excision. This study is the first nationwide population-based study on the unplanned excision of extremity STS. The results may have implications in establishing preventive or therapeutic measures to reduce the burden of unplanned excision of extremity STS."

The aim of the present study was to analyze the accuracy of measurements of Raypex 6 and EndoPilot using a novel, objective image-analysis system.Onehundred and twenty teeth were randomized and allocated to three groups: After coronal flaring, either Raypex 6 or EndoPilot were used to determine the endodontic working length during instrumentation using manual files (RPM and EPM group respectively). In addition, EndoPilot was used for continuous, automatic measurement during rotating instrumentation (EPA group). If the working length had been reached according to endometric results, the files were fixed in place. Tooth and file were then embedded and prepared for analysis. Subsequently, the distance between the tip of the file and the apical constriction (DAC) or the apical foramen (DAF) was calculated using trigonometric analysis and the position of the file relative to AC and AF was analyzed.Both inter- and intra-examiner-reliability of the trigonometric analysis were nearly perfect (ICC = 0.999, p<0.001). DAC was not significantly different between groups (p>0.05, t-test). DAF was significantly decreased when EPA had been used compared to EPM (p<0.05, Exact-test). EPA resulted in files being positioned beyond AF significantly more often than the other two methods (p<0.01).All methods allowed reliable detection of AC. However, EPA significantly increased the risk of overpreparation. Objective, digital assessment based on image analysis was suitable to compare the accuracy of different endometric devices."
https://openalex.org/W1880859660,"Objective Parallel to an ever stronger advocacy for the use of generics, various sources of information report concerns regarding substitution. The literature indicates that information regarding substitution is not univocal. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore patients’ representations regarding generics in patients suffering from non-specific disabling chronic musculoskeletal pain, as these patients are confronted with the issue of the prescription and/or substitution of original formulations with generics. Methods Qualitative methods were selected because the aim was to access the range of patients' representations and to consider their conceptions. Standardized face-to-face semi-structured interviews were used, and transcripts were submitted to content analysis. Results Patients’ representations suggest that they might be confident in taking a generic medication: when he/she has an understanding of generics as resulting from a development process that has become part of the public domain; the generic medication is prescribed by the physician; each prescription is discussed, i.e., the patient is prescribed the generic version of a given medication and not a generic medication. Discussion Economic arguments are not sufficient to justify substitution, and may even raise issues calling upon cognitive dissonance. Even in non-life-threatening diseases, negative cues require attention and need be de-emphasized - in particular lower price as an indication of lower quality, and generic status as contradictory with advocating individualization of medication."
