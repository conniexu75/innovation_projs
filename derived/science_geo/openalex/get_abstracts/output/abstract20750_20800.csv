https://openalex.org/W2125423296,"Peptide growth factors may play a role in patterning of the early embryo, particularly in the induction of mesoderm. We have explored the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in early Xenopus development by expressing a dominant negative mutant form of the FGF receptor. Using a functional assay in frog oocytes, we found that a truncated form of the receptor effectively abolished wild-type receptor function. Explants from embryos expressing this dominant negative mutant failed to induce mesoderm in response to FGF. In whole embryos the mutant receptor caused specific defects in gastrulation and in posterior development, and overexpression of a wild-type receptor could rescue these developmental defects. These results demonstrate that the FGF signaling pathway plays an important role in early embryogenesis, particularly in the formation of the posterior and lateral mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2000079550,"trkB is a tyrosine protein kinase gene highly related to trk, a proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). trkB expression is confined to structures of the central and peripheral nervous systems, suggesting it also encodes a receptor for neurotrophic factors. Here we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-3, but not NGF, can induce rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of gp145trkB, one of the receptors encoded by trkB. BDNF and NT-3 can induce DNA synthesis in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells that express gp145trkB. Cotransfection of plasmids encoding gp145trkB and BDNF or NT-3 leads to transformation of recipient NIH 3T3 cells. In these assays, BDNF elicits a response at least two orders of magnitude higher than NT-3. Finally, 125I-NT-3 binds to NIH 3T3 cells expressing gp145trkB; binding can be competed by NT-3 and BDNF but not by NGF. These findings indicate that gp145trkB may function as a neurotrophic receptor for BDNF and NT-3."
https://openalex.org/W2061183445,"In this report we provide four lines of evidence indicating that E12/E47-like proteins interact in vivo with the myogenic HLH proteins MyoD and myogenin. First, cotransfection of MyoD and E47 in COS cells indicates that these factors synergistically enhance transcription of a reporter gene containing an oligomerized MyoD-binding site. Second, mobility-shift assays of muscle cell nuclear extracts, ""double shifted"" with specific antisera, have identified complexes binding to the MEF1 site that contain either MyoD or myogenin in association with E12/E47-like proteins. Third, association with E47 alters the phosphorylation state of MyoD. Fourth, C3H10T1/2 cells expressing antisense E2A transcripts contain low levels of E2A gene products and display less terminal muscle differentiation when infected with retroviral MyoD or when challenged to differentiate with 5-azacytidine treatment. In addition we demonstrate that MyoD, in conjunction with E12/E47-like proteins, is functioning as a regulatory nodal point for activation of several other downstream muscle regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1600110256,"The temporal aspects and mechanisms of the regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase (MMP-2) by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) were investigated in early passage human gingival fibroblasts and compared with the regulation of the genes for collagenase (MMP-1) and TIMP, the tissue inhibitor of MMPs. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that 1.0 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 increased the abundance of MMP-2 mRNA/cell approximately 1.5-fold at 24 h, an increase similar to that observed in the level of [35S]methionine pulse-labeled MMP-2 at 24 h (1.9-fold). At 48 and 72 h, the increase in MMP-2 mRNA abundance remained elevated by 1.5-2.2-fold on a per cell basis whereas TIMP mRNA levels were elevated by up to 3.3-fold. In contrast, the relative levels of collagenase mRNA were reduced by 66-75%. The changes in the MMP-2, collagenase, and TIMP mRNA concentrations in response to TGF-beta 1 were blocked by cycloheximide indicating that protein synthesis was required to mediate the effects of TGF-beta 1 on these mRNA levels. TGF-beta 1 was also found to increase the half-life of the MMP-2 mRNA from approximately 46 to approximately 150 h but did not alter the stability of TIMP mRNA (t1/2 approximately 60 h). Nuclear run-off transcription assays revealed that MMP-2 gene transcription was increased approximately 5-fold 7 h following TGF-beta 1-treatment but returned to control levels by 24 h. In comparison, increased TIMP gene transcription was only detectable after 24 h whereas collagenase gene transcription, although low in control cells, was undetectable at 24 h. Gene transcription, mRNA levels, and message stability of the genes for the extracellular matrix proteins type I collagen and fibronectin were also increased by TGF-beta 1. Thus, the similarity in the control of MMP-2, alpha 1 (I) procollagen, and fibronectin expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels indicates that these genes may share regulatory elements. In comparison, TGF-beta 1 reduced the level of collagenase mRNA and increased the level of TIMP mRNA as a result of altered transcriptional activities, through pathways that required protein synthesis, and without changes in mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2010785482,"Incubation of the apoB2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase with Fe2+ and O2 produces native B2, which contains the tyrosyl radical-dinuclear iron cluster cofactor required for nucleotide reduction. The chemical mechanism of this reconstitution reaction was investigated by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy and by rapid freeze-quench EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy. Two novel intermediates have been detected in the reaction. The first exhibits a broad absorption band centered at 565 nanometers. Based on known model chemistry, this intermediate is proposed to be a mu-peroxodiferric complex. The second intermediate exhibits a broad absorption band centered at 360 nanometers and a sharp, isotropic EPR signal with g = 2.00. When the reaction is carried out with 57Fe2+, this EPR signal is broadened, demonstrating that the intermediate is an iron-coupled radical. Variation of the ratio of Fe2+ to B2 in the reaction and comparison of the rates of formation and decay of the intermediates to the rate of formation of the tyrosyl radical (.Y122) suggest that both intermediates can generate .Y122. This conclusion is supported by the fact that both intermediates exhibit an increased lifetime in a mutant B2 subunit (B2-Y122F) lacking the oxidizable Y122. Based on these kinetic and spectroscopic data, a mechanism for the reaction is proposed. Unlike reactions catalyzed by heme-iron peroxidases, oxygenases, and model complexes, the reconstitution reaction appears not to involve high-valent iron intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2089802627,"The neurotrophins (nerve growth factor [NGF], brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], neurotrophin-3 [NT-3], and neurotrophin-4 [NT-4] ) have been defined by their ability to support neuronal survival. These factors utilize the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, perhaps in conjunction with a second component known as the low affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR). Here we demonstrate that TrkB mediates survival and proliferation in response to both BDNF and NT-3 when expressed in a particular strain of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, with BDNF the more potent ligand. Furthermore, the BDNF dose dependency displayed by these TrkB-expressing fibroblasts is similar to that required to support the survival of primary neurons. The LNGFR is not expressed in our fibroblast system, implying that this receptor is not essential for responses to physiological concentrations of the neurotrophins. We discuss our findings in the context of neurotrophin signaling pathways and mechanisms of neuronal cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1551921884,"Production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by human T-lymphocytes can be augmented by costimulation via CD28. It has been reported that signaling via CD28 acts by stabilization of lymphokine mRNAs (Lindsten, T., June, C. H., Ledbetter, J. A., Stella, G., and Thompson, C. B. (1989) Science 244, 339-343). Here we demonstrate that costimulation via CD28 also provides a signal which activates transcription of the IL-2 gene A CD28-responsive element (CD28RE) in the IL-2 enhancer at position -162 to -152 was identified. This so far unidentified element shows sequence similarity to the kB enhancer motif. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that the via CD28-induced signal synergizes with either phorbol myristate acetate or anti-CD3 for the induction of a nuclear factor that binds CD28RE and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) NF-kB motif. The significance of the sequence similarity of CD28RE with the kB enhancer motif was demonstrated by cross-competition studies using unlabeled CD28RE, HIV-1 NF-kB binding site, and a mutated version of the NF-kB motif. In addition, we found that NF-kB-dependent reporter gene expression was induced by costimulation via CD28. These results indicate that besides an effect on lymphokine mRNA stabilization, stimulation via CD28 acts at the level of transcription via coinduction of an NF-kB-like activity."

https://openalex.org/W1543377758,"High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the signal transduction pathways of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 (IL-1 alpha and -beta) in human fibroblasts. Approximately 450 discrete radioactive spots were electrophoretically resolved from cytosolic extracts of cells prelabeled with 32P. At least 63 of these polypeptides exhibited significant and concordant phosphorylation or dephosphorylation in response to TNF or IL-1, despite the fact that different receptors are involved. Most of these changes concerned serine/threonine residues although enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides was also observed. Phosphorylation patterns induced by a number of other agonists were compared with the patterns induced by IL-1 and TNF. These included activators of protein kinases C and A, bradykinin (a stimulator of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis), epidermal growth factor, heatshock, and mellitin (an activator of phospholipase A2). Although each of these agonists induced changes resulting in a distinct pattern of protein phosphorylation, none of these patterns had significant homology with that induced by IL-1 and TNF. Other assays were performed to verify the involvement of specific kinases. Collectively, these data indicate that IL-1 and TNF activate multiple protein kinases viz. a kinase(s) which activates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) kinase, a kinase that phosphorylates the cap-binding protein, and a possibly novel serine/threonine protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1947580298,"Little is known about the relative stoichiometry of guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins relative to the effector systems to which they link. We addressed this question for the stimulatory G protein (Gs) linked to adenylate cyclase. Forskolin stimulates the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase (C), but it has a higher efficacy and potency when C also interacts with the G protein Gg. Accordingly, we measured high-affinity [3H]forskolin binding to intact cells to assay α,-C complexes. No high-affinity specific binding occurred with unstimulated cells. The β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol promoted the binding of [3H]forskolin to about 3000 sites per cell, suggesting that each receptor on average activates at least several Gg molecules. Activating Gg directly with cholera toxin maximally promoted [3H]forskolin binding to a similar number of sites, suggesting that this is the maximal number of αg-C complexes formed per cell. We conclude that each cell likely contains only a few thousand functional copies of C, and that the availability of C (rather than Gg, which exists in more than 100,000 copies per cell) is likely to be limiting for agonist stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity.—Alousi, A.; Jasper, J. R.; Insel, P. A.; Motulsky, H. J. Stoichiometry of receptor-Gg-adenylate cyclase interactions. FASEB J. 5: 2300–2303; 1991."
https://openalex.org/W1547587527,"The effects of two novel quinolone derivatives, CP-67,804 and CP-115,953 (the 1-ethyl and 1-cyclopropyl derivatives of 6,8-difluoro-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, respectively), on the enzymatic activities of Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II were examined. Both drugs enhanced the enzyme's pre- and post-strand passage DNA cleavage activities. CP-67,804 was nearly as potent an enhancer as etoposide, while CP-115,953 was approximately 2 times more potent than this topoisomerase II-targeted antineoplastic drug. In contrast to etoposide, which stabilizes enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes primarily by inhibiting topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation, neither quinolone impaired the enzyme's ability to religate cleaved DNA. To further assess the characteristics of these unusual quinolone derivatives, the cytotoxic effects of CP-67,804 and CP-115,953 toward wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells and VpmR-5 cells (an epipodophyllotoxin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary line) were examined. Both quinolones were cytotoxic to the wild-type cells. CP-115,953 was the more potent agent and displayed a level of cytotoxicity similar to that of etoposide. Finally, the VpmR-5 line showed cross-resistance to CP-67,804 (approximately 3.7-fold) and CP-115,953 (approximately 1.3-fold). Although quinolone cross-resistance was less pronounced than observed for etoposide (approximately 12-fold), it indicates that topoisomerase II is a physiological target for CP-67,804 and CP-115,953 in mammalian cells. These findings strongly suggest that these quinolone derivatives represent a novel class of topoisomerase II-targeted drugs which have potential as antineoplastic agents."

https://openalex.org/W1599140803,"A 150-kDa phospholipase C has previously been purified from turkey erythrocytes and has been shown by reconstitution with turkey erythrocyte membranes to be a receptor- and G-protein-regulated enzyme (Morris, A. J., Waldo, G. L., Downes, C.P., and Harden, T. K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13501-13507; Morris, A.J., Waldo, G.L., Downes, C.P., and Harden, T.K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13508-13514). Combination of this 150-kDa protein with phosphoinositide substrate-containing phospholipid vesicles prepared with a cholate extract from purified turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes resulted in conferrence of AlF4- sensitivity to the purified phospholipase C. Guanosine 5‘-3-O-(thio)triphosphate also activated the reconstituted phospholipase C in a manner that was inhibited by guanosine 5‘-2-O-(thio)-diphosphate. The magnitude of the AlF4- stimulation was increased with increasing amounts of plasma membrane extract, and was also dependent on the concentration of purified phospholipase C. Using reconstitution of AlF4- sensitivity as an assay, the putative G-protein conferring regulation to the 150-kDa phospholipase C was purified to near homogeneity by sequential chromatography over Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, octyl-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and Mono-Q. Reconstituting activity co-purified with an approximately 43-kDa protein identified by silver staining; lesser amounts of a 35-kDa protein was present in the final purified fractions, as was a minor 40-kDa protein. The 43-kDa protein strongly reacted with antiserum against a 12-amino acid sequence found at the carboxyl terminus of Gq and G11, the 35-kDa protein strongly reacted with G-protein beta-subunit antiserum, and the 40-kDa protein reacted with antiserum that recognizes Gi3. Immunoprecipitation of the 43-kDa protein resulted in loss of phospholipase C-stimulating activity of the purified fraction. The idea that this is a phospholipase C-regulating G-protein is further supported by the observation that co-reconstitution of G-protein beta gamma-subunit with the purified phospholipase C-activating fraction resulted in a beta gamma-subunit-dependent inhibition of AlF(4-)-stimulated phospholipase C activity in the reconstituted preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1593448218,"The phosphorylation sites in the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate or MARCKS protein consist of four serines contained within a conserved, basic region of 25 amino acids, termed the phosphorylation site domain. A synthetic peptide comprising this domain was phosphorylated by both protein kinase C and its catalytic fragment with high affinity and apparent positive cooperativity. Tryptic phosphopeptides derived from the peptide appeared similar to phosphopeptides derived from the phosphorylated intact protein. The peptide was phosphorylated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases with markedly lower affinities. In peptides containing only one of the four serines, with the other three serines replaced by alanine, the affinities for protein kinase C ranged from 25 to 60 nM with Hill constants between 1.8 and 3.0. The potential pseudosubstrate peptide, in which all four serines were replaced by alanines, inhibited protein kinase C phosphorylation of histone or a peptide substrate with an IC50 of 100-200 nM with apparently non-competitive kinetics; it also inhibited the catalytic fragment of protein kinase C with a Ki of 20 nM, with kinetics of the mixed type. The peptide did not significantly inhibit the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. It inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I, II, and III by competing with the kinases for calmodulin. In addition, the peptide inhibited the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity of a proteolytic fragment of Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase II, with an IC50 approximately 5 microM. Thus, the phosphorylation site domain peptide of the MARCKS protein is a high affinity substrate for protein kinase C in vitro; the cognate peptide containing no serines is a potent but not completely specific inhibitor of both protein kinase C and its catalytic fragment."
https://openalex.org/W2000816957,"Transgenic mice carrying the bel region of human foamy retrovirus (HFV) under transcriptional control of its own long terminal repeat expressed the transgene in their central nervous systems and in smooth and striated muscle tissues. The animals developed a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system and of the striated muscle. Because expression of the transgene was closely correlated with the appearance of structural damage and inflammatory reactions were scanty, the disease is likely to be caused directly by the HFV proteins. These unexpected findings call for a reevaluation of the pathogenic potential of HFV in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1581223029,"Thermotoga maritima is the most thermophilic eubacterium currently known and grows up to 90 degrees C by a fermentative metabolism in which H2, CO2, and organic acids are end products. It was shown that the production of H2 is catalyzed by a single hydrogenase located in the cytoplasm. The addition of tungsten to the growth medium was found to increase both the cellular concentration of the hydrogenase and its in vitro catalytic activity by up to 10-fold, but the purified enzyme did not contain tungsten. It is a homotetramer of Mr 280,000 and contains approximately 20 atoms of Fe and 18 atoms of acid-labile sulfide/monomer. Other transition metals, including nickel (and also selenium), were present in only trace amounts (less than 0.1 atoms/monomer). The hydrogenase was unstable at both 4 and 23 degrees C, even under anaerobic conditions, but no activity was lost in anaerobic buffer containing glycerol and dithiothreitol. Under these conditions the enzyme was also quite thermostable (t50% approximately 1 h at 90 degrees C) but extremely sensitive to irreversible inactivation by O2 (t50% approximately 10 s in air). The optimum pH ranges for H2 evolution and H2 oxidation were 8.6-9.5 and greater than or equal to 10.4, respectively, and the optimum temperature for catalytic activity was above 95 degrees C. In contrast to mesophilic Fe hydrogenases, the T. maritima enzyme had very low H2 evolution activity, did not use T. maritima ferredoxin as an electron donor for H2 evolution, was inhibited by acetylene but not by nitrite, and exhibited EPR signals typical of [2Fe-2S]1+ clusters. Moreover, the oxidized enzyme did not exhibit the rhombic EPR signal that is characteristic of the catalytic iron-sulfur cluster of mesophilic Fe hydrogenases. These data suggest that T. maritima hydrogenase has a different FeS site and/or mechanism for catalyzing H2 production. The potential role of tungsten in regulating the activity of this enzyme is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1558466164,"Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) is the fibrinogen receptor on activated platelets. GPIIIa is phosphorylated in resting platelets and the incorporation of 32Pi increases with platelet activation. To address the functional significance of this modification, the stoichiometry of GPIIIa phosphorylation was determined in resting and activated platelets by estimating the specific activity of metabolic [gamma-32P]ATP from the specific activity of phosphatidic acid. Approximately 0.01 mol of P/mol of GPIIIa was phosphorylated in resting platelets and 0.03 mol of P/mol of GPIIIa was phosphorylated in thrombin-, phorbol ester-, or U46619-treated platelets. Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation served as a positive control for this method (1.2 mol of P/mol of MLC). Phosphorylation of purified GPIIb-IIIa by human platelet protein kinase C (PKC) resulted in levels of GPIIIa phosphorylation similar to that in platelets (0.05 mol of P/mol of GPIIIa). However, while GPIIIa in platelets was phosphorylated primarily on threonine, purified GPIIIa treated with PKC was phosphorylated primarily on serine. These results suggest that PKC may not directly phosphorylate GPIIIa in intact platelets. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated purified GPIIIa to higher levels (0.5 mol of P/mol of GPIIIa) with phosphorylation on both threonine and serine. The limited phosphorylation of GPIIIa in intact platelets suggests that this event is unlikely to affect functions involving large populations of GPIIb-IIIa, such as its conversion to a fibrinogen receptor. However, these results may suggest the existence of a more readily phosphorylated subpopulation of GPIIb-IIIa with potentially distinct structural or functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W1640714826,"High affinity binding of isoquinolines, such as PK 11195, is a conserved feature of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) across species. However, species differences in PBR ligand binding have been described based on the affinity for N1-alkyl-1,4-benzodiazepines, such as Ro5-4864. Ro5-4864 binds with high affinity to the rat receptor but has low affinity for the bovine PBR. Photolabeling with an isoquinoline ligand, [3H]PK 14105, identifies a 17-kDa protein, the PBR isoquinoline binding protein (PBR/IBP), in both species. To further elucidate the role of the PBR/IBP in determining PBR benzodiazepine and isoquinoline binding characteristics, the bovine PBR/IBP was cloned and expressed. Using a cDNA encoding a rat PBR/IBP to screen a fetal bovine adrenal cDNA library, a bovine cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 169 residues was cloned. The bovine and rat PBR/IBPs had similar hydropathy profiles exhibiting five potential transmembrane domains. Transfecting the cloned bovine PBR/IBP cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in an 11-fold increase in the density of high affinity [3H]PK 11195 binding sites which had only low affinity for Ro5-4864. Expression of the bovine PBR/IBP yields a receptor which is pharmacologically distinct from both endogenous COS-7 PBR and the rat PBR based on the affinity for several N1-alkyl-1,4-benzodiazepine ligands. These results suggest the PBR/IBP is the minimal functional component required for PBR ligand binding characteristics and the different protein sequences account for the species differences in PBR benzodiazepine ligand binding."

Major nuclear substrates displayed apparent molecular masses of 200, 130, 120, and 60 kDa on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The nuclear proteins and the H1 kinase were released from Triton-treated nuclei following incubation with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl. They therefore appeared to be internal nuclear matrix proteins. The nuclear H1 kinase activity solubilized by incubation with m-calpain was eluted in the void volume of a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column, indicating an apparent mass greater than 1,500 kDa. Treatment of the calpain-solubilized kinase with 0.5 M NaCl dissociated it to a form having an apparent mass of 300 kDa (Stokes radius = 5.6 nm), suggesting that the 300-kDa (Stokes radius = 5.6 nm), nuclei by calpain treatment as a large complex containing other internal matrix proteins. Purified human erythrocyte mu-calpain was capable of proteolyzing the nuclear matrix proteins at 10(-6) M Ca2+. In contrast, human erythrocyte multicatalytic protease complex produced little cleavage of the nuclear proteins. Proteolysis of nuclear proteins by either mu-calpain or m-calpain was inhibited by calpastatin. These experiments suggest a physiologic role for the calpains in the turnover of nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1534517774,"The ability of the glucosidase inhibitor 1-deoxynojirimycin (dNM) and a series of N-alkylated dNM derivatives to interfere with biosynthesis, transport, and maturation of the glycoprotein alpha 1-antitrypsin in HepG2 cells was investigated. Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase I and II by dNM and its derivatives resulted in an intracellular accumulation of alpha 1-antitrypsin with glucose-containing high mannose type oligosaccharides (precursor). N-alkylation of dNM increased its potency in inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum glucosidases, as determined from the concentration required for half maximal inhibition. N-Alkylated derivatives of dNM were better able to inhibit glucosidase I than glucosidase II (deduced from the number of glucose residues retained in Endo H-releasable oligosaccharides). The inhibition of glucosidase activity imposed by alkylated dNM derivatives was less easily reversed than that by dNM, an effect most pronounced for N-methyl-dNM. Branching of the alkyl group of dNM derivatives decreased the inhibitory potency. Although dNM and its derivatives interfered strongly with intracellular oligosaccharide processing, they did not completely block N-glycan maturation of alpha 1-antitrypsin even at the highest concentrations tested."
https://openalex.org/W1501128993,"The COOH-terminal sequence KDEL has been shown to be essential for the retention of several proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Munro S., and Pelham, H.

We have previously demonstrated that variants to the KDEL retention signal, particularly at the initial two positions of the tetrapeptide, can be made without affecting its ability to direct intracellular retention when appended to the neuropeptide Y precursor (pro-NPY) (Andres, D. A., Dickerson, I. M., and Dixon, J. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5952-5955). To further investigate the nature of the KDEL retention signal, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and transfection was used to generate stable mouse anterior pituitary AtT-20 cell lines expressing pro-NPY mutants with variants of the KDEL sequence added to their direct carboxyl terminus. Analyses of dibasic processing and indirect immunofluorescent microscopy of AtT-20 subclones were consistent with the retention of the pro-NPY mutants bearing the COOH-terminal extensions QDEL, KEDL, or KDEI within the endoplasmic reticulum. A change in the final amino acid of the tetrapeptide from Leu to Val abolished retention completely, and the peptide hormone was processed and secreted. These results indicate that only a limited number of conservative changes can be made to the final two positions of the tetrapeptide without abolishing activity and suggest a highly specific interaction of the retention signal and the KDEL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1562892413,"We reported previously that a 46/50-kDa membrane-associated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is phosphorylated in intact human platelets in response to both cGMP- and cAMP-elevating vasodilator drugs and presented evidence that this is mediated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases, respectively. VASP was recently purified and an antibody against it was developed which detects a phosphorylation-induced mobility change of VASP in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Halbrugge, M., Friedrich, C., Eigenthaler, M., Schanzenbacher, P., and Walter, U. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3088-3093). We have now used these methods for the quantitative analysis of VASP phosphorylation during coincubations of human endothelial cells and human platelets. Endothelial cell-derived factors caused the rapid, stoichiometric, and reversible phosphorylation of platelet VASP during these coincubations. Other experiments indicated that the endothelium-derived factors which stimulate VASP phosphorylation are prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor whose effects are mediated by cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. The results suggest that VASP phosphorylation is an important component of the inhibitory effects of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor on platelet activation and that VASP phosphorylation is a useful biochemical marker for the interaction of endothelial cells and platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1585037688,"In an osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1, cloned from mouse calvaria, epinephrine stimulated the production of prostaglandin E2 as an essentially sole arachidonate metabolite (Kusaka, M., Oshima, T., Yokota, K., Yamamoto, S., and Kumegawa, M. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 972, 339-346). Western and Northern blot analyses showed increases in the enzyme protein and mRNA of fatty acid cyclooxygenase in the epinephrine-treated cells. A rapid cAMP production caused by epinephrine was followed by increases in the activity and mRNA of cyclooxygenase. Both dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP also increased the level of the cyclooxygenase activity and mRNA. These results suggest that cAMP produced by beta-adrenergic stimulation was responsible for the increased cyclooxygenase mRNA level leading to induction of the cyclooxygenase enzyme. Furthermore, the addition of prostaglandin E2 (the final arachidonate metabolite in the MC3T3-E1 cells) brought about a rapid synthesis of intracellular cAMP followed by increases in the enzyme protein and mRNA of cyclooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1571436445,"2-Acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (2-acyl-GPE) acyltransferase and acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) synthetase are thought to be dual catalytic activities of a single inner membrane enzyme. A filter disc replica print method for the detection of acyl-ACP synthetase activity by colony fluorography was used to screen a mutagenized population of cells for acyl-ACP synthetase mutants (aas). All aas mutants lacked both acyl-ACP synthetase and 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase activities in vitro. There was no detectable acyl-CoA-independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine or the major outer membrane lipoprotein in aas mutants. Exogenous lysophospholipid uptake and acylation was also lacking in aas mutants. Lipoprotein acylation by phospholipids synthesized by the de novo biosynthetic pathway was not affected in aas mutants showing that this gene product was not directly involved in lipoprotein biogenesis. The aas mutants had an altered membrane phospholipid composition and accumulated both 2-acyl-GPE and acylphosphatidylglycerol. Acylphosphatidylglycerol accumulation was due to the transacylase activity of lysophospholipase L2 (the pldB gene product) since aas pldB double mutants accumulated 2-acyl-GPE, but not acylphosphatidylglycerol. The aas allele was mapped to 61 min of the Escherichia coli chromosome, and the deduced gene order in this region was thyA-aas-lysA. The biochemical, physiological, and genetic analyses of aas mutants support the conclusion that 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase are two activities of the same protein and confirm that this enzyme system participates in membrane phospholipid turnover and governs the acyl-CoA independent incorporation of exogenous fatty acids and lysophospholipids into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1570851270,"Down-regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors was investigated using a cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cell line. Endothelial cells have been shown to possess two subtypes of ANP receptors, a guanylate cyclase-coupled receptor (B-receptor) and a clearance receptor (C-receptor). The treatment with APIII, rat ANP (103-126), at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M for 24 h, resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.01) greater decrease in maximum 125I-APIII binding to CPAE cells than the identical concentration of API, rat ANP (103-123). APIII at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M stimulated cyclic GMP (cGMP) production 3.3-17.5-fold greater than similar concentrations of API. From these findings, we hypothesized that cGMP produced following ANP binding to the B-receptor participates in ANP receptor regulation. M&B 22948, a selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, significantly (p less than 0.01) potentiated the effect of both API and APIII on 125I-APIII binding, while M&B 22948 itself had no significant effect on 125I-APIII binding. Treatment of the cells with 1 mM 8-bromo-cGMP also significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased 125I-APIII binding to the cells, and a potentiation of this effect was observed by M&B 22948. Scatchard analysis of binding data from 8-bromo-cGMP-treated cells showed a significant decrease in Bmax (1.79 +/- 0.15 to 1.20 +/- 0.07 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05) without a significant change in Kd. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-APIII to 8-bromo-cGMP-treated cells showed a decrease in the labeling of 60- and 70-kDa bands corresponding to the C-receptor. In addition, the APIII-stimulated cGMP response remained unchanged in the 8-bromo-cGMP-treated cells, indicating that the B-receptor was not down-regulated. We conclude that cGMP regulates ANP-binding sites on the endothelial cell and that the evidence indicates that the C-receptor may preferentially be down-regulated by cGMP in CPAE cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581924051,"The ubiquinol:cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase (bc1 complex) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides consists of four subunits. One of these subunits, cytochrome c1, is the site of interaction with cytochrome c2, a periplasmic protein. In addition, the sequences of the fbcC gene and of the cytochrome c1 subunit that it encodes suggest that the protein should be located on the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane and that it is anchored to the membrane by a single membrane-spanning alpha-helix located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the polypeptide. Site-directed mutagenesis of the fbcC gene was used to alter the codon for Gln228 to a stop codon. This results in the production of a truncated version of the cytochrome c1 subunit that lacks the membrane anchor at the carboxyl terminus. The bc1 complex fails to assemble properly as a result of this mutation, but the Rb. sphaeroides cells expressing the altered gene contain a water-soluble form of cytochrome c1 in the periplasm. The water-soluble cytochrome c1 was purified and characterized. The amino-terminal sequence is identical with that of the membrane-bound subunit, indicating the signal sequence is properly processed. High pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography indicates it is monomeric (28 kDa). The heme content and electrochemical properties are similar to those of the intact subunit within the complex. Flash-induced electron transfer kinetics measured using whole cells demonstrated that the water-soluble cytochrome c1 is competent as a reductant for cytochrome c2 within the periplasmic space. These data show that the isolated water-soluble cytochrome c1 retains many of the properties of the membrane-bound subunit of the bc1 complex and, therefore, will be useful for further structural and functional characterization."

In the cloning, the ALBP coding region was placed under control of the recA promoter and downstream of the phage T7 g-10 translation enhancer sequence. Nalidixic acid (50 micrograms/ml) induced the expression of ALBP 20-fold over that attained using the pT7 system previously reported (Chinander, L. L., and Bernlohr, D. A. (1989) J. Biol.

(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18897-18903) for the enzyme. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 45 kDa. The 35-kDa protein previously identified as PI 4-kinase was a proteolysis product of the 45-kDa protein. A detailed kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme was performed with Triton X-100/phosphatidylinositol-mixed micelles according to the dilution (Deems, R.A., Eaton, B.R., and Dennis, E.A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9013-9020) and (Hendrickson, H.S., and Dennis, E.A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5734-5739) kinetic models. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity followed saturation kinetics with respect to the bulk and surface concentrations of phosphatidylinositol at concentrations of phosphatidylinositol below 0.1 mM. Above 0.1 mM activity was only dependent on the surface concentration of phosphatidylinositol. The enzyme more closely followed the dual phospholipid model where the enzyme associated with Triton X-100 micelles when phosphatidylinositol was present. The interfacial Michaelis constant (KmB) for phosphatidylinositol was 0.0036 mol fraction and the dissociation constant (KsA) for phosphatidylinositol in the micelle surface was 0.26 mM. The results of glycerol gradient centrifugation studies showed that the enzyme was physically associated with Triton X-100/phosphatidylinositol micelles."
https://openalex.org/W1497397052,"The metabolism of sphingomyelin (SPM) was investigated in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cell lines from normal individuals and from patients with Niemann-Pick disease Type A (deficient in the acid, lysosomal sphingomyelinase) and familial hypercholesterolemia (lacking the low density lipoprotein receptor). Cells were incubated with the following radioactive or fluorescent SPMs: [choline-methyl-14C] SPM, [oleoyl-3H]SPM, pyrene-propenoyl-SPM (P3:1-SPM), pyrene-butanoyl-SPM (P4-SPM), pyrene-dodecanoyl-SPM (P12-SPM), and pyrene-sulfonylamino-undecanoyl-SPM (PSA11-SPM). Several pathways of uptake and subsequent metabolism of SPM in the lymphoblastoid cells were identified. [choline-methyl-14C]SPM and the P12-analog, administered to the cells in the presence of lipoproteins, were taken up through the apoB/E receptor-dependent pathway of endocytosis and degraded solely by the lysosomal sphingomyelinase. Under similar conditions, the other sphingomyelins, i.e. [oleoyl-3H]SPM, P3:1-SPM, P4-SPM, and PSA11-SPM, were taken up by a low density lipoprotein receptor-independent pathway and degraded mostly by a nonlysosomal sphingomyelinase which also catalyzed their hydrolysis in Niemann-Pick cells. In the absence of serum, all sphingomyelins were taken up by an apoB/E receptor-independent pathway and hydrolyzed by a nonlysosomal sphingomyelinase. Indeed, in vitro assays demonstrated the presence, in lymphoblastoid cells, of the neutral magnesium-activated sphingomyelinase, which was also fully active in the Niemann-Pick cells. In conclusion, our observations are consistent with: (i) the existence in lymphoblastoid cells of several pathways for the uptake and subsequent utilization of SPM; (ii) a major role of lipoproteins for the metabolic routing of the SPM; and (iii) the effect of the structure of the fatty acyl residue of SPM on its possible association with lipoproteins and/or cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1608843362,"Treatment of isolated canine renal Na,K-ATPase with a stable diazomethane analog, 4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin (DEAC), results in enzyme inactivation. The inactivation rate was dramatically increased when the enzyme was treated with DEAC in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (in imidazole buffer) or Pi and Mg2+, conditions which produce enzyme phosphorylation. Inactivation in the presence of Pi and Mg2+ could be partially prevented by Na+ and almost completely prevented by K+. The quantity of DEAC covalently bound to the Na,K-ATPase was determined spectrophotometrically. The extent of inactivation was linearly related to the amount of K-protectable DEAC incorporation. Complete inactivation of ATPase activity occurred with 2.14 +/- 0.18 nmol of DEAC covalently bound/mg of protein. This suggests that only 1 or 2 carboxyl residues/catalytic center (estimated by high affinity ADP binding) are involved in the modification leading to inactivation. The modified enzyme exhibited normal levels of high affinity [3H]ADP (and hence ATP) binding, thus, the nucleotide-binding domain of the enzyme seems unaffected by the modification. In contrast, under conditions where native enzyme was able to occlude 3.82 nmol of K+ ions/mg of protein, DEAC-modified enzyme occluded only 0.33 nmol of K+ ions. Na+ occlusion by the enzyme (in the presence of oligomycin) was also reduced (by 80%) following treatment with DEAC. Phosphorylation by [32P]inorganic phosphate and Na(+)-activated phosphorylation of the modified enzyme with [32P]ATP yielded reduced levels of phosphoenzyme (about 36%) compared to native enzyme. The DEAC-modified [32P]phosphoenzyme formed from [32P]ATP was insensitive to the addition of K+ ions, under conditions which led to the rapid hydrolysis of native phosphoenzyme. Gel electrophoresis of modified protein revealed strong fluorescence labeling of the alpha-subunit, which was substantially reduced if treatment with DEAC was performed in the presence of K+ ions. Partial tryptic digestion and electrophoretic analysis revealed normal degradation patterns in the presence of ADP (E1 form) but the typical patterns, seen with K+ ions (E2K) or Na+ ions (E1Na) in native enzyme, were absent. A typical E2-like tryptic degradation pattern was seen, however, in the presence of vanadate ions and ouabain, suggesting that the modification does not freeze the enzyme in an E1 conformation and that the enzyme is still able to undergo the E1E2 conformational transition after modification. Our results suggest that a small number of carboxyl residues in the sodium pump alpha-subunit (perhaps one) are essential for K+ and Na+ binding and stabilizing the occluded enzyme cation forms. Esterification of the carboxyl groups by DEAC inactivates the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

When the cells were treated with human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha, the synthesis of TIMP, proMMP-1, and proMMP-3 was greatly enhanced along with the increase in the steady-state levels of mRNAs for respective proteins. The treatment of the cells with human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha and W-7 further augmented the production of proMMPs-1 and -3 and the accumulation of their mRNAs. In contrast, TIMP production and its steady-state mRNA level were reduced considerably under these conditions. Similar observations were made with another calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine, but not with N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, the weakest inhibitor for calmodulin. These results indicate that calmodulin is required for the interleukin 1-enhanced synthesis of TIMP but it is a suppressor for the synthesis of proMMPs-1 and -3."

The hypophosphatemic mouse model (Hyp) is phenotypically and biochemically similar to the human disease. Biochemically, hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of this disorder. The cause of the hypophosphatemia is thought to be secondary to a defect in the renal and/or intestinal Na(+)-phosphate transporter. The current studies were designed to investigate and characterize the localization of the defect in the Na(+)-phosphate transporter in this disorder. Phosphate uptake by renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) showed a significant decrease in the slope of the initial rate of phosphate uptake in (Hyp) compared with control mice (0.009 versus 0.013, respectively). The slopes representing initial rates of phosphate uptake by jejunal BBMV were similar in (Hyp) and control mice (0.004 and 0.004, respectively). Kinetics of jejunal Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake showed a Vmax of 0.63 +/- 0.12 and 0.64 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg protein/15 s in (Hyp) and control mice, respectively, whereas Km values were 0.12 +/- 0.08 and 0.2 +/- 0.11 mM, respectively. Similar kinetic analysis in the kidney showed a Vmax of 0.32 +/- 0.06 and 1.6 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.01) and Km of 0.07 +/- 0.06 and 0.39 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.02) in (Hyp) and control mice, respectively. Na(+)-dependent D-glucose uptake by BBMVs of intestine and kidney showed typical overshoot phenomena in (Hyp) and control mice. In order to explore these findings further, Na(+)-phosphate transporter expression from intestine and kidney was accomplished by microinjection of 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake was expressed 6 days after the microinjection of intestinal and kidney poly(A)+ RNA from control mice. However, expression of the transporter from (Hyp) mice occurred only from the intestine, and not from the kidney. The decrease in the expression of the Na(+)-dependent phosphate transporter was not secondary to accelerated efflux of phosphate or decreased metabolism in oocytes injected with poly(A)+ RNA from (Hyp) mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The isolated cytochrome was resolved into two polypeptides with molecular masses of 60-90 and 19 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For enzymatic reduction of purified cytochrome b558, we utilized hepatic NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase purified from rat liver microsomes. More than 80% of the cytochrome was reduced by incubation with the reductase and NADPH under the anaerobic condition, and was quickly reoxidized by the air. As indicated by measurement of oxygen consumption, the purified cytochrome catalytically reduced oxygen at a rate equal to approximately 30% of the activity of the phorbol myristate acetate-activated cells on the basis of cytochrome b558 content. Electron paramagnetic resonance study with a spin trapping agent 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide demonstrated that O2- is the exclusive primary product in the reduction of oxygen by the cytochrome. This gives direct evidence that cytochrome b558 functions as the terminal oxidizing enzyme in the O2- -generating system of neutrophils. This also establishes a new functional class of heme proteins that catalyzes one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen."

The reaction proceeds through a covalent intermediate, the cleavable complex, in which the DNA is cleaved and the enzyme is linked to the DNA via a phosphotyrosine linkage. Each molecule of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I has been shown to have three tightly bound zinc(II) ions required for relaxation activity (Tse-Dinh, Y.-C., and Beran-Steed, R.K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15857-15859). It is shown here that Cd(II) could replace Zn(II) in reconstitution of active enzyme from apoprotein. The role of metal was analyzed by studying the partial reactions. The apoenzyme was deficient in sodium dodecyl sulfate-induced cleavage of supercoiled PM2 phage DNA. Formation of covalent complex with linear single-stranded DNA was also reduced in the absence of metal. However, the cleavage of small oligonucleotide was not affected, and the apoenzyme could religate the covalently bound oligonucleotide to another DNA molecule. Assay of noncovalent complex formation by retention of 5'-labeled DNA on filters showed that the apoenzyme was not inhibited in noncovalent binding to DNA. It is proposed that zinc(II) coordination in E. coli DNA topoisomerase I is required for the transition of the noncovalent complex with DNA to the cleavable state."

The purified enzyme (specific activity 31 units/mg) catalyzed the hydrolysis of both 6-O-phosphoryl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1,2-beta-D-fructofuranoside (sucrose 6-phosphate) and sucrose (Km = 0.1 and 100 mM, respectively). Ultracentrifugal analysis of sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase indicated an Mr = 52,200. The purified enzyme migrated as a single protein during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 52,000). However, four distinct polypeptides were detected by analytical electrofocusing, and all four species hydrolyzed sucrose and sucrose 6-phosphate. The amino acid composition of sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, and the sequence of the first 12 amino acids from the NH2 terminus, have been determined. Hybridization studies with oligonucleotide probes show that the genes for sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (scrB), Enzyme IIScr of the phosphoenolypyruvate-dependent sucrose:phosphotransferase system (scrA), and N5-(carboxyethyl)ornithine synthase (ceo) are encoded by the same approximately 20-kilobase EcoRI fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1617746883,"During differentiation of human promyelocytic HL60 cells into monocytes there are sustained increases in intracellular pH and Na+/H+ antiporter activity. Here we show that increased transcription and expression of the gene for the Na+/H+ antiporter precedes phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced HL60 cell differentiation. PMA increased steady-state Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA levels approximately 50-fold within 8 h (at which time less than 15% of cells had differentiated). This increase was due to an increased transcriptional rate as determined by nuclear run on. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled Na+/H+ antiporter using an antiporter fusion protein antibody (RP1-c28) showed an equivalent increase in Na+/H+ antiporter protein synthesis. The synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleolyl-2-acetylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, which unlike PMA did not cause differentiation, failed to induce Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of PMA-induced differentiation by either sphingosine or cycloheximide prevented accumulation of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA. Together, these findings strongly suggest a close association of Na+/H+ antiporter induction with HL60 cell differentiation. The HL60 cell system is a promising model to study the mechanisms of Na+/H+ antiporter gene regulation and its function in differentiation."

The oxidation is most likely the result of hydrogen abstraction from the benzylic carbon of the substrate alcohol leading to eventual disproportionation to the aldehyde product. An aromatic cation radical intermediate, as would be formed during the oxidation of veratryl alcohol in the lignin peroxidase-H2O2 system, is not formed during the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. In addition to glutathione, dithiothreitol, L-cysteine, and beta-mercaptoethanol are capable of promoting veratryl alcohol oxidation. Non-thiol reductants, such as ascorbate or dihydroxyfumarate (known substrates of horseradish peroxidase), do not support oxidation of veratryl alcohol. Spectral evidence indicates that horseradish peroxidase compound II is formed during the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, electron spin resonance studies indicate that glutathione is oxidized to the thiyl radical. However, in the absence of Mn2+, the thiyl radical is unable to promote the oxidation of veratryl alcohol. In addition, Mn3+ is unable to promote the oxidation of veratryl alcohol in the absence of glutathione. These results suggest that the ultimate oxidant of veratryl alcohol is a Mn(3+)-GSH or Mn(2+)-GS. complex (where GS. is the glutathiyl radical)."

This protein has previously been shown to help initiate DNA replication on a double-stranded DNA template by catalyzing synapsis between the template and a homologous DNA single strand that serves as primer. Here, we demonstrate that this replication-initiating activity of the uvsX protein greatly amplifies the snap-back (hairpin-primed) DNA synthesis that is catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme on linear, single-stranded DNA templates. Amplification requires the presence of uvsX protein, the DNA polymerase holoenzyme, T4 gene 32 protein, and a T4 DNA helicase, in a reaction that is modulated by the T4 uvsY protein (an accessory protein to the uvsX recombinase). The reaction products consist primarily of large networks of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. With alkali or heat treatment, these networks resolve into dimer-length single-stranded DNA chains that renature instantaneously to reform a monomer-length double helix. A simple model can explain this uvsX protein-dependent amplification of snap-back DNA synthesis; the mechanism proposed makes several predictions that are confirmed by our experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1529057880,"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are applied to characterize the nonfreezable water molecules in fully hydrated D2O/sphingomyelin at temperatures below 0 degrees C. Upon cooling, DSC thermogram displays two thermal transitions peaked at -11 and -34 degrees C. The high-temperature exothermic transition corresponds to the freezing of the bulk D2O, and the low-temperature transition, which has not previously been reported, can be ascribed to the freezing of the phosphocholine headgroup in the lipid bilayer. The dynamics of nonfreezable water are also studied by 2H NMR T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) and T2e (spin-spin relaxation time obtained by two pulse echo) measurements at 30.7 MHz and at temperatures down to -110 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the T1 relaxation time is characterized by a distinct minimum value of 2.1 +/- 0.1 ms at -30 degrees C. T2e is discontinuous at temperature around -70 degrees C, indicating another freezing-like event for the bound water at this temperature. Analysis of the relaxation data suggest that nonfreezable water undergoes both fast and slow motions at characteristic NMR time scales. The slow motions are affected when the lipid headgroup freezes."

It is often assumed that omega-CgTx interacts with Ca2+ channels exclusively. We have tested this assumption in a study of omega-CgTx-binding sites in the electric organ of Discopyge ommata. Synaptosomal membranes from this tissue contain low affinity omega-CgTx receptor sites (Kd = 0.6 microM) in great abundance (280 pmol/mg of protein), as first reported by Ahmad and Miljanich (Ahmad, S. N., and Miljanich, G.P. (1988) Brain Res. 453, 247-256). However, we find that a large majority of these omega-CgTx-binding sites co-purify with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and can be immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies generated against the nAChR of Torpedo. Cross-linking experiments with radiolabeled omega-CgTx show pronounced specific labeling of the alpha-subunit of the nAChR but not other subunits. Specific omega-CgTx binding to the nAChR is reduced by millimolar Ca2+ but not by alpha- or kappa-bungarotoxin, alpha-conotoxin, or carbamylcholine. Cross-linking experiments also reveal omega-CgTx-binding proteins of 170 and 60 kDa.

The pooled individual peak fractions were further purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 column. Analysis of the purified samples by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that they all contained major peptides corresponding to alpha and beta subunits of the brain CaM-stimulated phosphatase. The phosphatases had similar specific activities and were similarly stimulated by Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+ + Ca2+, and CaM. They showed differential reactivity on immunotransblots with an alpha subunit-specific monoclonal antibody VJ6, which reacted strongly toward BPI and weakly toward BPIII and LPI, but showed no reactivity toward BPII, LPII, and LPIII. Each of the alpha subunits of the purified phosphatases had a distinct V8 protease and chymotrypsin peptide map. The results suggest that both bovine brain and bovine lung contain multiple CaM-stimulated phosphatase isozymes. The suggestion of three mammalian brain CaM-stimulated phosphatase isozymes is in agreement with the results of recent molecular cloning studies (Kuno, T., Takeda, T., Hirai, M., Ito, A., Mukai, H., and Tanaka, C.

Analysis of these clones revealed that they represent T beta 4 retroposons; they lack introns and contain stretches of poly(A) sequence at their 3' ends and direct repeats flanking the cDNA-like sequences. In order to isolate a T beta 4 intron-containing gene, DNA fragments that include T beta 4 introns were generated by polymerase chain reaction, using rat genomic DNA as template. Subsequent Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA with intron-specific probes demonstrated the presence of a single T beta 4 intron-containing gene. Upon screening the rat genomic DNA library with an intron-specific probe, two overlapping clones of the T beta 4 intron-containing gene were isolated.

Treatment of PC12 cells with 2-chloroadenosine results in a dose-dependent decrease of TPST activity which is observable as early as 3 h after initiation of treatment, maximizes at 24-48 h with continuous exposure, and is readily reversible upon removal of the drug. While forskolin, an agent that directly increases intracellular cAMP, has no effect on TPST activity, 2-chloroadenosine equally suppressed the enzyme activity in both the wild type and a protein kinase A-deficient mutant strain of PC12 cells, indicating that such regulation of TPST activity by 2-chloroadenosine was independent of cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. This effect of 2-chloroadenosine can be potentiated by an adenosine uptake blocker dipyridamole but cannot be elicited by other adenosine A1 or A2 receptor agonists, further suggesting that TPST activity in PC12 cells is regulated by 2-chloroadenosine via a novel membrane receptor. Incubation of the cells with cyclo heximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, also led to a time- and dose-dependent suppression of TPST activity. At concentrations of cycloheximide that produced maximal inhibition (approximately 50%), cotreatment with 2-chloroadenosine did not lead to a further decrease of the TPST activity. These results suggest that the sensitivity of TPST activity to be controlled by protein synthesis provides a mechanism for regulation of its activity by 2-chloroadenosine."
