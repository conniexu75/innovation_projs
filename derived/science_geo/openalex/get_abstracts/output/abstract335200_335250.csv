We call such a performance ""singing"" and each repeated series of sounds a ""song."""
https://openalex.org/W2076980488,"Brachiopods and coralline sponges are the dominant taxa of a series of parallel pantropical communities found in cryptic habitats of Recent coral reefs, where these organisms may cover almost the entire available surface area. It is suggested that the continued survival and success of these and other groups of considerable paleontological importance resulted from their occupation of cryptic reef habitats after competition with more rapidly growing hermatypic corals in the Middle Jurassic when scleractinian reefs first appeared."
https://openalex.org/W2091345108,"Analysis of the Murray meteorite, a type II carbonaceous chondrite, has led to the identification of 17 amino acids. For seven of the amino acids nearly equal amounts of the D and L isomers are present, and 11 of the amino acids are not found in protein. These results suggest that these amino acids, like the amino acids of the Murchison meteorite, are extraterrestrial in origin."
https://openalex.org/W1986262964,"The phalangid Vonones sayi has a pair of exocrine defensive glands that secrete quinones (2,3-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4- benzoquinone). When distributed, the animal emits the secretion, dilutes it with aqueous regurgitated fluid, and effects dosaged delivery of the mixture by brushing it on the assailant with the tips of its forelegs. Predators such as ants are effectively repelled."
https://openalex.org/W2035654338,The x-ray photoelectron spectra of the oxygen 1s level of olivines contain a single component whereas those of pyroxenes contain two components with an intensity ratio of 2:1 and an energy separation of about 1 electron volt. We interpret these two components to be the result of the binding energy differences between nonbridging and bridging oxygen atoms within a silicate chain in the pyroxene structure.

https://openalex.org/W2032309462,"When the Philippine volcano Pinatubo exploded last year, pumping the upper atmosphere full of find debris, researchers foresaw yet another assault on the stratosphere's beleaguered ozone layer. Some calculations of the effects of volcanic debris implied that as much as 25% to 30% of the ozone shield over temperature latitudes might be eaten away by the volcanic haze - five times the observed loss over the past decade. Early measurements didn't bear out that concern, but researchers weren't prepared to call off the alarm until the verdict came in from the most vulnerable part of the planet's ozone layer, the frigid stratosphere over Antarctica. Although the hole was more extensive than ever before, probably because of unusual weather patterns, total ozone bottomed out well above the record set last year - even a tad above the low levels seen in 1987, 1989, and 1990."
