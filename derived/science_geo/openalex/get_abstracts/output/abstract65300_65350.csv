https://openalex.org/W1549586164,"Abstract Lactose and o-nitrophenylgalactoside (NPG) were transported against considerable concentration gradients by ML 308-225, a mutant of Escherichia coli which lacks β-galactosidase but possesses a constitutive transport system for β-galactosides. The kinetics of influx of NPG during this accumulation were found to be the same as those found for this galactoside moving down a concentration gradient into ML 308, i.e. transport into the parent cell containing β-galactosidase. When cells of ML 308-225 were exposed to azide, azide plus iodoacetate, or dinitrophenol transport of these galactosides against a concentration gradient was completely abolished. However, the presence of functional membrane carriers in such inhibited cells was indicated by (a) very rapid equilibration of external and internal concentrations of galactoside, (b) inhibition of the rate of this equilibration by chemical analogues, and (c) transientaccumulation of substrate by washed cells preloaded with galactoside. All the evidence was consistent with the hypothesis that the same membrane carriers were involved in active transport by control cells and facilitated diffusion by poisoned cells. The most striking finding was that the addition of metabolic inhibitors reduced the Kt of exit about two orders of magnitude, whereas the Kt of entrance remained constant. It was inferred from these studies that energy coupling reduced the affinity of the carrier for its substrate on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. The possible physiological control of energy coupling of transport was discussed in the light of the present observations."

Immunoreactive insulin concentration was less than expected during the infusions of norepinephrine, but returned to higher values after the norepinephrine infusions. From these data it is concluded that norepinephrine inhibits the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells."

Touching a perioral region leads to head movement, bringing the stimulus to the mouth. Touching the lip-line leads to jaw opening. The size of the fields depends on the intensity of stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1522299751,"Abstract An intracellular, inorganic pyrophosphatase from Escherichia coli K-12 3000(λ) has been purified 500-fold to a state of apparent homogeneity. The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, and tetrapolyphosphate with relative velocities of 1.000, 0.016, and 0.007, respectively. No activity whatsoever was found with a variety of other phosphate esters. There was an absolute requirement for divalent cation in amounts suggesting stoichiometric combination with the substrate. At pH 9.1, Mg2+ and Mn2+ were maximally effective; at pH 7.5, Zn2+ and Co2+ were best. Although no exchange reaction (32Pi ⇄ PPi) could be demonstrated, a net reversal of the reaction was achieved by coupling through thymidine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase to oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconic acid. The stoichiometry of the reverse reaction indicated utilization of 10% of the 32Pi (trapped as thymidine triphosphate). The enzyme was exceptionally stable. In the presence of 0.01 m Mg2+, it withstood a temperature of 80° for 10 min."

A mutant was isolated which produced a desensitized enzyme. Glucose was no longer as effective in preventing the utilization of exogenous glycerol by cells which synthesized constitutively such an altered enzyme, even though the usual degree of catabolite repression still operated."
https://openalex.org/W1517466889,"The present studies establish the enzymatic methylation of lysine residues in certain proteins with S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Ribosomal proteins of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii and basic proteins of chromatin from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cell nuclei were shown to act as methyl acceptors. Crude protein preparations from Salmonella typhimurium were also able to accept methyl groups. In each case, only lysine residues in protein were methylated to yield e-N-methyllysine. The product of this reaction proved to be identical with authentic e-N-methyllysine by paper electrophoresis and column chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W1593315453,Abstract The specific binding of aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to 30 S ribosome subunits takes place in the presence of polyribonucleotide which contains the code for the amino acid. The binding activity of 30 S ribosome subunits was similar to that of 70 S ribosomes at 4 x 10-2 m magnesium ion concentration. Streptomycin inhibited the binding of phenylalanyl soluble ribonucleic acid to the complex of 30 S ribosome subunits and polyuridylic acid.
https://openalex.org/W1539400961,"Abstract A glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase was purified from Escherichia coli B. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 700,000. This enzyme can use either ammonia or glutamine as the amino group donor in carbamyl phosphate synthesis. Estimated values of the Michaelis constant for each of these substrates indicate that glutamine is probably the true amino group donor in vivo. The stoichiometry for the case where glutamine serves as a substrate indicates that 2 moles of adenosine triphosphate are required for the formation of 1 mole of carbamyl phosphate. The reaction is reversible, although the rate of the back reaction is about one-tenth as fast as that of the forward reaction. This reverse reaction, the formation of ATP from carbamyl phosphate and ADP, does not proceed in the absence of glutamic acid and orthophosphate. The single omission of glutamate or of orthophosphate reduces the synthesis of ATP to one-half the amount observed when both are present. We have suggested that these data indicate that the reaction may involve more than one step."
https://openalex.org/W2092110694,"Significant amounts of immunoglobulins G and M, and a small amount of natural antibodies reactive with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Escherichia coli, have been detected in human adult serums by imnmunofluorescent techniques. Umbilical cord serums also contained substantial immunoglobulin-G antibody but little or no M or A. These findings challenge the concept that natural antibodies reactive with Gram-negative bacteria are primarily of the immunoglobulin-M class."
https://openalex.org/W1553435115,"Abstract A procedure is described for obtaining crystalline d-serine dehydrase from a mutant of Escherichia coli which produces this enzyme constitutively. The enzyme appears pure by ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria. In sucrose gradients, serine dehydrase sediments to the same position as horseradish peroxidase, indicating a molecular weight of about 40,000. This corresponds closely to its combining weight of 42,800 per pyridoxal phosphate. Its absorption maximum at 410 mµ due to bound pyridoxal phosphate is not materially changed by interaction with substrate or by variation in pH between 6.0 and 9.0. d-Serine and d-threonine are the only substrates found; O-methylserine is a potent competitive inhibitor. In the presence of suitable protective agents, the enzyme can be resolved completely by dialysis against d- or l-cysteine, and reactivated by addition of pyridoxal phosphate. Tris buffer inactivates the enzyme; this inactivation is prevented by the presence of sufficient K+ or NH4+, and less effectively by Na+ or pyridoxal phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1577746592,"Abstract The role of phospholipid in the uridine diphosphate-galactose: lipopolysaccharide galactosyltransferase reaction has been studied in extracts of Salmonella typhimurium by utilizing synthetic and natural phospholipids and phospholipids altered by venom digestion, alkaline hydrolysis, and catalytic hydrogenation. Activity was seen with derivatives of phosphatidic acid containing two unsaturated or cyclopropane fatty acids, and either a hydroxyl group, ethanolamine, glycerol, or polyglycerol phosphate (in cardiolipin) as the component attached to the α-phosphate group. No activity was seen with phosphatidylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1526670378,"Abstract Infection of Escherichia coli B with bacteriophages T1, T2, or T4 results in increase in the activity of deoxyribonucleic acid methylase assayed in crude extracts of the infected cells. The largest increase is observed after infection with T2 phage; T4 and T1 phages lead to smaller increases in that order of decreasing magnitude. After infection with T3, T5, or T6 phages, a decrease in activity was observed; T7 and λ phages had no effect. The kinetics of the increase in methylase activity after T2 infection is similar to those found with the early enzymes induced by T-even phages, and protein synthesis is necessary for the increase to occur. The properties of the methylase activity of phage T2-infected bacteria suggest that it is a new phage-directed enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2036838803,"Oligonucleotide messengers containing the sequence AUG at or near the 5' end of the chain stimulate the incorporation of N-formylmethionine,but not of free (unformylated) methionine. AUG is considerably more active in this regard than UUG, the other N-formylmethionine codon. The coding activity of subsequent in-phase triplets in the 3' direction from AUG is markedly stimulated by this codon."

https://openalex.org/W1986796185,"When purified Qbeta-RNA replicase is presented alternately with two genetically different Qbeta-RNA molecules, the RNA synthesized is identical to the initiating template. The results establish that the RNA is the instructive agent in the replicative process and hence that it satisfies the operational definition of a self-duplicating entity. The data also eliminate alternative explanations which do not involve self-propagation of the input RNA. An opportunity is now provided for studying the genetics and evolution of a self-duplicating nucleic acid molecule under conditions permitting detailed control of environmental parameters and chemical components."

The molecular weight is 37,300, and 1 mole of pyridoxal 5-phosphate is bound per mole of enzyme. d-Threonine is dehydrated at one-fifth the rate of d-serine, and slight activity is also observed with l-serine and dl-allothreonine."
https://openalex.org/W1591625637,"Abstract An essentially pure preparation of the cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii can utilize the purified thioredoxin system from Escherichia coli B as hydrogen donor in place of dihydrolipoate in the reduction of the triphosphates of cytidine, guanosine, adenosine, and uridine. The substrate specificity pattern of L. leichmannii reductase is determined by ATP and various deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, apparently acting as allosteric effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1568998944,"The preparation of a cell-free amino acid incorporation system from Bacillus stearothermophilus active at 65° and the conditions for optimal activity with synthetic polynucleotide messengers are described. The activity of this system is comparable to that of the conventional Escherichia coli system. Its thermal stability, high activity, and low nuclease content are convenient features for studies of protein synthesis and coding. Thus, a 1.4:1 copolymer of adenylic and uridylic acids, which, because of a high degree of ordered structure, is almost inactive in the E. coli system at 37°, promoted significant incorporation of isoleucine, leucine, and lysine in the B. stearothermophilus system at 65°."
https://openalex.org/W1499552828,"Abstract Incubation of one of the aminoacyl-transferring factors, transferase I, at 37° leads to its rapid and irreversible loss of activity. This enzyme is protected against loss of activity by aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid (sRNA) but not by stripped sRNA, synthetic polynucleotides, ribosomes, transferase II, guanosine triphosphate, or sulfhydryl compounds. Protection is highly dependent on the presence of sRNA-bound amino acids but is not specific for a particular amino acid. The rate of hydrolysis of aminoacyl-sRNA is significantly slower in the presence of transferase I; ribosomes, transferase II, and other components of the aminoacyl transfer reaction do not affect the rate of deacylation. These results suggest that the interaction of aminoacyl-sRNA and transferase I yields a product in which both components are more stable than either one in the free form. The high degree of specificity for aminoacyl-sRNA and transferase I in this interaction may reflect an intermediary stage in polypeptide biosynthesis, between aminoacyl-sRNA and ribosome-bound aminoacyl-sRNA or peptidyl-sRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1569254696,"Abstract Biologically active ribosomes of Escherichia coli can be purified by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Such ribosomes (DEAE-ribosomes) contain about 30% less protein than ribosomes washed by repeated centrifugation. In spite of the loss in protein, the DEAE-ribosomes have the same sedimentation values as washed ribosomes, are active in polypeptide synthesis, and are able to bind phenylalanyl soluble ribonucleic acid in the presence of polyuridylic acid but without guanosine triphosphate or any component of the cell sap. The loss of protein from the DEAE-ribosomes is concomitant with a loss of about 80% of the latent ribosomal DNase but none of the latent ribosomal RNase. Removal of the protein does not alter the response of the DEAE-ribosomes to various inhibitors of protein synthesis, including streptomycin. The DEAE-ribosomes differ from the washed ribosomes in their response to pH, NH4Cl, and magnesium. The activity of the DEAE-ribosomes changes little if at all over the range of pH from 6.9 to 8.5 whereas the washed ribosomes exhibit a broad optimum between pH 7.8 and 8.2. High concentrations (0.12 m) of NH4Cl produce a parallel increase in the binding of phenylalanyl soluble RNA and polypeptide synthesis with the DEAE-ribosomes but not with the washed ribosomes. The optimal magnesium concentration for polypeptide synthesis is 0.012 m with the DEAE-ribosomes as compared to 0.016 m with the washed ribosomes. Electrophoretic patterns of the ribosomal protein obtained from the DEAE-ribosomes were largely the same as those obtained from the washed ribosomes except for the absence of one protein band. These differences indicate that all of the ribosomes chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose have lost protein. The electrophoretic patterns of the ribosomal protein obtained from DEAE-ribosomes and washed ribosomes of E. coli K-12 was compared to ribosomal protein from similar ribosomal preparations of E. coli B."
https://openalex.org/W1523906215,"Abstract An enzyme has been obtained from extracts of Escherichia coli which catalyzes the synthesis of N5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase holoenzyme from apoenzyme and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide deoxyadenosyl in the presence of a reduced pyridine nucleotide. In addition to holoenzyme formation, this system supplies the reducing power for the synthesis of methionine from N5-methyl-H4-folate. It is suggested that this enzyme system functions by reducing the cobamide prosthetic group, and that it may be the natural reducing system required for methionine synthesis in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W94198478,"Abstract Extracts obtained from Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis were found to catalyze the following reactions. [see PDF for equation] The products of each reaction were isolated and identified by absorption spectra, phosphate analysis, and identification of the sugar moiety by various methods. The final product was cytidine 5'-diphosphate abequose when extracts of S. typhimurium were used and a mixture of CDP-paratose and CDP-tyvelose when extracts of S. enteritidis were used. The identification of 3,6-dideoxyhexoses is based on thin layer chromatography, cocrystallization of reduced derivatives of the sugars with authentic compounds, and oxidation with mold d - glucose oxidase. CDP - d - glucose oxidoreductase, catalyzing Reaction b above, was found to require triphosphopyridine nucleotide or diphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity. For the conversion of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose into CDP-3,6-dideoxyhexoses (Reaction c), the addition of TPNH was required; ATP and flavin adenine dinucleotide (or flavin mononucleotide) strongly stimulated the reaction. Evidence for the feedback inhibition of CDP-d-glucose pyrophosphorylase by CDP-3,6-di-deoxyhexoses was also presented."

https://openalex.org/W2161529224,"INTRAPERITONEAL injection of (±)-α-lipoic acid has been reported to be toxic to thiamine-deficient rats1. Development of the toxic effect was prevented by simultaneous injection of 100 µg of thiamine hydrochloride. It was also noticed that (±)-α-lipoic acid, unlike neopyrithiamine, had no effect on thiamine excretion. The toxicity of (±)-α-lipoic acid to thiamine-deficient rats therefore could not be related to the depletion of the thiamine reserves present in the organs of thiamine-deficient animals. Obviously, the results obtained from the use of the racemic form of lipoic acid could not reveal whether both or one of the isomers had been responsible for the toxic effects in the deficient animals. In order to clarify the relative toxicity of the isomers of lipoic acid in thiamine-deficient rats, the experiments were repeated with the natural and unnatural isomers of α-lipoic acid. The preparation of pure (+)-α-lipoic acid was accomplished from (+)-6,8-dichlorooctanoic acid (−)-ephedrine salt2. However, the (−)-α-lipoic acid was found to be contaminated with 15–20 per cent of the dextro-rotatory enantiomorph2. Therefore, the pure (−)-α-lipoic acid was synthesized from the purified (−)-6,8-dichlorooctanoic acid (+)-ephedrine salt. This was obtained after converting a sample of (−)-6,8-dichlorooctanoic acid (−)-ephedrine salt into the (+)-ephedrine salt. (The (−)-6,8-dichlorooctanoic acid (−)-ephedrine salt was generously supplied by Dr. W. J. Wayne of Du Pont.)"
https://openalex.org/W2059646509,"Rejection of orthotopic neural-fold transplants may be prevented by either embryonic parabiosis or reciprocal exchange of presumptive blood. These observations form the basis of the no blood-no tolerance hypothesis, which states that persistent tolerance by the host requires that the somatic transplant be accompanied by presumptive blood from the donor. Regarding parabionts and chimeras as special cases of transplantation of whole or partial animals, I found that ex-parabionts accept subsequent skin exchanges only from the homologous ex-parabiont; reciprocal chimeras are compatible provided each animal portion contains a primary blood source, and will accept transplants as frogs only from the homologous recombinant. Chimeric recombinations made anterior to the heart field prove incompatible and fail to survive to maturity. Successful chimeras as well as ex-parabionts survive to maturity and are apparently normal in every respect."

https://openalex.org/W1570861145,Abstract The deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from Escherichia coli has been found capable of using as a template a deoxyribonucleic acid-ribonucleic acid hybrid polymer which has alternating thymine and hypoxanthine residues on the deoxyribose strand and alternating adenine and cytosine residues on the ribose strand. The DNA polymer prepared from this hybrid template has properties similar to those of a double stranded DNA polymer with alternating thymine and guanine residues on one strand and alternating adenine and cytosine residues on the other strand. The DNA-RNA hybrid polymer was prepared by the action of the E. coli RNA polymerase on a single stranded DNA polymer obtained by deamination of the previously studied DNA polymer with alternating adenine and thymine residues. The priming ability of the DNA-RNA hybrid polymer was similar to that of the DNA polymer which was prepared from the hybrid template.
