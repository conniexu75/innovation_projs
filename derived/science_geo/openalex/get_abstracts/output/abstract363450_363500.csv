https://openalex.org/W2001701937,"We carried out a genome-wide association study among Chinese women to identify risk variants for breast cancer. After analyzing 607,728 SNPs in 1,505 cases and 1,522 controls, we selected 29 SNPs for a fast-track replication in an independent set of 1,554 cases and 1,576 controls. We further investigated four replicated loci in a third set of samples comprising 3,472 cases and 900 controls. SNP rs2046210 at 6q25.1, located upstream of the gene encoding estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), showed strong and consistent association with breast cancer across all three stages. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) were 1.36 (1.24-1.49) and 1.59 (1.40-1.82), respectively, for genotypes A/G and A/A versus G/G (P for trend 2.0 x 10(-15)) in the pooled analysis of samples from all three stages. We also found a similar, albeit weaker, association in an independent study comprising 1,591 cases and 1,466 controls of European ancestry (P(trend) = 0.01). These results strongly implicate 6q25.1 as a susceptibility locus for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021723069,"We examined the association of common variants at the NPPA-NPPB locus with circulating concentrations of the natriuretic peptides, which have blood pressure-lowering properties. We genotyped SNPs at the NPPA-NPPB locus in 14,743 individuals of European ancestry, and identified associations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide with rs5068 (P = 8 x 10(-70)), rs198358 (P = 8 x 10(-30)) and rs632793 (P = 2 x 10(-10)), and of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide with rs5068 (P = 3 x 10(-12)), rs198358 (P = 1 x 10(-25)) and rs632793 (P = 2 x 10(-68)). In 29,717 individuals, the alleles of rs5068 and rs198358 that showed association with increased circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations were also found to be associated with lower systolic (P = 2 x 10(-6) and 6 x 10(-5), respectively) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 1 x 10(-6) and 5 x 10(-5)), as well as reduced odds of hypertension (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.92, P = 4 x 10(-5); OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85-0.95, P = 2 x 10(-4), respectively). Common genetic variants at the NPPA-NPPB locus found to be associated with circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations contribute to interindividual variation in blood pressure and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1965691847,"In a longitudinal cohort of ∼700 children in New York City, the prevalence of asthma (>25%) is among the highest in the US. This high risk may in part be caused by transplacental exposure to traffic-related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) but biomarkers informative of PAH-asthma relationships is lacking. We here hypothesized that epigenetic marks associated with transplacental PAH exposure and/or childhood asthma risk could be identified in fetal tissues. Mothers completed personal prenatal air monitoring for PAH exposure determination. Methylation sensitive restriction fingerprinting was used to analyze umbilical cord white blood cell (UCWBC) DNA of 20 cohort children. Over 30 DNA sequences were identified whose methylation status was dependent on the level of maternal PAH exposure. Six sequences were found to be homologous to known genes having one or more 5′-CpG island(s) (5′-CGI). Of these, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3) exhibited the highest concordance between the extent of methylation of its 5′-CGI in UCWBCs and the level of gene expression in matched fetal placental tissues in the initial 20 cohort children. ACSL3 was therefore chosen for further investigation in a larger sample of 56 cohort children. Methylation of the ACSL3 5′-CGI was found to be significantly associated with maternal airborne PAH exposure exceeding 2.41 ng/m3 (OR = 13.8; p<0.001; sensitivity = 75%; specificity = 82%) and with a parental report of asthma symptoms in children prior to age 5 (OR = 3.9; p<0.05). Thus, if validated, methylated ACSL3 5′CGI in UCWBC DNA may be a surrogate endpoint for transplacental PAH exposure and/or a potential biomarker for environmentally-related asthma. This exploratory report provides a new blueprint for the discovery of epigenetic biomarkers relevant to other exposure assessments and/or investigations of exposure-disease relationships in birth cohorts. The results support the emerging theory of early origins of later life disease development."
https://openalex.org/W2014968469,"Artemisinin derivatives are the key active ingredients in Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), the most effective therapies available for treatment of malaria. Because the raw material is extracted from plants with long growing seasons, artemisinin is often in short supply, and fermentation would be an attractive alternative production method to supplement the plant source. Previous work showed that high levels of amorpha-4,11-diene, an artemisinin precursor, can be made in Escherichia coli using a heterologous mevalonate pathway derived from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), though the reconstructed mevalonate pathway was limited at a particular enzymatic step.By combining improvements in the heterologous mevalonate pathway with a superior fermentation process, commercially relevant titers were achieved in fed-batch fermentations. Yeast genes for HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase (the second and third enzymes in the pathway) were replaced with equivalent genes from Staphylococcus aureus, more than doubling production. Amorpha-4,11-diene titers were further increased by optimizing nitrogen delivery in the fermentation process. Successful cultivation of the improved strain under carbon and nitrogen restriction consistently yielded 90 g/L dry cell weight and an average titer of 27.4 g/L amorpha-4,11-diene.Production of >25 g/L amorpha-4,11-diene by fermentation followed by chemical conversion to artemisinin may allow for development of a process to provide an alternative source of artemisinin to be incorporated into ACTs."
https://openalex.org/W1966163069,"Plant root growth and development is highly plastic and can adapt to many environmental conditions. Sugar signaling has been shown to affect root growth and development by interacting with phytohormones such as gibberellins, cytokinin and abscisic acid. Auxin signaling and transport has been earlier shown to be controlling plant root length, number of lateral roots, root hair and root growth direction.Increasing concentration of glucose not only controls root length, root hair and number of lateral roots but can also modulate root growth direction. Since root growth and development is also controlled by auxin, whole genome transcript profiling was done to find out the extent of interaction between glucose and auxin response pathways. Glucose alone could transcriptionally regulate 376 (62%) genes out of 604 genes affected by IAA. Presence of glucose could also modulate the extent of regulation 2 fold or more of almost 63% genes induced or repressed by IAA. Interestingly, glucose could affect induction or repression of IAA affected genes (35%) even if glucose alone had no significant effect on the transcription of these genes itself. Glucose could affect auxin biosynthetic YUCCA genes family members, auxin transporter PIN proteins, receptor TIR1 and members of a number of gene families including AUX/IAA, GH3 and SAUR involved in auxin signaling. Arabidopsis auxin receptor tir1 and response mutants, axr2, axr3 and slr1 not only display a defect in glucose induced change in root length, root hair elongation and lateral root production but also accentuate glucose induced increase in root growth randomization from vertical suggesting glucose effects on plant root growth and development are mediated by auxin signaling components.Our findings implicate an important role of the glucose interacting with auxin signaling and transport machinery to control seedling root growth and development in changing nutrient conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2121467598,"Background It has been suggested that exercise training results in compensatory mechanisms that attenuate weight loss. However, this has only been examined with large doses of exercise. The goal of this analysis was to examine actual weight loss compared to predicted weight loss (compensation) across different doses of exercise in a controlled trial of sedentary, overweight or obese postmenopausal women (n = 411). Methodology/Principal Findings Participants were randomized to a non-exercise control (n = 94) or 1 of 3 exercise groups; exercise energy expenditure of 4 (n = 139), 8 (n = 85), or 12 (n = 93) kcal/kg/week (KKW). Training intensity was set at the heart rate associated with 50% of each woman's peak VO2 and the intervention period was 6 months. All exercise was supervised. The main outcomes were actual weight loss, predicted weight loss (exercise energy expenditure/ 7700 kcal per kg), compensation (actual minus predicted weight loss) and waist circumference. The study sample had a mean (SD) age 57.2 (6.3) years, BMI of 31.7 (3.8) kg/m2, and was 63.5% Caucasian. The adherence to the intervention was >99% in all exercise groups. The mean (95% CI) weight loss in the 4, 8 and 12 KKW groups was −1.4 (−2.0, −0.8), −2.1 (−2.9, −1.4) and −1.5 (−2.2, −0.8) kg, respectively. In the 4 and 8 KKW groups the actual weight loss closely matched the predicted weight loss of −1.0 and −2.0 kg, respectively, resulting in no significant compensation. In the 12 KKW group the actual weight loss was less than the predicted weight loss (−2.7 kg) resulting in 1.2 (0.5, 1.9) kg of compensation (P<0.05 compared to 4 and 8 KKW groups). All exercise groups had a significant reduction in waist circumference which was independent of changes in weight. Conclusion In this study of previously sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women we observed no difference in the actual and predicted weight loss with 4 and 8 KKW of exercise (72 and 136 minutes respectively), while the 12 KKW (194 minutes) produced only about half of the predicted weight loss. However, all exercise groups had a significant reduction in waist circumference which was independent of changes in weight. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00011193"

https://openalex.org/W2032033134,"The protein kinase mammalian Sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) plays a critical role in the regulation of cell death. Recent studies suggest that MST1 mediates oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death by phosphorylating the transcription factor FOXO3 at serine 207, a site that is conserved in other FOXO family members. Here, we show that MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 at serine 212, corresponding to serine 207 in FOXO3, disrupts the association of FOXO1 with 14-3-3 proteins. Accordingly, MST1 mediates the nuclear translocation of FOXO1 in primary rat cerebellar granule neurons that are deprived of neuronal activity. We also find a requirement for MST1 in cell death of granule neurons upon withdrawal of growth factors and neuronal activity, and MST1 induces cell death in a FOXO1-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the MST1-regulatory, scaffold protein Nore1 is required for survival factor deprivation induced neuronal death.

During normal development, neurons die by the process of apoptosis to ensure the proper wiring of the nervous system (1.Oppenheim R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 14: 453-501Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar, 2.Pettmann B. Henderson C.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In the mature nervous system, aberrant neuronal cell death contributes to the pathogenesis of a large number of diseases (3.Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 4.Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 5.Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the molecular underpinnings of neuronal cell death is essential for our understanding of brain development and also offers the possibility of identification of targets for the development of drugs that prevent neuronal degeneration in brain diseases. Granule neurons of the rat cerebellum provide a robust system for the study of the mechanisms that govern neuronal cell death (6.Williams R.W. Herrup K. Annu. Rev.

Likewise, the survival of primary rat cerebellar granule neurons is supported by polypeptide growth factors, provided by serum and neuronal activity, and mimicked by the activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels induced by membrane depolarization (13.D'Mello S.R.

Granule neurons have also proved useful in the study of mechanisms of neuronal cell death in response to pathologically relevant stimuli such as oxidative stress (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R.

Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress-induced MST1 triggers neuronal cell death via the transcription factor FOXO3. MST1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207, a site that lies within its forkhead domain, and thereby promotes the dissociation of FOXO3 from 14-3-3 proteins. The 14-3-3 proteins sequester FOXO3 in the cytoplasm and thus inhibit FOXO3-dependent transcription and cell death. The consequence of the MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 in neurons treated with hydrogen peroxide is the accumulation of FOXO3 in the nucleus and activation of neuronal cell death (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). A major question raised by the identification of the MST1-FOXO3 link is whether MST1 also signals to the nucleus via other members of the FOXO family of transcription factors in neurons. The FOXO proteins have overlapping but also distinct functions and regulatory mechanisms (18.Obsil T. Obsilova V. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2263-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19.Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 20.van der Vos K.E.

Thus, the identification of a kinase phosphorylating and regulating a FOXO family member does not automatically mean that another family member will be similarly regulated. Among the FOXO3-related proteins, FOXO1 and FOXO6 are expressed in neurons (22.Hoekman M.F. Jacobs F.M. Smidt M.P. Burbach J.P. Gene. Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although nucleocytoplasmic shuttling does not appear to play a major role in the regulation of FOXO6 function (23.van der Heide L.P. Jacobs F.M. Burbach J.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus is critical to FOXO1 regulation (24.Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Recent studies have defined a Cdk1-FOXO1 signaling link in postmitotic neurons whereby neuronal activity deprivation triggers the Cdk1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 at a critical regulatory site and releases FOXO1 from 14-3-3 proteins (25.Yuan Z. Becker E.B. Merlo P. Yamada T. DiBacco S. Konishi Y. Schaefer E.M. Bonni A. Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26.Kim A.H. Bonni A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3819-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In a similar manner to MST1-FOXO3 signaling, the Cdk1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 leads to the accumulation of FOXO1 in the nucleus and the induction of cell death (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A.

Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of whether MST1 might phosphorylate FOXO1 and thus contribute to neuronal cell death upon the withdrawal of survival stimuli. In this study, we identify FOXO1 as a critical substrate of MST1. MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 within its forkhead domain at serine 212 in vitro and in vivo. The MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 at serine 212 triggers the disruption of FOXO1 from 14-3-3 proteins. We also find a requirement for MST1 in the ability of activity deprivation to induce the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 in granule neurons. Consistent with these results, we identify a function for MST1 in granule neuron cell death induced by the deprivation of growth factors and neuronal activity. Finally, we uncover a novel dual function for the MST1 regulatory scaffold protein Nore1 in granule neuron cell death. Remarkably, whereas Nore1 dampens the ability of oxidative stress to induce neuronal death, we find a requirement for Nore1 in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal death. Taken together, our findings define a crucial function for MST1 in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal death. We have also characterized upstream and downstream mechanisms of MST1 function in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal death. Identification of FOXO1 as a physiologically relevant substrate in primary neurons provides a compelling link between MST1 and the FOXO family of transcription factors with important implications for brain development and disease. Plasmids and Antibodies—The plasmids encoding GST-FOXO1-forkhead domain (GST-FOXO1(FD)) were generated by PCR cloning in pGEX4T1 at the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The FOXO1(FD) S212A, 3A, and 4A plasmids (where 3A refers to the 212A, S234A, S235A FOXO1(FD) mutant, and 4A refers to the S212A, S218A, S234A, and S235A FOXO1(FD) mutant) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations were verified by sequencing. The Nore1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting sequence is conserved in mice and rats and corresponds to: GAAGATTGACAGCTATAACAGC. Antibodies to MST1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); GFP (Molecular Probes); GST, 14-3-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); FLAG-M2 (Sigma); and β-galactosidase (Promega) were purchased. The rabbit antibody to Nore1 was generated by injecting New Zealand rabbits with full-length His-Nore1 and purified over a protein A column (Pierce). Neuronal Cultures—Cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from postnatal day 6 rat (P6) pups as described (27.Shalizi A. Lehtinen M. Gaudilliere B. Donovan N. Han J. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7326-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RNAi experiments, cultures of P6 granule neurons were transfected by a calcium phosphate method after 2 days in vitro (P6 + 2DIV) with the MST1 RNAi or control U6 plasmid together with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Following incubation with conditioned medium containing calf serum (HyClone) and membrane-depolarizing concentrations of KCl (30 mm) for 3 days, cultures were washed and returned to conditioned medium or placed in medium deprived of serum- and membrane-depolarizing concentrations of KCl (5 mm) for 24 h. Cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence as described (28.Becker E.B. Bonni A.

Cell survival was assessed in β-galactosidase-expressing neurons based on the integrity of neurites and nuclear morphology visualized using the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258; Sigma).

Cell counts were carried out in a blinded manner and analyzed for statistical significance by ANOVA and Fisher's protected least significance difference (PLSD) post hoc test. Approximately 150 cells were counted per experiment. In analyses of FOXO1 localization, neurons were transfected after 2 days in vitro (P6 + 2DIV) with the MST1 RNAi or control U6 plasmid together with the GFP-FOXO1 expression plasmid. After 24 h, neurons were placed in full medium (serum + 30 mm KCl) or in medium in which membrane depolarization was inhibited (serum + 5 mm KCl). Cells were fixed 30 h later and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described (16.Lehtinen M.K.

Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Lysates were next centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. In immunoprecipitation analyses, lysates were precleared with protein A beads at 4 °C for 20 min, and supernatants were incubated with appropriate antibodies in the presence of 10 ml of protein A-protein G (2:1) agarose beads for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting. In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described (30.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated MST1 or recombinant active MST1 was incubated in the following conditions: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of full-length GST-FOXO1 or GST-FOXO1-FD as the substrate. Kinase reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography or immunoblotting using the phospho-FOXO antibody. MST1 Phosphorylates FOXO1 at Serine 212 in Vitro and in Vivo—We investigated whether the transcription factor FOXO1 might play a role in propagating the MST1 signal to the nucleus in neurons. First, we asked whether MST1 phosphorylates full-length FOXO1 in vitro. We expressed MST1 tagged with the FLAG epitope or a kinase-dead FLAG-tagged MST1 in which the ATP binding site was mutated (MST1 K59R) in 293T cells. MST1 or MST1 K59R were immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells using the FLAG antibody and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in which recombinant full-length FOXO1 fused to GST (GST-FOXO1) and 32P-labeled ATP were added. MST1, but not the kinase-dead MST1, robustly phosphorylated FOXO1 (Fig. 1A). In other experiments, we found that purified recombinant MST1 also phosphorylated FOXO1 in vitro (Fig. 1B). MST1 phosphorylates FOXO3 at serine 207, a conserved site within the forkhead domain of the FOXO family of transcription factors (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B.

Therefore, we next determined whether MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 212, the site that corresponds to serine 207 in FOXO3. In in vitro kinase assays, MST1 phosphorylated the forkhead domain of FOXO1 fused to GST (GST-FOXO1(FD)) (Fig. 1C) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Upon tandem mass spectrometry analysis followed by data-dependent MS/MS/MS (MS3), we identified four serine residues in FOXO1 (serines 212, 218, 234, and 245) that were phosphorylated by MST1 (data not shown) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We next determined the ability of MST1 to catalyze the phosphorylation of wild-type FOXO1(FD) or FOXO1(FD) mutants in which serine 212 was mutated. Although MST1 robustly phosphorylated FOXO1(FD), MST1 failed to phosphorylate FOXO1(FD) mutants in which serine 212 was replaced with alanine (Fig. 1D) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y.

These results indicate that MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 212 in vitro. To determine whether MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 212 in vivo, we used a phospho-FOXO antibody raised to specifically recognize FOXO3 or FOXO1 when phosphorylated at serine 207 or serine 212, respectively (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The phospho-FOXO antibody recognized recombinant FOXO1(FD) that was phosphorylated by MST1 in vitro but failed to recognize unphosphorylated FOXO1(FD) (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the phospho-FOXO antibody failed to recognize serine 212 mutants of GST-FOXO1(FD) that were incubated with MST1 in vitro (Fig. 2A). We also found that the phospho-FOXO antibody recognized recombinant full-length FOXO1 when phosphorylated by MST1 in vitro but failed to recognize unphosphorylated full-length FOXO1 or FOXO1 that was incubated with the kinase-dead MST1 (MST1 K59R) (Fig. 2B). These results establish that the phospho-FOXO antibody recognizes serine 212-phosphorylated FOXO1 and that MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 212 in vitro. We next determined the capacity of MST1 to phosphorylate FOXO1 in cells. We expressed FOXO1 fused to GFP (GFP-FOXO1) together with FLAG-tagged MST1 in 293T cells and subjected lysates of transfected cells to immunoblotting with the phospho-FOXO, GFP, or FLAG antibody. We found that expression of MST1 triggered the phosphorylation of FOXO1 at serine 212 (Fig. 2C). These results show that MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 212 in vivo. The MST1-induced FOXO1 Phosphorylation Disrupts FOXO1's Interaction with 14-3-3 Proteins and Promotes the Nuclear Accumulation of FOXO1—The ability of MST1 to phosphorylate FOXO1 at serine 212 led us next to determine the functional consequences of the FOXO1 phosphorylation. Because MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207 disrupts FOXO3's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of the MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 at serine 212 on FOXO1's association with 14-3-3 proteins. We expressed MST1 or kinase-dead MST (MST1 K59R) together with GFP-FOXO1 in cells and immunoblotted GFP immunoprecipitates of transfected cells with 14-3-3 antibodies. In control-transfected cells, FOXO1 interacted robustly with 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 3A). By contrast, expression of MST1 dramatically reduced the ability of FOXO1 to interact with 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 3A). Expression of MST1 K59R failed to disrupt FOXO1's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, suggesting that the ability of MST1 to disrupt the FOXO1/14-3-3 association required the kinase activity of MST1 (Fig. 3A). In other experiments, MST1 inhibited the ability of the forkhead domain of FOXO1 to associate with 14-3-3 proteins in cells (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results support the conclusion that MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 disrupts FOXO1's association with 14-3-3 proteins. Because 14-3-3 proteins reside predominantly in the cytoplasm (31.Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the finding that the MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 disrupts its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins raised the possibility that the MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 might promote the nuclear translocation of FOXO1. We therefore determined the role of MST1 in the control of the subcellular localization of FOXO1 in primary cerebellar granule neurons. In recent studies, we found that FOXO1 translocates to the nucleus upon activity deprivation (25.Yuan Z. Becker E.B. Merlo P. Yamada T. DiBacco S. Konishi Y. Schaefer E.M. Bonni A. Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the withdrawal of neuronal activity triggers the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 in primary granule neurons (Fig. 3C). To determine the role of MST1 in activity deprivation-induced nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, we induced the knockdown of MST1 in neurons. We used a plasmid-based method of RNAi encoding shRNAs targeting MST1 (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MST1 knockdown reduced significantly the level of FOXO1 in the nucleus in activity-deprived granule neurons (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that MST1 plays a critical role in the control of FOXO1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and support the interpretation that MST1-FOXO1 signaling promotes the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 in the nucleus in neurons. MST1 Mediates Growth Factor and Activity Deprivation-induced Neuronal Cell Death—A requirement for MST1 in the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 in activity-deprived neurons led us to test the role of MST1 in neuronal cell death. The deprivation of neuronal activity and growth factors, mimicked by the withdrawal of serum and membrane depolarization, potently induces cell death in cerebellar granule neurons (13.D'Mello S.R.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of MST1 knockdown on the ability of growth factor and activity deprivation to induce neuronal cell death. Primary granule neurons were transfected with the MST1 RNAi or control U6 plasmid together with an expression plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Transfected neurons were left in full survival medium containing serum- and membrane-depolarizing concentrations of KCl (30 mm) or deprived of serum and membrane depolarization (5 mm KCl) and then subjected to immunocytochemical analyses using an antibody to β-galactosidase and the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). Transfected β-galactosidase-positive neurons were analyzed for cell survival and death based on the integrity of neuronal processes and nuclear morphology. As expected, the deprivation of membrane depolarization and growth factors induced cell death in granule neurons (Fig. 4A). However, the knockdown of MST1 significantly reduced the level of cell death in activity and growth factor-deprived neurons (Fig. 4A). MST1 knockdown neurons appeared healthy, displaying robust nuclei and processes (data not shown). These results suggest that MST1 plays a critical role in inducing cell death in neurons upon the deprivation of survival stimuli. To demonstrate the specificity of the MST1 RNAi-induced survival phenotype, we performed a rescue experiment. We expressed MST1 encoded by cDNA designed to be resistant to MST1 shRNAs (MST1R) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We found that expression of MST1R, but not MST1 encoded by wild-type cDNA, reversed the ability of MST1 RNAi to protect neurons against activity and growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the MST1 RNAi-induced protection of neurons from cell death is the result of specific knockdown of MST1 rather than off-target effects of RNAi. We next determined whether MST1 induces cell death in a FOXO1-dependent manner. We expressed an activated form of MST1 in which MST1 is fused with a myristoylation signal (myr-MST1) in cerebellar granule neurons together with an expression plasmid encoding a dominant interfering form of FOXO1 in which the transactivation domain is deleted (FOXO1-DN) or its control vector (33.Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 34.Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Expression of myr-MST1 induced cell death robustly in granule neurons (Fig. 4C). However, expression of FOXO1-DN reduced myr-MST1-induced cell death in neurons (Fig. 4C). Collectively, our results suggest that MST1-FOXO1 signaling contributes to cell death upon the withdrawal of growth factors and neuronal activity. In view of the role of MST1-FOXO3 signaling in oxidative stress-induced neuronal death (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), the identification of MST1-FOXO1 signaling in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal cell death in this study raised the question of how MST1 function is differentially controlled in neurons upon exposure to distinct cell death stimuli. We first characterized the effect of survival factor deprivation and oxidative stress on transcriptional responses of apoptotic gene targets of the FOXO transcription factors in granule neurons. Both hydrogen peroxide and survival factor deprivation triggered the expression of a FOXO-responsive reporter gene in granule neurons (Fig. 4D) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J.

Yamada T. DiBacco S. Konishi Y. Schaefer E.M. Bonni A. Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, both hydrogen peroxide and survival factor deprivation similarly induced the expression of a reporter gene controlled by the promoter of the apoptotic FOXO target gene BIM (Fig. 4E) (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A.

Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By contrast, the FOXO target gene FasL appeared to respond differentially to hydrogen peroxide and survival factor deprivation. Although survival factor deprivation robustly induced the expression of a reporter gene controlled by the FasL promoter, hydrogen peroxide marginally induced the FasL-luciferase reporter gene in neurons (Fig. 4F). Together, these results suggest that distinct sets of FOXO target genes may be activated in neurons upon exposure to survival factor deprivation and oxidative stress. It will be important to determine in future studies the full complement of genes that are regulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3 that couple the MST1 signal to cell death in neurons. The MST1 Regulatory Scaffold Protein Nore1 Plays Distinct Roles in Neuronal Cell Death—We next investigated the role of MST1 regulatory mechanisms in neuronal responses to oxidative stress and survival factor deprivation. The scaffold protein Nore1 has emerged as a critical upstream regulator of MST1 in non-neural cells (33.Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 34.Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Nore1 plays a role in the control of neuronal death. Nore1 is expressed in the brain, including granule neurons of the rodent cerebellar cortex (the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and data not shown). We confirmed that Nore1 forms a physical complex with MST1 in cells (Fig. 5A). To determine Nore1 function in neuronal death, we generated a plasmid encoding Nore1 shRNAs. Nore1 RNAi triggered robust knockdown of Nore1 in 293T cells and neurons (Fig. 5, B and C). We next analyzed the effect of Nore1 RNAi on neuronal death. Remarkably, Nore1 knockdown led to distinct cellular responses in neurons upon exposure to oxidative stress and survival factor deprivation. Nore1 knockdown sensitized granule neurons to hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (Fig. 5D). By contrast, we found that Nore1 knockdown robustly protected neurons from survival factor deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that the MST1-regulating scaffold protein Nore1 plays a dual role in neuronal death depending on the stimulus. Although Nore1 dampens the effect of oxidative stress on cell death in neurons, Nore1 is required for survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal cell death. In this study, we have identified a link between MST1 and FOXO1 and thus uncovered a critical function for MST1 in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal death. Our major findings are: 1) MST1 phosphorylates FOXO1 at the conserved forkhead binding site of serine 212 in vitro and in vivo, 2) the MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 promotes the disruption of FOXO1 from 14-3-3 proteins, 3) MST1 triggers the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 in primary neurons upon activity deprivation, 4) MST1 plays a critical role in cell death of neurons upon growth factor and activity deprivation, and 5) the MST1 regulatory scaffold protein Nore1 plays a critical role in neuronal death upon growth factor and activity deprivation. Collectively, we have identified a novel function for MST1 in survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal death, and we have characterized upstream and downstream mechanisms of MST1 function in neuronal death upon survival factor deprivation. The identification of MST1-induced FOXO1 phosphorylation and consequent dissociation of FOXO1 from 14-3-3 proteins supports the growing concept that the disruption of 14-3-3 proteins from pro-apoptotic proteins plays a key role in determining the balance of life and death in neurons (16.Lehtinen M.K.

Intriguingly, a number of apoptotic protein kinases, including Cdk1, JNK1, and MST1, trigger the dissociation of 14-3-3 proteins from apoptotic proteins including the BH3-only protein BAD and the transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3 (16.Lehtinen M.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40944-40949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cdk1 promotes cell death by acting on both BAD and FOXO1 (25.Yuan Z. Becker E.B. Merlo P. Yamada T. DiBacco S. Konishi Y. Schaefer E.M. Bonni A. Science. 2008; 319: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29.Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol.

Thus, Cdk1 and MST1 appear to converge upon FOXO1 by phosphorylating two distinct sites, serine 249 and serine 212, respectively, each promoting the disruption of FOXO1 from 14-3-3 proteins. Thus, the combined actions of Cdk1 and MST1 in neurons deprived of survival stimuli may ensure the robust activation of FOXO1 and induction of cell death. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether MST1, like Cdk1 and JNK1, also acts directly at the mitochondria to promote cell death. Our findings generalize the substrates of MST1 from FOXO3 to other family members of the FOXO family of transcription factors in mammalian cells. Thus, MST1 is likely to influence diverse biological processes beyond cell death in neurons. Consistent with this interpretation, MST-FOXO signaling promotes lifespan and health span in Caenorhabditis elegans (16.Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The scope of MST1-FOXO1 as well as MST1-FOXO3 signaling in the regulation of additional biological functions in mammalian cells from cell proliferation to differentiation and metabolism remains to be explored. The finding that the MST1 regulatory protein Nore1 exerts distinct roles in neuronal cell death depending on the nature of the death stimulus raises the important question of how these stimuli in turn regulate Nore1. In agreement with our finding that Nore1 is critical for survival factor deprivation-induced death in primary neurons, Nore1 plays an apoptotic tumor suppressive role in non-neural cells (33.Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Whether the ability of Nore1 to dampen oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death extends beyond neurons to cells outside the nervous system remains an interesting question for future studies. The identification of MST1 signaling to FOXO1 further builds the case that MST1 is a key regulator in neuronal cell death. It will be important in future studies to determine the role of these pathways in brain development and to investigate the role of MST1-FOXO1 signaling in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases.

Avruch for MST1 and Nore1 plasmids, and members of the Bonni laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript."

It is also one of the most potent endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, playing an important role in restricting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Studies show that PEDF binds to cell surface proteins, but little is known about how it exerts its effects. Recently, research identified phospholipase A2/nutrin/patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 2 as one PEDF receptor. To identify other receptors, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using PEDF as bait and discovered that the non-integrin 37/67-kDa laminin receptor (LR) is another PEDF receptor. Co-immunoprecipitation, His tag pulldown, and surface plasmon resonance assays confirmed the interaction between PEDF and LR. Using the yeast two-hybrid method, we further restricted the LR-interacting domain on PEDF to a 34-amino acid (aa) peptide (aa 44–77) and the PEDF-interacting domain on LR to a 91-aa fragment (aa 120–210). A 25-mer peptide named P46 (aa 46–70), derived from 34-mer, interacts with LR in surface plasmon resonance assays and binds to endothelial cell (EC) membranes.

Biophys. Res. Commun... 2005; 335: 756-761Google Scholar). Yet the mechanisms explaining the diverse biological activities of PEDF remain unclear. A ligand/receptor interaction at the cell membrane seemed likely, in addition to interactions within extracellular matrices, because of the diverse effects and ubiquitous expression of PEDF and the fact that most PEDF deposits remain within extracellular matrices (20Alberdi E.M. Weldon J.E. Becerra S.P. BMC Biochem... 2003; 4: 1Google Scholar). We suspected that distinct PEDF receptors elicit divergent signals to cause different biological effects. Indeed, evidence shows that PEDF binds at least two receptors: a 60-kDa receptor in ECs and an 80-kDa receptor in neuronal cells (21Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J. Biol.

The 34-mer peptide induces apoptosis, blocks endothelial cell migration, and inhibits corneal angiogenesis, possibly through a distinct EC receptor. We do not yet know the nature of the 60-kDa receptor. PEDF is one of the most potent natural endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, the extension of the vascular network from pre-existing blood vessels. It inhibits endothelial cell migration even in the presence of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (27Duh E.J. Yang H.S. Suzuma I. Miyagi M. Youngman E. Mori K. Katai M. Yan L. Suzuma K. West K. Davarya S. Tong P. Gehlbach P. Pearlman J. Crabb J.W. Aiello L.P. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Miyata Y. Matsuyama T. Kanetake H. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 961-970Google Scholar). PEDF-deficient mice show increased stromal microvessel density in several organs, such as the pancreas and prostate, suggesting that PEDF plays a key role as a natural angiogenesis inhibitor (30Doll J.A. Stellmach V.M. Bouck N.P. Bergh A.R. Lee C. Abramson L.P. Cornwell M.L. Pins M.R. Borensztajn J. Crawford S.E. Nat. Med... 2003; 9: 774-780Google Scholar). PEDF activity is selective. It only targets new vessel growth and spares pre-existing vasculature. It seems that the anti-angiogenic effects of PEDF involve endothelial cell death through the activation of the Fas/FasL death pathway (31Volpert O.V. Zaichuk T. Zhou W. Reiher F. Ferguson T.A. Stuart P.M. Amin M. Bouck N.P. Nat. Med... 2002; 8: 349-357Google Scholar). MAPK JNK and p38 influence endothelial cell apoptosis by modulating c-FLIP or caspase activity in the presence of PEDF (32Zaichuk T.A. Shroff E.H. Emmanuel R. Filleur S. Nelius T. Volpert O.V. J. Exp. Med... 2004; 199: 1513-1522Google Scholar, 33Chen L. Zhang S.S. Barnstable C.J. Tombran-Tink J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2006; 348: 1288-1295Google Scholar). Recently, Cai et al. (34Cai J. Jiang W.G. Grant M.B. Boulton M. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 3604-3613Google Scholar) reported that PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in retinal ECs. PEDF enhances γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of the C terminus of VEGF receptor-1, thus blocking VEGF receptor-2 induced angiogenesis. This study aimed to investigate potential receptors for PEDF and to establish how they influence angiogenesis. We used a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach to identify potential PEDF partners, paying particular attention to proteins that could be PEDF receptors. Our results demonstrate that the non-integrin 37/67-kDa laminin receptor (LR) is a new PEDF receptor. LR could be the proposed 60-kDa receptor identified in ECs (24Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Nakamura K. Abe R. Shimizu T. Yoshimura A. Imaizumi T. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol... 2004; 37: 497-506Google Scholar). LR is not simply a laminin receptor. It also mediates prion protein internalization (35Gauczynski, S., Peyrin, J. M., Haïk, S., Leucht, C., Hundt, C., Rieger, R., Krasemann, S., Deslys, J. P., Dormont, D., Lasmézas, C. I., and Weiss, S. EMBO J. 20, 5863–5875Google Scholar) and functions as a receptor for viruses, such as Sindbis, dengue, and adeno-associated virus (36Wang K.S. Kuhn R.J. Strauss E.G. Ou S. Strauss J.H. J. Virol... 1992; 66: 4992-5001Google Scholar, 37Thepparit C. Smith D.R. J. Virol... 2004; 78: 12647-12656Google Scholar-38Akache B. Grimm D. Pandey K. Yant S.R. Xu H. Kay M.A. J. Virol... 2006; 80: 9831-9836Google Scholar). The LR subunit is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cell differentiation, growth, migration, and cancer invasion (39Nelson J. McFerran N.V. Pivato G. Chambers E. Doherty C. Steele D. Timson D.J. Biosci. Rep... 2008; 28: 33-48Google Scholar). Our research shows that LR helps mediate PEDF anti-angiogenic activities. We identified both a 25-mer LR-interacting domain on PEDF and a PEDF-interacting domain on LR. The 25-mer PEDF-derived peptide exerts the same anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects on ECs as PEDF. Y2H Screening of PEDF Partners—We used a Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 strain (Clontech) to screen a human skeletal muscle Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech), with their 5′ ends proximal to the activation domain (AD) of the GAL4 transcription factor in a pACT2 vector. We used full-length PEDF cDNA (accession number NM_002615) baits, cloned in a pGBKT7 vector, with the GAL4-binding domain (BD) at their 5′ end. We performed interaction selection on high stringency medium (SD/–Ade/–His/–Leu/–Trp/X-α-Gal). The AD-containing plasmids in the selected clones were isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. We determined the cDNA nucleotide sequences in each clone (genome-express, Meylan, France) and compared them with the GenBank™ data base by using the BLAST search program. Y2H Method to Identify Laminin Receptor and PEDF Interaction—We PCR-amplified different human PEDF fragments (encoding amino acids 2–418, 140–418, 206–418, 374–418, 2–326, 2–140, 2–86, 2–44, 44–121, and 44–77; see Fig. 1) and cloned them into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGBKT7 vector. Similarly, we PCR-amplified LR fragments (encoding amino acids 2–295, 96–295, 96–295del158–179, 120–210, 135–200, 157–210, 120–180, and 157–180) with probes containing EcoRI and BamHI sites and cloned them into pGADT7. We verified the constructions by sequencing. We studied the potential interaction between different fragments of PEDF and LR by co-transforming them into the S. cerevisiae AH109 strain, as described above. Yeast immunofluorescence was performed as described (40Lee F.J. Huang C.F. Yu W.L. Buu L.M. Lin C.Y. Huang M.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 30998-31005Google Scholar) with anti-GAL4-AD and anti-GAL4-BD (Santa Cruz). Yeast protein extracts were carried out as described (41von der Haar T. PLoS ONE.. 2007; 2: e1078Google Scholar) and analyzed with anti-GAL4-AD and anti-LR (Santa Cruz) in Western blot analysis. Cell Cultures—Human bone marrow endothelial cells (HuBMEC) (42Schweitzer K.M. Vicart P. Delouis C. Paulin D. Dräger A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M. Weksler B.B. Lab. Investig... 1997; 76: 25-36Google Scholar) were grown in endothelial cell basal medium 2 (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany). We cultured cells in plates coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. We grew COS7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% FBS with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Expression Vector Construction and Transfection into Cell Cultures—We cloned full-length PEDF (aa 2–418) and LR (aa 2–295) cDNAs in pCMV-HA and pCMV-Myc vectors (Clontech) to obtain pCMV-HA-tagged-PEDF (HA-PEDF) and Myc-tagged-LR (Myc-LR) expression vectors, respectively. We then co-transfected these two constructions into COS-7 cells that we had plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well the previous day using Matra transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). PEDF Expression in Insect Cells and Laminin Receptor Expression in Escherichia coli—We used the primers PEDF2 (5′-AATGAATTCCAGGCCCTGGTGCTACTCCTC-3′) and PEDFR (5′-CCTCTAGACTGGGGCCCCTGGGGTCCAG-3′) to PCR amplify human PEDF cDNA (2–418). We cloned this fragment into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pIB/V5-His/CAT vector (Invitrogen). Primers LR2 (5′-ACTGAATTCTCCGGAGCCCTTGATGTCCTG-3′) and LR reverse primer (5′-ACTGCGGCCGCAGACCAGTCAGTGGTTGCTCC-3′) or LR90 (5′-ACTGAATTCGCCACTCCAATTGCTGGCCGC-3′) and LRR were used to PCR amplify human LR (2–295) or LR90 (90–295) fragments, respectively. We cloned these fragments into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pSCodon2 vector (Delphi Genetics, Charleroi, Belgium). We purified PEDF from Sf9 insect cells after blasticidin selection and purified laminin receptor from SE1 bacteria after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction with Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-PEDF and Myc-LR. Forty-eight hours later, we rinsed them with PBS twice and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min. We permeabilized cells with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. We then incubated the permeabilized cells with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min before incubating them with either anti-PEDF antibody (MAB1059, 1:100; Chemichon, Temecula, CA) and anti-LR antibody (H-141, 1:100; Santa Cruz) or anti-HA antibody (3F10, 1:100; Roche Applied Science) and anti-Myc tag antibody (9B11, 1:2000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. We washed cells four times with PBS and incubated them with Cy3-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:400, Jackson Immunoresearch; Suffolk, UK) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h in the dark. We washed the cells three times in PBS before incubating them with DAPI (dilution 1:10000, Sigma) for 5 min. We washed cells twice before mounting them onto glass slides with a drop of Mowiol mounting medium. Molecular Modeling—We modeled the PEDF-interacting domain using VMD software. We reduced the region into a theoretical functional domain with the help of a server and a docking server simulating an interaction between the peptide and ribosomal protein S2, which shares a 52% sequence homology with LR. One peptide, 25-mer P46 (aa 46–70, FFKVPVNKLAAAVSNFGYDLYRVRS) was determined and synthesized (see Fig. 3). We also synthesized fluoroscein-coupled peptide (F46) (Engineering protein platform, IFR83, UPMC, Paris, France). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assays—Using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), we analyzed the molecular interaction in real time between PEDF or PEDF-derived peptide P46 and his-LR (aa 2–295) or his-LR90 (aa 90–295) isolated from E. coli and immobilized on a NTA sensor chip to reach a response of between 1200 and 1600 resonance units (RU), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We prepared a reference surface, without protein, by the same procedure. To evaluate nonspecific background signals, we also used PEDF protein and peptide P46 on NTA chips uncoated with His-LR. Running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) and binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were used. We used PEDF protein (reference number 01-211; Upstate) and peptide P46 to study binding. We analyzed results with BIA evaluation software version 4.1. F46 Binding to Cells—We grew HuBMECs to a 60–80% confluency before incubating them with fluoroscein-coupled-P46 peptide (F46, 50 or 200 nm) at 4 °C for 60 min. To test the binding specificity, we used either nonfluorescent peptide (P46) at 500 μm or anti-LR antibodies in the binding assay. In the latter case, HuBMECs were first preincubated for 30 min with LR antibody (67LR, ab711, 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; or LR antibody, H-141, 1:100; Santa Cruz) at 37 °C, followed by placing the plate at 4 °C for 30 min, prior to incubation with F46 (50 or 200 nm) at 4 °C for 1 h. We washed cells three times with PBS and then fixed them with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, incubated them with PBS containing DAPI, then washed, and mounted them beneath glass coverslips. We took photographs with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser microscope (Göttingen, Germany). We used a nonrelevant rhodamin-labeled 25-mer peptide KAP3.1 (FSDKSCRCGVCLPSTCPHEISLLQP) derived from keratin-associated protein (43Thibaut S. Cavusoglu N. De Becker E. Zerbib F. Bednarczyk A. Schaeffer C. Van Dorsselaer A. Bernard B.A. J. Investig. Dermatol... 2008; 129: 449-459Google Scholar) as a control peptide. Western Blot Analysis—We extracted proteins using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). We determined protein amounts using Bradford reagent (BioRad). We denatured 20 μg of protein with reducing Laemmli buffer and resolved them with 12% SDS-PAGE. We then transferred the proteins to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). We blocked the membranes with 5% fatty acid-free milk at room temperature for 1 h. We then incubated the membranes overnight at 4 °C, with the primary antibodies (LR antibody, H-141, 1:250; Santa Cruz; and active caspase-3, CPP32, 1:1000; R & D System) diluted in 5% milk, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). We used ECL detection reagent to detect signals. The values obtained with ImageJ software were normalized with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (FL-335, 1:400; Santa Cruz). Co-immunoprecipitation—We incubated the protein mixtures at 4 °C for 1 h with 2 μg of anti-PEDF antibody (Chemicon) on a mixing rotor. We added agarose A/G protein (20 μl) and incubated the samples overnight. The next day, we centrifuged the samples at 1000 × g for 5 min. We removed the supernatant, leaving a pellet of beads. We washed the pellets four times by centrifuge (1000 × g, 5 min) with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 ml) (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), adding Laemmli buffer after the last wash. We performed Western blot analysis with anti-LR antibody (H-141, 1:250; Santa Cruz) as described above. His Tag Pulldown Assay—We assessed PEDF binding to His-tagged LR by His tag pulldown of bound complexes with Ni-NTA resin, as described by Notari et al. (26Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Escribano J. Laborda J. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 38022-38037Google Scholar). PEDF protein (2 μg; Upstate) was mixed with either 1 μg of His-LR (aa 2–295) or 1 μg of His-LR90 (aa 90–295, extracellular domain), purified from E. coli by Ni-NTA resin (more than 95% purity) in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm Nacl, 1% Nonidet P-40; final volume, 150 μl), and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle rotation. We added the Ni-NTA resin beads (50 μl), pre-equilibrated in binding buffer, to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. Brief centrifugation sedimented the resin beads, and we washed them three times with binding buffer. We extracted the proteins with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed them by Western blot with anti-PEDF antibody. Matrigel Angiogenesis Assay—We performed this assay as previously described (44Franco C.A. Mericskay M. Parlakian A. Gary-Bobo G. Gao-Li J. Paulin, D. Gustafsson E. Li Z. Dev. Cell.. 2008; 15: 448-461Google Scholar). HuBMECs were seeded in 24-well plates, precoated with 300 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Bioscience), at 48,000 cells/well. We cultured cells for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 0.2% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. We examined the effects of PEDF, 25-mer peptide P46, or control peptide KAP3.1 on bFGF-induced tube-like networks by phase contrast microscopy. We took representative photographs from four random fields/sample and measured the endothelial tube lengths. We then performed three distinct experiments. Corneal Angiogenesis—We assessed corneal angiogenesis as described previously (45Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1996; 37: 1625-1632Google Scholar). Sucralfate pellets containing PBS alone, bFGF alone, bFGF plus PEDF, bFGF plus peptide P46, or P46 alone were implanted into the corneas of C57/B16 mice. We used about 30 ng of bFGF, 50 ng of PEDF, and 10 ng of P46/pellet. Three to eight animals (6–11 corneal implants) were examined per sample. We used an Olympus SCH10 microscope to examine the eyes of the mice. The Pierre and Marie Curie University Animal Care and Use Committee had approved the protocol. Apoptosis Assay—We performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). We seeded HuBMECs at 3.8 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in complete MEB2 medium (Promocell). The next day the cells were serum-starved for 14 h by incubation in 0.2% serum MEB2 without growth factors. We then incubated cells with PEDF (40 ng/ml), P46 (200 nm), or KAP3.1 (200 nm) in the presence or absence of bFGF (20 ng/ml) and VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. We rinsed cells with PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min twice, fixed them with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained them according to the manufacturer's instructions. We stained cell nuclei with DAPI. We assessed the percentage of TUNEL-stained cells by fluorescence microscopy, examining four random views/sample. We repeated the experiments three times. Wound Healing Assay—We plated HuBMECs into 12-well plates at 50,000 cells/cm2 and grew them until confluent. We created a wound using a pipette cone. We then washed cells once with culture medium and left them in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 20 ng/ml bFGF. We monitored the wounded areas over 24 h and took micrographs every 4 h. siRNA-mediated LR Knockdown Experiment—We seeded HuBMECs in 6-well dishes at 1 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. We used four siRNA oligonucleotides (Genecust, Ivry, France) to target the human LR gene, either individually or in combination: LR-100 (5′-GGAACAGUACAUCUAUAAATT-3′/5′-UUUAUAGAUGUACUGUUCCAT-3′), LR-211 (5′-UGCUGAUGUCAGUGUUAUATT-3′/5′-UAUAACACUGACAUCAGCAGG-3′), LR-402 (5′-CGGAGGCAUCUUAUGUUAATT-3′/5′-UUAACAUAAGAUGCCUCCGTG-3′), and LR-612 (5′-CAGAGAUCCUGAAGAGAUUTT-3′/5′-AAUCUCUUCAGGAUCUCUGTT-3′). We used scrambled siRNA (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′/5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′) as a negative control. The siRNA pool of the four sequences gave the best knockdown result (data not shown), and we used this in all subsequent experiments. We transfected cells with MATRA-si (IBA) 24 h later, according to the manufacturer's protocol. We analyzed silencing efficiency by immunoblotting with anti-LR antibody (H-141; Santa Cruz). We assayed active caspase-3 levels by using anti-active caspase-3 antibody (CPP32; R & D System) in a Western blot. We repeated the experiments twice. Statistical Analysis—We analyzed quantitative data using Fisher post hoc tests for repeated measures and Student's unpaired t tests. The data shown are the means ± S.E. We considered p values <0.05 to be statistically significant and have marked them with asterisks. Identification of 37/67-kDa LR as a PEDF Partner by the Y2H System—Considering the widespread tissue expression and distinct biological functions of PEDF, we assumed that this peptide would have a series of partners. To investigate this further, we adopted a Y2H approach, screening a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using full-length PEDF (aa 2–418) as bait. We screened the clones grown on high stringency selected medium (SD/–Ade/–His/–Leu/–Trp/X-α-Gal). We isolated and sequenced plasmids from the clones that expressed proteins potentially interacting with GAL4-BD-PEDF. We then matched the sequences from these clones with the GenBank™ data base. Sequence analysis revealed that several of these clones encode plasma membrane proteins or potential PEDF receptors, such as PNPLA2 and 37/67-kDa LR. During our study, Becerra and co-workers (26Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Escribano J. Laborda J.

https://openalex.org/W2059210927,"PCSK9 is a secreted protein that degrades low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in liver by binding to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR. It is not known whether PCSK9 causes degradation of LDLRs within the secretory pathway or following secretion and reuptake via endocytosis. Here we show that a mutation in the LDLR EGF-A domain associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, H306Y, results in increased sensitivity to exogenous PCSK9-mediated cellular degradation because of enhanced PCSK9 binding affinity. The crystal structure of the PCSK9-EGF-A(H306Y) complex shows that Tyr-306 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-374 in PCSK9 at neutral pH, which strengthens the interaction with PCSK9. To block secreted PCSK9 activity, LDLR (H306Y) subfragments were added to the medium of HepG2 cells stably overexpressing wild-type PCSK9 or gain-of-function PCSK9 mutants associated with hypercholesterolemia (D374Y or S127R). These subfragments blocked secreted PCSK9 binding to cell surface LDLRs and resulted in the recovery of LDLR levels to those of control cells. We conclude that PCSK9 acts primarily as a secreted factor to cause LDLR degradation. These studies support the concept that pharmacological inhibition of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction extracellularly will increase hepatic LDLR expression and lower plasma low density lipoprotein levels."
https://openalex.org/W2168486196,"Hair cells in the inner ear display a characteristic polarization of their apical stereocilia across the plane of the sensory epithelium. This planar orientation allows coherent transduction of mechanical stimuli because the axis of morphological polarity of the stereocilia corresponds to the direction of excitability of the hair cells. Neuromasts of the lateral line in fishes and amphibians form two intermingled populations of hair cells oriented at 180 degrees relative to each other, however, creating a stimulus-polarity ambiguity. Therefore, it is unknown how these animals resolve the vectorial component of a mechanical stimulus. Using genetic mosaics and live imaging in transgenic zebrafish to visualize hair cells and neurons at single-cell resolution, we show that lateral-line afferents can recognize the planar polarization of hair cells. Each neuron forms synapses with hair cells of identical orientation to divide the neuromast into functional planar-polarity compartments. We also show that afferent neurons are strict selectors of polarity that can re-establish synapses with identically oriented targets during hair-cell regeneration. Our results provide the anatomical bases for the physiological models of signal-polarity resolution by the lateral line."
https://openalex.org/W1989377261,"Reduced expression of Paneth cell antimicrobial alpha-defensins, human defensin (HD)-5 and -6, characterizes Crohn's disease (CD) of the ileum. TCF-4 (also named TCF7L2), a Wnt signalling pathway transcription factor, orchestrates Paneth cell differentiation, directly regulates the expression of HD-5 and -6, and was previously associated with the decrease of these antimicrobial peptides in a subset of ileal CD. To investigate a potential genetic association of TCF-4 with ileal CD, we sequenced 2.1 kb of the 5' flanking region of TCF-4 in a small group of ileal CD patients and controls (n = 10 each). We identified eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which three (rs3814570, rs10885394, rs10885395) were in linkage disequilibrium and found more frequently in patients; one (rs3814570) was thereby located in a predicted regulatory region. We carried out high-throughput analysis of this SNP in three cohorts of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and controls. Overall 1399 healthy individuals, 785 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 225 CD patients with colonic disease only and 784 CD patients with ileal involvement were used to determine frequency distributions. We found an association of rs3814570 with ileal CD but neither with colonic CD or UC, in a combined analysis (allele positivity: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.52, p = 0.00737), which was the strongest in ileal CD patients with stricturing behaviour (allele frequency: OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08 to1.62, p = 0.00686) or an additional involvement of the upper GIT (allele frequency: OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to1.84, p = 0.02882). The newly identified genetic association of TCF-4 with ileal CD provides evidence that the decrease in Paneth cell alpha-defensins is a primary factor in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2095513789,"Oct4 is a key component of the molecular circuitry which regulates embryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. It is essential for maintenance of undifferentiated, pluripotent cell populations, and accomplishes these tasks by binding DNA in multiple heterodimer and homodimer configurations. Very little is known about how formation of these complexes is regulated, or the mechanisms through which Oct4 proteins respond to complex extracellular stimuli which regulate pluripotency. Here, we provide evidence for a phosphorylation-based mechanism which regulates specific Oct4 homodimer conformations. Point mutations of a putative phosphorylation site can specifically abrogate transcriptional activity of a specific homodimer assembly, with little effect on other configurations. Moreover, we performed bioinformatic predictions to identify a subset of Oct4 target genes which may be regulated by this specific assembly, and show that altering Oct4 protein levels affects transcription of Oct4 target genes which are regulated by this assembly but not others. Finally, we identified several signaling pathways which may mediate this phosphorylation and act in combination to regulate Oct4 transcriptional activity and protein stability. These results provide a mechanism for rapid and reversible alteration of Oct4 transactivation potential in response to extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W1981670163,"Pterosaurs, enigmatic extinct Mesozoic reptiles, were the first vertebrates to achieve true flapping flight. Various lines of evidence provide strong support for highly efficient wing design, control, and flight capabilities. However, little is known of the pulmonary system that powered flight in pterosaurs. We investigated the structure and function of the pterosaurian breathing apparatus through a broad scale comparative study of respiratory structure and function in living and extinct archosaurs, using computer-assisted tomographic (CT) scanning of pterosaur and bird skeletal remains, cineradiographic (X-ray film) studies of the skeletal breathing pump in extant birds and alligators, and study of skeletal structure in historic fossil specimens. In this report we present various lines of skeletal evidence that indicate that pterosaurs had a highly effective flow-through respiratory system, capable of sustaining powered flight, predating the appearance of an analogous breathing system in birds by approximately seventy million years. Convergent evolution of gigantism in several Cretaceous pterosaur lineages was made possible through body density reduction by expansion of the pulmonary air sac system throughout the trunk and the distal limb girdle skeleton, highlighting the importance of respiratory adaptations in pterosaur evolution, and the dramatic effect of the release of physical constraints on morphological diversification and evolutionary radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2026321358,"Haruhiko Koseki and colleagues identify a gain-of-function mutation in Fgf9 in mice with elbow knee synostosis. They further show that this mutation prevents homodimerization of Fgf9, allowing increased diffusion of the altered protein through developing tissues. The spontaneous dominant mouse mutant, Elbow knee synostosis (Eks), shows elbow and knee joint synosotsis, and premature fusion of cranial sutures. Here we identify a missense mutation in the Fgf9 gene that is responsible for the Eks mutation. Through investigation of the pathogenic mechanisms of joint and suture synostosis in Eks mice, we identify a key molecular mechanism that regulates FGF9 signaling in developing tissues. We show that the Eks mutation prevents homodimerization of the FGF9 protein and that monomeric FGF9 binds to heparin with a lower affinity than dimeric FGF9. These biochemical defects result in increased diffusion of the altered FGF9 protein (FGF9Eks) through developing tissues, leading to ectopic FGF9 signaling and repression of joint and suture development. We propose a mechanism in which the range of FGF9 signaling in developing tissues is limited by its ability to homodimerize and its affinity for extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2055259541,"During acute pancreatitis (AP), oxidative stress contributes to intestinal barrier failure. We studied actions of multispecies probiotics on barrier dysfunction and oxidative stress in experimental AP.Fifty-three male Spraque-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups: 1) controls, non-operated, 2) sham-operated, 3) AP, 4) AP and probiotics and 5) AP and placebo. AP was induced by intraductal glycodeoxycholate infusion and intravenous cerulein (6 h). Daily probiotics or placebo were administered intragastrically, starting five days prior to AP. After cerulein infusion, ileal mucosa was collected for measurements of E. coli K12 and (51)Cr-EDTA passage in Ussing chambers. Tight junction proteins were investigated by confocal immunofluorescence imaging. Ileal mucosal apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione levels were determined and glutamate-cysteine-ligase activity and expression were quantified. AP-induced barrier dysfunction was characterized by epithelial cell apoptosis and alterations of tight junction proteins (i.e. disruption of occludin and claudin-1 and up-regulation of claudin-2) and correlated with lipid peroxidation (r>0.8). Probiotic pre-treatment diminished the AP-induced increase in E. coli passage (probiotics 57.4+/-33.5 vs. placebo 223.7+/-93.7 a.u.; P<0.001), (51)Cr-EDTA flux (16.7+/-10.1 vs. 32.1+/-10.0 cm/s10(-6); P<0.005), apoptosis, lipid peroxidation (0.42+/-0.13 vs. 1.62+/-0.53 pmol MDA/mg protein; P<0.001), and prevented tight junction protein disruption. AP-induced decline in glutathione was not only prevented (14.33+/-1.47 vs. 8.82+/-1.30 nmol/mg protein, P<0.001), but probiotics even increased mucosal glutathione compared with sham rats (14.33+/-1.47 vs. 10.70+/-1.74 nmol/mg protein, P<0.001). Glutamate-cysteine-ligase activity, which is rate-limiting in glutathione biosynthesis, was enhanced in probiotic pre-treated animals (probiotics 2.88+/-1.21 vs. placebo 1.94+/-0.55 nmol/min/mg protein; P<0.05) coinciding with an increase in mRNA expression of glutamate-cysteine-ligase catalytic (GCLc) and modifier (GCLm) subunits.Probiotic pre-treatment diminished AP-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and prevented oxidative stress via mechanisms mainly involving mucosal glutathione biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986377016,"Pax3 and Pax7 are paired-box transcription factors with roles in developmental and adult regenerative myogenesis. Pax3 and Pax7 are expressed by postnatal satellite cells or their progeny but are down regulated during myogenic differentiation. We now show that constitutive expression of Pax3 or Pax7 in either satellite cells or C2C12 myoblasts results in an increased proliferative rate and decreased cell size. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative constructs leads to slowing of cell division, a dramatic increase in cell size and altered morphology. Similarly to the effects of Pax7, retroviral expression of Pax3 increases levels of Myf5 mRNA and MyoD protein, but does not result in sustained inhibition of myogenic differentiation. However, expression of Pax3 or Pax7 dominant-negative constructs inhibits expression of Myf5, MyoD and myogenin, and prevents differentiation from proceeding. In fibroblasts, expression of Pax3 or Pax7, or dominant-negative inhibition of these factors, reproduce the effects on cell size, morphology and proliferation seen in myoblasts. Our results show that in muscle progenitor cells, Pax3 and Pax7 function to maintain expression of myogenic regulatory factors, and promote population expansion, but are also required for myogenic differentiation to proceed."
https://openalex.org/W2006190082,"Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs of 18-24 nucleotides that repress post-transcriptional gene expression. However, it is unknown whether the functions of mature miRNAs can be regulated. Here we report that expression of versican 3'UTR induces organ adhesion in transgenic mice by modulating miR-199a* activities. The study was initiated by the hypothesis that the non-coding 3'UTR plays a role in the regulation of miRNA function. Transgenic mice expressing a construct harboring the 3'UTR of versican exhibits the adhesion of organs. Computational analysis indicated that a large number of microRNAs could bind to this fragment potentially including miR-199a*. Expression of versican and fibronectin, two targets of miR-199a*, are up-regulated in transgenic mice, suggesting that the 3'UTR binds and modulates miR-199a* activities, freeing mRNAs of versican and fibronectin from being repressed by miR-199a*. Confirmation of the binding was performed by PCR using mature miR-199a* as a primer and the targeting was performed by luciferase assays. Enhanced adhesion by expression of the 3'UTR was confirmed by in vitro assays. Our results demonstrated that upon arrival in cytoplasm, miRNA activities can be modulated locally by the 3'UTR. Our assay may be developed as sophisticated approaches for studying the mutual regulation of miRNAs and mRNAs in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate that expression of the 3'UTR may be an approach in the development of gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020781844,"APE1/Ref-1 is an essential DNA repair/gene regulatory protein in mammals of which intracellular level significantly affects cellular sensitivity to genotoxicants. The apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) functions are altered by phosphorylation and acetylation. We here report that APE1 is also modified by ubiquitination. APE1 ubiquitination occurred specifically at Lys residues near the N-terminus, and was markedly enhanced by mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), the major intracellular p53 inhibitor. Moreover, DNA-damaging reagents and nutlin-3, an inhibitor of MDM2–p53 interaction, increased APE1 ubiquitination in the presence of p53. Downmodulation of MDM2 increased APE1 level, suggesting that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination can be a signal for APE1 degradation. In addition, unlike the wild-type APE1, ubiquitin–APE1 fusion proteins were predominantly present in the cytoplasm. Therefore, monoubiquitination not only is a prerequisite for degradation, but may also alter the APE1 activities in cells. These results reveal a novel regulation of APE1 through ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2056596287,"Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a dynamin-like GTPase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and mutations in OPA1 are associated with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA). OPA1 plays important roles in mitochondrial fusion, cristae remodeling and apoptosis. Our previous study showed that dOpa1 mutation caused elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and resulted in damage and death of the cone and pigment cells in Drosophila eyes. Since ROS-induced oxidative damage to the cells is one of the primary causes of aging, in this study, we examined the effects of heterozygous dOpa1 mutation on the lifespan. We found that heterozygous dOpa1 mutation caused shortened lifespan, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and elevated production of ROS in the whole Drosophila. Antioxidant treatment partially restored lifespan in the male dOpa1 mutants, but had no effects in the females. Heterozygous dOpa1 mutation caused an impairment of respiratory chain complex activities, especially complexes II and III, and reversible decreased aconitase activity. Heterozygous dOpa1 mutation is also associated with irregular and dysmorphic mitochondria in the muscle. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate the important role of OPA1 in aging and lifespan, which is most likely mediated through augmented ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W1990787788,"T. J. Crow suggested that the genetic variance associated with the evolution in Homo sapiens of hemispheric dominance for language carries with it the hazard of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Individuals lacking the typical left hemisphere advantage for language, in particular for phonological components, would be at increased risk of the typical symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and delusions.Twelve schizophrenic patients treated with low levels of neuroleptics and twelve matched healthy controls participated in an event-related potential experiment. Subjects matched word-pairs in three tasks: rhyming/phonological, semantic judgment and word recognition. Slow evoked potentials were recorded from 26 scalp electrodes, and a laterality index was computed for anterior and posterior regions during the inter stimulus interval. During phonological processing individuals with schizophrenia failed to achieve the left hemispheric dominance consistently observed in healthy controls. The effect involved anterior (fronto-temporal) brain regions and was specific for the Phonological task; group differences were small or absent when subjects processed the same stimulus material in a Semantic task or during Word Recognition, i.e. during tasks that typically activate more widespread areas in both hemispheres.We show for the first time how the deficit of lateralization in the schizophrenic brain is specific for the phonological component of language. This loss of hemispheric dominance would explain typical symptoms, e.g. when an individual's own thoughts are perceived as an external intruding voice. The change can be interpreted as a consequence of ""hemispheric indecision"", a failure to segregate phonological engrams in one hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2018651163,"Background Since soluble TRAIL exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic activities both in vitro and in animal models, this study was designed to assess the relationship between the serum levels of TRAIL and clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methodology/Principal Findings Levels of TRAIL were measured by ELISA in serial serum samples obtained from 60 patients admitted for AMI, both during hospitalization and in a follow-up of 12 months, as well as in 60 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of TRAIL were significantly decreased in patients with AMI at baseline (within 24 hours from admission), compared with healthy controls, and showed a significant inverse correlation with a series of negative prognostic markers, such as CK, CK-MB and BNP. TRAIL serum levels progressively increased at discharge, but normalized only at 6–12 months after AMI. Of note, low TRAIL levels at the patient discharge were associated with increased incidence of cardiac death and heart failure in the 12-month follow-up, even after adjustment for demographic and clinical risk parameters (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97]; p = 0.001). Conclusions/Significance Although the number of patients studied was limited, our findings indicate for the first time that circulating TRAIL might represent an important predictor of cardiovascular events, independent of conventional risk markers."

Transfection of HEK293T cells with small interfering RNAs targeting the acyl carrier protein (ACP) component reduced ACP mRNA and protein levels by >85% within 24 h. The earliest phenotypic changes observed were a marked decrease in the proportion of post-translationally lipoylated mitochondrial proteins recognized by anti-lipoate antibodies and a reduction in their catalytic activity, and a slowing of the cell growth rate. Later effects observed included a reduction in the specific activity of respiratory complex I, lowered mitochondrial membrane potential, the development of cytoplasmic membrane blebs containing high levels of reactive oxygen species and ultimately, cell death. Supplementation of the culture medium with lipoic acid offered some protection against oxidative damage but did not reverse the protein lipoylation defect.

Culturing and Transfection of HEK293T Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. On-Target Plus siRNA reagents, as well as nonspecific siRNAs, were purchased from Dharmacon. The former consist of pooled siRNA species that are chemically modified to reduce off-target effects and favor antisense strand entry into the RNA-induced Silencing Complex. Transfection was performed using DharmaFECT 1 lipid transfection reagent. HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells per 0.5 ml in each well of 24-well plates. DharmaFECT 1 (0.8 μl) was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen), the mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min, siRNA was added, and incubation continued for another 20 min. The final mixture was added to culture plate wells, resulting in a final siRNA concentration in the 10–100 nm range. In earlier experiments 100 nm was used until we subsequently established that 10 nm was equally effective in down-regulation of the ACP. In some control experiments, no siRNA was included with the transfection reagent. Cells were collected, counted, and assayed at various times after transfection. Some cell cultures were supplemented with dl-α-lipoic acid (Sigma) as either Tris or sodium salt. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase (Qiagen) to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA yield was determined using a Nano-drop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript® III Platinum® according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples within an experiment were reverse transcribed at the same time, the resulting cDNA was diluted 1:5 in nuclease-free water and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Real-time PCR was performed with intron-spanning target-specific primers and SYBR Green detection in 384-well plates, using an ABI Prism 7900 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Sequence Detector System software was used for data analysis. Oligonucleotide Sequences—The On-Target Plus Smart Pool siRNA sequences were: for ACP, GGACCGUGUUCUUUACGUA, GGCCAUGGAAGACGAAUUU, CCAGAGAAGCUUUCAGUAA, and UGGACCAAGUGGAGAUUAU; for NDUFB8, GUAUGCAGCUCUUCGGUUUUU, GCAAAGGGCAUCCCGGAACUU, CCGCCAAGAAGUAUAAUAUUU, and GAGAGAGAUCCAUGGUAUAUU. The primer sequences for Real-time PCR were: for ACP, CTATGACAAGATTGACCCAGAGAAG and CAGCATCTATATCAGGAATTTCAAACC; for pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit, AGAAGTTTTGTTGGTACGGAAAGAAC and AGTACTGACCGCAACACTGACAT; for β-actin, CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC and CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT. MTT Assay—Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay in HEK293T cells (5 × 103) seeded in a 96-well plate in 100-μl volumes. siRNA transfection was done at the time cells were seeded. MTT (10 μl of 5 mg/ml) was added at various times, and the cells were incubated for 4 h in a tissue culture incubator. Formazan produced in the cells was dissolved in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20% SDS, 0.2 m HCl), and the mixture incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere. Absorbance of the formazan product was measured at 590 nm and the reference wavelength was set at 700 nm. The absorbance was directly proportional to cell number over the range 5 × 103 to 4 × 104 cells (A590 nm range 0.01–0.6). A unit of formazan production corresponds to A590 nm–A700 nm. Fluorescence Microscopy—Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and accumulation of ROS in cultured HEK293T cells were assessed at various times following siRNA treatment using the JC-1 mitochondrial potential detection kit (Cell Technology, Inc.) and CM-H2DCFDA dye (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 light fluorescence inverted microscope with mercury illumination interfaced to a computer equipped with basic spot processing software. Preparation of Mitochondrial Extracts—All operations were carried out at 4 °C. HEK293T cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, scraped from the wells, suspended in 250 mm sucrose buffered with 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7, containing 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (leupeptin (5 μg/ml), antitrypsin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml) trans-epoxysuccinyleucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (3.6 μg/ml), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)) and homogenized with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was homogenized again with a new portion of the buffer and centrifuged. Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was used for preparation of mitochondrial extract or stored at -80 °C. Mitochondria were extracted by incubation for 30 min, with occasional mixing, in a solution (20 μl/21 mg wet cells) containing 2% lauryl maltoside, 50 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7, 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected, and the extraction repeated. Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The extract, which contained both matrix and solubilized membrane proteins, was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration in the extracts was measured with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The procedures used were based on the methods described earlier (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar, 26.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar) except that the denaturation solution also contained 3 m urea, the transfer solution for Western blotting contained 20% methanol, and the nitrocellulose-membrane blocking solution was 5% fat-free dried milk powder dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. After exposure to the primary antibody, the membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Enhanced Chemiluminescent or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Reagent (Thermo Scientific Pierce) was used as substrate for peroxidase, according to manufacturer's recommendations. The procedure used for SDS-PAGE of mitochondrial extract proteins was modified as follows. Denatured proteins (32–40 μg) were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels (27.Schagger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane in a semi-dry transfer system using CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. Enzyme Assays—Cell extracts initially were prepared either by lauryl maltoside extraction of the isolated mitochondrial fraction or by hypotonic treatment (freeze-thawing in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). For all complexes but complex III, the highest specific activities were observed with the mitochondria swollen by hypotonic treatment and this method was employed for preparation of mitochondria in subsequent assays. All assays were performed at 30 °C. Respiratory complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) was assayed spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, in the presence of antimycin A, using 2,6-dichloroindophenol as the acceptor of electrons from decylubiquinone, which is reduced after oxidation of NADH by complex I (28.Janssen A.J. Trijbels F.J. Sengers R.C. Smeitink J.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Wintjes L.T. Stoltenborg-Hogenkamp B.J. Rodenburg R.J. Clin. Chem. 2007; 53: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Rotenone-sensitive activity was defined as complex I activity. Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) was assayed, in the presence of antimycin A, potassium cyanide, and rotenone, by measuring the rate of malonate-sensitive and succinate-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol in the presence of decylubiquinone (28.Janssen A.J. Trijbels F.J. Sengers R.C. Smeitink J.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Wintjes L.T. Stoltenborg-Hogenkamp B.J. Rodenburg R.J. Clin.

Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Complex III activity (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) was assayed by monitoring at 550 nm the antimycin A-sensitive reduction of ferri- to ferrocytochrome c by decylubiquinol, in the presence of Tween 20, albumin, and sodium azide (30.Luo C. Long J. Liu J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2008; 395: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Complex IV activity (cytochrome c oxidase) was assayed by monitoring the azide-sensitive decrease in absorbance at 550 nm that accompanies the oxidation of ferro- to ferricytochrome c (31.Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Cooperstein S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay was not linear and the first-order rate constant was used to calculate complex IV activities. Complex V (ATP synthase) was measured in the reverse direction by coupling the formation of ADP with the pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase reactions; pyruvate formed in the kinase reaction is converted to lactate resulting in the oxidation of NADH and a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (33.Zheng J. Ramirez V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity, catalyzed by F0 subunit, is reported as complex V activity. Pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activities in hypotonically swollen mitochondria were monitored spectrophotometrically at 500 nm (34.Schwab M.A. Kolker S. van den Heuvel L.P. Sauer S. Wolf N.I. Rating D. Hoffmann G.F. Smeitink J.A. Okun J.G. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). β-Fluoropyruvate sensitivity (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and CoASH dependence (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) were used to verify specificity. Prior to the assay pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was activated by incubation of hypotonically swollen mitochondria, at 1 mg protein/ml, with dichloroacetate and magnesium and calcium ions at 37 °C for 10 min (35.Sheu K.F. Hu C.W. Utter M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 67: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Human mitochondrial ACP was expressed and purified as described previously (36.Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and polyclonal rabbit antibodies prepared by Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies recognizing 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and the E2 subunit of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase were gifts from Dr. Luke Szweda (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against lipoic acid were purchased from Calbiochem. Individual mouse monoclonal antibodies against five subunits of human complex I and against the E2 subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase were obtained from Mitosciences (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal antibody against branched-chain oxoacid dehydrogenase was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and those recognizing β-actin from Sigma. Blue Native PAGE and Complex I Activity—Mitochondrial complexes were separated on 1-mm thick 4–13% acrylamide gel gradients, using a 3.5% stacking gel, prepared in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II system (37.Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schagger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Each sample, usually 32 μg of protein, contained 5% glycerol and 0.5% G-250 suspension in 0.5 m 6-aminohexanoic acid to achieve a mass ratio between lauryl maltoside and G-250 equal to 30. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C, 60 V for the first 15 min, then at 5 mA constant current. Deep blue buffer was replaced with light blue buffer (37.Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schagger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar) when the front reached 2/3 of the gel length. Complex I activity was measured directly in the gel using nitro blue tetrazolium (38.Nijtmans L.G. Henderson N.S. Holt I.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional analysis, Blue Native gel electrophoresis was performed in the first dimension, 3-cm sections of the gel were cut out, soaked for 1 h at 20 °C in Tricine SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% mercaptoethanol and 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (39.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), and sealed into a 4% acrylamide stacking gel poured over a 10% acrylamide SDS-Tricine running gel. Electrophoresis was performed first at 15 V for 2.5 h and then at constant current, 16 mA/plate, for 2.5 to 3 h. Western blotting, in a semi-dry system, was performed as described above. Integrated density measurements were done with ImageJ version 1.38x software (National Institutes of Health). Effect of ACP siRNA on ACP mRNA Level and Cell Growth—Transfection of HEK293T cells with siRNAs targeting mitochondrial ACP was extremely effective in down-regulating ACP expression. Within 24 h, the ACP mRNA level was reduced by 95% and this low level was maintained for at least 72 h, whereas that in control cells, treated with either nonspecific siRNA or vehicle only, were relatively unaffected (Fig. 1A). Cell growth was slowed significantly by 48 h and by 72 h cells began to die and detach from the culture plate (Fig. 1B). The reduction in the viable cell population was also reflected in the decreased ability of the ACP siRNA-treated cells to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to the insoluble formazan dye in the MTT assay (Fig. 1C) and the appearance of cells that stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (details not shown). Effect of ACP Down-regulation on the Protein Lipoylation Profile—Our previous finding that the fatty acid biosynthetic and protein lipoylation pathways are directly linked in mammalian mitochondria prompted us to examine the effect of ACP down-regulation on the lipoylation status of mitochondrial proteins, using antibodies that recognize lipoyl moieties. Three lipoylated proteins were recognized by the antibodies in HEK293T cells. The species giving the strongest anti-lipoyl signal was identified as pyruvate dehydrogenase, using antibodies that recognize specifically the E2 subunits of this complex. The level of pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 protein was not decreased by treatment of cells with ACP siRNA (Fig. 2). However, the ability of anti-lipoyl antibodies to recognize the E2 subunits was dramatically curtailed as early as 24 h post-transfection; this reduced reactivity toward anti-lipoyl antibodies was maintained for at least 96 h post-transfection. Cells treated with nonspecific siRNA, or vehicle alone, did not exhibit altered lipoylation profiles. Recognition of a second, faster-moving lipoylated protein was also dramatically reduced by treatment of the cells with ACP siRNA. This species was identified as the E2 subunit of branched-chain oxoacid dehydrogenase using antibodies specific for that protein (details not shown). Lipoylation of a third protein, identified as the H-protein of the glycine cleavage system based on its molecular mass of ∼14 kDa, was also dramatically reduced by transfection of HEK293T cells with ACP siRNAs (details not shown). Direct spectrophotometric assay of pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenases revealed that 48 h following transfection with ACP siRNA, the activities were lowered by ∼40% (Table 1). These results suggested that down-regulation of mitochondrial ACP may reduce the availability of octanoyl moieties required for the synthesis of lipoyl moieties de novo, thus compromising the post-translational modification reactions.TABLE 1Effect of down-regulation of mitochondrial ACP on activities of oxoacid dehydrogenases and respiratory complexes HEK293T cells were treated with 10 nm nonspecific siRNA (control) or ACP siRNA, cultured for 48 h, and swollen mitochondria were prepared for assay. Values are means (± S.D.) for two to three determinations. Specificity of the assays was evaluated using specific inhibitors: approximately 70% activity measured in the pyruvate dehydrogenase assay was inhibited by β -fluoropyruvate, 90% activity measured in oxoglutarate assay was CoASH dependent, 75% of the activity measured in the complex I assay was inhibited by rotenone; 95% of the activity measured in the complex II assay was inhibited by malonate; 75% of the activity in the complex III assay was inhibited by antimycin A; 95% of activity in the complex IV assay was inhibited by sodium azide; 50% of activity in the complex V assay was inhibited by oligomycin. 100% values, in nanomole min–1 mg protein–1, were: for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 27.7; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, 43.5; complex I. 153; complex II, 212, complex III, 377, complex V, 108. The first-order rate constant of complex IV was 1,480 nmol–1 min–1 mg–1.EnzymeNonspecific siRNANo treatment+ACP siRNAactivity, % controlPyruvate dehydrogenase100 ± 5.597.3 ± 4.451.9 ± 0.3ap values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.02Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase100 ± 7.8110 ± 0.851.6 ± 2.5ap values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.02Complex I100 ± 5.1124 ± 0.9ap values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.0261.6 ± 5.7ap values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.02Complex II100 ± 1.2111 ± 4.1bp values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.0575.3 ± 0.1ap values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.02Complex III100 ± 1.396.4 ± 13.794.2 ± 4.6Complex IV100 ± 3.9104 ± 2.8108 ± 3.4Complex V100 ± 10.6122 ± 0.8112 ± 13.5a p values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.02b p values indicate activities statistically different from the nonspecific siRNA control: <0.05 Open table in a new tab Effect of Down-regulation of Mitochondrial ACP on Integrity of Respiratory Chain Complexes—Because mitochondrial ACP has been implicated as one of the many subunits of respiratory complex I, we evaluated the effect of ACP siRNA treatment on the integrity of this complex. For comparison, HEK293T cells were also transfected with siRNAs targeting NDUFB8, another of the nuclear-encoded complex I subunits. The mitochondrial content of ACP and NDUFB8 were both significantly lowered by treatment with their respective siRNAs (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the mitochondrial content of NDUFS3, another of the complex I subunits, was unaffected by treatment with siRNAs targeting either ACP or NDUFB8. Complex I was separated from other respiratory complexes by Blue Native gel electrophoresis, localized by Western blotting with antibodies directed against the NDUFA9 subunit, and its activity was assessed directly in the gel (Fig. 3B). Although ACP protein levels in HEK293T cell mitochondria were significantly reduced 24 h after transfection with ACP siRNA, no decrease in complex I activity was apparent until 48 h post-transfection. Activity at this time was estimated as ∼47% of that of untreated control cells. Transfection of cells with siRNAs targeting the NDUFB8 subunit resulted in a similar decrease in complex I activity by 48 h post-transfection; activity was reduced to ∼45% of the control. To distinguish between the possibilities that the decreased activity in complex I induced"
https://openalex.org/W2055780312,"The lag time of an invasion is the delay between arrival of an introduced species and its successful spread in a new area. To date, most estimates of lag times for plants have been indirect or anecdotal, and these estimates suggest that plant invasions are often characterized by lag times of 50 years or more. No general estimates are available of lag times for tropical plant invasions. Historical plantings and documentation were used to directly estimate lag times for tropical plant invasions in Hawai'i.Historical planting records for the Lyon Arboretum dating back to 1920 were examined to identify plants that have since become invasive pests in the Hawaiian Islands. Annual reports describing escape from plantings were then used to determine the lag times between initial plantings and earliest recorded spread of the successful invaders. Among 23 species that eventually became invasive pests, the average lag time between introduction and first evidence of spread was 14 years for woody plants and 5 years for herbaceous plants.These direct estimates of lag times are as much as an order of magnitude shorter than previous, indirect estimates, which were mainly based on temperate plants. Tropical invaders may have much shorter lag times than temperate species. A lack of direct and deliberate observations may have also inflated many previous lag time estimates. Although there have been documented cases of long lag times due to delayed arrival of a mutualist or environmental changes over time, this study suggests that most successful invasions are likely to begin shortly after arrival of the plant in a suitable habitat, at least in tropical environments. Short lag times suggest that controlled field trials may be a practical element of risk assessment for plant introductions."
https://openalex.org/W2007683737,"Chemokine receptors belong to a class of integral membrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are responsible for transmitting signals from the extracellular environment. However, the structural changes in the receptor, connecting ligand binding to G-protein activation, remain elusive for most GPCRs due to the difficulty to produce them for structural and functional studies. We here report high-level production in E.coli of 4 human GPCRs, namely chemokine receptors (hCRs) CCR5, CCR3, CXCR4 and CX3CR1 that are directly involved in HIV-1 infection, asthma and cancer metastasis. The synthetic genes of CCR5, CCR3, CXCR4 and CX3CR1 were synthesized using a two-step assembly/amplification PCR method and inserted into two different kinds of expression systems. After systematic screening of growth conditions and host strains, TB medium was selected for expression of pEXP-hCRs. The low copy number pBAD-DEST49 plasmid, with a moderately strong promoter tightly regulated by L-arabinose, proved helpful for reducing toxicity of expressed membrane proteins. The synthetic Trx-hCR fusion genes in the pBAD-DEST49 vector were expressed at high levels in the Top10 strain. After a systematic screen of 96 detergents, the zwitterionic detergents of the Fos-choline series (FC9-FC16) emerged as the most effective for isolation of the hCRs. The FC14 was selected both for solubilization from bacterial lysates and for stabilization of the Trx-hCRs during purification. Thus, the FC-14 solubilized Trx-hCRs could be purified using size exclusion chromatography as monomers and dimers with the correct apparent MW and their alpha-helical content determined by circular dichroism. The identity of two of the expressed hCRs (CCR3 and CCR5) was confirmed using immunoblots using specific monoclonal antibodies. After optimization of expression systems and detergent-mediated purification procedures, we achieved large-scale, high-level production of 4 human GPCR chemokine receptor in a two-step purification, yielding milligram quantities of CCR5, CCR3, CXCR4 and CX3CR1 for biochemical, biophysical and structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2048992165,"Embryos of most fish develop externally and are exposed to an aquatic environment full of potential pathogens, whereas they have little or only limited ability to mount an efficient and protective response. How fish embryos survive pathogenic attacks remains poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the maternal immunization of female zebrafish with formalin-killed Aeromonas hydrophila causes a significant increase in C3 and Bf contents in the mother, a corresponding rise in the offspring, and induces a remarkable increase in the hemolytic activities in both the mother and offspring. In addition, the embryos derived from the immunized mother are significantly more tolerant to A. hydrophila challenge than those from the unimmunized fish, and blocking C3 and Bf activities by injection of the antibodies against C3 and Bf into the embryos render them more susceptible to A. hydrophila. These results clearly show that the protection of zebrafish embryos against A. hydrophila can be achieved by the maternally-transferred immunity of the complement system operating via the alternative pathway. This appears to be the first report providing in vivo evidences for the protective role of the alternative complement components in the early embryos of zebrafish, paving the way for insights into the in vivo function of other maternally-transferred factors in fish."
https://openalex.org/W2089705167,"Background Melanoma metastasis status is highly associated with the overall survival of patients; yet, little is known about proteomic changes during melanoma tumor progression. To better understand the changes in protein expression involved in melanoma progression and metastasis, and to identify potential biomarkers, we conducted a global quantitative proteomic analysis on archival metastatic and primary melanomas. Methodology and Findings A total of 16 metastatic and 8 primary cutaneous melanomas were assessed. Proteins were extracted from laser captured microdissected formalin fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues by liquefying tissue cells. These preparations were analyzed by a LC/MS-based label-free protein quantification method. More than 1500 proteins were identified in the tissue lysates with a peptide ID confidence level of >75%. This approach identified 120 significant changes in protein levels. These proteins were identified from multiple peptides with high confidence identification and were expressed at significantly different levels in metastases as compared with primary melanomas (q-Value<0.05). Conclusions and Significance The differentially expressed proteins were classified by biological process or mapped into biological system networks, and several proteins were implicated by these analyses as cancer- or metastasis-related. These proteins represent potential biomarkers for tumor progression. The study successfully identified proteins that are differentially expressed in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of metastatic and primary melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1984567902,"C-type lectin receptors expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages are able to bind glycoproteins of microbial pathogens via mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Langerin on Langerhans cells, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin on dendritic cells, and mannose receptor (MR) on dendritic cells and macrophages bind the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein gp120 principally via high mannose oligosaccharides. These C-type lectin receptors can also oligomerize to facilitate enhanced ligand binding. This study examined the effect of oligomerization of MR on its ability to bind to mannan, monomeric gp120, native trimeric gp140, and HIV type 1 BaL. Mass spectrometry analysis of cross-linked MR showed homodimerization on the surface of primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. Both monomeric and dimeric MR were precipitated by mannan, but only the dimeric form was co-immunoprecipitated by gp120. These results were confirmed independently by flow cytometry analysis of soluble monomeric and trimeric HIV envelope and a cellular HIV virion capture assay. As expected, mannan bound to the carbohydrate recognition domains of MR dimers mostly in a calcium-dependent fashion. Unexpectedly, gp120-mediated binding of HIV to dimers on MR-transfected Rat-6 cells and macrophages was not calcium-dependent, was only partially blocked by mannan, and was also partially inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate. Thus gp120-mediated HIV binding occurs via the calcium-dependent, non-calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition domains and the cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus of MR dimers, presenting a much broader target for potential inhibitors of gp120-MR binding."
https://openalex.org/W2011445314,"SMARCB1 is deleted in rhabdoid tumor, an aggressive paediatric malignancy affecting the kidney and CNS. We hypothesized that the oncogenic pathway in rhabdoid tumors involved epigenetic silencing of key cell cycle regulators as a consequence of altered chromatin-remodelling, attributable to loss of SMARCB1, and that this hypothesis if proven could provide a biological rationale for testing epigenetic therapies in this disease. We used an inducible expression system to show that the imprinted cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1C is a downstream target for SMARCB1 and is transcriptionally activated by increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the promoter. We also show that CDKN1C expression induces cell cycle arrest, CDKN1C knockdown with siRNA is associated with increased proliferation, and is able to compete against the anti-proliferative effect of restored SMARCB1 expression. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Romidepsin, specifically restored CDKN1C expression in rhabdoid tumor cells through promoter histone H3 and H4 acetylation, recapitulating the effect of SMARCB1 on CDKNIC allelic expression, and induced cell cycle arrest in G401 and STM91-01 rhabdoid tumor cell lines. CDKN1C expression was also shown to be generally absent in clinical specimens of rhabdoid tumor, however CDKN1A and CDKN1B expression persisted. Our observations suggest that maintenance of CDKN1C expression plays a critical role in preventing rhabdoid tumor growth. Significantly, we report for the first time, parallels between the molecular pathways of SMARCB1 restoration and Romidepsin treatment, and demonstrate a biological basis for the further exploration of histone deacetylase inhibitors as relevant therapeutic reagents in the treatment of rhabdoid tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1968278549,"Background Shape complementarity and non-covalent interactions are believed to drive protein-ligand interaction. To date protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA interactions were systematically investigated, which is in contrast to interactions with small ligands. We investigate the role of covalent and non-covalent bonds in protein-small ligand interactions using a comprehensive dataset of 2,320 complexes. Methodology and Principal Findings We show that protein-ligand interactions are governed by different forces for different ligand types, i.e., protein-organic compound interactions are governed by hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and covalent bonds; protein-metal ion interactions are dominated by electrostatic force and coordination bonds; protein-anion interactions are established with electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts; and protein-inorganic cluster interactions are driven by coordination bonds. We extracted several frequently occurring atomic-level patterns concerning these interactions. For instance, 73% of investigated covalent bonds were summarized with just three patterns in which bonds are formed between thiol of Cys and carbon or sulfur atoms of ligands, and nitrogen of Lys and carbon of ligands. Similar patterns were found for the coordination bonds. Hydrogen bonds occur in 67% of protein-organic compound complexes and 66% of them are formed between NH- group of protein residues and oxygen atom of ligands. We quantify relative abundance of specific interaction types and discuss their characteristic features. The extracted protein-organic compound patterns are shown to complement and improve a geometric approach for prediction of binding sites. Conclusions and Significance We show that for a given type (group) of ligands and type of the interaction force, majority of protein-ligand interactions are repetitive and could be summarized with several simple atomic-level patterns. We summarize and analyze 10 frequently occurring interaction patterns that cover 56% of all considered complexes and we show a practical application for the patterns that concerns interactions with organic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1978728136,"Social conformity is a cornerstone of human culture because it accelerates and maintains the spread of behaviour within a group. Few empirical studies have investigated the role of social conformity in the maintenance of traditions despite an increasing body of literature on the formation of behavioural patterns in non-human animals. The current report presents a field experiment with free-ranging marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) which investigated whether social conformity is necessary for the maintenance of behavioural patterns within groups or whether individual effects such as habit formation would suffice.Using a two-action apparatus, we established alternative behavioural patterns in six family groups composed of 36 individuals. These groups experienced only one technique during a training phase and were thereafter tested with two techniques available. The monkeys reliably maintained the trained method over a period of three weeks, despite discovering the alternative technique. Three additional groups were given the same number of sessions, but those 21 individuals could freely choose the method to obtain a reward. In these control groups, an overall bias towards one of the two methods was observed, but animals with a different preference did not adjust towards the group norm. Thirteen of the fifteen animals that discovered both techniques remained with the action with which they were initially successful, independent of the group preference and the type of action (Binomial test: exp. proportion: 0.5, p<0.01).The results indicate that the maintenance of behavioural patterns within groups 1) could be explained by the first rewarded manipulation and subsequent habit formation and 2) do not require social conformity as a mechanism. After an initial spread of a behaviour throughout a group, this mechanism may lead to a superficial appearance of conformity without the involvement of such a socially and cognitively complex mechanism. This is the first time that such an experiment has been conducted with free-ranging primates."

https://openalex.org/W2172101583,"Procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei reside in the midgut of tsetse flies where they are covered by several million copies of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins known as procyclins. It has been proposed that procyclins protect parasites against proteases and/or participate in tropism, directing them from the midgut to the salivary glands. There are four different procyclin genes, each subject to elaborate levels of regulation. To determine if procyclins are essential for survival and transmission of T. brucei, all four genes were deleted and parasite fitness was compared in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured in vitro, the null mutant and wild type trypanosomes (tagged with cyan fluorescent protein) maintained a near-constant equilibrium. In contrast, when flies were infected with the same mixture, the null mutant was rapidly overgrown in the midgut, reflecting a reduction in fitness in vivo. Although the null mutant is patently defective in competition with procyclin-positive parasites, on its own it can complete the life cycle and generate infectious metacyclic forms. The procyclic form of T. brucei thus differs strikingly from the bloodstream form, which does not tolerate any perturbation of its variant surface glycoprotein coat, and from other parasites such as Plasmodium berghei, which requires the circumsporozoite protein for successful transmission to a new host."

https://openalex.org/W2139309246,"Background The activating immunoreceptor NKG2D is expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells and subsets of T cells. NKG2D contributes to anti-tumour and anti-viral immune responses in vitro and in vivo. The ligands for NKG2D in humans are diverse proteins of the MIC and ULBP/RAET families that are upregulated on the surface of virally infected cells and tumours. Two splicing variants of ULBP5/RAET1G have been cloned previously, but not extensively characterised. Methodology/Principal Findings We pursue a number of approaches to characterise the expression, trafficking, and function of the two isoforms of ULBP5/RAET1G. We show that both transcripts are frequently expressed in cell lines derived from epithelial cancers, and in primary breast cancers. The full-length transcript, RAET1G1, is predicted to encode a molecule with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that are unique amongst NKG2D ligands. Using specific anti-RAET1G1 antiserum to stain tissue microarrays we show that RAET1G1 expression is highly restricted in normal tissues. RAET1G1 was expressed at a low level in normal gastrointestinal epithelial cells in a similar pattern to MICA. Both RAET1G1 and MICA showed increased expression in the gut of patients with celiac disease. In contrast to healthy tissues the RAET1G1 antiserum stained a wide variety or different primary tumour sections. Both endogenously expressed and transfected RAET1G1 was mainly found inside the cell, with a minority of the protein reaching the cell surface. Conversely the truncated splicing variant of RAET1G2 was shown to encode a soluble molecule that could be secreted from cells. Secreted RAET1G2 was shown to downregulate NKG2D receptor expression on NK cells and hence may represent a novel tumour immune evasion strategy. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that the expression patterns of ULBP5RAET1G are very similar to the well-characterised NKG2D ligand, MICA. However the two isoforms of ULBP5/RAET1G have very different cellular localisations that are likely to reflect unique functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2169820297,"Background Primary immunodeficiencies are inborn errors of immunity that lead to life threatening conditions. These predispositions describe human immunity in natura and highlight the important function of components of the Toll-IL-1- receptor-nuclear factor kappa B (TIR-NF-κB) pathway. Since the TIR-NF-κB circuit is a conserved component of the host defence in higher animals, genetically tractable models may contribute ideas for clinical interventions. Methodology/Principal Findings We used immunodeficient fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to address questions pertaining to survival following bacterial infection. We describe here that flies lacking the NF-κB protein Relish, indispensable for countering Gram-negative bacteria, had a greatly improved survival to such infections when subject to dietary short-term starvation (STS) prior to immune challenge. STS induced the release of Nitric Oxide (NO), a potent molecule against pathogens in flies, mice and humans. Administering the NO Synthase-inhibitory arginine analog N-Nitro-L-Arginine-Methyl-Ester (L-NAME) but not its inactive enantiomer D-NAME increased once again sensitivity to infection to levels expected for relish mutants. Surprisingly, NO signalling required the NF-κB protein Dif, usually needed for responses against Gram-positive bacteria. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that NO release through STS may reflect an evolutionary conserved process. Moreover, STS could be explored to address immune phenotypes related to infection and may offer ways to boost natural immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2014410888,"Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in haematological malignancies is caused in several cases by loss of function mutations within the coding sequence of NF-kappaB inhibitory molecules such as IkappaBalpha or p100. Hut-78, a truncated form of p100, constitutively generates p52 and contributes to the development of T-cell lymphomas but the molecular mechanism underlying this oncogenic potential remains unclear. We show here that MMP9 gene expression is induced through the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway in fibroblasts and also on Hut-78 or p52 overexpression in fibroblasts as well as in lymphoma cells. p52 is critical for Hut-78-mediated MMP9 gene induction as a Hut-78 mutant as well as other truncated NF-kappaB2 proteins that are not processed into p52 failed to induce the expression of this metalloproteinase. Conversely, MMP9 gene expression is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Interestingly, MLL1 and MLL2 H3K4 methyltransferase complexes are tethered by p52 on the MMP9 but not on the IkappaBalpha promoter, and the H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity recruited on the MMP9 promoter is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Moreover, MLL1 and MLL2 are associated with Hut-78 in a native chromatin-enriched extract. Thus, we identified a molecular mechanism by which the recruitment of a H3K4 histone methyltransferase complex on the promoter of a NF-kappaB-dependent gene induces its expression and potentially the invasive potential of lymphoma cells harbouring constitutive activity of the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2064823638,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of ubiquitylated inclusions and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) is a ubiquitin-ligase that ubiquitylates alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 and is present in Lewy bodies of PD patients. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitylation of PD-related proteins might shed light on the events involved in the formation of Lewy bodies and death of neurons. We show in this study that the recently described synphilin-1 isoform, synphilin-1A, interacts in vitro and in vivo with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase SIAH and regulates its activity toward alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1. SIAH promotes limited ubiquitylation of synphilin-1A that does not lead to its degradation by the proteasome. SIAH also increases the formation of synphilin-1A inclusions in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, supporting the participation of ubiquitylated synphilin-1A in the formation of Lewy body-like inclusions. Synphilin-1A/SIAH inclusions recruit PD-related proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1, Parkin, PINK1, and UCH-L1. We found that synphilin-1A robustly increases the steady-state levels of SIAH by decreasing its auto-ubiquitylation and degradation. In addition, synphilin-1A blocks the ubiquitylation and degradation of the SIAH substrates synphilin-1 and deleted in colon cancer protein. Furthermore, synphilin-1A strongly decreases the monoubiquitylation of alpha-synuclein by SIAH and the formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions, supporting a role for monoubiquitylation in alpha-synuclein inclusion formation. Our results suggest a novel function for synphilin-1A as a regulator of SIAH activity and formation of Lewy body-like inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W1992673079,"YopH is an exceptionally active tyrosine phosphatase that is essential for virulence of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium causing plague. YopH breaks down signal transduction mechanisms in immune cells and inhibits the immune response. Only a few substrates for YopH have been characterized so far, for instance p130Cas and Fyb, but in view of YopH potency and the great number of proteins involved in signalling pathways it is quite likely that more proteins are substrates of this phosphatase. In this respect, we show here YopH interaction with several proteins not shown before, such as Gab1, Gab2, p85, and Vav and analyse the domains of YopH involved in these interactions. Furthermore, we show that Gab1, Gab2 and Vav are not dephosphorylated by YopH, in contrast to Fyb, Lck, or p85, which are readily dephosphorylated by the phosphatase. These data suggests that YopH might exert its actions by interacting with adaptors involved in signal transduction pathways, what allows the phosphatase to reach and dephosphorylate its susbstrates."
https://openalex.org/W2066691875,"Oncogenic transformation is a complex, multistep process, which goes through several stages before complete malignant transformation occurs. To identify early processes in carcinogenesis, we used an in vitro model, based on the initiating event in cervical cancer, papillomavirus transformation of keratinocytes. We compared gene expression in primary keratinocytes (K) and papillomavirus-transformed keratinocytes from early (E) and late (L) passages and from benzo[a]pyrene-treated L cells (BP). The transformed cells exhibit similar transcriptional changes to clinical cervical carcinoma. The number of transcripts expressed progressively decreased during the evolution from K to BP cells. Bioinformatic analysis, validated by detailed biochemical analysis, revealed substantial contraction of both pro- and antiapoptotic networks during transformation. Nonetheless, L and BP cells were not resistant to apoptotic stimuli. At doses of cisplatin that led to 30-60% apoptosis of K and E cells, transformed L and BP cells underwent 80% necrotic cell death, which became the default response to genotoxic stress. Moreover, appreciable necrotic fractions were observed in the cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, in response to comparable doses of cisplatin. The shrinkage of biochemical networks, including the apoptotic network, may allow a cancer cell to economize on energy usage to facilitate enhanced proliferation but leaves it vulnerable to stress.

This study supports the hypothesis that the process of cancer transformation may be accompanied by a shift from apoptosis to necrosis. Cancer is an evolving, complex process, which goes through several stages before full malignancy. In vivo, cell immortalization is followed by the development of benign lesions, which later progress into malignant tumors, finally metastasizing to other tissues. As it evolves, a cancer cell relinquishes pathways that interfere with proliferation and escapes from some of the restrictions of multicellular organisms. This process enables the cancer cell to proliferate in a broad range of naturally occurring microenvironments but may leave it vulnerable to rare or unexpected perturbations (1.Kitano H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) (e.g. genotoxic stress). The reactions of cancer cells, which acquire numerous molecular changes, may differ significantly from the reactions of normal cells to genotoxic stress.Apoptosis is tightly controlled by the ability of the cell to integrate many pro- and antiapoptotic signals. Thus, the decision to live or to die in response to death signals is a choice the cell makes in the face of its cellular context. Molecular changes acquired by cancer cells may influence the connectivity of the signaling pathways and disturb the apoptotic network. As a result, the cancer cell may die by alternative death modes in response to genotoxic drugs.In order to follow the changes that occur during the evolution of cancer, we use a model in which one can follow the progression from the normal phenotype all the way to the transformed phenotype, based on the natural evolution of cervical cancer.

High risk HPV infections progress to cervical cancer in only a small percentage of infected women, after a long latency period (2.zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). Risk factors such as smoking are associated with the progression of the infected cells to the tumor stage (3.Bosch F.X. Lorincz A. Munoz N. Meijer C.J. Shah K.V. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 244-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). Our model system consists of cultures of primary keratinocytes (K) and of HPV16-transformed keratinocytes (HF1 cells) from early (E) and late passage (L) (4.Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Tsvieli R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In an attempt to simulate the natural causes of transformation, we treated L cells with benzo-[a]pyrene (BP), a carcinogen present in cigarette smoke. L and BP cells display enhanced growth rate (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), increased ploidy, and chromosomal translocations (data not shown), whereas BP cells also generate colonies in soft agar (Fig. S1). Furthermore, L and BP cells show a striking convergence of gene expression with published data from cervical carcinomas (6.Santin A.D. Zhan F. Bignotti E. Siegel E.R. Cane S. Bellone S. Palmieri M. Anfossi S. Thomas M. Burnett A. Kay H.H. Roman J.J. O'Brien T.J. Tian E. Cannon M.J. Shaughnessy Jr., J. Pecorelli S.

Cancer. 2006; 118: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), attesting to the biological relevance of this system to the development of human cervical cancer.To gain a broad view of the molecular changes that occur during keratinocyte transformation, we compared K, E, L, and BP cell gene expression using microarray analysis. We found that the number of expressed transcripts progressively decreased during the evolution from K to BP cells, implying a contraction in the number of active cellular pathways. Among the biological categories that were significantly contracted during the progression from K to BP cells, we identified a large group of pro- and antiapoptotic transcripts. Further bioinformatic and biochemical analysis of the extended apoptotic network, based on the recognition of hub proteins in each pathway, confirmed a substantial contraction of the pro- and antiapoptotic machinery. Nonetheless, L and BP cells were not resistant to apoptotic stimuli. On the contrary, L and BP cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to stress but showed a propensity to necrotic death, due to the absence of pro- and antiapoptotic avenues. Moreover, significant necrotic fractions were observed in the cervical cancer cell line HeLa in response to similar cisplatin (CDDP) concentrations. This study supports the hypothesis (8.Zeh III, H.J. Lotze M.T. J. Immunother. (1997). 2005; 28: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that the process of cancer transformation is accompanied by a shift from apoptosis to necrosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents were purchased as follows: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham/F-12, and antibiotics from Biological Industries Israel Beit Ha'emek Ltd.; fetal bovine serum from Invitrogen; epidermal growth factor from Peprotech Inc.; insulin, T3, transferrin, cholera toxin, and hydrocortisone from Sigma; and TGFβ1 from R&D Systems. Inhibitors were purchased as follows: QNZ and U0126 from Calbiochem, and LY294002 from A.G. Scientific.Cell Culture—Primary keratinocytes and HPV16-immortalized cells were maintained in keratinocyte growth medium, as described previously (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Primary K cells were cultured from small biopsy specimens. The HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes had been transfected with a plasmid carrying the genome of the human papillomavirus, HPV16 (4.Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Tsvieli R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Early passage (passage 20; E) represents cells that underwent about 50 doublings after transfection. Late passage (passage 270; L) represents cells that underwent about 1000 doublings. BP cells were derived from L cells, by benzo[a]pyrene treatment, as follows. L cells were treated with the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (5 μm) for 30 days to establish a clone able to form colonies in soft agar. The established clone was suspended in soft agar for 2 weeks, and selected colonies were grown and then further cultured in soft agar for additional selection (BP cells). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 μg/liter streptomycin.Western Blot Analysis—Primary keratinocytes and transformed cells were plated in 6-well plates at the following concentrations: K (5 × 105 cells/well), E (1.2 × 105 cells/well), L (105 cells/well), BP (105 cells/well), and HeLa (0.8 × 105 cells/well). Where indicated, medium was replaced 72 h later with medium containing CDDP (25 μm). For inhibition of the apoptotic regulatory pathways, medium was replaced 72 h after initial plating with medium containing QNZ (30 nm), LY294002 (20 μm), and U0126 (10 μm). 1.5 h later, CDDP was added to a final concentration of 25 μm, and cells were further incubated for the indicated length of time. Cells were then washed and lysed, as described previously (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For detection of HMGB1 release, medium from treated and untreated cells was collected and concentrated 40-fold using Amicon Ultrafree-MC filters. Sample buffer (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was added to the medium, such that the medium was effectively concentrated 10-fold.Western analysis was performed as described previously (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-Erk2, Smad4, and ICAD from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Erk (Thr183, Tyr185) from Sigma; HMGB1 from BD Biosciences; caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-9, and pGSK3 α/β from Cell Signaling Technology. Unless stated otherwise, each experiment was performed at least three times.Flow Cytometric Analysis Using Annexin V and PI—K (5 × 105 cells/well), E (2.2 × 105 cells/well), L, BP (2 × 105 cells/well), and HeLa (105 cells/well) were seeded in 60-mm wells. 48 h later, the medium was replaced with medium containing CDDP, as indicated, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. FACS analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the Vybrant apoptosis kit (Molecular Probes). Cells that were stained neither with annexin V nor with PI (annexin V-/PI-) were regarded as healthy. Cells that were stained with annexin V but not with PI (annexin V+/PI-) were considered to be in early apoptosis, and cells that were stained with both (annexin V+/PI+) were considered to be necrotic or late apoptotic. Cells that were stained with PI alone were necrotic. At least 10,000 cells for each sample were analyzed in each experiment. K and HF1 cells were analyzed several times in each of two variations. Samples were treated with CDDP at a fixed concentration (25 μm) and removed at various time points (0, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h); alternately, samples were treated with CDDP at various concentrations (0, 25, and 50 μm) for a fixed period of 24 h. HeLa cells were treated with CDDP at a fixed concentration (25 μm) and analyzed after 24 h.Preparation of Labeled cRNA and Hybridization to Gene Chips—Three independent cultures of K and HF1 cells were grown. RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed, amplified, and labeled as described. 8 μg of labeled cRNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A microarrays, according to the manufacturer's protocol.Data Processing and Analysis—The gene expression data were analyzed using the Microarray Suite version 5.0 algorithm (Affymetrix). For each probe, a CHP output file contained a signal quantitative metric, which represents the relative level of expression of a transcript and a “detection” classification of each signal as present, marginal, or absent. To compare data from different arrays, the signal of each array was scaled to the same target intensity value. Further gene analysis was performed as described in the supplemental material.Cell Transfections—K (5 × 105 cells/well), E (1 × 105 cells/well), L, and BP cells (8 × 104 cells/well) were seeded onto 6-well plates (Falcon). Cells were transfected 48 h later with 1 μg of DNA/well, as described previously (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed after 36 h.Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with the appropriate reporter plasmids. In order to correct for transfection efficiencies, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Renilla. After incubation for 36 h, cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared by lysis with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with a dual luciferase kit (Promega).The following constructs were used: 6AP-1 (9.Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A.

We isolated mRNA from three independent cultures each of K, E, L, and BP cells, grown under basal conditions. cDNA was prepared and hybridized to the human genome U133A array (Affymetrix). The overall picture shows that 1) there is a progressive divergence of later HF1 passages from K cells, and 2) the expression of more genes is reduced than induced, in the progressive passages (Fig. 1, A and B). Following paired t test analysis and using a cut-off of at least 2-fold change in the level of expression, 613 transcripts were induced in E (versus K), as compared with 906 repressed transcripts; 1424 transcripts were induced in L (versus K), as compared with 2597 repressed transcripts; and 2199 transcripts were induced in BP (versus K), as compared with 2902 repressed transcripts. The excess of repression versus induction becomes even more obvious as the cut-off is made more stringent (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that there is a contraction in the number of genes transcribed as the cells become progressively more transformed, but certain genes are expressed at higher levels.We compared our lists of genes with at least 2-fold changes in expression with the published data of Santin et al. (6.Santin A.D. Zhan F. Bignotti E. Siegel E.R. Cane S. Bellone S. Palmieri M. Anfossi S. Thomas M. Burnett A. Kay H.H. Roman J.J. O'Brien T.J. Tian E. Cannon M.J. Shaughnessy Jr., J. Pecorelli S.

More than half of the genes that were repressed or induced in cervical cancer according to Santin et al. (6.Santin A.D. Zhan F. Bignotti E. Siegel E.R. Cane S. Bellone S. Palmieri M. Anfossi S.

Virology. 2005; 331: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were also progressively repressed or induced in HF1 cells (Fig. 1C). The probability of obtaining an overlap of 56% between our data for BP cells and the data of Santin et al. (6.Santin A.D. Zhan F. Bignotti E. Siegel E.R. Cane S. Bellone S. Palmieri M. Anfossi S.

Similarly, 64% of the genes that were modified in cervical cancer according to Wong et al. (7.Wong Y.F. Cheung T.H. Tsao G.S. Lo K.W. Yim S.F. Wang V.W. Heung M.M. Chan S.C. Chan L.K. Ho T.W. Wong K.W. Li C. Guo Y. Chung T.K. Smith D.I. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were progressively modified in HF1 cells (see “Comparison of Overall Gene Expression in HF1 and Cervical Carcinoma” in the supplemental material). The probability of obtaining this overlap randomly in BP cells was calculated as explained in Fig. S2 and is 7.8 × 10-15. These two sets of results show a marked convergence of the HF1 passages with cervical cancer and strongly support the relevance of the in vitro cellular system described here to cervical cancer.Expression of Pro- and Antiapoptotic Genes Was Reduced during Transformation—In order to examine which biological processes were most affected by transformation, we used EASE software (11.Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to group the transcripts that were expressed at least 2-fold higher/lower in BP cells compared with K cells according to GO annotations. Biological categories that were significantly overrepresented, as defined by an EASE score of ≤0.05 and global false discovery rate = 0, are shown in Table S1 (supplemental data). Cell death was among the overrepresented biological categories with reduced gene expression (91 genes with reduced expression of 404 genes with this GO term on the chip; Table S1B) but was not among the overrepresented induced categories. Note that the EASE analysis yields biological categories with multiple overlaps (e.g. the down-regulated categories include cell death, regulation of apoptosis, negative regulation of apoptosis, and antiapoptosis; the up-regulated categories include cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle, M phase, and mitosis). Therefore, this analysis is useful for choosing biological processes of interest but cannot tell us how many cellular pathways were induced or repressed.Although we anticipated the decrease in expression of proapoptotic genes, we were intrigued by the finding that antiapoptotic genes (27 of 88 genes in this category on the microarray; Table S1B) were also significantly overrepresented among genes with reduced expression. We therefore decided to focus in this study on the apoptotic network and how its contraction affects cellular behavior in the absence and presence of exogenous stress. To do this, we analyzed the extended apoptotic network, including regulatory pathways acting well upstream to the caspase cascade (although these were not defined by EASE as apoptotic pathways), reasoning that changes in the upstream pathways would influence the death response.Reduced Expression of Major Pathways Controlling Apoptosis—The group of cell death genes with reduced expression in BP cells comprised 91 transcripts, including CASP3, CASP2, CASP6, CASP10, CASP1, BCL-X, BID, BCL2A1, DAPK1, and DAPK2 (Table S2). Most of the genes with reduced expression in L and BP cells showed a continuous decline in expression during the progression from K to BP cells, based on the microarray data. Several transcripts were induced slightly in E cells compared with K cells, but their expression decreased in L and BP cells.Among the repressed genes classified by EASE as involved in cell death, we noticed transcripts participating in the MAPK pathway, such as GADD45A, RASA1, SERPINB2, IL1A, and IL1B (Table S2), although the members of the MAPK cascade themselves were not classified as involved in cell death. Similarly, several NFκB-regulated genes, such as BCL2L1, CFLAR, and BCL2A1, were classified as involved in cell death, although their upstream regulators were not. These findings prompted us to examine signaling pathways acting upstream to the apoptotic machinery. In particular, we looked at the expression of hub proteins (namely, proteins with multiple interaction partners or those that determine the fate of a certain pathway) in these pathways, reasoning that decreased expression of the hub proteins would affect the entire pathway.In the extended analysis, we used GO and KEGG to identify members of the upstream pathways. Among genes with reduced expression, GO analysis identified 35 members of the NFκB pathway, although the pathway itself was not identified as overrepresented by GO analysis. Among the 35 down-regulated genes were key proteins like IKBKB, IKBKE, RIPK, and Myd88 (Table S3). 10 members of the NFκB pathway, as defined by GO, showed induced expression. Using KEGG to categorize transcripts that were significantly induced/repressed, only 23 genes participating in the MAPK pathway were induced in BP cells, compared with 56 MAPK genes that were repressed in this category. Another five MAPK members were identified by a literature search (Table S3). All five had reduced expression in L and BP cells. Using KEGG, 36 gene products that function in the TGFβ-Smad4 pathway were identified. Of these, the expression of 26 gene products (including Smad4, TGFBR1, TGFBR2; Table S3) was reduced, compared with 10 that were induced. In the JAK-STAT pathway, 28 genes were reduced in expression (including JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3; Table S4), compared with six that had increased expression. Moreover, we have shown in a parallel study that the antiapoptotic PKB pathway (12.Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar) is repressed in L and BP cells (5.Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, components of at least five major pathways controlling apoptosis showed strongly reduced expression in transformed L and BP cells.In order to validate the microarray data we investigated the biochemical status of the above mentioned pathways in K and HF1 cells, using Western blot and reporter assays, as follows. We first examined the substrates of the MAPK pathway, ERK, and AP-1. The involvement of ERK and AP-1 in both pro- and antiapoptotic processes has been well documented (12.Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 13.Kim Y.K. Kim H.J. Kwon C.H. Kim J.H. Woo J.S. Jung J.S. Kim J.M. J. Appl.

There was a gradual decrease in ERK phosphorylation from K through E, L, and BP (pERK; Fig. 2A). AP-1 transcriptional activity, as assessed by a reporter assay, also declined with progressive transformation (Fig. 2B). This finding was consistent with the decreased expression of genes known to be induced by AP-1 (18.Reddy S.P. Vuong H. Adiseshaiah P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2027126563,"Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) is one of the two major pathways of DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) repair. Mutations in human NHEJ genes can lead to immunodeficiency due to its role in V(D)J recombination in the immune system. In addition, most patients carrying mutations in NHEJ genes display developmental anomalies which are likely the result of a general defect in repair of endogenously induced DSBs such as those arising during normal DNA replication. Cernunnos/XLF is a recently identified NHEJ gene which is mutated in immunodeficiency with microcephaly patients. Here we aimed to investigate whether Cernunnos/XLF mutations disrupt the ability of patient cells to respond to replication stress conditions. Our results demonstrate that Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells and cells downregulated for Cernunnos/XLF have increased sensitivity to conditions which perturb DNA replication. In addition, under replication stress, these cells exhibit impaired DSB repair and increased accumulation of cells in G2/M. Moreover Cernunnos/XLF mutated and down regulated cells display greater chromosomal instability, particularly at fragile sites, under replication stress conditions. These results provide evidence for the role of Cernunnos/XLF in repair of DSBs and maintenance of genomic stability under replication stress conditions. This is the first study of a NHEJ syndrome showing association with impaired cellular response to replication stress conditions. These findings may be related to the clinical features in these patients which are not due to the V(D)J recombination defect. Additionally, in light of the emerging important role of replication stress in the early stages of cancer development, our findings may provide a mechanism for the role of NHEJ in preventing tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970047498,"Background Myocardial infarction (MI) due to coronary artery disease remains one of the leading causes of premature death. Replacement of infarcted heart tissue with regenerating myocardium from endogenous progenitor pools or exogenously introduced stem cells remains a therapeutic ideal. Their impracticality mainly lies in their low efficiency in cardiogenic differentiation (CD). Our recent studies with an acute MI animal model have already demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the MeOH extract of Geum japonicum (EGJ), providing clear evidence of myocardial regeneration. Methods and Findings The present study further isolated the active component contained in EGJ using bioassay-guided isolation and investigated its efficacy in the treatment of infarcted heart in animal MI models. We demonstrated that substantial repair of infarcted heart in animal MI models by EGJ can be mimicked by the isolated candidate compound (cardiogenin) in MI animal models. Clear evidence of newly regenerated endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived cardiomyocytes was observed throughout the infarct zone, accompanied by significantly improved functional performance of the heart. Transplantation of MSCs pretreated with EGJ or cardiogenin into a MI animal model also resulted in substantial regeneration of functional myocardium, implying that the activated MSCs carry all the necessary blueprints for myocardial regeneration. Signaling pathways specific to cell survival, CD identified in embryonic heart induction and angiogenesis were activated in both cardiogenin-treated MSCs and cardiogenin-induced regenerating myocardium. Conclusions This study has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of cardiogenin in infarcted heart repair, and identified the associated signalling pathways for effective cardiogenic differentiation of MSCs, cell survival and angiogenesis. These findings should enable new treatment strategies for MI to be developed immediately."
https://openalex.org/W2060625803,"During larval development in Drosophila melanogaster, transcriptional activation of target genes by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (dSREBP) is essential for survival. In all cases studied to date, activation of SREBPs requires sequential proteolysis of the membrane-bound precursor by site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). Cleavage by S2P, within the first membrane-spanning helix of SREBP, releases the transcription factor. In contrast to flies lacking dSREBP, flies lacking dS2P are viable. The Drosophila effector caspase Drice cleaves dSREBP, and cleavage requires an Asp residue at position 386, in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane stalk. The initiator caspase Dronc does not cleave dSREBP, but animals lacking dS2P require both drice and dronc to complete development. They do not require Dcp1, although this effector caspase also can cleave dSREBP in vitro. Cleavage of dSREBP by Drice releases the amino-terminal transcription factor domain of dSREBP to travel to the nucleus where it mediates the increased transcription of target genes needed for lipid synthesis and uptake. Drice-dependent activation of dSREBP explains why flies lacking dS2P are viable, and flies lacking dSREBP itself are not.

Genetic systems offer powerful tools for understanding the role of proteolysis in normal physiology. Studies of mutants lacking one or more proteases can reveal physiologically relevant details not accessible from biochemical approaches alone. One proteolytic signaling pathway that has yielded to the combination of genetics and biochemistry is the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 3The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; dSREBP, Drosophila SREBP; S1P, site-1 protease; S2P, site-2 protease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSV, herpes simplex virus; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference; AEL, after egg laying. pathway that plays a central role in the regulation of lipid metabolism (1Goldstein J.L.

Two membrane-spanning helices anchor the ∼120-kDa precursor form to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Its large amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains reside in the cytoplasm, whereas a short loop projects into the ER lumen. In the ER membrane, SREBP forms a complex with Scap, a polytopic membrane protein harboring a sterol sensing domain. When cellular demand for lipid rises, SREBP-Scap complexes exit the ER via COPII-coated vesicles and travel to the Golgi apparatus. Once there, SREBP is cleaved at two sites to release the soluble, active amino-terminal transcription factor domain. The site-1 protease (S1P) cuts within the luminal loop separating the two membrane-spanning helices. The membrane-bound amino-terminal fragment, which harbors the transcription factor domain, is the substrate for the site-2 protease (S2P). S2P cleaves SREBP within the first membrane-spanning helix, between Leu and Cys residues, and the intermediate form of SREBP accumulates only in the absence of cleavage by S2P (5Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster has a single SREBP gene, dSREBP (also called HLH-106 (6Theopold U. Ekengren S. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1195-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), as well as orthologues of S1P, S2P, and Scap (7Seegmiller A.C. Dobrosotskaya I. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Rawson R.B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells and in flies, transcriptional up-regulation of the genes of lipid metabolism by SREBP is essential for survival. Mammalian cells lacking S1P, S2P, or Scap cannot activate SREBP and do not survive unless their culture medium is supplemented with free cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids (1Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Similarly, Drosophila lacking dSREBP die at the end of second instar but can be rescued by supplementing their diet with the ultimate end products of dSREBP activation, fatty acids (8Kunte A.S. Matthews K.A. Rawson R.B. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unlike vertebrates, insects cannot synthesize cholesterol and therefore always have a requirement for sterols in their diet (9Clark A.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2578-2588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sang J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1956; 33: 45-72Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, in striking contrast to mammalian cells, for which loss of S2P is lethal, flies lacking dS2P survive rather well. In dS2P mutants, dSREBP continues to be activated. Thus, they exhibit a less severe deficit in the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism than larvae lacking dSREBP (8Kunte A.S. Matthews K.A. Rawson R.B. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Matthews K.A. Kunte A.S. Tambe-Ebot E. Rawson R.B. Genetics. 2009; 181: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This explains why they survive and larvae lacking dSREBP do not. In mammalian cells, SREBP can be cleaved also during apoptosis by caspases-3 and -7 (12Pai J.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Caspases nearly always cleave following an Asp residue. Caspase cleavage of mammalian SREBP occurs at a cytoplasmic site that lies in the juxtamembrane stalk between the DNA binding domain and the first membrane-spanning helix (14Wang X. Pai J.T. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The transcription factor domain released by caspase cleavage can activate a reporter gene under control of a synthetic SREBP target promoter (15Higgins M.E. Ioannou Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1939-1946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of cleavage of SREBPs during apoptosis is unknown. The genome of D. melanogaster encodes seven caspases as follows: damm (48C5), dcp1 (59E3), decay (89B18), dream (or strica, 42A8), dredd (1B12–13), drice (99C1), and dronc (or Nc, 67D2). Dronc, Dredd, and Dream are thought to be initiator (or apical) caspases that activate other caspases by cleaving them, whereas Damm, Dcp1, Decay, and Drice are effector (or executioner) caspases that cleave various target proteins. Here we combine biochemical and genetic techniques to investigate whether caspases are responsible for the activation of dSREBP in dS2P mutants. We find that two Drosophila effector caspases, Drice and Dcp1, can cleave dSREBP in vitro and in cultured Drosophila S2 cells undergoing apoptosis. Flies lacking dS2P and drice (but not dcp1) phenocopy loss of dSREBP itself, dying during the second larval instar. Importantly, this synthetic lethality is rescued by supplementing the culture medium with fatty acids, just as seen for dSREBP mutants. The initiator caspase Dronc, which activates Drice, is not able to cleave dSREBP in vitro but is also required by dS2P mutants. Thus Drice can cleave dSREBP and is necessary for its activation in the absence of dS2P. This activation enables the survival of dS2P mutants. Expression Plasmids-The plasmid Mtal-Grim, and plasmids harboring cDNAs of Dcp1, Drice, Dronc, Damm, Decay, Dream, and Dredd, were gifts from John Abrams (University of Texas Southwestern) and were used as a template to synthesize DNA fragments for RNAi synthesis. A genomic construct of dSREBP tagged at its amino terminus with enhanced YFP (Clontech) and also tagged with the HSV epitope was engineered such that tags are inserted in-frame at the unique AscI restriction site described (8Kunte A.S. Matthews K.A. Rawson R.B. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This construct, designated YFP-dSREBP, was originally designed for germ line transformation. It proved to be more efficiently expressed in S2 cells than versions tagged with HSV alone and was therefore chosen for many of the studies presented here. Site-directed mutagenesis using PCR and/or the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) was employed to construct desired mutations, and the mutagenesis was confirmed by multiple sequencing runs for each strand. Germ line transformation of Drosophila was performed by BESTGENE (Chino Hills, CA). Cell Culture-Transfection of S2 cells was performed as described (7Seegmiller A.C. Dobrosotskaya I. Goldstein J.L.

The assays were performed in caspase reaction buffer (0.15 ml of 25 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing 100 μg (protein) of membrane fractions and 200 nm caspase.

All crosses were set up using virgin females homozygous for dS2P and heterozygous for drice or dronc. These animals survived poorly on unsupplemented medium (see below). Thus, to collect a sufficient numbers of females, embryos from the heterozygous stocks were plated onto dishes containing 14:0 + 18:1 medium (semi-defined medium supplemented with 0.075% myristate and 0.15% oleate (w/v)). Third instar larvae homozygous for dS2P and heterozygous for drice or dronc were scored using the twist- and actin-GFP markers and transferred to vials containing regular/cornmeal/molasses agar medium. Adult females were collected as they emerged. Virgin dS2P2/dS2P2; driceΔ1 (or dronc51)/TM3, Ser, actin-GFP females were crossed to dS2P1/CyO, twist-GFP; driceΔ1 (or dronc51)/TM3, Ser, actin-GFP males. On day 0, embryos from an overnight collection were plated at 10 mg of embryos/dish onto duplicate 60-mm dishes containing semi-defined medium with no additions (“No Addition”) and 60-mm dishes containing 14:0 + 18:1 medium. Two days later, larvae from one “No Addition” and one “14:0 + 18:1” plate were separated from the food by floatation on a salt cushion and scored using the twist- and actin-GFP markers. On day 4, this procedure was repeated for the remaining two dishes. To calculate the percent expected, the observed ratio (calculated by dividing the number of larvae for each genotype by the expected total) was divided by the predicted Mendelian ratio. The total number of larvae expected was calculated based on the emergence of the doubly heterozygous mutants, which are expected to comprise 1/3 of the larvae because of embryonic lethality of animals homozygous for the third chromosome balancer. Thus, the expected total is (number of doubly heterozygous larvae/0.33). Rescue of dSREBP189 Lethality by Genomic dSREBP Transgenes-Independent insertions of P{dSREBPg(D386A)} on the second chromosome were recombined onto both dS2P1 and dS2P2 alleles and then crossed into a dSREBP189 background. Recombinants were genotyped by PCR analysis and sequencing of the P{dSREBPg(D386A)} transgene. Lines homozygous or heterozygous for the second chromosome were generated as follows: dS2P, P{dSREBPg(D386A)}/dS2P, P{dSREBPg(D386A)}; dSREBP189/TM6B, Tb Hu e and dS2P, P{dSREBPg(D386A)}/CyO, twist-GFP; dSREBP189/TM6B, Tb Hu e. Virgin dS2P2, P{dSREBPg(D386A)}/dS2P2, P{dSREBPg-(D386A)}; dSREBP189/TM6B, Tb Hu e females were crossed to dS2P1, P{dSREBPg(D386A)}/CyO, twist-GFP; dSREBP189/TM6B, Tb Hu e males. On day 0, embryos from an overnight collection were seeded into 10 vials (at 1 mg embryos/vial) containing regular/cornmeal/molasses agar (No Addition) and 10 vials containing regular/cornmeal/molasses agar supplemented with 0.075% myristate and 0.15% oleate. Emerging adults were scored using twist-GFP and Hu markers until no further adults emerged (approximately day 19 AEL). The data are presented as percent of the expected calculated as described above. Statistical Procedures-Data were analyzed using χ2 tests for independence and goodness of fit. The Sequential Bonferroni Correction of Holms was applied to pairwise comparisons. dSREBP Is Cleaved during Apoptosis in Drosophila S2 Cells-Mammalian SREBPs were among the first experimentally verified substrates for cleavage by caspases (14Wang X. Pai J.T. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify proteases other than dS1P and dS2P that can cleave dSREBP in dS2P– larvae, we first tested the hypothesis that dSREBP can be cleaved by Drosophila caspases. To increase caspase activity in Drosophila S2 cells, we induced apoptosis by expression of the apoptotic activator Grim under control of the inducible metallothionine promoter (21Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Following addition of copper sulfate (CuSO4), caspase activity in Grim-transfected cells increased dramatically as monitored by cleavage of the fluorescent substrate Ac-DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows a schematic of SREBP topology and the relationship of the various cleavage fragments. We cotransfected S2 cells with Grim and with tagged versions of dSREBP (YFP-dSREBP), either wild type or harboring specific mutations that block cleavage by dS1P and dS2P (7Seegmiller A.C. Dobrosotskaya I. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Rawson R.B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The YFP-dSREBP constructs show similar levels of the precursor form (“P”) in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 1–8). For dSREBP with wild type sequences at site-1 and site-2 (YFP-dSREBP WT), the nuclear form of dSREBP (“N”) is detected in both the absence and presence of CuSO4 (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). A novel, more rapidly migrating band (hereafter designated “fragment C”) also appears in the nuclear extract of the CuSO4-treated sample (lane 2) but not the untreated one (lane 1). Mutating the crucial Arg at position 486 in site-1 to Ala blocks cleavage by dS1P (7Seegmiller A.C. Dobrosotskaya I. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Rawson R.B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and no nuclear dSREBP is observed in the absence of CuSO4 (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 3). The smaller, novel fragment C appears when apoptosis is induced (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 4). Mutating an Asp-Pro motif within the first membrane-spanning helix of dSREBP blocks cleavage by dS2P but leaves cleavage at site-1 unaffected (7Seegmiller A.C. Dobrosotskaya I. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Rawson R.B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The intermediate form (“I”) of dSREBP is the product of dS1P cleavage and remains attached to the membrane because it retains a single membrane-spanning helix. The intermediate form appears in both the presence and absence of CuSO4 (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). The normal nuclear form is absent from the nuclear extract (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 5 and 6), but fragment C appears when apoptosis is induced (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 6). The same pattern holds true when both site-1 and -2 are mutated (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 7 and 8). These results parallel results using versions of dSREBP tagged with the HSV epitope alone (data not shown). Thus, dSREBP can be cleaved when caspase activity is up-regulated in S2 cells, and this cleavage does not require prior cleavage by dS1P or dS2P. Consistent with this finding, caspase cleavage of dSREBP during apoptosis is unaffected by treating S2 cells with palmitate and ethanolamine (data not shown), which suppresses cleavage of dSREBP by dS1P and dS2P (16Dobrosotskaya I.Y. Seegmiller A.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Science. 2002; 296: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). dSREBP Is Cleaved by Drice and Dcp1-To investigate further the role of caspases in the production of dSREBP fragment C, we performed RNAi experiments in Drosophila S2 cells targeting dronc, dredd, decay, drice, dream, damm, and dcp1 and determined whether fragment C still was produced upon induction of apoptosis (supplemental Fig. 1). When apoptosis was induced by expression of Grim, RNAi against Drice blocked the appearance of fragment C (supplemental Fig. 1, lane 7), whereas RNAi against Dcp1 partially reduced the accumulation of fragment C (supplemental Fig. 1, lane 10). We consistently observed the partial effect of RNAi against Dcp1 and the full effect of Drice RNAi. The evident effect of RNAi treatment against Drice and Dcp1 indicates that at least these two effector caspases can mediate cleavage of dSREBP during Grim-induced apoptosis in S2 cells. To test whether Drice and Dcp1 can cleave dSREBP directly, we prepared membrane fractions from S2 cells transfected with YFP-dSREBP and incubated these membranes in vitro with purified recombinant Drice or Dcp1 (Fig. 2). At 0 min, no caspase cleavage product is observed with either protease (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 5). Increasing accumulation of fragment C is observed over time (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4 and 6–8). No product is observed at 60 min in the absence of added protease (Fig. 2, lane 10). These data demonstrate that Drice and Dcp1 can cleave membrane-bound dSREBP in vitro. Dronc Does Not Cleave dSREBP-We also tested the ability of the initiator caspase Dronc to cleave dSREBP, using purified recombinant Dronc. These results are shown in Fig. 3. Incubation of membranes containing wild type dSREBP with either Drice or Dcp1 resulted in substantial accumulation of fragment C (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). No accumulation of fragment C was observed with purified Dronc (Fig. 3, lane 4). Dronc can cleave Ac-DEVD-amidotrifluoromethylcoumarin (22Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dorstyn L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When we introduced that cleavage site motif into the juxtamembrane region of dSREBP (383FTTDAGL was mutated to 383FTTDEVD), incubation with Dronc resulted in accumulation of fragment C (Fig. 3, lane 8), confirming that the enzyme had activity in this assay. With the mutant Dronc-cleavable substrate, accumulation of fragment C was blocked by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 3, lane 9). Recombinant Dronc can cleave a version of dSREBP containing a motif that Dronc has been shown to cleave but does not cleave wild type dSREBP. Thus, the effector caspases Drice and Dcp1 cleave dSREBP, but the initiator caspase Dronc does not. Cleavage of dSREBP by Caspases Requires an Asp Residue at Position 386-As their name indicates (24Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar), caspases have a decided preference for an Asp residue in the P1 position. Drice and Dcp1 have cleavage specificities similar to mammalian caspase 3, with the sequence DEVD reported to be optimal for cleavage by Drice in vitro (25Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows sequence alignment of the juxtamembrane stalk region (between the transcription factor domain and the first membrane-spanning helix) of SREBPs from each of the 12 SREBP sequences available from the genus Drosophila. There are four Asp residues within this region of dSREBP (Fig. 4A, black boxes), and these four are conserved among all species, save Drosophila willistoni. We note that many other attributes of the genome sequence of this species are also exceptional among the 12 species sequenced (26Clark A.G. Eisen M.B. Smith D.R. Bergman C.M. Oliver B. Markow T.A. Kaufman T.C. Kellis M. Gelbart W. Iyer V.N. Pollard D.A. Sackton T.B. Larracuente A.M. Singh N.D. Abad J.P. et al.Nature. 2007; 450: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 27Vicario S. Moriyama E.N. Powell J.R. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 226Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A multiple phylum alignment of this region is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. We individually mutated each of these Asp residues to Ala in the context of YFP-dSREBP, and we assessed the ability of each construct to be cleaved during apoptosis (Fig. 4B). The apoptosis-dependent fragment C appears with wild type dSREBP (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 12) and with Asp to Ala mutants at positions 395, 398, and 407 (lanes 6, 8 and 10). No fragment is observed when the Asp at 386 is mutated to Ala (Fig. 4B, lane 4). The dependence of cleavage on an Asp at 386 (but not on any other Asp residue in this region) indicates that cleavage during apoptosis occurs at the sequence 383FTTD↓A387 in dSREBP, where the down arrow indicates the scissile bond. Consistent with this conclusion, in transfected S2 cells, fragment C comigrates with a truncated version of dSREBP that has a stop codon in place of residue 387 (data not shown). This was somewhat surprising as Drice and Dcp1 are thought to prefer the sequence DXXD as is present at 395. We therefore further tested the requirement of Asp-386 for in vitro cleavage by Drice by incubating membrane fractions from S2 cells transfected with YFP-dSREBP, either wild type or harboring the D386A mutation (Fig. 5A). Accumulation of fragment C proceeded in a time-dependent fashion with the wild type substrate (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–6), but no fragment C was produced from the D386A mutant (lanes 7–10). In S2 cells, cleavage during apoptosis was also abolished when Asp-386 was substituted by Glu or Asn (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 8). The supplemental Fig. 3 shows that the threonine residue at position 385 is also required for cleavage (lanes 4 and 6). Even when a serine is introduced at this position, cleavage is abolished (supplemental Fig. 3, lane 4). This Thr residue is as well conserved among Drosophila as Asp-386, whereas residues in the P3 and P4 positions are not highly conserved (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this evolutionarily acceptable variation, we find that a T384A mutant is cleaved as readily as wild type (data not shown). Drice Is Required for the Survival of dS2P Mutant Larvae-In S2 cells and using purified enzyme in vitro, Drice and Dcp1 can cleave dSREBP, and cleavage is blocked by substituting Asp-386 with Ala. We hypothesized that this cleavage of dSREBP by caspases is responsible for the survival of flies lacking dS2P. To test this, we constructed stocks harboring null mutations both in dS2P as well as in one each of the two caspases that were shown to cleave dSREBP, using the alleles dcp1Prev1 and driceΔ1 (18Laundrie B. Peterson J.S. Baum J.S. Chang J.C. Fileppo D. Thompson S.R. McCall K. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1881-1888PubMed Google Scholar, 19Muro I. Berry D.L. Huh J.R. Chen C.H. Huang H. Yoo S.J. Guo M. Baehrecke E.H. Hay B.A. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 3305-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). If cleavage of dSREBP by one of these caspases were responsible for the survival of dS2P mutants, then flies lacking both that caspase and dS2P would be unable to activate dSREBP. The doubly mutant animals should evince the phenotype observed in flies completely lacking dSREBP (dSREBP189) and die at the end of second larval instar because of deficient transcription of dSREBP target genes. Importantly, if this “synthetic” lethality were indeed because of deficient dSREBP activation, then supplementing the larval diet with free fatty acids should afford substantial rescue of the dS2P, drice double mutants, just as seen for dSREBP mutants (8Kunte A.S. Matthews K.A. Rawson R.B. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Flies homozygous for dcp1Prev1 are viable (18Laundrie B. Peterson J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2095273487,"We evaluated gene transcription in canine skeletal muscle (biceps femoris) using microarray analysis to identify effects of age and diet on gene expression. Twelve female beagles were used (six 1-year olds and six 12-year olds) and they were fed one of two experimental diets for 12 months. One diet contained primarily plant-based protein sources (PPB), whereas the second diet contained primarily animal-based protein sources (APB). Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome Arrays were used to hybridize extracted RNA. Age had the greatest effect on gene transcription (262 differentially expressed genes), whereas the effect of diet was relatively small (22 differentially expressed genes). Effects of age (regardless of diet) were most notable on genes related to metabolism, cell cycle and cell development, and transcription function. All these genes were predominantly down-regulated in geriatric dogs. Age-affected genes that were differentially expressed on only one of two diets were primarily noted in the PPB diet group (144/165 genes). Again, genes related to cell cycle (22/35) and metabolism (15/19) had predominantly decreased transcription in geriatric dogs, but 6/8 genes related to muscle development had increased expression. Effects of diet on muscle gene expression were mostly noted in geriatric dogs, but no consistent patterns in transcription were observed. The insight these data provide into gene expression profiles of canine skeletal muscle as affected by age, could serve as a foundation for future research pertaining to age-related muscle diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2021713638,"Background There is extensive variation in gene expression among individuals within and between populations. Accurate measures of the variation in mRNA expression using microarrays can be confounded by technical variation, which includes variation in RNA isolation procedures, day of hybridization and methods used to amplify and dye label RNA for hybridization. Methodology/Principal Findings In this manuscript we analyze the relationship between the amount of mRNA and the fluorescent signal from the microarray hybridizations demonstrating that for a wide-range of mRNA concentrations the fluorescent signal is a linear function of the amount of mRNA. Additionally, the separate isolation, labeling or hybridization of RNA does not add significant amounts of variation in microarray measures of gene expression. However, single or double rounds of amplification for labeling do have small but significant affects on 10% of genes, but this source of technical variation is easy to avoid. To examine both technical and stochastic biological variation, mRNA expression was measured from the same five individuals over a six-week time course. Conclusion There were few, if any, meaningful differences in gene expression among time points. Thus, microarray measures using standard laboratory procedures can be precise and quantitative and are not subject to significant random biological noise."
https://openalex.org/W1980941153,"By removing herbivores and promoting increases in macroalgae, overfishing is thought to indirectly cause coral disease and mortality. We performed three field manipulations to test the general hypothesis that overfishing and the subsequent alteration of coral reef trophic dynamics are a cause of coral epizootics. Specifically, we asked whether the presence of macroalgae can influence within- and among-colony spread rates of Caribbean Yellow Band Disease in Montastraea faveolata. Macroalgae were placed next to infected and healthy, adult and small coral colonies to measure effects on disease spread rate, coral growth and coral survival. Surprisingly, the addition of macroalgae did not affect disease severity or coral fitness. Our results indicate that macroalgae have no effect on the severity and dynamics of Caribbean Yellow Band Disease and that fisheries management alone will not mitigate the effects of this important epizootic."
https://openalex.org/W2058045658,"Ethnicity can be a means by which people identify themselves and others. This type of identification mediates many kinds of social interactions and may reflect adaptations to a long history of group living in humans. Recent admixture in the US between groups from different continents, and the historically strong emphasis on phenotypic differences between members of these groups, presents an opportunity to examine the degree of concordance between estimates of group membership based on genetic markers and on visually-based estimates of facial features. We first measured the degree of Native American, European, African and East Asian genetic admixture in a sample of 14 self-identified Hispanic individuals, chosen to cover a broad range of Native American and European genetic admixture proportions. We showed frontal and side-view photographs of the 14 individuals to 241 subjects living in New Mexico, and asked them to estimate the degree of NA admixture for each individual. We assess the overall concordance for each observer based on an aggregated measure of the difference between the observer and the genetic estimates. We find that observers reach a significantly higher degree of concordance than expected by chance, and that the degree of concordance as well as the direction of the discrepancy in estimates differs based on the ethnicity of the observer, but not on the observers' age or sex. This study highlights the potentially high degree of discordance between physical appearance and genetic measures of ethnicity, as well as how perceptions of ethnic affiliation are context-specific. We compare our findings to those of previous studies and discuss their implications."
https://openalex.org/W1994143765,"FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) is a powerful technique that detects and localises specific DNA sequences on metaphase chromosomes, interphase nuclei or chromatin fibres. When coupled to BrdU (5-Bromo 2-deoxy-uridine) labeling of newly replicated DNA, the replication properties of different DNA sequences can be analysed. However, the technique for the detection of BrdU incorporation is time consuming, and relies on acidic pH buffer treatments, that prevent use of pH sensitive fluorochromes such as FITC (Fluoro-isothiocianate) during FISH. In this work, we describe a simplified protocol that allows the simultaneous detection of FISH signals and BrdU incorporation. Since the technique does not involve paraformaldehyde for cell fixation, or formamide for denaturation of the target DNA and in post-hybridisation washes, it represents a safer alternative to classical FISH techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1990025887,"In a previous research, we have described and documented self-assembly of geometric triangular chiral hexagon crystal-like complex organizations (GTCHC) in human pathological tissues. This article documents and gathers insights into the magnetic field in cancer tissues and also how it generates an invariant functional geometric attractor constituted for collider partners in their entangled environment. The need to identify this hierarquic attractor was born out of the concern to understand how the vascular net of these complexes are organized, and to determine if the spiral vascular subpatterns observed adjacent to GTCHC complexes and their assembly are interrelational. The study focuses on cancer tissues and all the macroscopic and microscopic material in which GTCHC complexes are identified, which have been overlooked so far, and are rigorously revised. This revision follows the same parameters that were established in the initial phase of the investigation, but with a new item: the visualization and documentation of external dorsal serous vascular bed areas in spatial correlation with the localization of GTCHC complexes inside the tumors. Following the standard of the electro-optical collision model, we were able to reproduce and replicate collider patterns, that is, pairs of left and right hand spin-spiraled subpatterns, associated with the orientation of the spinning process that can be an expansion or contraction disposition of light particles. Agreement between this model and tumor data is surprisingly close; electromagnetic spiral patterns generated were identical at the spiral vascular arrangement in connection with GTCHC complexes in malignant tumors. These findings suggest that the framework of collagen type 1 – vasoactive vessels that structure geometric attractors in cancer tissues with invariant morphology sets generate collider partners in their magnetic domain with opposite biological behavior. If these principles are incorporated into nanomaterial, biomedical devices, and engineered tissues, new therapeutic strategies could be developed for cancer treatment."
