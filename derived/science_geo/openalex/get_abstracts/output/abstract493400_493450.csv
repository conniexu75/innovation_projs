https://openalex.org/W2051438014,"Systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits in the brain will require the development of whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution. To this end, we performed comprehensive chemical screening to develop a whole-brain clearing and imaging method, termed CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain imaging cocktails and computational analysis). CUBIC is a simple and efficient method involving the immersion of brain samples in chemical mixtures containing aminoalcohols, which enables rapid whole-brain imaging with single-photon excitation microscopy. CUBIC is applicable to multicolor imaging of fluorescent proteins or immunostained samples in adult brains and is scalable from a primate brain to subcellular structures. We also developed a whole-brain cell-nuclear counterstaining protocol and a computational image analysis pipeline that, together with CUBIC reagents, enable the visualization and quantification of neural activities induced by environmental stimulation. CUBIC enables time-course expression profiling of whole adult brains with single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2141049972,"Changing Assemblages Although the rate of species extinction has increased markedly as a result of human activity across the biosphere, conservation has focused on endangered species rather than on shifts in assemblages. Dornelas et al. (p. 296 ; see the Perspective by Pandolfi and Lovelock ), using an extensive set of biodiversity time series of species occurrences in both marine and terrestrial habitats from the past 150 years, find species turnover above expected but do not find evidence of systematic biodiversity loss. This result could be caused by homogenization of species assemblages by invasive species, shifting distributions induced by climate change, and asynchronous change across the planet. All of which indicates that it is time to review conservation priorities."

Wang et al. (p. 310 ) identify a lncRNA expressed exclusively in human dendritic cells (DC), called lnc-DC, that is required for optimal DC differentiation from human monocytes and that regulates DC activation of T cells. Lnc-DC interacts with the transcription factor STAT3, which is also required for DC development and function, to prevent interaction with and to block dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatase SHP1."
https://openalex.org/W2067765323,"Thin and Selective Outpourings When using a membrane to separate materials, the efficiency of the separation is limited by how fast the gas or liquid passes through the membrane and by how selective it is. Thinner membranes usually allow for faster flow rates but are usually less selective. Attempting to maintain selectivity, Celebi et al. (p. 289 ) developed a sophisticated way to drill holes of controlled diameter in a graphene sheet about two layers thick. For such a thin membrane, the primary barriers to separation come from entrance and exit from the holes and not from the motion through the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1967076681,"Brain endothelial cells form a paracellular and transcellular barrier to many blood-borne solutes via tight junctions (TJs) and scarce endocytotic vesicles. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in the healthy and diseased CNS. BBB damage after ischemic stroke contributes to increased mortality, yet the contributions of paracellular and transcellular mechanisms to this process in vivo are unknown. We have created a transgenic mouse strain whose endothelial TJs are labeled with eGFP and have imaged dynamic TJ changes and fluorescent tracer leakage across the BBB in vivo, using two-photon microscopy in the t-MCAO stroke model. Although barrier function is impaired as early as 6 hr after stroke, TJs display profound structural defects only after 2 days. Conversely, the number of endothelial caveolae and transcytosis rate increase as early as 6 hr after stroke. Therefore, stepwise impairment of transcellular followed by paracellular barrier mechanisms accounts for the BBB deficits in stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2091603506,"Patchy Insulation Myelin insulates neuronal axons such that their electrical signals travel faster and more efficiently. However, not all axons are myelinated equally. Tomassy et al. (p. 319 ; see the Perspective by Fields ) obtained detailed images from two snippets of the adult mouse brain and generated three-dimensional reconstructions of individual neurons and their myelination patterns. The images show that some axons have long, unmyelinated stretches, which might offer sites for building new connections. Thus, myelination is not an all-or-none phenomenon but rather is a characteristic of what may be a specific dialogue between the neuron and the surrounding myelin-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058867280,"Resilient Hyperpolarization Despite constant exposure to all sorts of stressors, most people are resilient and do not develop depression, but we do not understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of stress resilience. Friedman et al. (p. 313 ) studied this phenomenon in a mouse model of social-defeat stress depression. In the mice they found that, despite apparently pathological levels of hyperpolarization and elevated potassium channel currents in the ventral tegmental area (a structure known to be involved in depression), resilient mice showed normal activity in dopaminergic neurons. Thus, if “depressed” mice were experimentally provoked into hyperpolarization—unexpectedly, they completely reversed depression-related behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W1981932072,"Universal Immune Function Certain pathogen effectors are detected in plants by cytoplasmic receptors. First solving the crystal structures of Arabidopsis receptors, Williams et al. (p. 299 ; see the Perspective by Nishimura and Dangl ) discovered that in the resting state, the structures form a heterodimer that readies the complex for effector binding and keeps the signaling domains from firing too early. Once the pathogen effector binds, the structure of the complex shifts such that the signaling domains can form a homodimer to initiate downstream signaling. Similarities between these plant-pathogen receptors and Toll-like receptors in animals suggest the molecular mechanisms may translate broadly."
https://openalex.org/W1994837626,"How Tight? In metazoans, sheets of epithelial cells separate different tissue spaces and control their composition. Tight junctions are cell-cell adhesion structures in these cell sheets that form a seal between cells but also provide some selective permeability to ions and small molecules. Claudins are the main constituents of tight junctions, and mutations in claudins cause inherited human disorders involving the disruption of ionic balance. Suzuki et al. (p. 304 ) report the structure of mouse claudin-15 at 2.4 angstrom resolution, which shows an extracellular β-sheet domain anchored to a transmembrane four-helix bundle. The electrostatic distribution on the claudin surface reveals a negatively charged groove in the extracellular domain that may provide a pathway for positive ions."

https://openalex.org/W2140059679,"Strained Superconductor Distorting a material and observing its response can allow insight into its electronic properties. Thin films can be strained by placing them on a substrate with a different lattice constant; bulk samples present more of a challenge. Hicks et al. (p. 283 ) designed an apparatus to apply both tensile and compressive strain and used it to study the properties of the superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 , which has long been hypothesized to host the unusual p-wave superconductivity. The response of the superconducting transition temperature T c to the applied strain depended on the direction in which the strain was applied, and did not exhibit a cusp predicted to occur around zero strain. As the technique leaves a surface of the probe open to external probes, it could be adopted for a wide range of methods."
https://openalex.org/W2018869169,"Starry Brightness The high photometric precision of NASA's Kepler observatory has enabled the detection of many planets because they cause slight dimming of their host stars as they orbit in front of them. From these data, Quintana et al. (p. 277 ) have spotted a five-planet system around a small star. Here, the outermost planet is only 10% larger than Earth and completes its 130-day orbit entirely within the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on its surface. Similarly, Kepler can detect faint periodic brightenings, as Kruse and Agol (p. 275 ) have reported for the binary system KOI-3278. In this system, a white dwarf acts as a gravitational microlens when it passes in front of its Sun-like G-star companion every 88 days. The lensing effect allows the mass of the white dwarf to be estimated, which helps us to understand how similar binary systems may have evolved."

The sense of touch is indispensable for environmental exploration, social interaction, tactile discrimination, and other tasks in life. Much of what we know about the transduction and encoding of touch stimuli is from the study of invertebrates’ simple touch-sensing nerves (Chalfie and Au, 1989Chalfie M. Au M.

In contrast to invertebrates, mammals have developed complicated tactile end organs in the skin including Merkel discs, Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner’s corpuscles, and Ruffini endings (Johnson, 2001Johnson K.O. The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). These tactile end organs sense a wide range of touch stimuli to generate sensory impulses that enable tactile tasks including the most sophisticated one, tactile discrimination. Merkel discs, also known as Merkel-cell-neurite complexes, are formations of Merkel cells and Aβ-afferent nerve endings in synapse-like structures (Iggo and Muir, 1969Iggo A. Muir A.R.

They are highly abundant in fingertips of humans, whisker hair follicles of nonhuman mammals (Hashimoto, 1972Hashimoto K. The ultrastructure of the skin of human embryos. X.

Tactile stimuli to Merkel discs in the skin elicit slowly adapting type I responses (SAI) in Aβ-afferent fibers (Iggo and Muir, 1969Iggo A. Muir A.R.

Flanagan J.R. Coding and use of tactile signals from the fingertips in object manipulation tasks.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). This tactile-induced SAI response allows fingertips of humans and whiskers of nonhuman mammals to perform tactile discrimination of an object’s shape, curvature, texture, and other physical properties (Carvell and Simons, 1990Carvell G.E.

The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, touch sensation can be either reduced to cause numbness or exaggerated to result in tactile allodynia. Although Merkel cells were discovered 139 years ago (Merkel, 1875Merkel F. Tastzellen and Tastkoerperchen bei den Hausthieren und beim Menschen.Arch Mikrosc Anat. 1875; 11: 636-652Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar), cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tactile transduction in Merkel discs remain unclear after over a century of studies (Halata et al., 2003Halata Z. Grim M. Bauman K.I. Friedrich Sigmund Merkel and his “Merkel cell”, morphology, development, and physiology: review and new results.Anat. Rec. A Discov. Mol. Cell. Evol. Biol. 2003; 271: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is also unknown how tactile transduction is further encoded in Merkel discs and how the SAI response in Aβ-afferent endings is generated. Deletion of Merkel cells from animals chemically (Ikeda et al., 1994Ikeda I. Yamashita Y. Ono T. Ogawa H.

Merkel cells are essential for light-touch responses.Science. 2009; 324: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) results in the loss of SAI response to light touch. However, Merkel cells have not been shown to have any tactile sensitivity in previous studies (Yamashita et al., 1992Yamashita Y. Akaike N. Wakamori M. Ikeda I. Ogawa H. Voltage-dependent currents in isolated single Merkel cells of rats.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In fact, Merkel cells have been believed to be merely supportive tissues for nerve endings’ functions (Gottschaldt and Vahle-Hinz, 1981Gottschaldt K.M. Vahle-Hinz C. Merkel cell receptors: structure and transducer function.Science. 1981; 214: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms underlying the transduction of touch by tactile end organs are also largely unknown in mammals, while molecules that transduce touch have been identified in sensory neurons of some invertebrates. In Caenorhabditis elegans, DEG/ENaC channels transduce touch stimuli to excite touch-sensing neurons (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991Driscoll M. Chalfie M. The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration.Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, Huang and Chalfie, 1994Huang M. Chalfie M. Gene interactions affecting mechanosensory transduction in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Mammalian homologs to C. elegans DEG/ENaC channels are expressed in mammalian sensory neurons (Fricke et al., 2000Fricke B. Lints R. Stewart G. Drummond H. Dodt G. Driscoll M. von Düring M. Epithelial Na+ channels and stomatin are expressed in rat trigeminal mechanosensory neurons.Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 299: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar, Price et al., 2000Price M.P. Lewin G.R.

Drummond H.A. et al.The mammalian sodium channel BNC1 is required for normal touch sensation.Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), but deletion of these channels in mice either does not result in touch defects (Drew et al., 2004Drew L.J. Rohrer D.K. Price M.P. Blaver K.E. Cockayne D.A. Cesare P. Wood J.N. Acid-sensing ion channels ASIC2 and ASIC3 do not contribute to mechanically activated currents in mammalian sensory neurones.J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 691-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or produces only modest defects (Price et al., 2000Price M.P. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. et al.The mammalian sodium channel BNC1 is required for normal touch sensation.Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In Drosophila larvae, No mechanoreceptor potential C (NOMPC) channels have been shown to be touch transducers and their activation by light touch directly excites Drosophila mechanosensory neurons (Yan et al., 2013Yan Z. Zhang W. He Y. Gorczyca D. Xiang Y. Cheng L.E. Meltzer S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Drosophila NOMPC is a mechanotransduction channel subunit for gentle-touch sensation.Nature. 2013; 493: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Piezo ion channels (Piezo1 and Piezo2) have recently been identified as mechanically activated ion channels (MA) and are expressed in several mammalian tissues (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Piezo2 channels are expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and have been shown to be involved in mechanotransduction (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, Eijkelkamp et al., 2013Eijkelkamp N.

Runx1 controls terminal morphology and mechanosensitivity of VGLUT3-expressing C-mechanoreceptors.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, studies thus far have not identified whether Piezo2 or any other molecule is used by a tactile end organ for sensing tactile stimuli in mammals. In the present study, we set out to answer the questions of whether tactile stimuli are transduced by Merkel cells or by Aβ-afferent endings in Merkel discs, what molecules are involved in the tactile transduction in Merkel discs, and how tactile stimuli are encoded by Merkel discs to drive SAI impulses in Aβ-afferent endings. Patch-clamp recording is the most direct way to detect and study mechanotransduction in a cell, but it is technically challenging to apply this technique to intact cells of any tactile end organ due to tissue barriers. In previous studies, dissociated Merkel cells were patch-clamp recorded but they did not respond to mechanical stimuli (Yamashita et al., 1992Yamashita Y. Akaike N. Wakamori M. Ikeda I. Ogawa H. Voltage-dependent currents in isolated single Merkel cells of rats.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An isolated rat whisker hair follicle preparation was developed for extracellular recordings from whisker afferent bundles but patch-clamp recording has never been performed on Merkel cells in this preparation due to tissue barriers (Baumann et al., 1996Baumann K.I. Chan E. Halata Z. Senok S.S. Yung W.H. An isolated rat vibrissal preparation with stable responses of slowly adapting mechanoreceptors.Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 213: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Merkel cells in whisker hair follicles are covered by layers of tough tissues including the follicle capsule, ring sinus tissues, and glassy membranes (Figure 1A). We performed microprocedures to remove these tissues so that the Merkel cell layer was on the surface of the preparation (Figures 1B and 1C). Merkel cells in our preparation had elongated cell bodies and antenna-like processes (Figures 1C and 1D) similar to their original shapes before removing the tissue barriers. For patch-clamp recordings on Merkel cells, we preidentified Merkel cells by vital staining with quinacrine (Figure 1C), a fluorescent marker for Merkel cells (Crowe and Whitear, 1978Crowe R. Whitear M. Quinacrine fluorescence of Merkel cells in Xenopus laevis.Cell Tissue Res. 1978; 190: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first striking finding was that Merkel cells in situ fired multiple action potentials (APs) when they were injected with small depolarizing currents (Figure 1E, 48/48 cells). APs in Merkel cells significantly increased intracellular Ca2+ in Merkel cells (Figures 1D and 1F). Our finding that Merkel cells in situ fire multiple APs was surprising since cells in the skin have been believed to be not excitable. A previous study observed a single abortive potential in dissociated Merkel cells (Yamashita et al., 1992Yamashita Y. Akaike N. Wakamori M. Ikeda I. Ogawa H. Voltage-dependent currents in isolated single Merkel cells of rats.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to Merkel cells in situ, non-Merkel cells (quinacrine-negative cells) in whisker hair follicles never fired APs (Figure 1I). Other membrane properties also indicated that Merkel cells are excitable cells (Table S1, available online, Figure 1H). The V-I relationship of Merkel cells (Figure 1H) was strongly rectifying and showed a steep current-potential relationship near resting membrane potentials (∼−60 mV), and a depolarizing current as small as 20 pA could lead to over 40 mV membrane depolarization from resting membrane potentials. This strong membrane response occurred because Merkel cells had extremely high membrane input resistance (over 2 GΩ, Table S1). Under voltage-clamp mode, Merkel cells showed strong voltage-activated outward currents with two kinetic components (Figures S1A–S1C). In contrast, the V-I relationship was nearly linear for non-Merkel cells (Figures 1I and 1J). Voltage-gated Na+ channels drive AP firing in most excitable cells including afferent nerve endings. Interestingly, AP firing in Merkel cells was not affected by tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker (Figure 2A). However, the AP firing was abolished under a low extracellular Ca2+ condition (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the AP firing was abolished by cadmium (Cd2+), a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) blocker (Figure 2C). The AP firing was also abolished by felodipine, a highly selective blocker of L-type VGCCs (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the AP firing in Merkel cells in situ is driven by Ca2+ influx through VGCCs. Voltage-clamp recordings showed that Cd2+-sensitive VGCC currents were expressed in Merkel cells (Figures S1D–S1G), consistent with the presence of VGCCs such as L- and P/Q-types shown in dissociated Merkel cells (Haeberle et al., 2004Haeberle H. Fujiwara M. Chuang J. Medina M.M. Panditrao M.V. Bechstedt S. Howard J. Lumpkin E.A. Molecular profiling reveals synaptic release machinery in Merkel cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Yamashita et al., 1992Yamashita Y. Akaike N. Wakamori M. Ikeda I. Ogawa H. Voltage-dependent currents in isolated single Merkel cells of rats.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The VGCC currents in Merkel cells in situ were also sensitive to the block by felodipine (Figures S1H–S1K). When Merkel cells were depolarized over a prolonged period, the Ca2+-AP firing was long-lasting, irregular, and adapted slowly (Figures 2E–2H). Thus, in a Merkel disc, the Merkel cell is an excitable element with the ability to fire Ca2+-APs in a slowly adapting manner. To test if Merkel cells in situ transduce mechanical stimuli, we displaced the Merkel cell layer with a piezo-driven probe at sites distant from the recorded Merkel cells. In this way, the mechanical impact was transmitted across adjacent cells to the recorded Merkel cells (Figures 3A–3C). This indirect stimulation, which was used to mimic naturally occurring touch stimuli, evoked MA currents in Merkel cells (273/273 cells). In a sample of 28 Merkel cells, the mechanotransduction threshold, i.e., the mechanical displacement that just elicited a detectable MA current, was 0.66 ± 0.05 μm, and the peak amplitude of the current increased with greater displacement distances (Figures 3D and 3F). Similar to indirect stimulation, directly displacing Merkel cell membranes also evoked MA currents (Figures 3E and 3F) with a mechanotransduction threshold of 0.61 ± 0.07 μm. MA currents adapted rapidly, but a small steady-state current component (Figures 3D, 3E, S2A, and S2B) with enhanced channel conduction noise (Figure S2A) could be observed. The amplitude of the steady-state current component increased in a displacement-dependent manner and was 16.4 ± 1.8 pA (6.2 to 35.0 pA, n = 25) with 4 μm displacement (Figure S2B). Merkel cells in situ may be necessary for demonstrating the mechanotransduction by Merkel cells since previous studies using dissociated Merkel cells failed to elicit MA currents (Yamashita et al., 1992Yamashita Y. Akaike N. Wakamori M. Ikeda I. Ogawa H. Voltage-dependent currents in isolated single Merkel cells of rats.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Mechanotransduction in Merkel cells featured fast kinetic MA currents (Figure 3G). The latency of mechanotransduction had an inverse relationship with the displacement distance (Figure 3H). At a displacement of 3.5 μm, the mechanotransduction latency was 0.96 ± 0.06 ms with indirect stimulation and 0.51 ± 0.03 ms with direct displacement of Merkel cell membranes (Figure 3H). The short latency of mechanotransduction suggests a direct mechanical gating. MA currents rose faster with increasing displacement distances (Figure 3I). The currents decayed monoexponentially with time constant of ∼6 ms (Figure 3J), almost identical to the decay kinetics of recently cloned Piezo2 channels (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). We determined Merkel cell MA channel ion permeability by measuring the MA current reversal potentials under different ionic conditions (Figures 3K–3N). I-V relationships of MA currents under normal recording conditions (Figure 3K), extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular Cs+ only ([Ca2+]out/[Cs+]in) (Figure 3L), [Na+]out/[Cs+]in and [Na+]out/[K+]in conditions (Figure 3M) all yielded reversal potentials near 0 mV. Calculated ion permeability ratios showed that MA channels in Merkel cells are almost equally permeable to Na+, K+, Cs+, and Ca2+ (Figure 3N). Thus, Merkel cell MA channels are Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels. We harvested Merkel cells (quinacrine-stained cells) and non-Merkel cells (quinacrine-negative cells) separately by aspirating individual cells into electrode pipettes and then examined Piezo2 mRNA expression in them. Piezo2 mRNA was detected in Merkel cells but not in non-Merkel cells (Figure 4A). We conducted pharmacological tests on MA currents in Merkel cells in situ. Merkel cell MA currents were inhibited by gadolinium (Gd3+) (Figure 4B) and ruthenium red (RR) (Figure 4C), two compounds that blocked Piezo2 channels in heterologous expression systems (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition by the two blockers on Merkel cell MA currents (Figures 4B and 4C) was comparable to their inhibition of Piezo2-mediated currents in heterologous expression systems (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). We tested Merkel cell MA currents with an antibody against an intracellular segment of Piezo2 (Piezo2Ab). Merkel cell MA currents were significantly reduced by the intracellular application of the Piezo2Ab when compared with a control group without Piezo2Ab (Figures 4D and 4E). The inhibition by Piezo2Ab was abolished in the presence of a blocking peptide for the antibody (Piezo2Ab+BP, Figures 4D and 4E) and was also abolished when the antibody was thermally inactivated (Figure S3B). The inhibition by Piezo2Ab was also evidenced with normalized currents, which showed the reduction of MA currents 10 min after establishing the whole-cell mode when the Piezo2Ab was present in the internal recording solution (Figures S3A and S3B). Similar to Merkel cell MA currents, the rapidly adapting MA currents (McCarter et al., 1999McCarter G.C. Reichling D.B. Levine J.D. Mechanical transduction by rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro.Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 273: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) mediated by Piezo2 in DRG neurons (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar) were inhibited by the intracellular application of Piezo2Ab (Figures S3C and S3D). On the other hand, MA currents evoked from N2A cells, which were known to be mediated by Piezo1 channels (Coste et al., 2010Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), were not significantly affected by the Piezo2Ab (Figures S3E and S3F). Voltage-activated currents and AP firing in Merkel cells were also not significantly affected by the Piezo2Ab (Figures S3G–S3J).Figure S3MA Currents in Merkel Cells and Cultured DRG Neurons Are Similarly Inhibited by a Piezo2 Antibody, but the Piezo2 Antibody Has No Effect on MA Currents in N2A Cells and Does Not Affect Electrophysiological Properties of Merkel Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Sample traces of MA currents recorded from 3 Merkel cells with normal electrode internal solution without Piezo2 antibody (no Piezo2Ab, left), internal solution that contained a Piezo2 antibody (Piezo2Ab, middle), or the Piezo2Ab plus its blocking peptide (Piezo2Ab+BP, right).

However, successful SCNT with human cells has proved challenging to achieve, and thus far has only been reported with fetal or infant somatic cells. In this study, we describe the application of a recently developed methodology for the generation of human ESCs via SCNT using dermal fibroblasts from 35- and 75-year-old males. Our study therefore demonstrates the applicability of SCNT for adult human cells and supports further investigation of SCNT as a strategy for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2067251833,"Most animals sleep more early in life than in adulthood, but the function of early sleep is not known. Using Drosophila, we found that increased sleep in young flies was associated with an elevated arousal threshold and resistance to sleep deprivation. Excess sleep results from decreased inhibition of a sleep-promoting region by a specific dopaminergic circuit. Experimental hyperactivation of this circuit in young flies results in sleep loss and lasting deficits in adult courtship behaviors. These deficits are accompanied by impaired development of a single olfactory glomerulus, VA1v, which normally displays extensive sleep-dependent growth after eclosion. Our results demonstrate that sleep promotes normal brain development that gives rise to an adult behavior critical for species propagation and suggest that rapidly growing regions of the brain are most susceptible to sleep perturbations early in life."
https://openalex.org/W2084897789,"On a Zeppelin Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important atmospheric trace gas that acts as a precursor of tropospheric hydroxyl-radicals (OH), which is responsible for the self-cleansing capacity of the atmosphere and which also controls the concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as methane and ozone. How HONO is made is a mystery. Flying onboard a Zeppelin over the Po Valley in Northern Italy, Li et al. (p. 292 ) discovered HONO in the undisturbed morning troposphere, indicating that HONO must be produced there, rather than mixed from the surface. The high HONO concentrations are likely to have been formed by a light-dependent gas-phase source that probably consumed OH or HO2 radicals, which hints that the impact of HONO on the abundance of OH in the entire troposphere may be substantially overestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2096338009,"Dysfunctions in Wnt signaling increase β-catenin stability and are associated with cancers, including colorectal cancer. In addition, β-catenin degradation is decreased by nutrient-dependent O-GlcNAcylation. Human colon tumors and colons from mice fed high-carbohydrate diets exhibited higher amounts of β-catenin and O-GlcNAc relative to healthy tissues and mice fed a standard diet, respectively. Administration of the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor thiamet G to mice also increased colonic expression of β-catenin. By ETD-MS/MS, we identified 4 O-GlcNAcylation sites at the N terminus of β-catenin (S23/T40/T41/T112). Furthermore, mutation of serine and threonine residues within the D box of β-catenin reduced O-GlcNAcylation by 75%. Interestingly, elevating O-GlcNAcylation in human colon cell lines drastically reduced phosphorylation at T41, a key residue of the D box responsible for β-catenin stability. Analyses of β-catenin O-GlcNAcylation mutants reinforced T41 as the most crucial residue that controls the β-catenin degradation rate. Finally, inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation decreased the β-catenin/α-catenin interaction necessary for mucosa integrity, whereas O-GlcNAcase silencing improved this interaction. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation regulates not only the stability of β-catenin, but also affects its localization at the level of adherens junctions. Accordingly, we propose that O-GlcNAcylation of β-catenin is a missing link between the glucose metabolism deregulation observed in metabolic disorders and the development of cancer.—Olivier-Van Stichelen, S., Dehennaut, V., Buzy, A., Zachayus, J.-L., Guinez, C., Mir, A-M., El Yazidi-Belkoura, I., Copin, M.-C., Boureme, D., Loyaux, D., Ferrara, P., Lefebvre, T.

https://openalex.org/W2103365844,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor that displays estrogenic activity. Several reports suggest that BPA may have estrogen receptor-independent effects. In zebrafish, 50 μM BPA exposure induces otic vesicle abnormalities, including otolith aggregation. The purpose of this study was to test if BPA action was mediated in vivo during zebrafish development by the orphan nuclear estrogen related receptor (ERR) γ. Combining pharmacological and functional approaches, we demonstrate that the zebrafish ERRγ mediates BPA-induced malformations in otoliths. Using different bisphenol derivatives, we show that different compounds can induce a similar otolith phenotype than BPA and that the binding affinity of these derivatives to the zebrafish ERRγ correlates with their ability to induce otolith malformations. Morpholino knockdown of ERRγ function suppresses the BPA effect on otoliths whereas overexpression of ERRγ led to a BPA-like otolith phenotype. Moreover, a subphenotypical dose of BPA (1 μM) combined with ERRγ overexpression led to a full-dose (50 μM) BPA otolith phenotype. We therefore conclude that ERRγ mediates the otic vesicle phenotype generated by BPA. Our results suggest that the range of pathways perturbed by this compound and its potential harmful effect are larger than expected.—Tohmé, M., Prud'homme, S.

This study uses fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to acquire resting state scans in 12 interictal migraine patients and 12 healthy matched controls. Hypothalamic connectivity seeds were anatomically defined based on high-resolution structural scans, and FC was assessed in the resting state scans. Migraine patients had increased hypothalamic FC with a number of brain regions involved in regulation of autonomic functions, including the locus coeruleus, caudate, parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and the temporal pole. Stronger functional connections between the hypothalamus and brain areas that regulate sympathetic and parasympathetic functions may explain some of the hypothalamic-mediated autonomic symptoms that accompany or precede migraine attacks."

This study aimed to explore the altitudinal patterns and potential drivers of leaf C∶N∶P stoichiometry. We measured the concentrations of leaf C, N and P in 175 plant species as well as soil nutrient concentrations along an altitudinal transect (500-2300 m) on the northern slope of Changbai Mountain, China to explore the response of leaf C∶N∶P stoichiometry to plant growth form (PGF), climate and soil. Leaf C, N, P and C∶N∶P ratios showed significant altitudinal trends. In general, leaf C and C∶N∶P ratios increased while leaf N and P decreased with elevation. Woody and herbaceous species showed different responses to altitudinal gradients. Trees had the largest variation in leaf C, C∶N and C∶P ratios, while herbs showed the largest variation in leaf N, P and N∶P ratio. PGF, climate and soil jointly regulated leaf stoichiometry, explaining 17.6% to 52.1% of the variation in the six leaf stoichiometric traits. PGF was more important in explaining leaf stoichiometry variation than soil and climate. Our findings will help to elucidate the altitudinal patterns of leaf stoichiometry and to model ecosystem nutrient cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2057866832,"Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are heme-thiolate proteins distributed across the biological kingdoms. P450s are catalytically versatile and play key roles in organisms primary and secondary metabolism. Identification of P450s across the biological kingdoms depends largely on the identification of two P450 signature motifs, EXXR and CXG, in the protein sequence. Once a putative protein has been identified as P450, it will be assigned to a family and subfamily based on the criteria that P450s within a family share more than 40% homology and members of subfamilies share more than 55% homology. However, to date, no evidence has been presented that can distinguish members of a P450 family. Here, for the first time we report the identification of EXXR- and CXG-motifs-based amino acid patterns that are characteristic of the P450 family. Analysis of P450 signature motifs in the under-explored fungal P450s from four different phyla, ascomycota, basidiomycota, zygomycota and chytridiomycota, indicated that the EXXR motif is highly variable and the CXG motif is somewhat variable. The amino acids threonine and leucine are preferred as second and third amino acids in the EXXR motif and proline and glycine are preferred as second and third amino acids in the CXG motif in fungal P450s. Analysis of 67 P450 families from biological kingdoms such as plants, animals, bacteria and fungi showed conservation of a set of amino acid patterns characteristic of a particular P450 family in EXXR and CXG motifs. This suggests that during the divergence of P450 families from a common ancestor these amino acids patterns evolve and are retained in each P450 family as a signature of that family. The role of amino acid patterns characteristic of a P450 family in the structural and/or functional aspects of members of the P450 family is a topic for future research."

We calculated the age-standardized rates of mortality from and the incidence of pesticide poisoning in South Korea by gender and region from 2006 through 2010 using registered death data obtained from Statistics Korea and national healthcare utilization data obtained from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of South Korea. During the study period of 2006 through 2010, a total of 16,161 deaths and 45,291 patients related to pesticide poisoning were identified, marking respective mortality and incidence rates of 5.35 and 15.37 per 100,000 population. Intentional self-poisoning was identified as the major cause of death due to pesticides (85.9%) and accounted for 20.8% of all recorded suicides. The rates of mortality due to and incidence of pesticide poisoning were higher in rural than in urban areas, and this rural-urban discrepancy was more pronounced for mortality than for incidence. Both the rate of mortality due to pesticide poisoning and its incidence rate increased with age and were higher among men than women. This study provides the magnitude and epidemiologic characteristics for mortality from and the incidence of pesticide poisoning at the national level, and strongly suggests the need for further efforts to prevent pesticide self-poisonings, especially in rural areas in South Korea."

We compared properties and molecular characteristics of human CD4+HLA-G+ with those of CD4+CD25+FoxP3-expressing tTreg cells using in vitro studies of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, single-cell electrophysiology, and functional in vivo studies. Both tTreg populations are characterized by alterations in proximal-signaling pathways on TCR stimulation and a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane when compared to conventional CD4+ T cells. However, both clearly differ in phenotype and pattern of secreted cytokines, which results in distinct mechanisms of suppression: While CD4+HLA-G+ cells secrete high levels of inhibitory molecules (IL-10, soluble HLA-G, IL-35), CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells express these molecules at significantly lower levels and seem to exert their function mainly in a contact-dependent manner via cyclic adenosine-monophosphate.

https://openalex.org/W2021321306,"The Steroid Receptor RNA Activator (SRA) enhances adipogenesis and increases both glucose uptake and phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1 in response to insulin. To assess the mechanism, we differentiated ST2 mesenchymal precursor cells that did or did not overexpress SRA into adipocytes using combinations of methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone and insulin. These studies showed that SRA overexpression promotes full adipogenesis in part by stimulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling. SRA overexpression inhibited phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in the early differentiation of ST2 cells. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous SRA in 3T3-L1 cells increased phosphorylation of JNK. Knockdown of SRA in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced insulin receptor (IR) mRNA and protein levels, which led to decreased autophosphorylation of IRβ and decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt. This likely reflects a stimulatory role of SRA on IR transcription, as transfection studies showed that SRA increased expression of an IR promoter-luciferase reporter construct."
https://openalex.org/W1964175664,"Background Cataract surgery has been shown to improve quality of life and household economy in the short term. However, it is unclear whether these benefits are sustained over time. This study aims to assess the six year impact of cataract surgery on health related quality of life (HRQoL), daily activities and economic poverty in Bangladesh and The Philippines. Methods and Findings This was a longitudinal study. At baseline people aged ≥50 years with visual impairment due to cataract (‘cases’) and age-, sex-matched controls without visual impairment were interviewed about vision specific and generic HRQoL, daily activities and economic indicators (household per capita expenditure, assets and self-rated wealth). Cases were offered free or subsidised cataract surgery. Cases and controls were re-interviewed approximately one and six years later. At baseline across the two countries there were 455 cases and 443 controls. Fifty percent of cases attended for surgery. Response rates at six years were 47% for operated cases and 53% for controls. At baseline cases had poorer health and vision related QoL, were less likely to undertake productive activities, more likely to receive assistance with activities and were poorer compared to controls (p<0.05). One year after surgery there were significant increases in HRQoL, participation and time spent in productive activities and per capita expenditure and reduction in assistance with activities so that the operated cases were similar to controls. These increases were still evident after six years with the exception that time spent on productive activities decreased among both cases and controls. Conclusion Cataract causing visual loss is associated with reduced HRQoL and economic poverty among older adults in low-income countries. Cataract surgery improves the HRQoL of the individual and economy of the household. The findings of this study suggest these benefits are sustained in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W2106251840,"Background Previous studies showed a higher risk of maternal morbidity amongst black and other minority ethnic (BME) groups, but were unable to investigate whether this excess risk was concentrated within specific BME groups in the UK. Our aim was to analyse the specific risks and to investigate reasons for any disparity. Methods Unmatched case-control analysis using data from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS), February 2005-January 2013. Cases were 1,753 women who experienced severe morbidity during the peripartum period. Controls were 3,310 women who delivered immediately before the cases in the same hospital. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to adjust for known confounders and to understand their effects. Results Compared with white European women, the odds of severe maternal morbidity were 83% higher among black African women (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.83; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.39–2.40), 80% higher among black Caribbean (aOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.14–2.82), 74% higher in Bangladeshi (aOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.05–2.88), 56% higher in other non-whites (non-Asian) (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.05–2.33) and 43% higher among Pakistani women (aOR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.07–1.92). There was no evidence of substantial confounding. Anaemia in current pregnancy, previous pregnancy problems, inadequate utilisation of antenatal care, pre-existing medical conditions, parity>3, and being younger and older were independent risk factors but, the odds of severe maternal morbidity did not differ by socioeconomic status, between smokers and non-smokers or by BMI. Discussion This national study demonstrates an increased risk of severe maternal morbidity among women of ethnic minority backgrounds which could not be explained by known risk factors for severe maternal morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2013960302,"Fruit set is initiated only after fertilization and is tightly regulated primarily by gibberellins (GAs) and auxins. The application of either of these hormones induces parthenocarpy, fruit set without fertilization, but the molecular mechanism underlying this induction is poorly understood. In the present study, we have shown that the parthenocarpic fruits induced by GA application at pre-bloom result from the interaction of GA with auxin signaling. The transcriptional levels of the putative negative regulators of fruit set initiation, including Vitis auxin/indole-3-acetic acid transcription factor 9 (VvIAA9), Vitis auxin response factor 7 (VvARF7), and VvARF8 were monitored during inflorescence development in seeded diploid 'Tamnara' grapevines with or without GA application. Without GA application, VvIAA9, VvARF7, and VvARF8 were expressed at a relatively high level before full bloom, but decreased thereafter following pollination. After GA application at 14 days before full bloom (DBF); however, the expression levels of VvIAA9 and VvARF7 declined at 5 DBF prior to pollination. The effects of GA application on auxin levels or auxin signaling were also analyzed by monitoring the expression patterns of auxin biosynthesis genes and auxin-responsive genes with or without GA application. Transcription levels of the auxin biosynthesis genes Vitis anthranilate synthase β subunit (VvASB1-like), Vitis YUCCA2 (VvYUC2), and VvYUC6 were not significantly changed by GA application. However, the expressions of Vitis Gretchen Hagen3.2 (VvGH3.2) and VvGH3.3, auxin-responsive genes, were up-regulated from 2 DBF to full bloom with GA application. Furthermore, the Vitis GA signaling gene, VvDELLA was up-regulated by GA application during 12 DBF to 7 DBF, prior to down-regulation of VvIAA9 and VvARF7. These results suggest that VvIAA9 and VvARF7 are negative regulators of fruit set initiation in grapevines, and GA signaling is integrated with auxin signaling via VvDELLA during parthenocarpic fruit development in grapevines."
https://openalex.org/W2048860926,"The migration of CD4+ T cells plays an important role in arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in CD4+ T cell migration are still unclear. The current study is aimed to determine the expression change of miR-142-3p in CD4+ T cells from patients with ASO and investigate its role in CD4+ T cell migration as well the potential mechanisms involved. We identified by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization that the expression of miR-142-3p in CD4+ T cells was significantly down-regulated in patients with ASO. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), a common inflammatory chemokine under the ASO condition, was able to down-regulate the expression of miR-142-3p in cultured CD4+ T cells. Up-regulation of miR-142-3p by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer had a strong inhibitory effect on CD4+ T cell migration both in cultured human cells in vitro and in mouse aortas and spleens in vivo. RAC1 and ROCK2 were identified to be the direct target genes in human CD4+ T cells, which are further confirmed by dual luciferase assay. MiR-142-3p had strong regulatory effects on actin cytoskeleton as shown by the actin staining in CD4+ T cells. The results suggest that the expression of miR-142-3p is down-regulated in CD4+ T cells from patients with ASO. The down-regulation of miR-142-3p could increase the migration of CD4+ T cells to the vascular walls by regulation of actin cytoskeleton via its target genes, RAC1 and ROCK2."
https://openalex.org/W2066202490,"Halophilic proteins have greater abundance of acidic over basic and very low bulky hydrophobic residues. Classical electrostatic stabilization was suggested as the key determinant for halophilic adaptation of protein. However, contribution of specific electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt-bridges) to overall stability of halophilic proteins is yet to be understood. To understand this, we use Adaptive-Poison-Boltzmann-Solver Methods along with our home-built automation to workout net as well as associated component energy terms such as desolvation energy, bridge energy and background energy for 275 salt-bridges from 20 extremely halophilic proteins. We then perform extensive statistical analysis on general and energetic attributes on these salt-bridges. On average, 8 salt-bridges per 150 residues protein were observed which is almost twice than earlier report. Overall contributions of salt-bridges are -3.0 kcal mol-1. Majority (78%) of salt-bridges in our dataset are stable and conserved in nature. Although, average contributions of component energy terms are equal, their individual details vary greatly from one another indicating their sensitivity to local micro-environment. Notably, 35% of salt-bridges in our database are buried and stable. Greater desolvation penalty of these buried salt-bridges are counteracted by stable network salt-bridges apart from favorable equal contributions of bridge and background terms. Recruitment of extensive network salt-bridges (46%) with a net contribution of -5.0 kcal mol-1 per salt-bridge, seems to be a halophilic design wherein favorable average contribution of background term (-10 kcal mol-1) exceeds than that of bridge term (-7 kcal mol-1). Interiors of proteins from halophiles are seen to possess relatively higher abundance of charge and polar side chains than that of mesophiles which seems to be satisfied by cooperative network salt-bridges. Overall, our theoretical analyses provide insight into halophilic signature in its specific electrostatic interactions which we hope would help in protein engineering and bioinformatics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2063894178,"Human Dachshund homologue 1 (DACH1) is a major component of the Retinal Determination Gene Network. Loss of DACH1 expression was found in breast, prostate, lung, endometrial, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma. To explore the expression, regulation and function of DACH1 in human esophageal cancer, 11 esophageal cancer cell lines, 10 cases of normal esophageal mucosa, 51 cases of different grades of dysplasia and 104 cases of primary esophageal squamous cancer were employed. Methylation specific PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot, flow cytometry, small interfering RNAs, colony formation techniques and xenograft mice model were used. We found that DACH1 expression was regulated by promoter region hypermethylation in esophageal cancer cell lines. 18.8% (6 of 32) of grade 1, 42.1% (8 of 19) of grade 2 and grade 3 dysplasia (ED2,3), and 61.5% (64 of 104) of esophageal cancer were methylated, but no methylation was found in 10 cases of normal esophageal mucosa. The methylation was increased in progression tendency during esophageal carcinogenesis (P<0.01). DACH1 methylation was associated with poor differentiation (P<0.05) and late tumor stage (P<0.05). Restoration of DACH1 expression inhibited cell growth and activated TGF-β signaling in KYSE150 and KYSE510 cells. DACH1 suppressed human esophageal cancer cell tumor growth in xenograft mice. In conclusion, DACH1 is frequently methylated in human esophageal cancer and methylation of DACH1 is involved in the early stage of esophageal carcinogenesis. DACH1 expression is regulated by promoter region hypermethylation. DACH1 suppresses esophageal cancer growth by activating TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2023424679,"The primary signal of sex determination in the honeybee, the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene, evolved from a gene duplication event from an ancestral copy of the fem gene. Recently, other paralogs of the fem gene have been identified in several ant and bumblebee genomes. This discovery and the close phylogenetic relationship of the paralogous gene sequences led to the hypothesis of a single ancestry of the csd genetic system of complementary sex determination in the Hymenopteran insects, in which the fem and csd gene copies evolved as a unit in concert with the mutual transfers of sequences (concerted evolution). Here, we show that the paralogous gene copies evolved repeatedly through independent gene duplication events in the honeybee, bumblebee, and ant lineage. We detected no sequence tracts that would indicate a DNA transfer between the fem and the fem1/csd genes between different ant and bee species. Instead, we found tracts of duplication events in other genomic locations, suggesting that gene duplication was a frequent event in the evolution of these genes. These and other evidences suggest that the fem1/csd gene originated repeatedly through gene duplications in the bumblebee, honeybee, and ant lineages in the last 100 million years. Signatures of concerted evolution were not detectable, implicating that the gene tree based on neutral synonymous sites represents the phylogenetic relationships and origins of the fem and fem1/csd genes. Our results further imply that the fem1 and csd gene in bumblebees, honeybees, and ants are not orthologs, because they originated independently from the fem gene. Hence, the widely shared and conserved complementary sex determination mechanism in Hymenopteran insects is controlled by different genes and molecular processes. These findings highlight the limits of comparative genomics and emphasize the requirement to study gene functions in different species and major hymenopteran lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2006189884,"Widespread species often show geographic variation in thermally-sensitive traits, providing insight into how species respond to shifts in temperature through time. Such patterns may arise from phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaptation, or their interaction. In some cases, the effects of genotype and temperature may act together to reduce, or to exacerbate, phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits across varying thermal environments. We find evidence for such interactions in life-history traits of Heteronympha merope, a butterfly distributed across a broad latitudinal gradient in south-eastern Australia. We show that body size in this butterfly is negatively related to developmental temperature in the laboratory, in accordance with the temperature-size rule, but not in the field, despite very strong temperature gradients. A common garden experiment on larval thermal responses, spanning the environmental extremes of H. merope's distribution, revealed that butterflies from low latitude (warmer climate) populations have relatively fast intrinsic growth and development rates compared to those from cooler climates. These synergistic effects of genotype and temperature across the landscape (co-gradient variation) are likely to accentuate phenotypic variation in these traits, and this interaction must be accounted for when predicting how H. merope will respond to temperature change through time. These results highlight the importance of understanding how variation in life-history traits may arise in response to environmental change. Without this knowledge, we may fail to detect whether organisms are tracking environmental change, and if they are, whether it is by plasticity, adaptation or both."
https://openalex.org/W2025571938,"Despite years of research, the reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotency remains a slow, inefficient process, and a detailed mechanistic understanding of reprogramming remains elusive. Current models suggest reprogramming to pluripotency occurs in two-phases: a prolonged stochastic phase followed by a rapid deterministic phase. In this paradigm, the early stochastic phase is marked by the random and gradual expression of pluripotency genes and is thought to be a major rate-limiting step in the successful generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). Recent evidence suggests that the epigenetic landscape of the somatic cell is gradually reset during a period known as the stochastic phase, but it is known neither how this occurs nor what rate-limiting steps control progress through the stochastic phase. A precise understanding of gene expression dynamics in the stochastic phase is required in order to answer these questions. Moreover, a precise model of this complex process will enable the measurement and mechanistic dissection of treatments that enhance the rate or efficiency of reprogramming to pluripotency. Here we use single-cell transcript profiling, FACS and mathematical modeling to show that the stochastic phase is an ordered probabilistic process with independent gene-specific dynamics. We also show that partially reprogrammed cells infected with OSKM follow two trajectories: a productive trajectory toward increasingly ESC-like expression profiles or an alternative trajectory leading away from both the fibroblast and ESC state. These two pathways are distinguished by the coordinated expression of a small group of chromatin modifiers in the productive trajectory, supporting the notion that chromatin remodeling is essential for successful reprogramming. These are the first results to show that the stochastic phase of reprogramming in human fibroblasts is an ordered, probabilistic process with gene-specific dynamics and to provide a precise mathematical framework describing the dynamics of pluripotency gene expression during reprogramming by OSKM."
https://openalex.org/W2083737715,"A tissue thermal conductivity (Ks) is an important parameter which knowledge is essential whenever thermal fields induced in selected organs are predicted. The main objective of this study was to develop an alternative ultrasonic method for determining Ks of tissues in vitro suitable for living tissues. First, the method involves measuring of temperature-time T(t) rises induced in a tested tissue sample by a pulsed focused ultrasound with measured acoustic properties using thermocouples located on the acoustic beam axis. Measurements were performed for 20-cycle tone bursts with a 2 MHz frequency, 0.2 duty-cycle and 3 different initial pressures corresponding to average acoustic powers equal to 0.7 W, 1.4 W and 2.1 W generated from a circular focused transducer with a diameter of 15 mm and f-number of 1.7 in a two-layer system of media: water/beef liver. Measurement results allowed to determine position of maximum heating located inside the beef liver. It was found that this position is at the same axial distance from the source as the maximum peak-peak pressure calculated for each nonlinear beam produced in the two-layer system of media. Then, the method involves modeling of T(t) at the point of maximum heating and fitting it to the experimental data by adjusting Ks. The averaged value of Ks determined by the proposed method was found to be 0.5±0.02 W/(m·°C) being in good agreement with values determined by other methods. The proposed method is suitable for determining Ks of some animal tissues in vivo (for example a rat liver)."
https://openalex.org/W2017535325,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma with poor prognosis. The genetic etiology of RMS remains largely unclear underlying its development and progression. To reveal novel genes more precisely and new therapeutic targets associated with RMS, we used high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to explore tumor-associated copy number variations (CNVs) and genes in RMS. We confirmed several important genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). We then performed bioinformatics-based functional enrichment analysis for genes located in the genomic regions with CNVs. In addition, we identified miRNAs located in the corresponding amplification and deletion regions and performed miRNA functional enrichment analysis. aCGH analyses revealed that all RMS showed specific gains and losses. The amplification regions were 12q13.12, 12q13.3, and 12q13.3–q14.1. The deletion regions were 1p21.1, 2q14.1, 5q13.2, 9p12, and 9q12. The recurrent regions with gains were 12q13.3, 12q13.3–q14.1, 12q14.1, and 17q25.1. The recurrent regions with losses were 9p12–p11.2, 10q11.21–q11.22, 14q32.33, 16p11.2, and 22q11.1. The mean mRNA level of GLI1 in RMS was 6.61-fold higher than that in controls (p = 0.0477) by QRT-PCR. Meanwhile, the mean mRNA level of GEFT in RMS samples was 3.92-fold higher than that in controls (p = 0.0354). Bioinformatic analysis showed that genes were enriched in functions such as immunoglobulin domain, induction of apoptosis, and defensin. Proto-oncogene functions were involved in alveolar RMS. miRNAs that located in the amplified regions in RMS tend to be enriched in oncogenic activity (miR-24 and miR-27a). In conclusion, this study identified a number of CNVs in RMS and functional analyses showed enrichment for genes and miRNAs located in these CNVs regions. These findings may potentially help the identification of novel biomarkers and/or drug targets implicated in diagnosis of and targeted therapy for RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2079788818,"In cardiomyocytes, Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) binds to and activates RyR2 channels, resulting in subsequent Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and cardiac contraction. Previous research has documented the molecular coupling of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels) to VDCCs in mouse cardiac muscle. Little is known regarding the role of RyRs-sensitive Ca2+ release in the SK channels in cardiac muscle. In this study, using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we observed that a Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK,Ca) recorded from isolated adult C57B/L mouse atrial myocytes was significantly decreased by ryanodine, an inhibitor of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), or by the co-application of ryanodine and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). The activation of RyR2 by caffeine increased the IK,Ca in the cardiac cells (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). We further analyzed the effect of RyR2 knockdown on IK,Ca and Ca2+ in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes using a whole-cell patch clamp technique and confocal imaging. RyR2 knockdown in mouse atrial cells transduced with lentivirus-mediated small hairpin interference RNA (shRNA) exhibited a significant decrease in IK,Ca (p<0.05) and [Ca2+]i fluorescence intensity (p<0.01). An immunoprecipitated complex of SK2 and RyR2 was identified in native cardiac tissue by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our findings indicate that RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release is responsible for the activation and modulation of SK channels in cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2001873174,"Multiplex genome engineering is a standalone recombineering tool for large-scale programming and accelerated evolution of cells. However, this advanced genome engineering technique has been limited to use in selected bacterial strains. We developed a simple and effective strain-independent method for effective genome engineering in Escherichia coli. The method involves introducing a suicide plasmid carrying the λ Red recombination system into the mutS gene. The suicide plasmid can be excised from the chromosome via selection in the absence of antibiotics, thus allowing transient inactivation of the mismatch repair system during genome engineering. In addition, we developed another suicide plasmid that enables integration of large DNA fragments into the lacZ genomic locus. These features enable this system to be applied in the exploitation of the benefits of genome engineering in synthetic biology, as well as the metabolic engineering of different strains of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1987117636,"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in mice using DNA-fragmented sperm (DFS) has been linked to an increased risk of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities both in embryos and offspring. This study examines: whether embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from DFS-ICSI embryos reflect the abnormalities observed in the DFS-ICSI progeny; the effect of DFS-ICSI on male fertility; and whether DFS-ICSI induces epigenetic changes that lead to a modified heritable phenotype. DFS-ICSI-produced embryos showed a low potential to generate ESC lines. However, these lines had normal karyotype accompanied by early gene expression alterations, though a normal expression pattern was observed after several passages. The fertility of males in the DFS-ICSI and control groups was compared by mating test. Sperm quantity, vaginal plug and pregnancy rates were significantly lower for the DFS-ICSI-produced males compared to in vivo-produced mice, while the number of females showing resorptions was higher. The epigenetic effects of DFS-ICSI were assessed by analyzing the phenotype rendered by the Axin1Fu allele, a locus that is highly sensitive to epigenetic perturbations. Oocytes were injected with spermatozoa from Axin1Fu/+ mice and the DFS-ICSI-generated embryos were transferred to females. A significantly higher proportion of pups expressed the active kinky-tail epiallele in the DFS-ICSI group than the controls.1) ESCs cannot be used as a model of DFS-ICSI; 2) DFS-ICSI reduces sperm production and fertility in the male progeny; and 3) DFS-ICSI affects the postnatal expression of a defined epigenetically sensitive allele and this modification may be inherited across generations."

https://openalex.org/W2004225092,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has two major subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC are hindered by the limited knowledge about the pathogenesis mechanisms of subtypes of NSCLC. It is necessary to research the molecular mechanisms related with AC and SCC. In this work, we improved the logic analysis algorithm to mine the sufficient and necessary conditions for the presence states (presence or absence) of phenotypes. We applied our method to AC and SCC specimens, and identified [Formula: see text] lower and [Formula: see text] higher logic relationships between genes and two subtypes of NSCLC. The discovered relationships were independent of specimens selected, and their significance was validated by statistic test. Compared with the two earlier methods (the non-negative matrix factorization method and the relevance analysis method), the current method outperformed these methods in the recall rate and classification accuracy on NSCLC and normal specimens. We obtained [Formula: see text] biomarkers. Among [Formula: see text] biomarkers, [Formula: see text] genes have been used to distinguish AC from SCC in practice, and other six genes were newly discovered biomarkers for distinguishing subtypes. Furthermore, NKX2-1 has been considered as a molecular target for the targeted therapy of AC, and [Formula: see text] other genes may be novel molecular targets. By gene ontology analysis, we found that two biological processes ('epidermis development' and 'cell adhesion') were closely related with the tumorigenesis of subtypes of NSCLC. More generally, the current method could be extended to other complex diseases for distinguishing subtypes and detecting the molecular targets for targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2005529944,"We have identified expression of the gene encoding the transcriptional coactivator FOG-1 (Friend of GATA-1; Zfpm1, Zinc finger protein multitype 1) in B lymphocytes. We found that FOG-1 expression is directly or indirectly dependent on the B cell-specific coactivator OBF-1 and that it is modulated during B cell development: expression is observed in early but not in late stages of B cell development. To directly test in vivo the role of FOG-1 in B lymphocytes, we developed a novel embryonic stem cell recombination system. For this, we combined homologous recombination with the FLP recombinase activity to rapidly generate embryonic stem cell lines carrying a Cre-inducible transgene at the Rosa26 locus. Using this system, we successfully generated transgenic mice where FOG-1 is conditionally overexpressed in mature B-cells or in the entire hematopoietic system. While overexpression of FOG-1 in B cells did not significantly affect B cell development or function, we found that enforced expression of FOG-1 throughout all hematopoietic lineages led to a reduction in the number of circulating eosinophils, confirming and extending to mammals the known function of FOG-1 in this lineage."

Methods A cohort study of one-year duration was conducted in Yangzhou and Changzhou cities in Jiangsu province of China. The baseline survey commenced in June 2009, recruited 1225 consenting adult MSCs (609 in Yangzhou and 617 in Changzhou) through STI-clinic based convenience sampling. Results Baseline HIV and syphilis prevalence were 0.49% and 17.29% respectively. Syphilis incidence rate was 7.22 per 100 person-years (6.53 in Yangzhou and 7.76 in Changzhou) during the 6-month follow-up with retention fractions of 27.38% and 35.15% for Yangzhou and Changzhou respectively. Majority of the participants were middle-aged, high school educated, married, living with partners and non-migrants. Very few subjects reported recent and consistent condom-use with regular partners. Although considerable number of MSCs reported recent sexual exposure with female sex workers (FSW) and non-FSW casual partners, the proportion of reported condom use was very low during those exposures. In multivariate analyses higher age, having recent sex with FSWs and being HIV-positive were associated with higher syphilis sero-positivity while higher education was protective. In bivariate analyses, being married, divorced/widowed, official residency of the study cities and non-use of condom with regular partners predicted higher risk. Conclusions Considering the potential bridging role of MSCs between high and low-risk populations, effective intervention strategies among them targeting the correlates of syphilis infection are urgently called for in Jiangsu province of China."

However, the analytically derived equilibrium frequency of multiple infections has not yet been determined, although the equilibrium for cases of single infection has been reported. In this study, we considered the difference equation for endosymbionts using three parameters: the probability of the failure of vertical transmission (), CI strength (), and the level of host inbreeding (). To analyze this model, we particularly focused on , i.e., the frequency of host individuals completely infected with all -bacterial strains in the population. , at the equilibrium state, was analytically calculated in the cases where and is any arbitrary value.
