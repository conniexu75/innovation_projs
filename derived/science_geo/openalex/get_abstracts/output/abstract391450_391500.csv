https://openalex.org/W2048919807,"It remains difficult to distinguish tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis after brain tumor therapy. Here we show that these lesions can be distinguished using the amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of endogenous cellular proteins and peptides as an imaging biomarker. When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation. The amide protons that can be detected by APT provide a unique and noninvasive MRI biomarker for distinguishing viable malignancy from radiation necrosis and predicting tumor response to therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1967232661,"This study identifies proteins from the postsynaptic density (PSD) of human neocortex and finds that the PSD shows enrichment of genes involved in cognitive and affective phenotypes and that PSD mutations are associated with neurological and psychiatric disease. We isolated the postsynaptic density from human neocortex (hPSD) and identified 1,461 proteins. hPSD mutations cause 133 neurological and psychiatric diseases and were enriched in cognitive, affective and motor phenotypes underpinned by sets of genes. Strong protein sequence conservation in mammalian lineages, particularly in hub proteins, indicates conserved function and organization in primate and rodent models. The hPSD is an important structure for nervous system disease and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1970397315,"The cell nucleus is a highly compartmentalized organelle harbouring a variety of dynamic membraneless nuclear bodies. How these subnuclear domains are established and maintained is not well understood. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of how one nuclear body, the paraspeckle, is assembled and organized. Paraspeckles are discrete ribonucleoprotein bodies found in mammalian cells and implicated in nuclear retention of hyperedited mRNAs. We developed a live-cell imaging system that allows for the inducible transcription of Men ɛ/β (also known as Neat1; ref. 12) noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and the direct visualization of the recruitment of paraspeckle proteins. Using this system, we demonstrate that Men ɛ/β ncRNAs are essential to initiate the de novo assembly of paraspeckles. These newly formed structures effectively harbour nuclear-retained mRNAs confirming that they are bona fide functional paraspeckles. By three independent approaches, we show that it is the act of Men ɛ/β transcription, but not ncRNAs alone, that regulates paraspeckle maintenance. Finally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses supported a critical structural role for Men ɛ/β ncRNAs in paraspeckle organization. This study establishes a model in which Men ɛ/β ncRNAs serve as a platform to recruit proteins to assemble paraspeckles."
https://openalex.org/W1972747383,"Collective cell migration occurs in a range of contexts: cancer cells frequently invade in cohorts while retaining cell-cell junctions. Here we show that collective invasion by cancer cells depends on decreasing actomyosin contractility at sites of cell-cell contact. When actomyosin is not downregulated at cell-cell contacts, migrating cells lose cohesion. We provide a molecular mechanism for this downregulation. Depletion of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) blocks collective cancer-cell invasion in a range of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and 'organotypic' models. DDR1 coordinates the Par3/Par6 cell-polarity complex through its carboxy terminus, binding PDZ domains in Par3 and Par6. The DDR1-Par3/Par6 complex controls the localization of RhoE to cell-cell contacts, where it antagonizes ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility. Depletion of DDR1, Par3, Par6 or RhoE leads to increased actomyosin contactility at cell-cell contacts, a loss of cell-cell cohesion and defective collective cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2105867118,"When events occur at predictable instants, anticipation improves performance. Knowledge of event timing modulates motor circuits and thereby improves response speed. By contrast, the neuronal mechanisms that underlie changes in sensory perception resulting from expectation are not well understood. We developed a behavioral procedure for rats in which we manipulated expectations about sound timing. Valid expectations improved both the speed and the accuracy of the subjects' performance, indicating not only improved motor preparedness but also enhanced perception. Single-neuron recordings in primary auditory cortex showed enhanced representation of sounds during periods of heightened expectation. Furthermore, we found that activity in auditory cortex was causally linked to the performance of the task and that changes in the neuronal representation of sounds predicted performance on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results indicate that changes in neuronal representation as early as primary sensory cortex mediate the perceptual advantage conferred by temporal expectation."
https://openalex.org/W2081501101,"Emmanuel Mignot and colleagues report genome-wide association analyses identifying a new susceptibility locus for narcolepsy. They identify associated variants in the 3′ untranslated region of P2RY11, a purinergic receptor that modulates immune cell viability. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3′ untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y11 gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 × 10−10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19–1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8+ T lymphocytes (72% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (70% reduced, P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2123497942,"Histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) is required for the endogenous production of histamine, but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. Yang et al. now report that Hdc-deficient mice develop more tumors in models of chemically induced carcinogenesis, associated with an increased recruitment of immature myeloid cells to the tumors and higher amounts of interleukin-6. The authors further show that Hdc deficiency inhibits myeloid cell maturation and that exogenous histamine promotes monocyte differentiation and suppresses tumor growth. Histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the unique enzyme responsible for histamine generation, is highly expressed in myeloid cells, but its function in these cells is poorly understood. Here we show that Hdc-knockout mice show a high rate of colon and skin carcinogenesis. Using Hdc-EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice in which EGFP expression is controlled by the Hdc promoter, we show that Hdc is expressed primarily in CD11b+Ly6G+ immature myeloid cells (IMCs) that are recruited early on in chemical carcinogenesis. Transplant of Hdc-deficient bone marrow to wild-type recipients results in increased CD11b+Ly6G+ cell mobilization and reproduces the cancer susceptibility phenotype of Hdc-knockout mice. In addition, Hdc-deficient IMCs promote the growth of tumor allografts, whereas mouse CT26 colon cancer cells downregulate Hdc expression through promoter hypermethylation and inhibit myeloid cell maturation. Exogenous histamine induces the differentiation of IMCs and suppresses their ability to support the growth of tumor allografts. These data indicate key roles for Hdc and histamine in myeloid cell differentiation and CD11b+Ly6G+ IMCs in early cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2171564382,"Hypoxia can act as an initial trigger to induce erythrocyte sickling and eventual end organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD). Many factors and metabolites are altered in response to hypoxia and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Using metabolomic profiling, we found that the steady-state concentration of adenosine in the blood was elevated in a transgenic mouse model of SCD. Adenosine concentrations were similarly elevated in the blood of humans with SCD. Increased adenosine levels promoted sickling, hemolysis and damage to multiple tissues in SCD transgenic mice and promoted sickling of human erythrocytes. Using biochemical, genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B)R)-mediated induction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, an erythrocyte-specific metabolite that decreases the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin, underlies the induction of erythrocyte sickling by excess adenosine both in cultured human red blood cells and in SCD transgenic mice. Thus, excessive adenosine signaling through the A(2B)R has a pathological role in SCD. These findings may provide new therapeutic possibilities for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2038706114,"NaV1.5 sodium channels enhance the invasiveness of breast cancer cells through the acidic-dependent activation of cysteine cathepsins. Here, we showed that the Na+/H+ exchanger type 1 (NHE1) was an important regulator of H+ efflux in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and that its activity was increased by NaV1.5. NaV1.5 and NHE1 were colocalized in membrane rafts containing caveolin-1. The inhibition of NaV1.5 or NHE1 induced a similar reduction in cell invasiveness and extracellular matrix degradation; no additive effect was observed when they were simultaneously inhibited. Our study suggests that NaV1.5 and NHE1 are functionally coupled and enhance the invasiveness of cancer cells by increasing H+ efflux."

https://openalex.org/W2065046615,"Biomineralization, the process by which minerals are deposited by organisms, has attracted considerable attention because this mechanism has shown great potential to inspire bottom-up material syntheses. To understand the mechanism for morphological regulation that occurs during biomineralization, many regulatory proteins have been isolated from various biominerals. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the morphology of biominerals remain unclear because there is a lack of in vivo evidence. Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize intracellular magnetosomes that comprise membrane-enveloped single crystalline magnetite (Fe3O4).

In this study, we analyzed the mms6 gene deletion mutant (Δmms6) of Magnetospirillum magneticum (M. magneticum) AMB-1. Surprisingly, the Δmms6 strain was found to synthesize the smaller magnetite crystals with uncommon crystal faces, while the wild-type and complementation strains synthesized highly ordered cubo-octahedral crystals. Furthermore, deletion of mms6 gene led to drastic changes in the profiles of the proteins tightly bound to magnetite crystals.

Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize magnetite crystals under ambient conditions via a highly controlled morphological regulation system that uses biological molecules. IntroductionThe control of morphology and size of nano-sized crystals by biological systems under ambient conditions has the potential to be adapted to wide-ranging industrial, biomedical, and electronic applications (1Hu X. Li G. Yu J.C. Langmuir. 2010; 26: 3031-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 2Avasthi D.K. Kumar A. Singhal R. Tripathi A. Misra D.S. J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 2010; 10: 3767-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Living organisms perform various mineral depositions in construction of structures such as shells, teeth, and bones in which morphologies are strictly controlled using biological molecules in biomineralization processes (3Oaki Y. Kotachi A. Miura T. Imai H. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2006; 16: 1633-1639Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Wang T. Cölfen H. Antonietti M. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2009; 284: 18972-18979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These biomineralization mechanisms have captured the imagination of material scientists engaged in development of bottom-up syntheses of various materials under mild conditions. Ansocalcin, a protein isolated from goose eggshell matrix, induces the construction of spherical calcite polycrystalline aggregates (6Lakshminarayanan R. Kini R.M. Valiyaveettil S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5155-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Osteopontin, a protein that is abundant in urine, interacts with the specific crystal edges of calcium oxalate and influences the morphology of the crystals (7Taller A. Grohe B. Rogers K.A. Goldberg H.A. Hunter G.K. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1768-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been determined that hierarchical organized structures with highly uniform pseudo-hexagonal structures are involved in the formation of the sturdy nacreous layer of mollusk shells and that rhombohedral nano-sized crystals are involved in the development of egg shells (3Oaki Y. Kotachi A. Miura T. Imai H. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2006; 16: 1633-1639Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Cölfen H. Antonietti M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 5576-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 9Oaki Y. Imai H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 6571-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the functions of proteins in the development of morphology and/or size control during biomineralization were mainly demonstrated by in vitro studies of chemical synthesis using purified proteins or synthetic peptides. Direct evidence of the protein-mediated control in vivo has not been elucidated to date. In particular, the morphology and size regulation mechanisms of single crystalline nano-sized biominerals are still unclear.Magnetotactic bacteria provide an ideal model organism for investigating the mechanism of nano-sized biomineral formation including size and morphological regulation, because the cells synthesize highly controlled single crystalline magnetites (magnetosomes). These microorganisms are thought to orient their cells in the geomagnetic field and to swim toward their preferred microaerobic environment. Previous molecular studies have revealed that magnetosomes are formed by a unique set of proteins in magnetotactic bacteria. Briefly, magnetosome vesicles are formed from the cytoplasmic membrane through an invagination process (10Tanaka M. Okamura Y. Arakaki A. Tanaka T. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 5234-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and the vesicles are then aligned along the actin-like filamentous protein within the cells (11Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 12Taoka A. Asada R. Wu L.F. Fukumori Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8737-8740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Magnetite crystals are formed within magnetosomes in a highly controlled manner. The crystal formation is also presumed to involve several processes, such as nucleation, growth, and morphological regulation.Within the magnetotactic bacteria, various magnetite crystals with narrow and species-specific sizes and morphologies including cubo-octahedra, elongated hexahedra, and bullet shapes have been observed under various environmental conditions (13Pósfai M. Buseck P.R. Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Am. Mineral. 1998; 83: 1469-1481Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 15Sakaguchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. Nature. 1993; 365: 47-49Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that magnetotactic bacteria exert significant regulation of the magnetite biomineralization process using specifically produced biological molecules. In our previous study, we identified a series of proteins, which are tightly bound to magnetite crystals in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. These proteins include Mms5, Mms6, Mms7/MamD, and Mms13/MamC (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, Mms6 possesses a hydrophobic Leucine-Glycine repeat motif at the N terminus and the hydrophilic region of the C terminus, which is thought to interact with magnetite crystal and iron ions (17Amemiya Y. Arakaki A. Staniland S.S. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Arakaki A. Masuda F. Amemiya Y. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. J. Colloid. Interface. Sci. 2010; 343: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The recombinant Mms6 protein has been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals during in vitro chemical synthesis (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the primary protein function has been suggested to be morphological regulation at the crystallographic level in nano-sized magnetite biomineralization, based on the results of the in vitro experiment. Magnetite crystals consisting of (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) faces were obtained in the presence of Mms6 protein, while the crystals consisting of mainly the (1 1 1) face were formed in the absence of this protein (17Amemiya Y. Arakaki A. Staniland S.S. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A similar observation was reported in an investigation using synthetic peptides mimicking the characteristic amino acids of Mms6 protein (18Arakaki A. Masuda F. Amemiya Y. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. J. Colloid. Interface. Sci. 2010; 343: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).On the other hand, in the closely related species Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (M. gryphiswaldense) MSR-1, the mamGFDC gene operon, which includes the mms7/mamD and mms13/mamC genes was proposed to play a role in controlling the size of the magnetite crystal (19Scheffel A. Gärdes A. Grünberg K. Wanner G. Schüler D. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In a recent study using gene deletion mutants, MamP, R, S, and T were also shown to function in controlling the size and number of magnetite crystals in M. magneticum AMB-1 (20Murat D. Quinlan A. Vali H. Komeili A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5593-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although several proteins, including Mms6, have been hypothesized to relate to magnetite crystallization, a detailed in vivo functional analysis of this protein in nano-sized magnetite crystallization has not yet been performed.In this study, to understand the role of Mms6 protein during magnetosome formation, we constructed and analyzed a Δmms6 strain of M. magneticum AMB-1. The crystallographic study of nano-sized magnetite crystals synthesized in vivo was conducted by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). 2The abbreviations used are HRTEM, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; MSGM, magnetic spirillum growth medium; MAI, magnetosome island. DISCUSSIONIn this study, because of the deficiency of Mms6 protein, M. magneticum AMB-1 synthesized magnetite crystals that had a lower aspect ratio, a smaller size, and an indefinite morphology consisting of uncommon crystal faces. Magnetite crystal formation is presumed to involve several steps such as nucleation, growth (size regulation), and morphological control. By the deletion of mms6 gene in M. magneticum AMB-1, the number of magnetite crystals remained unaffected. This observation clearly indicates that Mms6 does not function in the nucleation step of magnetite biomineralization. Although 2 distinct stages in magnetite crystal growth were recently suggested in magnetotactic bacteria (33Scheffel A. Gruska M. Faivre D. Linaroudis A. Plitzko J.M. Schüler D. Nature. 2006; 440: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka M. Arakaki A. Matsunaga T. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Faivre D. Böttger L.H. Matzanke B.F. Schüler D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 8495-8499Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whether or not the Mms6 protein functions in a specific stage of magnetite crystal growth remains unclear.In the previous reports on the crystallographic influence of proteins during biomineralization, the direct interactions of proteins with specific crystallographic faces and round edges of calcium oxalate have been observed (36De Yoreo J.J. Wierzbicki A. Dove P.M. Crystengcomm. 2007; 9: 1144-1152Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Teng H.H. Dove P.M. Orme C.A. De Yoreo J.J. Science. 1998; 282: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Because of this interaction between the protein and crystals, the crystal growth kinetics and thermodynamics change and can consequently alter the morphology of crystals in calcium-based biomineralization. While the calcium-based biomineralization attains the amorphous phase and contributes to the final biomineral habit (38Xiao J. Wang Z. Tang Y. Yang S. Langmuir. 2010; 26: 4977-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Radha A.V. Forbes T.Z. Killian C.E. Gilbert P.U. Navrotsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16438-16443Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence of the amorphous phase during magnetite biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria. The morphological regulation in magnetite biomineralization might occur via a mechanism other than calcium-based biomineralization, but the actual mechanism remains largely unknown.In our previous examination of in vitro chemical magnetite synthesis, the Mms6 protein was shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals with cubo-octahedral morphology and a narrow size distribution (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Amemiya Y. Arakaki A. Staniland S.S. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions of the in vitro chemical magnetite synthesis and magnetite formation in bacterial cells are significantly different. However, both processes indicated that Mms6 mediates the formation of uniform magnetite crystals with cubo-octahedral morphology consisting of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal faces. In contrast, in the absence of Mms6 protein, magnetite crystals mainly consisting of (1 1 1) faces were formed in vitro, while during in vivo magnetite formation, indefinite crystal morphologies were formed in the Δmms6 strain. This may be rationalized on the basis of the differences of the reaction conditions used in the in vivo and in vitro. The observed crystal defects and reduced size in the Δmms6 strain also suggests alternative functions of Mms6, such as the surface stabilization of magnetite crystal growth. Another potential function of the Mms6 protein could be to scaffold/stabilize these protein complexes to properly localize them onto the magnetite crystal surfaces. The lack of the Mms6 protein on the magnetite crystals may delocalize and/or enhance the degradation of other proteins.Various morphologies with high-index crystal faces were identified in the Δmms6 strain. Such faces usually possess higher surface energy and tend to form on the crystal surface to increase the portion of the low-index faces (40Tian N. Zhou Z.Y. Sun S.G. Ding Y. Wang Z.L. Science. 2007; 316: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). The observation in the Δmms6 strain was therefore unexpected, and this is probably due to the effects provided by cellular components and/or peculiar conditions within the magnetosome vesicle. It is also interesting that the crystals were observed to elongate toward the <1 1 1> direction in the Δmms6 strain. If the Mms6 protein (complex) regulates simple homogeneous crystal growth, the deficiency is likely to cause formation of the spherical or homogeneously minimized crystals. As the elongated crystal was revealed based on the mms6 gene deletion, we suggest that the biological molecule could regulate the orientation of crystal growth at the nano-sized scale and another unknown biological molecule might induce the magnetite crystal to grow toward the <1 1 1> direction in magnetotactic bacteria.Four proteins (Mms5, Mms6, Mms7/MamD, and Mms13/MamC) have been identified on the magnetite crystal surface (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The majority of these proteins were extracted by treatment using 1% SDS with boiling. The tight association of proteins with the magnetite surface was considered to be due to the presence of acidic amino acids, and their specific association with magnetite crystal. In addition, the common N-terminal hydrophobic regions of proteins have been considered to play a role in self-assembly of these proteins on the magnetite crystal surface to accelerate and/or direct the shape and size (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The result of this study revealed that the deletion of the mms6 gene significantly reduces the homeostasis of the other proteins on the crystal surface. Furthermore, the absence of these proteins resulted in formation of magnetite crystals with reduced sizes and undefined crystal morphologies. This result is consistent with our previous observation (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and strongly suggests that these proteins are associated with each other, and that they may co-localize on the surface of magnetite in the form of protein complexes. In addition, these proteins are considered to have similar functions and to cooperate in the formation of magnetite with a consistent crystal surface. To fully understand the interaction and function of these protein complexes, further studies that include crystallographic structures of other gene mutants and multiple gene mutations combined with mms6 will be required.The Mms7/MamD and Mms13/MamC protein functions have been also analyzed using the mutant mamGFDC gene operon in closely related species (19Scheffel A. Gärdes A. Grünberg K. Wanner G. Schüler D. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in M. gryphiswaldense MSR-1, the genes encoding Mms7/MamD and Mms13/MamC play a role in controlling the size of the magnetite crystals. Their protein homologs are also found in M. magneticum AMB-1. Although the magnetite crystals were not studied in detail in the mamGFDC mutant of M. gryphiswaldense MSR-1, it was observed that the size of the magnetite crystals had clearly decreased. In our study, the mms6 gene deletion from the M. magneticum AMB-1 genome caused a drastic decrease in protein expression levels, including the levels of the Mms7/MamD and Mms13/MamC proteins in the magnetite crystal surface (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S5), and a decrease in the crystal size (Fig. 2). This observation clearly shows the contribution of Mms6 (complexes) in magnetite biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria.Recent genome sequence analyses have clarified that the genes encoding magnetosome membrane proteins are conserved in phylogenetically diverse magnetotactic bacteria within the form of genomic island known as MAI. From the analyses of the MAI gene region, the proteins presumed to be involved in morphological regulation and possessing the Leucine-Glycine repeat motif and Mms13/MamC were commonly identified in 5 strains belonging to α-Proteobacteria (M. magneticum strain AMB-1, M. magnetotacticum strain MS-1, M. gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1, marine magnetotactic vibrio strain MV-1, and marine magnetotactic coccus strain MC-1), although the gene components and their amino acid sequences exhibit some variety among different strains (41Matsunaga T.

Ross C.A. Schüler D. Cox B.L. Nealson K.H. Bazylinski D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 4835-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Strains AMB-1, MSR-1, MV-1, and MC-1 that form cubo-octahedral magnetite crystals consisting of (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) faces possess 4, 3, 3, and 3 putative proteins similar to the presumed morphological regulation protein in MAI, respectively (41Matsunaga T.

Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, the genes encoding these proteins are absent in the genome of Desulfovibrio magneticus RS-1 that synthesizes irregular bullet-shaped magnetite crystals (45Nakazawa H. Arakaki A. Narita-Yamada S. Yashiro I. Jinno K. Aoki N. Tsuruyama A. Okamura Y. Tanikawa S. Fujita N. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T.

This observation also suggests that the genes are common in magnetotactic bacteria, which form magnetite crystals with cubo-octahedral morphology, and that strain RS-1 may have different morphological control factors in its magnetosome synthesis mechanism. Further identification of these genetic factors in other magnetotactic bacteria, which synthesize various magnetite crystals with different sizes and morphologies will allow us to design and control magnetic materials in vivo and in vitro.In conclusion, the Δmms6 strain synthesizes magnetite crystals of smaller sizes and lower shape factors relative to the wild-type strain and the complementation strain. The crystals revealed that the crystal faces (2 1 0), (2 1 1), and (3 1 1) are produced by the Δmms6 strain, while the wild type synthesizes magnetite crystals having (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) faces. We, therefore, conclude that Mms6 functions in the regulation of crystal surfaces to control the magnetite crystal morphology during crystal growth in magnetotactic bacterial cells. This is the first example of a protein being involved in the regulation of a nano-sized crystallographic structure in in vivo biomineralization. IntroductionThe control of morphology and size of nano-sized crystals by biological systems under ambient conditions has the potential to be adapted to wide-ranging industrial, biomedical, and electronic applications (1Hu X.

Living organisms perform various mineral depositions in construction of structures such as shells, teeth, and bones in which morphologies are strictly controlled using biological molecules in biomineralization processes (3Oaki Y. Kotachi A. Miura T. Imai H. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2006; 16: 1633-1639Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Wang T. Cölfen H. Antonietti M. J. Am. Chem.

These biomineralization mechanisms have captured the imagination of material scientists engaged in development of bottom-up syntheses of various materials under mild conditions. Ansocalcin, a protein isolated from goose eggshell matrix, induces the construction of spherical calcite polycrystalline aggregates (6Lakshminarayanan R. Kini R.M. Valiyaveettil S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5155-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Osteopontin, a protein that is abundant in urine, interacts with the specific crystal edges of calcium oxalate and influences the morphology of the crystals (7Taller A. Grohe B. Rogers K.A. Goldberg H.A. Hunter G.K. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1768-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been determined that hierarchical organized structures with highly uniform pseudo-hexagonal structures are involved in the formation of the sturdy nacreous layer of mollusk shells and that rhombohedral nano-sized crystals are involved in the development of egg shells (3Oaki Y. Kotachi A. Miura T. Imai H. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2006; 16: 1633-1639Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Cölfen H. Antonietti M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

However, the functions of proteins in the development of morphology and/or size control during biomineralization were mainly demonstrated by in vitro studies of chemical synthesis using purified proteins or synthetic peptides. Direct evidence of the protein-mediated control in vivo has not been elucidated to date. In particular, the morphology and size regulation mechanisms of single crystalline nano-sized biominerals are still unclear.Magnetotactic bacteria provide an ideal model organism for investigating the mechanism of nano-sized biomineral formation including size and morphological regulation, because the cells synthesize highly controlled single crystalline magnetites (magnetosomes). These microorganisms are thought to orient their cells in the geomagnetic field and to swim toward their preferred microaerobic environment. Previous molecular studies have revealed that magnetosomes are formed by a unique set of proteins in magnetotactic bacteria. Briefly, magnetosome vesicles are formed from the cytoplasmic membrane through an invagination process (10Tanaka M. Okamura Y. Arakaki A. Tanaka T. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 5234-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and the vesicles are then aligned along the actin-like filamentous protein within the cells (11Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 12Taoka A. Asada R. Wu L.F. Fukumori Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8737-8740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Magnetite crystals are formed within magnetosomes in a highly controlled manner. The crystal formation is also presumed to involve several processes, such as nucleation, growth, and morphological regulation.Within the magnetotactic bacteria, various magnetite crystals with narrow and species-specific sizes and morphologies including cubo-octahedra, elongated hexahedra, and bullet shapes have been observed under various environmental conditions (13Pósfai M. Buseck P.R. Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Am. Mineral. 1998; 83: 1469-1481Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Nat. Rev.

This has led to the proposal that magnetotactic bacteria exert significant regulation of the magnetite biomineralization process using specifically produced biological molecules. In our previous study, we identified a series of proteins, which are tightly bound to magnetite crystals in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. These proteins include Mms5, Mms6, Mms7/MamD, and Mms13/MamC (16Arakaki A. Webb J. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, Mms6 possesses a hydrophobic Leucine-Glycine repeat motif at the N terminus and the hydrophilic region of the C terminus, which is thought to interact with magnetite crystal and iron ions (17Amemiya Y. Arakaki A. Staniland S.S. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Arakaki A. Masuda F. Amemiya Y. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. J. Colloid. Interface. Sci. 2010; 343: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The recombinant Mms6 protein has been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystal"
https://openalex.org/W1997865382,"Background Recent reports have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate vital immunological processes and have emerged as key regulators of immune system development and function. Therefore, it is important to determine miRNA dysregulation and its pathogenic contribution in autoimmune diseases, an aspect not adequately addressed thus far. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we profiled miRNA expressions in splenic lymphocytes from three murine lupus models (MRL-lpr, B6-lpr and NZB/WF1) with different genetic background by miRNA microarray assays and Real-time RT-PCR. Despite the genetic differences among these three lupus stains, a common set of dysregulated miRNAs (miR-182-96-183 cluster, miR-31, and miR-155) was identified in splenocytes when compared with age-matched control mice. The association of these miRNAs with the disease was highlighted by our observation that this miRNA expression pattern was evident in NZB/W mice only at an age when lupus disease is manifested. Further, we have shown that the miRNA dysregulation in MRL-lpr mice was not simply due to the activation of splenocytes. By Real-time RT-PCR, we confirmed that these miRNAs were upregulated in both purified splenic B and T cells from MRL-lpr mice. miR-127 and miR-379, which were greatly upregulated in splenocytes from lpr mice, were moderately increased in diseased NZB/W mice. In addition, Real-time RT-PCR revealed that miR-146a, miR-101a, and miR-17-92 were also markedly upregulated in splenic T, but not B cells from MRL-lpr mice. Conclusions/Significance The identification of common lupus disease-associated miRNAs now forms the basis for the further investigation of the pathogenic contribution of these miRNAs in autoimmune lupus, which will advance our knowledge of the role of miRNAs in autoimmunity. Given that miRNAs are conserved, with regard to both evolution and function, our observation of a common lupus disease-associated miRNA expression pattern in murine lupus models is likely to have significant pathogenic, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic implications in human lupus."

In this study, we focused on an NADPH-dependent detoxification of reactive carbonyls in plants and explored the enzyme system involved in this detoxification process. Using acrolein (CH2 = CHCHO) as a model α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, we purified a predominant NADPH-dependent acrolein-reducing enzyme from cucumber leaves, and we identified the enzyme as an alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AOR) catalyzing reduction of an α,β-unsaturated bond. Cloning of cDNA encoding AORs revealed that cucumber contains two distinct AORs, chloroplastic AOR and cytosolic AOR. Homologs of cucumber AORs were found among various plant species, including Arabidopsis, and we confirmed that a homolog of Arabidopsis (At1g23740) also had AOR activity. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these AORs belong to a novel class of AORs. They preferentially reduced α,β-unsaturated ketones rather than α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Furthermore, we selected candidates of other classes of enzymes involved in NADPH-dependent reduction of carbonyls based on the bioinformatic information, and we found that an aldo-keto reductase (At2g37770) and aldehyde reductases (At1g54870 and At3g04000) were implicated in the reduction of an aldehyde group of saturated aldehydes and methylglyoxal as well as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in chloroplasts.

https://openalex.org/W2049757552,"Preferential repair of bulky DNA adducts from the transcribed genes via nucleotide excision repair is well characterized in mammalian cells. However, definitive evidence is lacking for similar repair of oxidized bases, the major endogenous DNA lesions. Here we show that the oxidized base-specific human DNA glycosylase NEIL2 associates with RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (hnRNP-U), both in vitro and in cells. NEIL2 immunocomplexes from cell extracts preferentially repaired the mutagenic cytosine oxidation product 5-hydroxyuracil in the transcribed strand. In a reconstituted system, we also observed NEIL2-initiated transcription-dependent base excision repair of 5-hydroxyuracil in the transcribed strand, with hnRNP-U playing a critical role. Chromatin immunoprecipitation/reimmunoprecipitation studies showed association of NEIL2, RNA polymerase II, and hnRNP-U on transcribed but not on transcriptionally silent genes. Furthermore, NEIL2-depleted cells accumulated more DNA damage in active than in silent genes. These results strongly support the preferential role of NEIL2 in repairing oxidized bases in the transcribed genes of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2156575753,"Several ribosomal proteins regulate p53 function by modulating MDM2. We recently found that RPS27L, a RPS27-like protein, is a direct p53-inducible target. Here we showed that RPS27 itself is a p53-repressible target. Furthermore, the N-terminal region of either RPS27L or RPS27 binds to MDM2 on the central acidic domain of MDM2. RPS27L or RPS27 forms an in vivo triplex with MDM2-p53 and competes with p53 for MDM2 binding. Similar to p53, RPS27L, but not RPS27, is a short-lived protein and a novel MDM2 substrate. Degradation of RPS27L requires the RING or acidic domain of MDM2. Ectopic expression of RPS27L or RPS27 inhibits MDM-2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and increases p53 levels by extending p53 protein half-life, whereas siRNA silencing of RPS27L decreases p53 levels by shortening p53 half-life, with a corresponding reduction in p53 transcription activity. RPS27L is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but upon p53-activating signals, a portion of RPS27L shuttled to the nucleoplasm where it colocalizes with MDM2. Both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear p53, induced by ribosomal stress, were reduced upon RPS27L silencing. Our study reveals a multilevel interplay between RPS27L/S27 and p53-MDM2 axis, with RPS27L functioning as a p53 target, a MDM2 substrate and a p53 regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2066507447,"Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli translocate many proteins into the host cell to promote virulence. The structure of one of these proteins, EspG from E. coli O157:H7, has been determined in a complex with two host enzymes and its mechanism dissected. These structures reveal how EspG disrupts endomembrane trafficking pathways by specifically recognizing the GTP-bound active state of the host's ARF6 enzyme during the vesicle budding reaction at membrane organelles. EspG directly activates PAK kinase by trapping an unfolded transition state in the kinase activation cascade. Pathogenic Escherichia coli translocate many proteins into the host cell to promote virulence. It is now shown that one of these proteins, EspG, which is present in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, interferes with the host signalling network. The fidelity and specificity of information flow within a cell is controlled by scaffolding proteins that assemble and link enzymes into signalling circuits1,2. These circuits can be inhibited by bacterial effector proteins that post-translationally modify individual pathway components3,4,5,6. However, there is emerging evidence that pathogens directly organize higher-order signalling networks through enzyme scaffolding7,8, and the identity of the effectors and their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here we identify the enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 type III effector EspG as a regulator of endomembrane trafficking using a functional screen, and report ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) as its relevant host substrates. The 2.5 Å crystal structure of EspG in complex with ARF6 shows how EspG blocks GTPase-activating-protein-assisted GTP hydrolysis, revealing a potent mechanism of GTPase signalling inhibition at organelle membranes. In addition, the 2.8 Å crystal structure of EspG in complex with the autoinhibitory Iα3-helix of PAK2 defines a previously unknown catalytic site in EspG and provides an allosteric mechanism of kinase activation by a bacterial effector. Unexpectedly, ARF and PAKs are organized on adjacent surfaces of EspG, indicating its role as a ‘catalytic scaffold’ that effectively reprograms cellular events through the functional assembly of GTPase-kinase signalling complex."
https://openalex.org/W2008498482,"Understanding the molecular features of specific tumors can increase our knowledge about the mechanism(s) underlying disease development and progression. This is particularly significant for colorectal cancer, which is a heterogeneous complex of diseases developed in a sequential manner through a multistep carcinogenic process. As such, it is likely that tumors with similar characteristics might originate in the same manner and have a similar molecular behavior. Therefore, specific mapping of the molecular features can be potentially useful for both tumor classification and the development of appropriate therapeutic regimens. However, this can only be accomplished by developing high-affinity molecular probes with the ability to recognize specific markers associated with different tumors. Aptamers can most easily meet this challenge based on their target diversity, flexible manipulation and ease of development.Using a method known as cell-based Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (cell-SELEX) and colorectal cancer cultured cell lines DLD-1 and HCT 116, we selected a panel of target-specific aptamers. Binding studies by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showed that these aptamers have high affinity and selectivity. Our data further show that these aptamers neither recognize normal colon cells (cultured and fresh), nor do they recognize most other cancer cell lines tested.The selected aptamers can identify specific biomarkers associated with colorectal cancers. We believe that these probes could be further developed for early disease detection, as well as prognostic markers, of colorectal cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2093174559,"Even if it doesn't trigger action potential, a slight somatic depolarization can still spread and modulate the neurotransmitter release at distant sites along axons. Here, the authors find that depolarization in the cerebellar molecular layer interneurons can affect presynaptic neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel–dependent manner. In many neurons, subthreshold somatic depolarization can spread electrotonically into the axon and modulate subsequent spike-evoked transmission. Although release probability is regulated by intracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+ dependence of this modulatory mechanism has been debated. Using paired recordings from synaptically connected molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the rat cerebellum, we observed Ca2+-mediated strengthening of release following brief subthreshold depolarization of the soma. Two-photon microscopy revealed that, at the axon, somatic depolarization evoked Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and facilitated spike-evoked Ca2+ entry. Exogenous Ca2+ buffering diminished these Ca2+ transients and eliminated the strengthening of release. Axonal Ca2+ entry elicited by subthreshold somatic depolarization also triggered asynchronous transmission that may deplete vesicle availability and thereby temper release strengthening. In this cerebellar circuit, activity-dependent presynaptic plasticity depends on Ca2+ elevations resulting from both sub- and suprathreshold electrical activity initiated at the soma."
https://openalex.org/W2040624085,"Deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp2 in mice is shown to induce malformations in the craniofacial regions. Wwp2 mono-ubiquitylates Goosecoid, a modification found to be essential for Goosecoid effects on the transcription of the cartilage regulatory protein Sox6. Craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) are the most frequently occurring human congenital disease, and a major cause of infant mortality and childhood morbidity. Although CFAs seems to arise from a combination of genetic factors and environmental influences, the underlying gene defects and pathophysiological mechanisms for most CFAs are currently unknown. Here we reveal a role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp2 in regulating craniofacial patterning. Mice deficient in Wwp2 develop malformations of the craniofacial region. Wwp2 is present in cartilage where its expression is controlled by Sox9. Our studies demonstrate that Wwp2 influences craniofacial patterning through its interactions with Goosecoid (Gsc), a paired-like homeobox transcription factor that has an important role in craniofacial development. We show that Wwp2-associated Gsc is a transcriptional activator of the key cartilage regulatory protein Sox6. Wwp2 interacts with Gsc to facilitate its mono-ubiquitylation, a post-translational modification required for optimal transcriptional activation of Gsc. Our results identify for the first time a physiological pathway regulated by Wwp2 in vivo, and also a unique non-proteolytic mechanism through which Wwp2 controls craniofacial development."
https://openalex.org/W2051328153,"Background Celastrol is a natural proteasome inhibitor that exhibits promising anti-tumor effects in human malignancies, especially the androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) with constitutive NF-κB activation. Celastrol induces apoptosis by means of proteasome inhibition and suppresses prostate tumor growth. However, the detailed mechanism of action remains elusive. In the current study, we aim to test the hypothesis that celastrol suppresses AIPC progression via inhibiting the constitutive NF-κB activity as well as modulating the Bcl-2 family proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the efficacy of celastrol both in vitro and in vivo, and evaluated the role of NF-κB in celastrol-mediated AIPC regression. We found that celastrol inhibited cell proliferation in all three AIPC cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and CL1), with IC50 in the range of 1–2 µM. Celastrol also suppressed cell migration and invasion. Celastrol significantly induced apoptosis as evidenced by increased sub-G1 population, caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, celastrol promoted cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and activated the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa. In addition, celastrol rapidly blocked cytosolic IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA. Likewise, celastrol inhibited the expression of multiple NF-κB target genes that are involved in proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis. Celastrol suppressed AIPC tumor progression by inhibiting proliferation, increasing apoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis, in PC-3 xenograft model in nude mouse. Furthermore, increased cellular IκBα and inhibited expression of various NF-κB target genes were observed in tumor tissues. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that, via targeting the proteasome, celastrol suppresses proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis by inducing the apoptotic machinery and attenuating constitutive NF-κB activity in AIPC both in vitro and in vivo. Celastrol as an active ingredient of traditional herbal medicine could thus be developed as a new therapeutic agent for hormone-refractory prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2012204251,"During development, haemogenesis occurs invariably at sites of vasculogenesis. Between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5 in mice, endothelial cells in the caudal part of the dorsal aorta generate haematopoietic stem cells and are referred to as haemogenic endothelium. The mechanisms by which haematopoiesis is restricted to this domain, and how the morphological transformation from endothelial to haematopoietic is controlled are unknown. We show here that HoxA3, a gene uniquely expressed in the embryonic but not yolk sac vasculature, restrains haematopoietic differentiation of the earliest endothelial progenitors, and induces reversion of the earliest haematopoietic progenitors into CD41-negative endothelial cells. This reversible modulation of endothelial-haematopoietic state is accomplished by targeting key haematopoietic transcription factors for downregulation, including Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1. Through loss-of-function, and gain-of-function epistasis experiments, and the identification of antipodally regulated targets, we show that among these factors, Runx1 is uniquely able to erase the endothelial program set up by HoxA3. These results suggest both why a frank endothelium does not precede haematopoiesis in the yolk sac, and why haematopoietic stem cell generation requires Runx1 expression only in endothelial cells."

Thus, the identification of ADAM substrates may unveil novel components and mechanisms of cell signaling pathways. We report the identification of the transmembrane protein vasorin (VASN), a transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) trap, as a substrate of ADAM17. The metalloprotease efficiently generates a soluble fragment encompassing the extracellular domain of VASN. Despite the importance of TGFβ in normal development and tumor progression, the regulation of VASN is completely unknown. Here, we show that only the soluble form of VASN inhibits TGFβ and that the secretion of VASN is tightly controlled by ADAM17. Hence, inhibition of ADAM17 leads to the upregulation of TGFβ signaling. Adding a new level of complexity to the function of ADAM17, we finally show that, through the cleavage of VASN, the metalloprotease controls TGFβ-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition."

Degradation of Bicoid by the F-box protein Fsd is shown to be required for the correct gradient profile of bicoid and developmental fate determination. Bicoid (Bcd) is a morphogenetic protein that instructs patterning along the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Despite extensive studies, what controls the formation of a normal concentration gradient of Bcd remains an unresolved and controversial question. Here, we show that Bcd protein degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We have identified an F-box protein, encoded by fates-shifted (fsd), that has an important role in Bcd protein degradation by targeting it for ubiquitylation. Embryos from females lacking fsd have an altered Bcd gradient profile, resulting in a shift of the fatemap along the A–P axis. Our study is an experimental demonstration that, contrary to an alternative hypothesis, Bcd protein degradation is required for normal gradient formation and developmental fate determination."
https://openalex.org/W2137042977,"N-Glycosylation, a major co- and post-translational event in the synthesis of proteins in eukaryotes, is unknown in aquatic photosynthetic microalgae. In this paper, we describe the N-glycosylation pathway in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Bio-informatic analysis of its genome revealed the presence of a complete set of sequences potentially encoding for proteins involved in the synthesis of the lipid-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol N-glycan, some subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, as well as endoplasmic reticulum glucosidases and chaperones required for protein quality control and, finally, the α-mannosidase I involved in the trimming of the N-glycan precursor into Man-5 N-glycan. Moreover, one N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, a Golgi glycosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of complex type N-glycans, was predicted in the P. tricornutum genome. We demonstrated that this gene encodes for an active N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, which is able to restore complex type N-glycans maturation in the Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 mutant, defective in its endogeneous N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Consistent with these data, the structural analyses of N-linked glycans demonstrated that P. tricornutum proteins carry mainly high mannose type N-glycans ranging from Man-5 to Man-9. Although representing a minor glycan population, paucimannose N-glycans were also detected, suggesting the occurrence of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-dependent maturation of N-glycans in this diatom. N-Glycosylation, a major co- and post-translational event in the synthesis of proteins in eukaryotes, is unknown in aquatic photosynthetic microalgae. In this paper, we describe the N-glycosylation pathway in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Bio-informatic analysis of its genome revealed the presence of a complete set of sequences potentially encoding for proteins involved in the synthesis of the lipid-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol N-glycan, some subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, as well as endoplasmic reticulum glucosidases and chaperones required for protein quality control and, finally, the α-mannosidase I involved in the trimming of the N-glycan precursor into Man-5 N-glycan. Moreover, one N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, a Golgi glycosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of complex type N-glycans, was predicted in the P. tricornutum genome. We demonstrated that this gene encodes for an active N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, which is able to restore complex type N-glycans maturation in the Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 mutant, defective in its endogeneous N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Consistent with these data, the structural analyses of N-linked glycans demonstrated that P. tricornutum proteins carry mainly high mannose type N-glycans ranging from Man-5 to Man-9. Although representing a minor glycan population, paucimannose N-glycans were also detected, suggesting the occurrence of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-dependent maturation of N-glycans in this diatom. Microalgae are a group of aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms that are so diverse that they have been gathered in a “paraphylum.” Among these microalgae, diatoms belong to the heterokont group and are responsible for approximately 40% of marine primary productivity (1Nelson D.M. Treguer P. Brzezinski M.A. Leynaert A. Queguiner B. Globalal. Biogeochem. Cycles. 1995; 9: 359-372Crossref Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 2Raven J.A. Waite A.M. New Phytologist. 2004; 162: 45-61Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Despite their physiological relevance in the marine ecosystem, molecular and cellular processes in diatom remain widely unknown. For example, so far, little is known about secretion, post-translational modifications, and intracellular trafficking of proteins in diatoms. Diatom species are usually classified into two major groups, the bi/multipolar centrics and the pennates. Recently, the genome of a pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, became available (3Bowler C. Allen A.E. Badger J.H. Grimwood J. Jabbari K. Kuo A. Maheswari U. Martens C. Maumus F. Otillar R.P.

Access to this data (Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA), together with the fact that P. tricornutum is easy to culture in vitro and can be genetically transformed (4Falciatore A. Bowler C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Scala S. Carels N. Falciatore A. Chiusano M.L. Bowler C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), provides the opportunity to perform comparative genomic studies and to dissect biosynthetic pathways. N-Glycosylation is a major co- and post-translational modification in the synthesis of proteins in eukaryotes. N-Glycan processing occurs in the secretory pathway and is essential for glycoproteins destined to be secreted or integrated in the membranes. In this process, a Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol oligosaccharide intermediate is assembled by the stepwise addition of monosaccharides to dolichol pyrophosphate on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 4The abbreviations used are ER, endoplasmic reticulum; α-Man, α-mannosidase; GnT, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; DMB, 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; RCA 120, R. communis agglutinin 120; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; PNGase A, peptide N-glycosidase A; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; ALG, asparagine-linked glycosylation; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; FucT, fucosyltransferase. This intermediate is then extended in the lumen of the ER until a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol N-glycan precursor is completed (6Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This precursor is transferred by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) multisubunit complex onto the asparagine residue of the consensus Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequences of a target nascent protein (6Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The precursor is then deglucosylated/reglucosylated to ensure the quality control of the neosynthetized protein through the interaction with ER-resident chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin. These ER events are crucial for the proper folding of the secreted proteins and are highly conserved in the eukaryotes investigated so far (7Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). In contrast, evolutionary adaptation of N-glycan processing in the Golgi apparatus has given rise to a large variety of organism-specific complex structures that allow the protein to carry out diverse glycan-mediated biological functions. α-Mannosidase I (α-Man I) located in the early compartment of the Golgi apparatus (Cis cisternae) first degrades the oligosaccharide precursor into high mannose type N-glycans ranging from Man9GlcNAc2 (Man-9) to Man5GlcNAc2 (Man-5). N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I) then transfers the first N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue on the α(1,3)-mannose arm of Man5GlcNAc2, enabling the initiation of the synthesis of multiple structurally different complex type N-glycans. Following GnT I action, α-mannosidase II (α-Man II) and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT II) give rise to the synthesis of the core GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2, which is finally matured into organism-specific complex N-glycans by transfer of various monomers by characteristic glycosyltransferases. GnT I and thus the GnT I-dependent maturation of N-glycans appeared during evolution at the same period as metazoans (8Schachter H. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Complex type N-glycans were demonstrated to be engaged in crucial steps of the development of pluricellular organisms (8Schachter H. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 10Metzler M.

For instance, GnT I-null embryos of mice die at ∼10 days after fertilization, indicating that complex N-glycans are required for morphogenesis in mammals (9Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 10Metzler M. Gertz A. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Schrader J.W. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2056-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of the GnT I in worm and fly reduces their viabilities (8Schachter H. Carbohydr.

In plants, Arabidopsis cgl mutant, defective in GnT I activity, was demonstrated to grow normally in standard culture conditions (12von Schaewen A. Sturm A. O'Neill J. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, these plants exhibited a strong phenotype in salt-induced stress conditions, for example, suggesting a role for mature plant N-glycans in specific physiological processes (13Kang J.S.

In contrast, animal cultured cells having GnT I null mutations usually grow normally (16Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although major data regarding protein N-glycosylation have been established in yeast and higher eukaryotes, nothing is known on N-glycan biosynthesis and structures in microalgae. In this paper, we describe the N-glycosylation pathway in the diatom P. tricornutum. We also demonstrate that the predicted GnT I from P. tricornutum is able to complement the biosynthesis of complex type N-glycans in the CHO Lec1 mutant, which is defective in its endogenous GnT I. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of a N-glycan glycosyltransferase from microalgae.

The GenBankTM accession number for Triticum aestivum was ABT33168. The JGI accession numbers were: Micromonas pusilla CCMP1545 (jgi|MicpuC2|32201|estExt_Genewise1Plus.C_30312); Emiliania huxleyi (jgi|Emihu1|460566|estExtDG_Genemark1.C_13800003); Fragilariopsis cylindrus (jgi|Fracy1|189180|e_gw1.9.153.1); P. tricornutum (GenBankTM TPABK007891); and Thalassosira pseudonana (jgi|Thaps3|1600|fgenesh1_pg.C_chr_1000734). The strain of P. tricornutum P.t1.8.6 (CCAP1055/1) was grown in batch culture method using 2-liter flat-bottomed flasks. The nutritive medium used for this experiment consisted of natural seawater, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, enriched in Conway medium (24Walne P.R. Fisheries Invest. 1966; 2: 1-52Google Scholar) and containing 40 mg·liter−1 sodium metasilicate. Diatom cells were maintained at 20 °C under continuous illumination (280–350 μmol photons m−2·s−1). The cells (20 × 106 cells·ml−1) were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was freeze-dried before biochemical analyses. P. tricornutum were grown in continuous culture conditions as described previously (25Bougaran G. Le Dean L. Lukomska E. Kaas R. Baron R. Aquat. Living Resour. 2003; 16: 389-394Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for real time quantitative PCR experiments. At the steady state (15–20 × 106 cells·ml−1), five samples (30 ml of each in triplicate) were harvested at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed rapidly, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol, immediately frozen, and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol method and then treated with RQ1 DNase to avoid DNA contamination and finally purified using the RNeasy mini kit. cDNA templates for PCR amplification were synthesized from 350 ng of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. Quantitative PCR was performed using Power SYBR® Green I PCR master mix in a final volume reaction of 25 μl. All of the reactions were performed following the instructions of the manufacturer with 5 μl of diluted cDNA (1/10) and 0.1 μm of specific primers. Quantitative measurements were performed in duplicate with a Stratagene Mx3000PTM Q-PCR system. The cycling parameters were one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. The results were represented as the relative gene expression normalized to reference genes encoding for ribosomal protein small subunit 30 S and histone H4 (26Siaut M. Heijde M. Mangogna M. Montsant A. Coesel S. Allen A. Manfredonia A. Falciatore A. Bowler C. Gene. 2007; 406: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Specific primers for the catalytic domain of the P. tricornutum GnT I gene (GNT1-Q-Fwd, 5′-CGTACGAATCGCCCTTACTC-3′; and GNT1-Q-Rev, 5′-TTGCCGTCTTGTGAAATTACC-3′) were designed using the Primer3Plus program. The relative GnT I gene expression analysis was performed using the method already described (27Chung C.C. Hwang S.P. Chang J. Appl. Environ Microbiol. 2005; 71: 8744-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Kang L.K. Hwang S.P.L. Lin H.J. Chen P.C. Chang J. J. Phycol. 2009; 45: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) where the comparative CT method (29Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar) and standard curve method were combined to calculate RNA molar ratio between the target and housekeeping genes (28Kang L.K. Hwang S.P.L. Lin H.J. Chen P.C. Chang J. J. Phycol. 2009; 45: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from P. tricornutum cell pellets as described in Ref. 30Falciatore A. Casotti R. Leblanc C. Abrescia C. Bowler C. Mar. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar. The GnT I gene was amplified from P. tricornutum genomic DNA using primers 5′-ATGCGGTTGTGGAAACGTAC-3′ and 5′-TCTTTTCGGTGACGGAATG-3′ and Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR enzyme mix. Then this GnT I gene was cloned according to the supplier's instructions in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector, leading to the expression of the P. tricornutum GnT I fused with the V5 epitope under the control of the T7 promoter. This construction pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-GnT I was sequenced and presented the following mutations: Gln-130 → Arg; Val-148 → Ile; Gly-159 → Ser; Lys-196 → Gln; Val-337 → Ala; and Asn-422 → Tyr (GenBankTM BankIt 1370344). CHO Lec1 mutant cells were transfected by electroporation with this construct. The cells were trypsinized (0.05%), triturated in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 100 μl of solution V for nucleofection by an Amaxa Nucleofector device set to program U-016 with the linearized pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-GnT I and 500 μg of sterile sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Then the transfection was followed by repetitive rounds of limiting dilution of cells in 400 μg·ml−1 of geneticin for selection. CHO wild type and CHO Lec1 mutant were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. CHO Lec1 mutant complemented with P. tricornutum GnT I was grown in the same conditions with 600 μg·ml−1 of geneticin. Two g of lyophilized P. tricornutum cells were lysed in 750 mm Tris-HCl pH 8 buffer containing 15% (w/v) of sucrose, 2% (v/v) of β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (extraction buffer). The cell lysis was done in a 50-ml BigD Lysing tube and assisted by the Fastprep 24 (15 times 30 s at 6 m·s−1). The mixture was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 4,000 × g. The pellet was washed once with 10 ml of extraction buffer and spun again at 4 °C for 5 min at 4,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were pooled prior to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then dialyzed against water for 48 h at 4 °C prior to lyophilization. Protein quantification was then performed using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as protein standard. Proteins from green onion were prepared in parallel and used as a positive control for affino- and immunodetection analyses. Fifty μg of total protein extract from P. tricornutum were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Ponceau Red to control the transfer efficiency. Affinodetections were carried out as described previously (31Fitchette A.C. Tran Dinh O. Faye L. Bardor M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 355: 317-342PubMed Google Scholar) using concanavalin A or biotinylated lectins such as phytohemagglutinin E and L, E. crista galli agglutinin, RCA 120, and peanut agglutinin. Biotinylated lectins were detected using streptavidin coupled with horseradish peroxidase, and concanavalin A was directly detected by horseradish peroxidase. Final developments of the blots were obtained using 4-chloro-1-naphtol or ECL as substrate. Immunodetections were performed using specific core β(1,2)-xylose and core α(1,3)-fucose antibodies as reported previously (32Faye L. Gomord V. Fitchette-Lainé A.C. Chrispeels M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the glycan moiety of glycoproteins was carried out on the blots using sodium periodate according to (33Fitchette-Lainé A.C. Denmat L.A. Lerouge P. Faye L. Methods Biotechnol. 1998; 3: 271-290Crossref Google Scholar). Immunodetection with anti-V5 antibodies was performed following the instructions of the supplier for dilution of the antibody and revelation (ECL kit). For deglycosylation with PNGase F, 0.5 mg of proteins was dissolved in 2 ml of a 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% SDS. The sample was then heated for 5 min at 100 °C for protein denaturation. After cooling down, 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 were added to the sample. Digestion was performed with 10 units of PNGase F for 24 h at 37 °C. For deglycosylation by Endo H, 0.5 mg of protein extract was dissolved in 1% SDS and denaturated by heating for 5 min at 100 °C. The sample was then diluted five times in 500 μl of 150 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.7, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 10 milliunits of Endo H. Finally, proteins digested from either PNGase F or Endo H were precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of ethanol overnight at −20 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and affinodetected with concanavalin A as reported previously (31Fitchette A.C. Tran Dinh O. Faye L. Bardor M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 355: 317-342PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro galactosylation was performed by treating 50 μg of protein at 37 °C for 24 h with 50 milliunits of β(1,4)-galactosyltransferase from bovine milk in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.4, supplemented with 5 μmol of UDP-galactose and 5 μmol of MnCl2 (34Bardor M. Loutelier-Bourhis C. Paccalet T. Cosette P. Fitchette A.C. Vézina L.P. Trépanier S. Dargis M. Lemieux R. Lange C. Faye L. Lerouge P. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2003; 1: 451-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was then freeze-dried. Proteins and glycoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane.

For N-glycan profiling, both PNGase A and PNGase F were used. In contrast to PNGase F, PNGase A is able to release N-linked oligosaccharides carrying a fucose α(1,3)-linked to the proximal glucosamine residue (38Tretter V. Altmann F. März L. Eur. J.

For PNGase A, 5 mg of freeze-dried proteins were resuspended in 3 ml of 4 m Tris-guanidine HCl, pH 8.5, prior to denaturation with a 2 mg·ml−1 DTT solution. After a short 30 s sonication, the sample was incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. 1.5 ml of iodoacetamide, prepared in 0.6 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, at 12 mg·ml−1, was then added to the sample, which was incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. The sample was dialyzed for 72 h against water. The proteins were digested at 37 °C for 48 h with 10 mg of pepsin dissolved in 2 ml of 10 mm HCl, pH 2.2. After neutralization with 1 m ammonium hydroxide, the solution was heated for 5 min at 100 °C and lyophilized. Glycopeptides were then deglycosylated overnight at 37 °C with 1.5 milliunits of PNGase A in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. N-Glycans released by either PNGase A or F were purified by successive elutions through a C18 and a Carbograph cartridges according to Ref. 39Bakker H. Bardor M. Molthoff J.W. Gomord V. Elbers I.

A number of human somatic cell types have been reported to generate hiPS cells, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes and peripheral blood cells, with variable reprogramming efficiencies and kinetics. Here, we show that human astrocytes can also be reprogrammed into hiPS (ASThiPS) cells, with similar efficiencies to keratinocytes, which are currently reported to have one of the highest somatic reprogramming efficiencies. ASThiPS lines were indistinguishable from human embryonic stem (ES) cells based on the expression of pluripotent markers and the ability to differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers in vitro by embryoid body generation and in vivo by teratoma formation after injection into immunodeficient mice. Our data demonstrates that a human differentiated neural cell type can be reprogrammed to pluripotency and is consistent with the universality of the somatic reprogramming procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2013772670,"Apoptotic cell corpses are engulfed and removed through an evolutionarily conserved pathway. In Caenorhabditis elegans, inhibition of the Rac GAP SRGP-1 permits sick or dying cells to escape clearance by this pathway. Multicellular animals rapidly clear dying cells from their bodies. Many of the pathways that mediate this cell removal are conserved through evolution. Here, we identify srgp-1 as a negative regulator of cell clearance in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells. Loss of srgp-1 function results in improved engulfment of apoptotic cells, whereas srgp-1 overexpression inhibits apoptotic cell corpse removal. We show that SRGP-1 functions in engulfing cells and functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for CED-10 (Rac1). Interestingly, loss of srgp-1 function promotes not only the clearance of already dead cells, but also the removal of cells that have been brought to the verge of death through sublethal apoptotic, necrotic or cytotoxic insults. In contrast, impaired engulfment allows damaged cells to escape clearance, which results in increased long-term survival. We propose that C. elegans uses the engulfment machinery as part of a primitive, but evolutionarily conserved, survey mechanism that identifies and removes unfit cells within a tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2144134765,"Drosophila Kinesin-73 (Khc-73), which plays a role in mitotic spindle polarity in neuroblasts, is a metazoan-specific member of the Kinesin-3 family of motors, which includes mammalian KIF1A and Caenorhabditis elegans Unc-104. The mechanism of Kinesin-3 motors has been controversial because some studies have reported that they transport cargo as monomers whereas other studies have suggested a dimer mechanism. Here, we have performed single-molecule motility and cell biological studies of Khc-73. We find that constructs containing the motor and the conserved short stretches of putative coiled-coil-forming regions are predominantly monomeric in vitro, but that dimerization allows for fast, processive movement and high force production (7 piconewtons). In Drosophila cell lines, we present evidence that Khc-73 can dimerize in vivo. We also show that Khc-73 is recruited specifically to Rab5-containing endosomes through its ""tail"" domain. Our results suggest that the N-terminal half of Khc-73 can undergo a monomer-dimer transition to produce a fast processive motor and that its C-terminal half possesses a specific Rab5-vesicle binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W1992043148,"Bone integrity is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteolytic lesions are a painful consequence of metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone in an overwhelming majority of breast cancer patients. Factors secreted by breast cancer cells propel a cascade of events that trigger osteoclastogenesis and elevated bone resorption. In the present study, we show that the Hedgehog (Hh) ligands secreted by breast cancer cells promote osteoclast differentiation and potentiate the activity of mature osteoclasts. Paracrine Hh signaling induced by breast cancer cells mediates a detrimental chain of events by the up-regulation of osteopontin (OPN), which in turn enhances osteoclastic activity by up-regulating cathepsin K and MMP9. Hh signaling is essential for osteoclasts because blocking the Hh pathway using the pharmacological Hh inhibitor, cyclopamine, results in an overall decrease in osteoclastogenesis and resorptive activity. Our studies suggest that inhibiting Hh signaling interferes with the ability of pre-osteoclasts to respond to the stimulatory effects of the breast cancer cells, indicating that Hh signaling is vital to osteoclast activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032053368,"Synapses made by local interneurons dominate the thalamic circuits that process signals traveling from the eye downstream. The anatomical and physiological differences between interneurons and the (relay) cells that project to cortex are vast. To explore how these differences might influence visual processing, we made intracellular recordings from both classes of cells in vivo in cats. Macroscopically, all receptive fields were similar, consisting of two concentrically arranged subregions in which dark and bright stimuli elicited responses of the reverse sign. Microscopically, however, the responses of the two types of cells had opposite profiles. Excitatory stimuli drove trains of single excitatory postsynaptic potentials in relay cells, but graded depolarizations in interneurons. Conversely, suppressive stimuli evoked smooth hyperpolarizations in relay cells and unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in interneurons. Computational analyses suggested that these complementary patterns of response help to preserve information encoded in the fine timing of retinal spikes and to increase the amount of information transmitted to cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2044574428,"Release from growth factor dependence and acquisition of signalling pathway addiction are critical steps in oncogenesis. To identify genes required on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) addiction, we performed a genome-wide short hairpin RNA screen on a v-H-ras-transformed Pten-deficient cell line that displayed two alternative growth modes, interleukin (IL)-3-independent/mTOR-addicted proliferation (transformed growth mode) and IL-3-dependent/mTOR-non-addicted proliferation (normal growth mode). We screened for genes required only in the absence of IL-3 and thus specifically for the transformed growth mode. The top 800 hits from this conditional lethal screen were analyzed in silico and 235 hits were subsequently rescreened in two additional Pten-deficient cell lines to generate a core set of 47 genes. Hits included genes encoding mTOR and the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) component rictor and several genes encoding mitochondrial functions including components of the respiratory chain, adenosine triphosphate synthase, the mitochondrial ribosome and mitochondrial fission factor. Small interfering RNA knockdown against a sizeable fraction of these genes triggered apoptosis in human cancer cell lines but not in normal fibroblasts. We conclude that mTORC2-addicted cells require mitochondrial functions that may be novel drug targets in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2015198164,"Glucose is considered essential for erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Importance of sugar and its permease for hepatic and sexual stages of Plasmodium, however, remains elusive. Moreover, increasing global resistance to current antimalarials necessitates the search for novel drugs. Here, we reveal that hexose transporter 1 (HT1) of Plasmodium berghei can transport glucose (K(m)~87 μM), mannose (K(i)~93 μM), fructose (K(i)~0.54 mM), and galactose (K(i)~5 mM) in Leishmania mexicana mutant and Xenopus laevis; and, therefore, is functionally equivalent to HT1 of P. falciparum (Glc, K(m)~175 μM; Man, K(i)~276 μM; Fru, K(i)~1.25 mM; Gal, K(i)~5.86 mM). Notably, a glucose analog, C3361, attenuated hepatic (IC(50)~15 μM) and ookinete development of P. berghei. The PbHT1 could be ablated during intraerythrocytic stages only by concurrent complementation with PbHT1-HA or PfHT1. Together; these results signify that PbHT1 and glucose are required for the entire life cycle of P. berghei. Accordingly, PbHT1 is expressed in the plasma membrane during all parasite stages. To permit a high-throughput screening of PfHT1 inhibitors and their subsequent in vivo assessment, we have generated Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant expressing codon-optimized PfHT1, and a PfHT1-dependent Δpbht1 parasite strain. This work provides a platform to facilitate the development of drugs against malaria, and it suggests a disease-control aspect by reducing parasite transmission."

Cys-64, -148, -292, -309 and the potential C₈₈xxC₉₁ redox motif in MPYS are indispensable for IFNβ stimulation and IRF3 activation.

https://openalex.org/W1984336779,"P2X receptor channels, which have three α-helical transmembrane domains, are found throughout the nervous system. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the authors find that each of the three subunits contributes equally to the open channel permeation pathway and that the closed-to-open transition involves a symmetrical separation of the three channel subunits. In the closed structure of the P2X cation channel, three α-helical transmembrane domains cross the membrane obliquely. In rat P2X2 receptors, these intersect at Thr339. Replacing Thr339 by lysine in one, two or three subunits progressively increased chloride permeability and reduced unitary conductance. This implies that the closed-open transition involves a symmetrical separation of the three subunits and that Thr339 from each subunit contributes symmetrically to the open channel permeation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1968752993,"The processing mechanisms of visual working memory (VWM) have been extensively explored in the recent decade. However, how the perceptual information is extracted into VWM remains largely unclear. The current study investigated this issue by testing whether the perceptual information was extracted into VWM via an integrated-object manner so that all the irrelevant information would be extracted (object hypothesis), or via a feature-based manner so that only the target-relevant information would be extracted (feature hypothesis), or via an analogous processing manner as that in visual perception (analogy hypothesis).High-discriminable information which is processed at the parallel stage of visual perception and fine-grained information which is processed via focal attention were selected as the representatives of perceptual information. The analogy hypothesis predicted that whereas high-discriminable information is extracted into VWM automatically, fine-grained information will be extracted only if it is task-relevant. By manipulating the information type of the irrelevant dimension in a change-detection task, we found that the performance was affected and the ERP component N270 was enhanced if a change between the probe and the memorized stimulus consisted of irrelevant high-discriminable information, but not if it consisted of irrelevant fine-grained information.We conclude that dissociated extraction mechanisms exist in VWM for information resolved via dissociated processes in visual perception (at least for the information tested in the current study), supporting the analogy hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087174347,"Displacement of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB) from ssDNA is necessary for filament formation of RecA on ssDNA to initiate homologous recombination. The interaction between RecO and SSB is considered to be important for SSB displacement; however, the interaction has not been characterized at the atomic level. In this study, to clarify the mechanism underlying SSB displacement from ssDNA upon RecO binding, we examined the interaction between Thermus thermophilus RecO and cognate SSB by NMR analysis. We found that SSB interacts with the C-terminal positively charged region of RecO. Based on this result, we constructed some RecO mutants. The R127A mutant had considerably decreased binding affinity for SSB and could not anneal SSB-coated ssDNAs. Further, the mutant in the RecOR complex prevented the recovery of ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of RecA from inhibition by SSB. These results indicated that the region surrounding Arg-127 is the binding site of SSB. We also performed NMR analysis using the C-terminal peptide of SSB and found that the acidic region of SSB is involved in the interaction with RecO, as seen in other protein-SSB interactions. Taken together with the findings of previous studies, we propose a model for SSB displacement from ssDNA where the acidic C-terminal region of SSB weakens the ssDNA binding affinity of SSB when the dynamics of the C-terminal region are suppressed by interactions with other proteins, including RecO."
https://openalex.org/W1974602452,"L-fucose is a common constituent of Asn-linked glycans in vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, but in fungal glycoproteins, fucose has not been found so far. However, by mass spectrometry we detected N-glycans and O-glycans containing one to six deoxyhexose residues in fruit bodies of several basidiomycetes. The N-glycans of chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius) contained a deoxyhexose chromatographically identical to fucose and sensitive to α-L-fucosidase. Analysis of individual glycan species by tandem MS, glycosidase digestion, and finally (1)H NMR revealed the presence of L-fucose in α1,6-linkage to an α1,6-mannose of oligomannosidic N-glycans. The substitution by α1,6-mannose of α1,2-mannosyl residues of the canonical precursor structure was yet another hitherto unknown modification. No indication for the occurrence of yet other modifications, e.g. bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, was seen. Besides fucosylated N-glycans, short O-linked mannan chains substituted with fucose were present on chanterelle proteins. Although undiscovered so far, L-fucose appears to represent a prominent feature of protein-linked glycans in the fungal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2037180644,"The polycomb group family protein BMI-1 is overexpressed by and functions as an oncogene in many different human cancers. We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression. In this study, we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells. Using stable retroviral transduction, we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions. Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures, at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death. The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated, in large part, by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). Significantly, we found that YAP levels, activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1. In contrast, YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo–YAP growth-suppressor pathway. Importantly, knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity. Together, these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1, contact inhibition and the Hippo–YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP."
https://openalex.org/W1969729143,"Rab27a, a Rab family small GTPase, is involved in the exocytosis of secretory granules in melanocytes and cytotoxic T-cells. Rab27a mutations cause type 2 Griscelli syndrome, which is characterized by immunodeficiency, including uncontrolled macrophage activation known as hemophagocytic syndrome. However, the role of Rab27a in phagocytosis remains elusive. Here, using macrophage-like differentiated HL-60 cells and C3bi-opsonized zymosan as a pathogen-phagocyte model, we show that Rab27a negatively regulates complement-mediated phagocytic activity in association with F-actin remodeling. We found that transfection of Rab27a shRNA into HL-60 cells enhances complement-mediated phagocytosis. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the elevated phagocytosis in Rab27a knockdown cells, we analyzed the process of phagosome formation focusing on F-actin dynamics: F-actin assembly, followed by F-actin extension around the particles and the subsequent degradation of F-actin, leading to internalization of the particles enclosed in phagosomes. Microscopic analysis revealed that these actin-related processes, including F-actin coating and F-actin degradation, proceed more rapidly in Rab27a knockdown cells than in control HL-60 cells. Both elevated phagocytosis and accelerated F-actin remodeling were restored by expression of rescue-Rab27a and Rab27a-Q78L (GTP-bound form), but not by Rab27a-T23N (GDP-bound form). Furthermore, an increased accumulation of Coronin 1A surrounding F-actin coats was observed in Rab27a knockdown cells, suggesting that the function of Coronin 1A is related to the regulation of the F-actin coating. Our findings demonstrate that Rab27a plays a direct regulatory role in the nascent process of phagocytosis by prolongation of the stage of actin coating via suppression of Coronin 1A. This study may contribute to an explanation of the underlying mechanisms of excessive phagocytosis observed in Griscelli syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2151165669,"Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis (B.p), continues to be a serious public health threat. Vaccination is the most economical and effective strategy for preventing and controlling pertussis. However, few systematic investigations of actual human immune responses to pertussis vaccines have been performed. Therefore, we utilized a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry to reveal the entire antigenic proteome of whole-cell pertussis vaccine (WCV) targeted by the human immune system as a first step toward evaluating the repertoire of human humoral immune responses against WCV.Immunoproteomic profiling of total membrane enriched proteins and extracellular proteins of Chinese WCV strain 58003 identified a total of 30 immunoreactive proteins. Seven are known pertussis antigens including Pertactin, Serum resistance protein, chaperonin GroEL and two OMP porins. Sixteen have been documented to be immunogenic in other pathogens but not in B.p, and the immunogenicity of the last seven proteins was found for the first time. Furthermore, by comparison of the human and murine immunoproteomes of B.p, with the exception of four human immunoreactive proteins that were also reactive with mouse immune sera, a unique group of antigens including more than 20 novel immunoreactive proteins that uniquely reacted with human immune serum was confirmed.This study is the first time that the repertoire of human serum antibody responses against WCV was comprehensively investigated, and a small number of previously unidentified antigens of WCV were also found by means of the classic immunoproteomic strategy. Further research on these newly identified predominant antigens of B.p exclusively against humans will not only remarkably accelerate the development of diagnostic biomarkers and subunit vaccines but also provide detailed insight into human immunity mechanisms against WCV. In particular, this work highlights the heterogeneity of the B.p immunoreactivity patterns of the mouse model and the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2014453670,"Transcription enhancer factor 3 (TEF3) is known to regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes and to play important roles in muscle development and diseases. However, little is known about its role in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Most recently, we discovered a novel function of TEF3, in which TEF3 is required for the up-regulation of a proangiogenic factor, Down syndrome candidate region 1 isoform 1L (DSCR1-1L), induced by VEGF-A(165) in endothelial cells. Overexpression of TEF3 isoform 1 (TEF3-1) is sufficient to induce DSCR1-1L expression. Here, we report that knocking down the expression of TEF3 almost completely inhibits VEGF-A(165)-induced proliferation, migration, tube formation, formation of F-actin stress fiber, and in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis. This inhibition cannot be rescued by DSCR1-1L overexpression. Further, overexpression of TEF3-1, but not its nuclear localization signal-deletion mutant (TEF3-ΔNLS), induces human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, and formation of F-actin stress fiber, even in the absence of VEGF-A(165) stimulation, which is partially inhibited by DSCR1-1L silencing. Our data demonstrate that TEF3, mainly its nuclear localization, is required for VEGF-A(165)-induced endothelial proliferation, migration, tube formation, and in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2145179825,"In spite of its highly immunogenic properties, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) establishes persistent infection in otherwise healthy individuals, making it one of the most widespread and deadly human pathogens. Mtb's prolonged survival may reflect production of microbial factors that prevent even more vigorous immunity (quantitative effect) or that divert the immune response to a non-sterilizing mode (qualitative effect). Disruption of Mtb genes has produced a list of several dozen candidate immunomodulatory factors. Here we used robotic fluorescence microscopy to screen 10,100 loss-of-function transposon mutants of Mtb for their impact on the expression of promoter-reporter constructs for 12 host immune response genes in a mouse macrophage cell line. The screen identified 364 candidate immunoregulatory genes. To illustrate the utility of the candidate list, we confirmed the impact of 35 Mtb mutant strains on expression of endogenous immune response genes in primary macrophages. Detailed analysis focused on a strain of Mtb in which a transposon disrupts Rv0431, a gene encoding a conserved protein of unknown function. This mutant elicited much more macrophage TNFα, IL-12p40 and IL-6 in vitro than wild type Mtb, and was attenuated in the mouse. The mutant list provides a platform for exploring the immunobiology of tuberculosis, for example, by combining immunoregulatory mutations in a candidate vaccine strain."
https://openalex.org/W2025866713,"Microarray analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mRNA transcripts expressed in vivo during animal infection has not been previously used to investigate potential virulence factors needed in this setting. We compared mRNA expression in bacterial cells recovered from the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of P. aeruginosa-colonized mice to that of P. aeruginosa in the drinking water used to colonize the mice. Genes associated with biofilm formation and type III secretion (T3SS) had markedly increased expression in the GI tract. A non-redundant transposon library in P. aeruginosa strain PA14 was used to test mutants in genes identified as having increased transcription during in vivo colonization. All of the Tn-library mutants in biofilm-associated genes had an attenuated ability to form biofilms in vitro, but there were no significant differences in GI colonization and dissemination between these mutants and WT P. aeruginosa PA14. To evaluate T3SS factors, we tested GI colonization and neutropenia-induced dissemination of both deletional (PAO1 and PAK) and insertional (PA14) mutants in four genes in the P. aeruginosa T3SS, exoS or exoU, exoT, and popB. There were no significant differences in GI colonization among these mutant strains and their WT counterparts, whereas rates of survival following dissemination were significantly decreased in mice infected by the T3SS mutant strains. However, there was a variable, strain-dependent effect on overall survival between parental and T3SS mutants. Thus, increased transcription of genes during in vivo murine GI colonization is not predictive of an essential role for the gene product in either colonization or overall survival following induction of neutropenia."
https://openalex.org/W2019948885,"In eukaryotic cells the nuclear envelope isolates and protects DNA from molecules that could damage its structure or interfere with its processing. Moreover, selected protection enzymes and vitamins act as efficient guardians against toxic compounds both in the nucleoplasm and in the cytosol. The observation that a cytosolic detoxifying and antioxidant enzyme i.e. glutathione transferase is accumulated in the perinuclear region of the rat hepatocytes suggests that other unrecognized modalities of nuclear protection may exist. Here we show evidence for the existence of a safeguard enzyme machinery formed by an hyper-crowding of cationic enzymes and proteins encompassing the nuclear membrane and promoted by electrostatic interactions.Electron spectroscopic imaging, zeta potential measurements, isoelectrofocusing, comet assay and mass spectrometry have been used to characterize this surprising structure that is present in the cells of all rat tissues examined (liver, kidney, heart, lung and brain), and that behaves as a ""nuclear shield"". In hepatocytes, this hyper-crowding structure is about 300 nm thick, it is mainly formed by cationic enzymes and the local concentration of key protection enzymes, such as glutathione transferase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase is up to seven times higher than in the cytosol. The catalytic activity of these enzymes, when packed in the shield, is not modified and their relative concentrations vary remarkably in different tissues. Removal of this protective shield renders chromosomes more sensitive to damage by oxidative stress. Specific nuclear proteins anchored to the outer nuclear envelope are likely involved in the shield formation and stabilization.The characterization of this previously unrecognized nuclear shield in different tissues opens a new interesting scenario for physiological and protection processes in eukaryotic cells. Selection and accumulation of protection enzymes near sensitive targets represents a new safeguard modality which deeply differs from the adaptive response which is based on expression of specific enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2099771211,"A phenocopy is defined as an environmentally induced phenotype of one individual which is identical to the genotype-determined phenotype of another individual. The phenocopy phenomenon has been translated to the drug discovery process as phenotypes produced by the treatment of biological systems with new chemical entities (NCE) may resemble environmentally induced phenotypic modifications. Various new chemical entities exerting inhibition of the kinase activity of Transforming Growth Factor β Receptor I (TGF-βR1) were qualified by high-throughput RNA expression profiling. This chemical genomics approach resulted in a precise time-dependent insight to the TGF-β biology and allowed furthermore a comprehensive analysis of each NCE's off-target effects. The evaluation of off-target effects by the phenocopy approach allows a more accurate and integrated view on optimized compounds, supplementing classical biological evaluation parameters such as potency and selectivity. It has therefore the potential to become a novel method for ranking compounds during various drug discovery phases."
https://openalex.org/W2037137403,"Unlike the commonly used method of blue-white screening for gene insertion, a fluorescent protein-based screening method offers a gain-of-function screening process without using any co-factors and a gene fusion product with a fluorescent protein reporter that is further useful in cell imaging studies. However, complications related to protein-folding efficiencies of the gene insert in fusion with fluorescent protein reporters prevent effective on-plate bacterial colony selection leading to its limited use.Here, we present three methods to tackle this problem. Our first method promotes the folding of the gene insert by using an N-terminal protein such as calmodulin that is well folded and expressed. Under this method, fluorescence was increased more than 30x over control allowing for enhanced screening. Our second method creates a fluorescent protein that is N-terminal to the gene upon insertion, thereby reducing the dependency of the fluorescent protein reporter on the folding of the gene insert. Our third method eliminates any dependence of the fluorescent protein reporter on the folding of the gene insert by using a stop and start sequence for protein translation.The three methods together will expand the usefulness of fluorescence on-plate screening and offer a powerful alternative to blue-white screening."
