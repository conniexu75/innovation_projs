https://openalex.org/W2093842300,"Among the ganglion cells in the rabbit's retina there is a class that responds to movement of a stimulus in one direction, and does not respond to movement in the opposite direction. The same directional selectivity holds over the whole receptive field of one such cell, but the selected direction differs in different cells. The discharge is almost uninfluenced by the intensity of the stimulus spot, and the response occurs for the same direction of movement when a black spot is substituted for a light spot."

https://openalex.org/W1997875762,"Experiments clearly demonstrate that with the help of auditory and visual cues man can single out motor units and control their isolated contractions. Experiments on the training of this control, interpreted as the training of descending pathways to single anterior horn cells, provide a new glimpse of the fineness of conscious motor controls. After training, subjects can recall into activity different single motor units by an effort of will while inhibiting the activity of neighbors. Some learn such exquisite control that they soon can produce rhythms of contraction in one unit, imitating drum rolls, etc. The quality of control over individual anterior horn cells may determine rates of learning."

https://openalex.org/W1646271124,"Human skin is an almost perfect emitter of infrared radiation in the spectral region beyond 3 microns. This energy may be recorded as a thermogram to yield a quantitative temperature map of the skin. If the nude subject has remained quiet in a cool room for 10 to 15 minutes prior to thermography, the skin temperatures are determined largely by the vascularity of the skin itself and by the heat conducted from within the body. Since, under these conditions, the contrasts which appear arise essentially from the internal sources of heat, the resulting thermograms yield information concerning certain pathological conditions within the body (16)."

A relationship between time, tooth vitality, and ultrasonic viewing was observed."

https://openalex.org/W1987574951,An erythrocyte catalase with atypical electromigration velocity was discovered in three generations of a family of Scandinavian-British extraction. Six members are heterozygous for the hereditary autosomal character; no abnormal homozygotes were found. The condition is associated with normal erythrocyte catalase activity and with no clinical or subclinical disease.

If the fractions separable by electrophoresis are treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, two populations of 7S antibodies are revealed. Primary-response precipitins have the characteristics of macroglobulins."

https://openalex.org/W2061412592,"Orientation in the monopolar pulse field used as the unconditioned stimulus was found to influence formation of a conditioned response to light in planarians. Planarians trained while oriented with the head toward the cathode reached maximal response rates rapidly, while those trained while oriented toward the anode showed no evidence of conditioned response formation."
https://openalex.org/W1996890730,"The structures of this articulation were found to originate from two different blastemata situated at some distance from each other and operating at different rates and opposing directions. A condylar blastema evolving dorsally contributes to the formation of the condylar cartilage, the disc, the aponeurosis of the external pterygoid muscle, and the capsular elements of the lower joint level, while a temporal blastema develops the articular structures of the upper level in a forward direction. At the end of the fourth fetal month all joint elements including a glenoid fossa and articular eminence are present in their primitive form."

The resulting mosaic survival pattern of the female graft is interpreted as support for the Lyon hypothesis of X-chromosome inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2060974271,"INDUCTION of lysogenic bacteria was first produced by the use of ultra-violet light1. It was shown later that other radiations2, nitrogen mustard, ethyleneimines, epoxides and organic peroxides3 can also induce lysogenic bacteria to produce phage. The process of induction is not yet clear. Several lines of evidence indicate that the primary lesion initiated by inducing agents could be an alteration in the nucleic acid economy of the host, an effect of unbalanced growth4."

https://openalex.org/W1976119000,"THE size distributions of spermatozoan nuclei are of interest from two points of view. On one hand there is the question of the identification and separation of X and Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa, and on the other hand the relation of nuclear size to total content of chromatophilic substances measured by the plug or core method of microspectroscopy. We do not wish to become involved in the former question; but are interested in the latter in connexion with work on the DNA content of bovine spermatozoa being examined in this laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W2078018665,"IT has been known for a comparatively long time that DNA and proteins of the histone or protamine type are the main components of the chromosomes1. The DNA has been the subject of several studies and much knowledge has been gained on its structure and function. Examination of the protein components, however, has been neglected to a large extent. Since the amount of histone protein approximately equals that of the DNA in the nucleus2, it is apparent that they must play a major part in the cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1980115361,"IT is supposed by several authors1–9 that adrenaline-induced EEG-arousal, which originates in the mesencephalic reticular formation and the posterior hypothalamus, is caused by a direct action of adrenaline on these structures. Discharges were recorded from single cells within the posterior hypothalamus10,11. The firing-rate of these cells was affected by intravenous injection of adrenaline or by mechanically induced changes of blood pressure. There is no effect of adrenaline if the blood pressure is kept constant artificially. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the adrenaline-induced arousal is a secondary effect of the rising blood pressure."

https://openalex.org/W1971402748,"GROSS1 observed that heating a solution of collagen in phosphate buffer to 37° C resulted in the formation of an opaque gel of collagen fibres. That this occurred at 37° C, but not in the cold, suggests that some unfolding of the collagen molecule is required to form fibres or gels, and that newly synthesized collagen molecules, in vivo, are also not as highly ordered as possible, but are somewhat unfolded in order to form connective tissue fibres. To test this idea in vitro we proposed to conduct the Gross heat gelation in deuterium oxide. Harrington and von Hippel2 showed that in the case of ichthyocol collagen in deuterium oxide, the helix→coil transition occurs at a temperature 4° C higher than in water. If heat gelation of collagen in deuterium oxide were to require a higher temperature than in water, the hypothesis would be supported. When we attempted to carry out the experiment, unexpected results were obtained, of which a preliminary report is presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2066375727,"WHILE using the rat hemidiaphragm method for assay of insulin1,2, it was noticed that the right hemidiaphragm, when incubated in the presence of insulin (2 milliunits/ml.), takes up significantly more glucose per unit weight, per unit time than the left hemidiaphragm. The basal uptake (without insulin) of the right hemidiaphragm was slightly more than the left, but the difference was not significant. The combined results of seven separate experiments are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2016002945,"ALTHOUGH Moore1 had demonstrated that β-carotene was transformed into vitamin A in the animal body, the actual process of this transformation has not as yet been fully understood. There are two views: one postulating oxidation of β-carotene at the central double bond, with the formation of, at first, two molecules of retinene2,3 (vitamin A aldehyde), which are immediately reduced to give two molecules of vitamin A alcohol; the other claiming that if an excentric bond be attacked it would give only one molecule of vitamin A, resulting from the further degradation of the larger fragment. Moore4 has given an outline of the evidence for and against these views."
