https://openalex.org/W1977586655,"THE orange-red colour produced by arginine and other mono-alkyl guanidines in the presence of α-naphthol and hypochlorites or hypobromites1 would probably be more widely used in analysis, were existing methods capable of a stable calibration or more reproducible."
https://openalex.org/W2987490983,"IT is well known that, for constant stimulus duration, the visual threshold intensity, I, is a function of the stimulus area A. In the case of absolute thresholds it has been generally accepted that: (i) for areas up to about 6′, AI = constant (Ricco's law); (ii) for areas between about 6′ and perhaps 20°, AI2 = constant (Piper's law)."

https://openalex.org/W1967499565,Nicol and Snell1 showed that the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system becomes depressed during the first two weeks of cortisone treatment and recovers to about the normal level during the third and fourth weeks if the cortisone injections are continued. The present communication shows that cortisone also produces changes in the blood.
