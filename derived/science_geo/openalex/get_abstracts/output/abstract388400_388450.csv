https://openalex.org/W2030955957,"A NUMBER of methods are available for the separation of the unbranched (amylose) and branched (amylopectin) components of starch. Of these methods, that of T. Schoch1 has been generally useful but presents certain disadvantages as a routine method inasmuch as it consists in a relatively high-temperature treatment, under pressure, of starch paste with butanol and isoamyl alcohol, and this treatment is known to cause some hydrolytic degradation of starch. The amylose component forms a Complex with butanol which is insoluble in water, whereas amylopectin either does not form such a complex or, more probably, forms a complex which is soluble in water."
https://openalex.org/W2045576837,"DURING the last four years, a systematic investigation of the effect of high-frequency electric currents on biological objects has been carried out in this Laboratory with the view of finding a specific effect apart from the heat effect hitherto generally supposed to be the only effect of high-frequency currents on tissue, bacteria, virus, etc. This view is quite natural as, with the technique hitherto used, the heat effect overwhelms any possible specific electric effect."
https://openalex.org/W2113253457,"BULL spermatozoa separated by centrifugation and washing from the seminal plasma can survive anærobically only if some glycolysable carbohydrate is added1 ; they can utilize glucose, fructose and mannose but not glycogen. In the whole semen, on the other hand, the spermatozoa survive without any additional sugar and they live at the expense of a reducing carbohydrate already present in the seminal plasma. Hitherto, this carbohydrate has been regarded as glucose2. However, in view of the inadequate evidence as to the identity of the sugar, an investigation of its chemical nature was undertaken. It revealed that the greatest part of the reducing sugar content of the seminal plasma is derived not from glucose but from fructose. From 120 ml. of bull semen, on purification, 15 ml. of a solution were obtained in which both the optical activity and the reducing value were determined and found to correspond to 630 mgm. fructose. Fructose was also identified as crystalline methylphenyl-fructosazone3. In small samples of semen (0.1 ml.) it was found possible to estimate fructose quantitatively by an adaptation of the method of Roe4; the analysis of seven freshly collected samples of bull semen gave the following results."

https://openalex.org/W1993397165,"THE advances in biochemistry during the past twenty years have increasingly revealed the vital part played in many biological processes by the phosphoric acid esters of sugars and amides. The synthesis in vitro of a number of these compounds, and of similar or related substances, would be very valuable for the study of the mechanisms of the reactions involved."

https://openalex.org/W2050224384,"IN a recent report1 it was shown that a scouring disease which affected cattle and sheep on reclaimed swamps and peaty soils in New Zealand was due to a deficiency of copper in the pasture. Affected animals showed low levels of copper in blood and liver ; the pasture contained only 2–5 p.p.m. of copper on a dry-matter basis compared with normal levels of 10 p.p.m. or more, and the disease could be controlled by administration of copper to the livestock or by top-dressing the pasture with fertilizers containing copper. This peat scours of New Zealand resembles the scouring disease in cattle attributed to copper deficiency on the sandy soils and reclaimed polders of Holland2,3."
https://openalex.org/W2009892553,"IN the investigation of the mechanism of polymerization reactions, it is essential to be able to count the number of polymer molecules produced. This implies that the number average molecular weight has to be measured. The best method is to use an osmometer, taking precautions with regard to the extrapolation of measurements to infinite dilution. Further, in order to get results reasonably quickly, the so-called dynamic osmometer is most suitable ; but the difficulty here is to get membranes which allow the solvent to diffuse through rapidly, but which are impermeable to the polymer molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2075226209,"THE purpose of this note is to record new spectroscopic data for the molecules SiS, SiSe and SiTe. These are members of a group of twenty molecules formed from Group IV and Group VI elements, each of which (with the single exception of CTe) has been shown by earlier work1 to give rise to at least one strong ultra-violet band-system, generally appearing readily in emission. Many of these systems have also been observed in absorption: it is convenient to call them D—X systems. The existence of weaker E—X systems, lying to shorter wave-lengths than the D—X systems of GeS, SnO, SnS, SnSe and SnTe1,2 suggested that other members of the group should possess similar E states."

https://openalex.org/W2071371536,"THE problem of the chemical identification of p-aminobenzoic acid has become important in view of its well-known action as antagonist of sulphonamides and the theory of Fildes and Woods concerning the mode of action of sulphonamides. Microbiological methods will always leave some doubt as to specificity, and the frequently used diazotization methods (suggested, for example, for estimation of p-aminobenzoic acid by Eckert1) are known to be unspecific and will be shown to give misleading results. So far, the presence of p-aminobenzoic acid has been established only for yeast2,3 by methods requiring large amounts of material."

https://openalex.org/W2032614835,"IN the last few years certain important advances have been made in the genetics of micro-organisms. Their implications are fundamental for genetics and go far beyond it, since they forecast a synthesis with microbiology, immunology and biochemistry. It is therefore fortunate that a very suggestive view of the whole field is now available in the form of a special issue of the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden*, containing the papers read, and the ensuing discussion, at a conference on “Gene Action in Microorganisms” held last February at St. Louis. The volume should be read by all those interested in the general trends of biology."

https://openalex.org/W2012275489,"THE ability to release atomic energy gives mankind great new powers. These powers can be used for good or ill. The first use of atomic energy was as a bomb the explosion of which stopped short a tragic war with the probable net saving of some million of lives. Its terrific military destructiveness has made it necessary for us to consider afresh how we may avoid future wars. The dramatic demonstration of its explosive power has directed attention away from the significance of atomic energy to our industry, our habits of life and our culture. It is in such peace-time consequences that atomic energy will eventually mean most to man."

https://openalex.org/W2088746657,"JAPAN is a country of eighty million people and her pre-war empire (including Manchuria) embraced 105 million people. The problem of feeding such numbers has been considerable, and the difficulties which Japanese communications experienced as a result of Allied air and sea attack did not make his problem any simpler. It will perhaps be of nterest at this stage, therefore, first to discuss Japanese diet and then to analyse the food situation in that country."

https://openalex.org/W1999168451,"THE existence of foveal tritanopia, in spite of the convincing observations of d'Alrutz (1909), Richardson-Robinson (1923) and Gothlin (1943), has been denied by those who, like Polack1, disagree with the trichromatic theory of colour vision and the classical division of dyschromatopsies. But the fact, already pointed out fifty years ago by Konig, has now been clearly evidenced by the results of Willmer and Wright2."

https://openalex.org/W2079306925,"THE two provinces covered in this article are those of Kuangtung and Fukien. Both differ widely in their dialects from all other parts of China and from each other, and during the War they had a different fate. In the campaign of 1944, the Japanese driving south along the Hankow-Canton railway linked up with the Japanese coming up from Canton, oapturing Kuangtung's temporary provincial capital, Kukong, and destroying the scientific institutions in its neighbourhood. Fukien, on the other hand, tinged round as it is on the landward side by mountains and forests, has suffered only intermittent Japanese occupation of its main ports, Fuchow and Hsiame'n (Amoy). It remains a sort of Valley of Avalon, isolated, with its two excellent universities, from the ravages of war in the plains of Chiangsi and Kuangtung to the west."

https://openalex.org/W1970230636,"THE international character of science which has been so often referred to by eminent men and so frequently stressed in the pages of Nature is well illustrated by the centenaries of distinguished investigators in physical science which occur in 1946. Disregarding for the moment the tercentenary of the great German scholar, philosopher, diplomatist and mathematician Leibniz, the year recalls first a succession of astronomers of many nationalities from the days when men's views were coloured by the mysteries of astrology and the dogmas of religion, and when there were neither scientific journals nor societies, much less international gatherings."
https://openalex.org/W1981257732,"THE 1945 report of the Governing Body of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine records a wide range of researches of which its director and staff may rightly be proud. The continued study of Vi bacteriophage has added one further Vi-phage type of the typhoid bacillus to the list of new types or subtypes identified in the British Isles, and there is evidence that unknown phage-types of typhoid and paratyphoid B bacilli are being introduced from abroad. The typing of Bact. typhi-murium, which is one of the commonest causes of food-poisoning in Great Britain and other countries, is proceeding and a scheme has been prepared for the routine application of the Vi test to future cases of typhoid fever, with the object of keeping a check, so far as this is possible, on persons who are likely to become persistent carriers of typhoid bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W2010472599,"THE discovery by Friedrich, Knipping and Laue of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals opened up new vistas to those interested in the structure of matter. It was now possible to determine the environment of individual atoms, and this inevitably led to a new and lively interest in the properties of matter, the further study of which had seemed to be opposed by an impassable barrier. Moreover, a new status was given to crystallography. No longer was it to be regarded as a subject of limited interest ; all men of science had to have a sound knowledge of crystallographic principles and the ability to apply them to their special problems."

https://openalex.org/W2038097913,"AFTER Miescher and co-workers1 had, in 1944, discovered the constitution of, and afterwards synthesized, the highly active œstrogen, dehydrodoisynolic acid, which has the formula it was investigated pharmacologically by E. Tschopp2. It was shown that dehydrodoisynolic acid is, on oral application, the most effective œstrogenic substance yet known."
https://openalex.org/W2065424208,"THE gradual easing of restrictions on travel and on the general release of scientific discoveries has made it practicable once more to arrange international meetings of men of science. The general assembly of the International Council of Scientific Unions will meet in London during July 22-24, 1946. Meanwhile its Executive Committee has held a meeting in London attended by representatives of most of the International Unions adhering to the Council."

https://openalex.org/W2081103211,"APPROXIMATELY fifty years ago the French scientific worker Bequerel discovered that certain minerals containing uranium possessed the property of producing energy in small amounts spontaneously, and apparently continuously. The Curies showed that the active substance responsible for this radioactivity in uranium minerals was not uranium itself, but was a small admixture of the rare element radium, which they were able to isolate. The activity of this concentrated material was so great that a mass of a gram of one of its salts maintained itself permanently several degrees hotter than its surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2090870736,"THE Report of the Medical Research Council's Committee on Hæmoglobin Surveys*, entitled “Hæmoglobin Levels in Great Britain in 1943 (with Observations upon Serum Protein Levels)”, is a valuable record of one aspect of national war-time health. The hæmoglobin level of some thirteen thousand adults (including seven hundred pregnant women) and some three thousand children were measured from the middle of the spring of 1943 until the middle of the autumn of that year. The Haldane-Gowers method was used and its efficacy is discussed. Although the Committee does not consider this method ideal, it concludes that it was accurate enough to justify the broad conclusions which are recorded in the 128 pages of this report, which is well illustrated by diagrams and graphs. The technical evidence thus published cannot be summarized adequately here. The main conclusions, very briefly given, are as follows."

https://openalex.org/W4214481121,"ASYMPOSIUM meeting of the Society for General Microbiology was held at Cambridge on July 5 and 6, 1945, the topic of the symposium being “The Effect of Environment on the Morphology and Activities of Micro-organisms”. The symposium occupied two sessions (afternoon and morning), the third session being (devoted to the reading of papers on a variety of topics ; there were also a number of interesting demonstrations. The aim of the organizers in choosing the wide topic for the symposium had been to provide opportunity for contributions from the many disciplines of microbiology in general, in order to foster one of the main objects of the Society, namely, to promote the advancement of microbiology by providing a common meeting-ground for those working in all the various specialized branches. In the event, the papers submitted at the symposium were weighted on the side of biochemistry, and there were fewer papers of more biological character than hacl been hoped. Perhaps this distribution reflects the present emphasis of active work in Britain, or it may be that authors who could have contributed valuably from other angles were too diffident. What- ever may have been the cause of the actual distribution of papers in the symposium, the Society will no doubt draw the necessary conclusions from its first venture, and continue in its endeavours to help weld together the various branches of microbiology, when organizing future symposia. The other contributions, both papers and demonstrations, were effective in restoring the balance of this two-day meeting, making it more representative of general microbiology."
https://openalex.org/W4232474973,"THE Faraday Society has had the courage, in spite of the very few months of peace, to initiate without delay its pre-war discussions on a pre-war scale. The meeting to discuss ""Oxidation"" held during September 27 and 28 brought forth all the vigour of previous discussions, and demonstrated how keen chemists are to exchange ideas and to subject each other to searching criticism in a way only the Faraday Society can achieve."
