https://openalex.org/W2079140157,"On the basis of an analysis of the human and rat calcitonin genes and of a related gene, alternative RNA processing represents a developmental strategy of the brain to dictate tissue-specific patterns of polypeptide synthesis. This regulation allows the calcitonin gene to generate two messenger RNA's, one encoding the precursor of a novel neuropeptide, referred to as CGRP, which predominates in the brain, and the second encoding the precursor to the hormone calcitonin which predominates in thyroid C cells. The distribution of CGRP in the central and peripheral nervous system and in endocrine and other organ systems suggests potential functions in nociception, ingestive behavior, cardiovascular homeostasis, and mineral metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2004149547,"Antibodies specific for human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) were demonstrated in serum samples from various groups of people in South Africa, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Tunisia, and Egypt. The samples had been collected for other purposes and were presumably selected without bias toward clinical conditions associated with HTLV infections. Regional differences in antibody positivity were observed, indicating widely distributed loci of occurrence of HTLV on the African continent in people of both black and white ancestry. Two patients with high titers of antibody to HTLV-I had some signs of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. In several groups a high frequency of false positive serum reactions was indicated when specific confirmation steps were included in the assay. Further characterization of these sera revealed highly elevated immunoglobulin levels, possibly due to polyclonal activation of immunoglobulin synthesis in these subjects. The possibility that related cross-reactive human retroviruses coexist in the same groups was not eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W2019429132,"The human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II are unique among the transforming retroviruses of vertebrates in their ability to transform human T cells in vitro and in their close association with human malignancies (T-cell lymphomas and leukemia). Their genomes are relatively simple, containing the genes gag, pol, env, and a 3′ region termed ""X."" This 3′ region may be responsible for the transforming potential of the viruses. The existence of proteins encoded by the 3′ region has been postulated on the basis of multiple open reading frames. In the present study this region is shown to contain a gene encoding a protein of 40 kilodaltons in HTLV-I and 37 kilodaltons in HTLV-II. It is proposed that these proteins be called, respectively, p40xI and p37xII."
https://openalex.org/W2021983664,"The preferred binding sites of echinomycin on DNA can be determined by a method called ""footprinting."" A 32P end-labeled restriction fragment from pBR322 DNA is protected by binding to echinomycin, and cleaved by a synthetic DNA cleaving reagent, methidiumpropyl--EDTA . Fe(II); the DNA cleavage products are then subjected to high-resolution gel analyses. This method reveals that echinomycin has a binding site size of four base pairs. The strong binding sites for echinomycin contain the central two-base-pair sequence 5'-CG-3'. From an analysis of 15 echinomycin sites on 210 base pairs of DNA, key recognition elements for echinomycin are contained in the sequences (5'-3') ACGT and TCGT (A, adenine; C, cytosine; G, guanine; T, thymine)."
https://openalex.org/W1546909579,"The ability of the scavenger receptor of human monocyte macrophages to recognize human low density lipoproteins (LDL) progressively modified by three lysine-specific reagents, malondialdehyde, acetic anhydride, or succinic anhydride, has been investigated. Regardless of the reagent utilized, receptor-mediated uptake was dependent upon modification of greater than 16% of the peptidyl lysines rather than upon the net negative charge of derivatized LDL. Rates of lysosomal hydrolysis of acetyl-LDL and succinyl-LDL increased as a function of progressive modification and reflected the amount of derivatized LDL binding to the receptor. Succinylation or acetylation of greater than 60% of the lysines was necessary to attain maximal ligand binding, internalization, and degradation. In contrast, modification of only 16% of the peptidyl lysines by malondialdehyde resulted in maximal levels of binding, uptake, and hydrolysis. The expression of receptor recognition site(s) appears to depend upon the charge modification of critical lysine residues of the LDL protein rather than the net negative charge of the lipoprotein complex. Malondialdehyde, a bifunctional reactant, may modify surface and sequestered lysines concomitantly and thus promote efficient formation of the recognition site(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2040398787,"Antibodies in sera from patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma or from healthy carriers of type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) recognize an antigen of approximately 42 kilodaltons (p42) in cell lines infected with HTLV-I. Radiolabel sequence analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments of p42 led to the conclusion that this antigen is encoded in part by LOR, a conserved portion of the ""X"" region that is flanked by the envelope gene and the 3' long terminal repeat of HTLV-I. It is possible that this novel product mediates the unique transformation properties of the HTLV family."

https://openalex.org/W2005416341,Exposure to insulin increased stimulus-evoked transmission at synapses formed in culture by cholinergic retinal neurons derived from fetal rats. This effect occurred at physiological concentrations and was long lasting. The findings support the hypothesis that insulin may serve as a developmental signal to regulate the emergence of effective neurotransmission across nascent synapses.
https://openalex.org/W2020792190,Recombinant DNA technology has provided a vast new source of DNA markers displaying heritable sequence variation in humans. These markers can be used in family studies to identify the chromosomal location of defective genes causing nervous system disorders. The discovery of a DNA marker linked to Huntington's disease has opened new avenues of research into this disorder and may ultimately permit cloning and characterization of the defective gene.
https://openalex.org/W1483781996,"Human erythrocytes transformed leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. Metabolism was proportional to the erythrocyte concentration, even at subphysiological levels (0.08-4 X 10(9) erythrocytes/ml). Comparative metabolic studies excluded the possibility that leukotriene B4 originated from trace amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes or platelets present in the purified erythrocyte suspensions. For example, suspensions of isolated platelets (100-500 X 10(6) cells/ml) failed to convert leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4; and conversion by suspensions of isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils was insufficient to account for the amounts of leukotriene B4 formed by erythrocytes. Leukotriene B4 formation was maximal within 2 min and substrate concentration dependent. Enzymatic activity originated from a 56 degrees C labile nondialyzable (Mr greater than 30,000) soluble component in the 100,000 X g supernatant obtained from lysed erythrocytes. In contrast to the contemporary view, our results indicate that human erythrocytes are not metabolically inert in terms of eicosanoid biosynthesis. The role of human erythrocytes during inflammatory or pulmonary disorders deserves re-examination in this context."
https://openalex.org/W1575457051,"The substrate specificities of the amino acid transport systems of vacuoles of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were investigated using purified vacuolar-membrane vesicles (Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2079-2082). Ten amino acids: arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, glutamine, asparagine, isoleucine, and leucine, were taken up actively into the vesicles. Kinetic studies indicated the presence of seven independent H+/amino acid antiport systems with narrow substrate specificity, which were all driven by a proton motive force established by ATP hydrolysis. The Kt and Vmax values, and the specific inhibitors for the arginine, arginine-lysine, histidine, phenylalanine-tryptophan, tyrosine, glutamine-asparagine, and isoleucine-leucine transport systems were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1516420307,"Microtubule protein prepared by cycles of assembly-disassembly contains a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) activity. We have isolated the NDP kinase responsible for this activity from twice-polymerized bovine brain microtubule protein by a five-step chromatographic procedure. The molecular weight of this enzyme was 103,000 +/- 7,000 daltons as determined by sedimentation equilibrium experiments performed with a Beckman Airfuge. A doublet of subunit bands with molecular masses of about 18,000 daltons was detected by silver staining after gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this preparation. We conclude that the enzyme is a hexamer, although we cannot identify the mix of subunits. We were able to isolate only nanogram quantities of this enzyme, too little for extensive studies, so we isolated the enzyme directly from bovine brain without a preliminary microtubule protein isolation. The whole-brain NDP kinase was isolated by the same chromatographic steps as the enzyme from microtubule protein preparations. Both enzymes had a doublet of subunits at the same molecular weights and both were the same isozyme, chromatofocusing at a pH of 8.0. Both enzymes had similar kinetic properties and similar thermal inactivation profiles. These similar properties of the two enzymes suggest that they are identical. Both subunits of NDP kinase could be reversibly phosphorylated by ATP. Phosphorylation of the native enzyme created multiple, more acidic forms that retained activity. The isolation of this NDP kinase, which can copurify with microtubule protein through cycles of assembly-disassembly, will facilitate future studies on the role of this enzyme in the mechanism and regulation of microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2062347345,"Four surface antigens previously recognized only in macrophages are present on human small cell lung carcinoma cells and tumors. Cancerous cells may arise from macrophage precursors in bone marrow, and these precursors migrate to lung to participate in the repair of damaged tissue produced by continuous heavy smoking. The characteristic presence of neuropeptides such as bombesin in small cell carcinoma, when considered along with these findings, presents new possibilities for the role of such peptides in nervous, endocrine, and immune system function."

https://openalex.org/W2048183400,A growth hormone minigene carrying its natural promoter (237 nucleotides of chromosomal DNA) was stably propagated in a murine retrovirus containing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase as a selectable marker. Glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone inducibility was transferred with the growth hormone gene. Recombinant virus with titers of 10(6) per milliliter was recovered. This demonstration that retroviruses can be used to transfer a nonselectable gene under its own regulatory control enlarges the scope of retroviral vectors as potent tools for gene transfer.
https://openalex.org/W1604651145,"Leishmania donovani, the causative agent in kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis, infects cells of the macrophage system. We show that a purified preparation of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, isolated from the external surface of L. donovani promastigotes, inhibits superoxide anion production by human neutrophils. Preincubation of neutrophils for 15-30 min at 37 degrees C with 240 units (1 unit equals 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate cleaved per h) of the acid phosphatase decreases both the rate and extent of superoxide generation by 90% upon stimulation with the chemoattractant peptide fMet-Leu-Phe. The ability of the phosphatase to suppress superoxide anion production is abolished by heat inactivation of the enzyme or by incorporation of an acid phosphatase inhibitor in the preincubation medium, indicating that the effect is dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. These results suggest a possible pathophysiologic role for the acid phosphatase of L. donovani promastigotes."

https://openalex.org/W1487822346,"Cytosolic protein phosphotyrosine (PPT) phosphatase was measured using a new substrate, Tyr(32P)-labeled bovine serum albumin. Kidney was found as a particularly rich tissue source of PPT-phosphatase activity, containing twice as much as liver and over 10-fold more than brain, heart, lung, or skeletal muscle. An affinity column of Zn2+-iminodiacetate agarose adsorbed up to 60% of the PPT-phosphatase present in kidney extracts. Subsequent chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose separated the phosphatase into two peaks, labeled I and II, that had Mr = 34,000 and 37,000, respectively, upon gel filtration with Sephadex G-75 Superfine. Overall purification of 850- and 1100-fold was achieved with a net 4% yield. Both phosphatases hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylphosphate as well as the protein substrate in the presence of EDTA. Peak I phosphatase activity displayed a neutral pH optimum, had an absolute requirement for sulfhydryl compounds, and was sensitive to trypsin, whereas Peak II activity had an acidic pH optimum and was active without mercaptans. The two proteins also gave different fragmentation patterns by gel electrophoresis after digestion with S. aureus V8 protease. The results show that multiple forms of PPT phosphatase specifically interact with Zn2+ and provide a basis for further structural and functional comparisons among different members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase family."
https://openalex.org/W1559051892,"Cells grown in the presence of ferric ammonium citrate or hemin exhibited a concentration and time-dependent decrease in 125I-transferrin (Trf) binding. In contrast, cells grown in the presence of protoporphyrin IX or picolinic acid (an iron chelator) exhibited a marked increase in Trf binding. The decrease or increase in binding activity observed under these different conditions of culture reflected, respectively, a reduction or increase in receptor number rather than an alteration in ligand receptor affinity. Growth of the cells in the presence of saturating concentrations of apotransferrin only induced a slight reduction in receptor number. Investigation of the Trf receptors' turnover and biosynthesis clearly showed that iron and hemin decreased the synthesis of Trf receptors without any modification of the receptor turnover; in contrast, protoporphyrin IX and picolinic acid markedly increased the synthesis of Trf receptors. Our results suggest that hemin, iron, and protoporphyrin IX may represent the main molecules involved in the regulation of Trf receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2052918489,"Human DNA contains many copies of endogenous retroviral sequences. Characterization of molecular clones of these structures reveals the existence of two related families. One family consists of full-length (8.8 kilobases) proviral structures, with typical long terminal repeates (LTR's). The other family consists of structures, which contain only 4.1 kilobases of gag-pol sequences, bounded by a tandem array of imperfect repeats 72 to 76 base pairs in length. Typical LTR sequences that exist as solitary elements in the genome were cloned and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2004594903,"The twitch procedure in horses attenuates the increase in the heart rate evoked by pain-inducing stimuli and the reaction of the animals to such stimuli. Endorphin systems are probably involved in the effectiveness of the twitch, since its action is blocked by naloxone and its application increases plasma concentrations of immunoreactive beta-endorphin. The mode of action of the twitch cannot be explained by the generally accepted theory of divertive pain and may resemble that of classical acupuncture."
https://openalex.org/W2129388093,"Long-term exposure of various cell types to beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol leads to an attenuated responsiveness (""desensitization"") of the adenylate cyclase system to further challenge with these agonists. The turkey erythrocyte model system was used earlier to show that a covalent modification of the receptor (phosphorylation) is associated with this process. The functionality of the ""desensitized"" beta-adrenergic receptor was assessed by implanting purified beta-adrenergic receptor preparations from control and desensitized turkey erythrocytes into phospholipid mixtures and then fusing them with receptor-deficient cells (Xenopus laevis erythrocytes). Desensitized beta-adrenergic receptors showed a 40 to 50 percent reduction in their ability to couple to the heterologous adenylate cyclase system, comparable to the reduction in their functionality observed in their original membrane environment. These results demonstrate the utility of recently developed receptor reconstitution techniques for assessing the functionality of purified receptors and show a direct link between a covalent modification of a membrane-bound receptor and its impaired functionality in a reconstituted system."

https://openalex.org/W1491056516,"The nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channel of chick skeletal myotubes in culture has been studied using both the 45Ca2+ flux technique and [3H]nitrendipine binding experiments. Ca2+ uptake is insensitive to nitrendipine when chick myotubes in culture are polarized. Whereas depolarization reveals a new component of 45Ca2+ influx which is inhibited by nitrendipine. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at a nitrendipine concentration of 0.7 nM. This value is similar to the dissociation constant Kd = 0.4 nM found in [3H]nitrendipine binding experiments. During myogenesis in vitro the nitrendipine receptor is absent in myoblasts and appears in parallel with the fusion process. Two stages of increased binding have been observed in vivo. The first one, which occurs during embryonic life, has the same properties as in the in vitro development. The second stage occurs near hatching and corresponds to a large increase in the number of nitrendipine receptors. This increase is accompanied by a decrease of affinity of nitrendipine for its receptor by a factor of 4 to 10. Chronic denervation produces a further increase in the number of nitrendipine receptors which reaches a factor of about 2 at 15 days of denervation. Results are discussed in relation to the particular localization of these channels in transverse tubules and with the innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2021395906,"The M protein is the antigen on the surface of group A streptococci that allows these bacteria to resist phagocytosis. DNA encoding the M12 protein was cloned into Escherichia coli and used as an isotopically labeled hybridization probe to compare genomic DNA's isolated from M+ and M- isogenic cultures in an effort to elucidate the genetic basis of this variation. DNA's from two spontaneous, independent M- variants contained small (approximately 50 base pairs) deletions which were mapped to identical restriction fragments within or adjacent to the M protein coding sequence. Taken together with the pleiotropic nature of these deletions, this suggests that they define a regulatory switch."
https://openalex.org/W1567835962,"Structural genes for EcoRI restriction endonuclease and modification methylase have been inserted into the plasmid vector pKC30 (Shimatake, H., and Rosenberg, M. (1981) Nature (Lond.) 292, 128-132) downstream from the bacteriophage lambda pL promoter. Upon induction of pL expression in strains producing a thermolabile lambda cI857 repressor, synthesis of EcoRI polypeptides is enhanced to the extent that after 4 h they represent several per cent of the total cell protein. Purification of activities overproduced in this manner yields preparations of endonuclease and methylase which appear identical to those obtained from conventional sources, with overall yields corresponding to 0.5 to 0.9 g of each enzyme/kg of cell paste."
https://openalex.org/W1567376454,"We have investigated the mechanism of bromouracil-induced transition mutations in vitro using synthetic DNA templates and purified T4 DNA polymerase. Evidence is presented for the occurrence of bromouracil-guanine base pairs in product DNA in the G x C----A x T pathway where guanine is present in the DNA template and bromouracil is present as the deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrate 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate. This finding supports a widely known but as yet untested model proposed by Freese (Freese, E. (1959) J. Mol. Biol. 1, 87-105) in which bromouracil-guanine base pairs are intermediates in 5-bromodeoxyuridine-induced transition mutation pathways. We find that the newly formed B x G base pairs are proofread with an efficiency of 75-85% by the 3' -exonuclease of T4 polymerase. The insertion of bromouracil occurring in direct competition with cytosine deoxyribonucleotides opposite template guanine sites is 1.1 +/- 0.14% (mean +/- S.E.), and the misincorporation ratio, inc(B)/inc(C), is reduced 6-fold by the action of the proofreading exonuclease to 0.16 +/- 0.02% (mean +/- S.E.). A previous study by Trautner et al. (Trautner, T. A., Swartz, M. N., and Kornberg, A. (1962) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 48, 449-455) suggested that, while template bromouracil stimulates incorporation of dGMP in the A x T----G x C transition mutation pathway, it may not be occurring exclusively by the pathway proposed by Freese. We concur with these earlier results, and, in addition, we find the surprising result that the 3'-exonuclease activity of wild-type T4 polymerase removes little or no incorporated dGMP on bromouracil-containing templates."
https://openalex.org/W1563487693,"Spectrin in isolated erythrocyte membranes is known to undergo tetramer to dimer transformation upon hypotonic incubation at 37 degrees C. In the present study, we detect no such transformation in intact erythrocytes in which hypotonicity is achieved by valinomycin treatment followed by hypotonic swelling. The inhibition of spectrin tetramer to dimer transformation is attributable to intracellular hemoglobin, since the addition of hemoglobin to isolated membranes or spectrin extracts blocks a similar spectrin transformation. However, the inhibitory effect is not limited to hemoglobin; other proteins including heme-containing proteins and basic proteins such as cytochrome c, ribonuclease, and albumin are also effective. The magnitude of their effect is proportional to the increased pI value of these proteins. We conclude that the stabilizing effect of these proteins on spectrin tetramers under hypotonic conditions is partly due to their non-ideality, which excludes water from spectrin and thus increases the effective concentration of spectrin, and to their electrostatic interactions with spectrin. In addition, promotion of spectrin self-association by hemoglobin under hypotonic conditions increases the stability of membrane skeletons against mechanical shearing. More importantly, the hemoglobin effect on spectrin self-association is demonstrable at physiological hemoglobin concentration, pH, and osmolarity, suggesting that in intact red cells the spectrin dimer-dimer association, as well as the membrane skeletal structure, is strengthened by intracellular hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1525397244,"The electronic and magnetic properties of the selenium-substituted 2[4Fe-4Se]2+/+ ferredoxin (Fd) from Clostridium pasteurianum have been investigated by EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The [4Fe-4Se]2+ clusters of oxidized Fd are diamagnetic and the Mossbauer spectra are nearly identical to those of oxidized 2[4Fe-4S]2+ Fd. The addition of 2e- per molecule of Se-substituted Fd causes the simultaneous appearance of three EPR signals: one (g1,2,3 = 2.103, 1.940, 1.888) is reminiscent of [4Fe-4S]+ EPR spectra and accounts for 0.7 to 0.8 spin/molecule. The two others consist of a broad signal with g = 4.5, 3.5, and approximately 2 (0.7 to 0.8 spin/molecule) and of a narrow peak at g = 5.172 which is observed up to 60 K. Peculiar features are also present in the Mossbauer spectra of 2[4Fe-4Se]+ Fd below 20 K: a subcomponent with lines near to +/- 4 mm/s and accounting for 20% of the total iron corresponds to two antiferromagnetically coupled sites in approximately a 3:1 ratio and displays fully developed paramagnetic hyperfine interactions at 4.2 K without any applied field. At 77 K, however, the reduced Se-substituted Fd yields a Mossbauer spectrum similar to that of 2[4Fe-4S]+ Fd. The new EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopic features of the 2[4Fe-4Se]+ Fd are attributed to S = 3/2 and S = 7/2 spin states which accompany the classical S = 1/2 state of [4Fe-4X]+ (X = S, Se) structures."
https://openalex.org/W1552954693,"Recently the purified alpha-subunit from Torpedo marmorata acetylcholine receptor was shown to bind alpha-bungarotoxin with a KD approximately 3 nM in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (Tzartos, S.J., and Changeux, J.P. (1983) EMBO J. 2, 381-387). Here we describe a further significant step toward renaturation of the alpha-subunit as judged by toxin and monoclonal antibody binding. Purified T. marmorata receptor subunits were diluted with 1% lipids (asolectin) plus 0.5% Na+ cholate. An anion-exchange resin eliminated most of the detergents, leaving approximately 0.1% Na+ cholate and the lipids. After this treatment, about 20% of the alpha-subunit recovered (but not the beta-, gamma-, or delta-subunit) exhibited a high affinity for radioiodinated alpha-bungarotoxin with a KD approximately 0.5 nM. The 34,000- and 27,000-dalton proteolytic peptides of the alpha-subunit conserved this lipid-dependent toxin binding. Unlabeled alpha-toxins, hexamethonium, and carbamylcholine competed with alpha-bungarotoxin for the renatured alpha-subunit. Noncompetitive channel blockers doubled the lipid-dependent toxin-binding capacity of the alpha-subunit but had no effect on the 27,000-dalton peptide. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to the main immunogenic region (which is particularly sensitive to denaturation) significantly increased. In particular, binding of antibody 16 changed from 1% to denatured to 100% to the lipid-renaturated alpha-subunit. The binding of these antibodies was lost with the lipid-renatured 34,000- and 27,000-dalton peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1556750259,"Partial cleavage with trypsin has been used to study the structure of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor purified from human carcinoma cells. Following affinity labeling of the receptor with 125I-EGF or the ATP analogue 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl benzoyl[14C]adenosine, metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, [3H]glucosamine, or [32P]orthophosphate, or in vitro autophosphorylation with [gamma-32P]ATP, tryptic cleavage defines the following three regions of the 180-kDa receptor protein: 1) a 125-kDa trypsin-resistant domain which contains sites of glycosylation, EGF binding, and an EGF-specific threonine phosphorylation site; 2) an adjacent 40-kDa fragment which contains serine and threonine phosphorylation sites and is further cleaved to a 30-kDa trypsin-resistant domain; and 3) a terminal 15-kDa portion of the receptor that contains the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and is degraded to small fragments in the presence of trypsin. Both the 125- and 40-kDa regions of the EGF receptor appear to be required for receptor-associated protein kinase activity since separation of these regions by tryptic cleavage abolishes this activity, and both regions are specifically labeled with an ATP affinity analogue, suggesting that both are involved in ATP binding. Additional 63- and 48-kDa phosphorylated fragments are generated upon trypsin treatment of EGF receptor from EGF-treated cells. The potential usefulness of partial tryptic cleavage in studying the EGF receptor and the possible biological function of the 30-kDa trypsin-resistant fragment of the receptor are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569251091,"Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analyses of purified human and monkey liver phenylalanine hydroxylase reveal that the enzyme consists of two different apparent molecular weight forms of polypeptide, designated H (Mr = 50,000) and L (Mr = 49,000), each containing three isoelectric forms. The two apparent molecular weight forms, H and L, represent the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of phenylalanine hydroxylase, respectively. After incubation of purified human and monkey liver enzyme with purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP, only the H forms contained 32P. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase converted the phenylalanine hydroxylase H forms to the L forms. The L forms but not the H forms could be phosphorylated on nitrocellulose paper after electrophoretic transfer from two-dimensional gels. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of human liver phenylalanine hydroxylase is not accompanied by significant changes in tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent enzyme activity. Peptide mapping and acid hydrolysis confirm that the apparent molecular weight heterogeneity (and charge shift to a more acidic pI) in human and monkey liver enzyme results from phosphorylation of a single serine residue. However, phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase does not account for the multiple charge heterogeneity of human and monkey liver phenylalanine hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1982088750,"Treatment of mice with the carcinogen N-methylnitrosourea results in the development of thymic lymphomas with frequent involvement of the N-ras oncogene. The activated mouse N-ras gene was isolated from one of these lymphomas and, by transformation in concert with restriction digestion, a map of the gene was prepared and its approximate boundaries were determined. By means of somatic cell hybrids the normal N-ras gene was found to be unlinked to other members of the ras gene family."
https://openalex.org/W54381199,"Site-specific mutagenesis was used to modify an amino acid residue of the catalytic trimer of aspartate transcarbamoylase thought to be at the active site. Tyrosine 165 of the catalytic chain was replaced by a serine residue. This mutation substantially reduces but does not entirely abolish the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme and the isolated catalytic trimer. Km for aspartate for the mutant catalytic trimer is 12-fold higher than for the wild type. Vmax is reduced by a factor of 4 and Kd for carbamoylphosphate is increased 3-fold in the mutant. Although these results suggest that tyrosine 165 is at the active site, they demonstrate that the residue is not essential for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1506367807,"We have identified the amino acid substitutions in two mutant forms of the recA protein from Escherichia coli. The recA441 mutant, which shows constitutive expression of the recA-mediated SOS response at 42 degrees C, contains two amino acid substitutions, glutamic acid to lysine at residue 38 and isoleucine to valine at residue 298. The recA629 mutant is an unusual pseudorevertant of recA441 that is no longer capable of spontaneous expression of SOS functions at 42 degrees C. Purified recA629 protein is cold-labile for several of the wild-type enzymatic activities and is shown here to contain three amino acid substitutions, the two found in the recA441 protein at residues 38 and 298, as well as an aspartic acid-to-glycine change at residue 32. The mutation at residue 32 was verified by restriction digestion of the 5' region of the recA629 structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1586947727,"Diacylglycerol kinase purified from pig brain cytosol could use sonication-dispersed diacylglycerol in the presence of its activator, phosphatidylcholine vesicles. However, the kinase failed to significantly use diacylglycerol cosonicated with phosphatidylcholine. Similarly, the kinase could not use diacylglycerol generated in microsomes by the back reaction of diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase, though phospholipase C treatment of microsomes yielded effective substrate for the kinase. In order to elucidate the mechanism of these discrepant findings, we studied the activity of the purified kinase and Rhizopus arrhizus lipase utilizing dioleoylglycerol incorporated into various phospholipid vesicles. The inaccessibility of diacylglycerol contained in phospholipid vesicles was observed similarly for the two different enzymes. We considered that the apparent enzymic latency of diacylglycerol could be best accounted for by an extremely limited solubility of diacylglycerol in the outer leaflet of phospholipid bilayers. The experimental bases for this interpretation are: 1) diacylglycerol cosonicated with dihexanoyl phosphatidylcholine was exceptionally effective as substrate for the kinase; 2) the enzyme activities with cosonicated and separately sonicated lipids became similar when bile salts were present; 3) both enzymes could use diacylglycerol generated on phosphatidylcholine vesicles by a limited phospholipase C hydrolysis; and 4) phosphatidylcholine diacylglycerol vesicles at widely different molar ratios (from 1:0.014 to 1:0.2) were similarly ineffective as substrate for both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1482850475,"We present experiments designed to test whether or not the ADP-sensitive (E1P) and the K-sensitive (E2P) phosphoenzyme forms of (Na,K)-ATPase are intermediates of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Na and K. We have used the apparent rate constant of anthroylouabain binding, k' on, and its inhibition by oligomycin to monitor the steady-state levels of E2P and E1P, respectively. We have measured k' on in purified dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase at 37 degrees C as a function of Na, K, and MgATP or Mg plus inorganic phosphate in the presence and absence of oligomycin. In the presence of 35 mM Na and no K, k' on was saturated with [ATP] greater than 25 microM, and oligomycin (10 microM) inhibited less than 10%. Inhibition by oligomycin increased when [Na] was increased. At 1.9 M Na oligomycin inhibited k' on and equilibrium binding of anthroylouabain with Ki = 136 nM. Oligomycin had no effect on k' on in the presence of Mg + inorganic phosphate. In the presence of 35 mM Na and 4.5 mM K, k' on was much slower, inhibition by oligomycin increased, and ATP stimulated both k' on and inhibition by oligomycin with K0.5 greater than 0.1 mM. From the k' on measurements in the presence and absence of K, we estimated that the steady-state level of E2P was between 4 and 15% of the enzyme with 25 microM to 6.5 mM ATP, 35 mM Na, and 4.5 mM K at 37 degrees C. For these conditions we estimated the rate constant of E2P hydrolysis to be 46,000 (+/- 1,000) min-1. These results are contrary to the predictions derived from a model in which acid-stable phosphoenzymes are not intermediates of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Na and K. They are fully consistent with a model in which E1P and E2P are intermediates of ATP hydrolysis coupled to transport of Na and K."
https://openalex.org/W1582782260,"Photoaffinity labeling of pBR322 with ethidium monoazide (8-azido-3-amino-5-ethyl-6-phenylphenanthridinium chloride) was used to provide evidence for the sequence specificity of ethidium binding to native DNA. DNA-drug interactions were examined at concentrations of eight covalently bound ethidium drugs per molecule of pBR322 (4363 base pairs). Restriction enzyme cutting was blocked by the covalent binding of a drug molecule at (or near) the enzyme recognition sequence. This phenomenon was observed with all restriction enzymes tested and was not limited to specific regions of the pBR322 molecule. Double-digestion experiments indicated that a drug molecule may bind 2 to 3 base pairs outside the recognition sequence and still block restriction enzyme digestion. Intact plasmid was treated with [3H]ethidium monoazide and digested with restriction enzymes. The amount of covalently-linked ethidium analog was quantitated for different restriction fragments and the G-C content of each fragment was determined from the DNA sequence. In approximately half of the fragments the drug appeared to preferentially bind at a G-C base pair. However, no preference for specific sequences such as 5‘-C-G-3‘ was detected, as had been suggested by previous modeling studies with ethidium bromide. The other fragments were located in specific map regions of the plasmid and did not bind drug with a strict dependence on GC content suggesting that binding specificity may depend on more than one structural feature of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532302477,"The effect of norepinephrine on phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine formation was investigated in short-term incubations with freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. In the presence of dl-propranolol, norepinephrine decreases the incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline into phosphatidylcholines in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 50 microM, norepinephrine (plus 20 microM propranolol) inhibits the incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline over a wide range of choline concentrations (59% inhibition at 5 microM choline; 34% inhibition at 1 mM choline). Norepinephrine also decreases the incorporation rates of [1-14C]palmitic acid and [1-14C]oleic acid into phosphatidylcholines. The effect of norepinephrine is mediated through an alpha-adrenergic receptor. Norepinephrine (plus propranolol) does not decrease the uptake or phosphorylation rate of [methyl-14C]choline. Pulse-label and pulse-chase studies indicate that the conversion rate of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, is diminished by norepinephrine. In contrast with the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, this hormone stimulates the formation of phosphatidylethanolamines from [1,2-14C]ethanolamine. This increased incorporation rate is apparent at ethanolamine concentrations above 25 microM. A combination of norepinephrine and propranolol decreases, however, the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines from [1,2-14C]ethanolamine. The results indicate that alpha-adrenergic regulation dissociates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines from that of phosphatidylethanolamines."
https://openalex.org/W2086807767,"Ionic channels, the integral membrane proteins responsible for the brain's electrical activity, have long been studied with standard electrophysiological and biochemical methods. Recently, however, newly developed electrical and molecular biological methods have been brought to bear on long-standing questions in neurobiology. Goals of current channel research include elucidating the primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of channel species; the mechanisms of synthesis, sorting, membrane insertion, and degradation; and aspects of function such as gating, ion permeation and selectivity, and regulation. The latest research combines the new biochemical and electrophysiological techniques to reveal relations between molecular structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1576854739,"Transcription of the adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) IVa2 gene, which contains no TATA-like sequence in the region immediately upstream of the IVa2 cap sites (Baker, C. C., and Ziff, E. B. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 149, 189-221), has been examined in extracts of HeLa cells (Manley, J. L., Fire, A., Cano, A., Sharp, P. A., and Gefter, M.L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 3855-3859). Run-off transcripts of the predicted length of those initiated at the IVa2 cap sites were synthesized from different Ad2 DNA templates, each of which also contained the major late transcriptional control region. Mapping of the 5' ends of the RNA made from one template by a nuclease protection assay established the fidelity of initiation of IVa2 transcription in vitro. The efficiency of IVa2 expression in whole HeLa extracts was influenced quite dramatically by monovalent and divalent metal ion concentrations and the concentration of extract protein present in the reaction mixture. Under certain conditions, IVa2 run-off transcripts were made almost as efficiently as those from the Ad2 major late transcriptional control region. However, conditions promoting optimal IVa2 transcription in vitro did not favor recognition of the major late transcriptional control region, and vice versa: the synthesis of IVa2 and major late run-off transcripts responded differently to all parameters tested."
https://openalex.org/W2042997551,"Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) treatment of the prolactin nonproducing subclone of GH cells (rat pituitary tumor cells) induces amplification of a 20-kilobase DNA fragment including all of the prolactin gene coding sequences. This amplified DNA segment, which is flanked by two unamplified regions, thus designates a unit of BrdUrd-induced amplified sequence. Cloned DNA segments, 10.3 kilobases long, from the 5' end of the rat prolactin gene of BrdUrd-responsive and -nonresponsive cells, were ligated to the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1TK), and the hybrid DNA was transferred to thymidine kinase-deficient mouse fibroblast cells by transfection. The HSV1TK gene and the rat prolactin gene were amplified together in drug-treated transfectants carrying the hybrid DNA HSV1TK gene and rat prolactin gene of BrdUrd-responsive GH cells. These results suggest that the 10.3-kilobase DNA segment at the 5' end of the rat prolactin gene of BrdUrd-responsive GH cells carries the information for drug-induced gene amplification (amplicon) and that another gene, such as the HSV1TK gene, is also amplified when the latter is placed adjacent to this segment."
https://openalex.org/W1494707477,"Chinese hamster subunits of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase), Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and Complex V (oligomycin-sensitive ATPase) were identified by immunoprecipitation and/or Western immunoblotting with antibody to the corresponding beef heart complexes. In the Chinese hamster lung cell mutant Gal 32, cytochrome c oxidase activity and its mitochondrially synthesized subunits (I, II, and III) are substantially decreased, but a cytoplasmically synthesized subunit (IV) is present at wild type levels. Complex I activity and five of its subunits are greatly diminished in Gal 32; several of the affected Complex I subunits correspond in mobility to mitochondrial translation products. In contrast, ATPase activity and its mitochondrially and cytoplasmically synthesized subunits are not greatly modified in the mutant. Our data suggest that the ATPase complex contains two rather than one mitochondrially synthesized peptides. The simultaneous correction of this pleiotropic phenotype in a spontaneous revertant of Gal 32 selected for its ability to grow on galactose suggests that the Gal 32 phenotype is a consequence of a single mutation. Therefore, it is concluded that Complex I may contain a previously unrecognized mitochondrially synthesized subunit(s), and that the lowered activity of both Complex I and cytochrome c oxidase in the mutant is due to decreased levels of their mitochondrially encoded subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2155554774,"Incubation of soluble complex III isolated from either yeast or beef heart mitochondria with 25-100 nmol of [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)/nmol of cytochrome b followed by centrifugation through 10% sucrose or precipitation with trichloroacetic acid did not result in any changes in the appearance of the subunits of either complex. The [14C]DCCD was bound to cytochrome b and phospholipids in the yeast complex and with similar kinetics to both cytochrome b and subunit VIII (Mr = 4000-8000) plus phospholipids of the beef complex. Subunit VIII of the beef complex was partially extracted with chloroform:methanol; however, no subunit of this mobility was present in the yeast complex. Incubation of the beef complex in phosphate buffer for short times resulted in a doubling of the [14C]DCCD bound to cytochrome b relative to that to subunit VIII. Preincubation of both complexes with venturicidin prior to treatment with DCCD resulted in a 50% decrease in the binding of [14C]DCCD to cytochrome b. Reisolation of the beef complex III by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 after incubation with [14C]DCCD resulted in the formation of a new band with an apparent molecular weight of 39,000 even in the zero time control. The [14C]DCCD was bound to subunit VIII and the core proteins but not to cytochrome b at all times, suggesting that precipitation with (NH)2SO4 in the presence of DCCD causes cross-linking of the subunits of complex III."

Analysis of the immunocomplexes on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gell electrophoresis revealed that p53, p28, and p19 of adult T-cell leukemia-associated antigens were phosphorylated in vivo. Immunocomplexes of MT-2 cell extract with monoclonal antibody KK-1 were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP in vitro and it was revealed that the phosphokinase activity was associated with p28. The phosphokinase activity of p28 was specific to the serine residue but was not to the tyrosine residue."
