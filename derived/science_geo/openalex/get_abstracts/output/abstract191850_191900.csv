The Naples and the Plymouth populations are unquestionably closely related and have the same chromosome number (2n = 8). However, cross-breeding between a Naples individual and a Plymouth individual has constantly resulted in embryos which degenerated at an early stage and were eaten by their parents."
https://openalex.org/W1980532664,"A STUDY was made of the toxicity of culture filtrates of the cotton–wilt pathogen, Fusarium vasinfectum Atk., grown in synthetic Czapek's medium, to cut shoots of cotton. This indicated that, under laboratory conditions, the culture filtrate (fourteen days old) when dialysed against distilled water at 4–5°C. for four days to rid the crude filtrate of metabolites—earlier observed to be toxic to the plant—brought about typical wilt symptoms, which have been described in detail elsewhere1. Higher dilutions of this dialysed neat filtrate did not produce any symptoms of toxæmia, but induced rooting. However, the dialysed filtrate autoclaved at 15 lb. pressure for 15 min. (with the view of inactivating the toxin) induced profuse rooting in the cut shoots of cotton at all concentrations, and in no case were there any typical wilt symptoms."

Evans et al.1 and others have shown that a change in reaction from strongly acid to alkaline results in increased uptake, especially in the alkaline region. So far as we are aware, all cases of molybdenum deficiency hitherto reported have been in acid soils, while excess levels of molybdenum in herbage, responsible, in part at least, for complicated copper-deficiency effects in livestock, have been reported only from slightly acid to strongly alkaline soils. This in general has also been our experience3. However, in an extension of our work, a case has been found where the conditioned copper-deficiency syndrome occurs in cattle confined to pasture growing on strongly acid soils. It was thought at first that this might possibly be a case of simple copper-deficiency. The animals were severely affected. Blood samples showed copper values varying from 0.03 to 0.07 mgm. percent. Herbage samples taken from the pastures concerned showed copper values in the region of 13 parts per million and molybdenum values of 7.0–13.0 p.p.m. The herbage consisted of bent grasses, crested dogstail, Yorkshire fog, Juncus spp., sedges and other species typical of poor pasture on acid soils."

Dowson2 found that Bacillus polymyxa, a facultative sporulating organism, was capable of causing a soft rot of potato. This organism is capable of attacking pectin and therefore has potential retting abilities. B. amylobacter Bredemann, which is a synonym of Cl. butyricum and wrongly includes more than one true specific group3, is mentioned in the literature as a retting organism4. So far as I am aware, no other strict anaerobe, facultative anaerobe or micro–aerophilic organism has been reported in England as a possible retting agent."

https://openalex.org/W2984456070,"IN 1949, the late P. Ellinger1 described some experiments which suggested that treatment of rats with nitrogen mustard had produced a mutation in the gene or genes controlling the output of nicotinamide methochloride. He followed up this work with some extensive experiments, and recently asked me to analyse the results. Prof. Ellinger died before I had the opportunity of discussing with him the results of the analysis, and this communication is therefore published withoutthe benefit of his advice."
