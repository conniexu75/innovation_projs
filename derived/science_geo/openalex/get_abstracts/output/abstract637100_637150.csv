https://openalex.org/W2966465234,"Immunotherapies that block inhibitory checkpoint receptors on T cells have transformed the clinical care of patients with cancer1. However, whether the T cell response to checkpoint blockade relies on reinvigoration of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or on recruitment of novel T cells remains unclear2-4. Here we performed paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing on 79,046 cells from site-matched tumors from patients with basal or squamous cell carcinoma before and after anti-PD-1 therapy. Tracking T cell receptor clones and transcriptional phenotypes revealed coupling of tumor recognition, clonal expansion and T cell dysfunction marked by clonal expansion of CD8+CD39+ T cells, which co-expressed markers of chronic T cell activation and exhaustion. However, the expansion of T cell clones did not derive from pre-existing tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes; instead, the expanded clones consisted of novel clonotypes that had not previously been observed in the same tumor. Clonal replacement of T cells was preferentially observed in exhausted CD8+ T cells and evident in patients with basal or squamous cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate that pre-existing tumor-specific T cells may have limited reinvigoration capacity, and that the T cell response to checkpoint blockade derives from a distinct repertoire of T cell clones that may have just recently entered the tumor."

However, the phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo during atherosclerosis and the influence of this process on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk have not been clearly established. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomic phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions of both mouse and human arteries and found that these cells transform into unique fibroblast-like cells, termed 'fibromyocytes', rather than into a classical macrophage phenotype. SMC-specific knockout of TCF21-a causal CAD gene-markedly inhibited SMC phenotypic modulation in mice, leading to the presence of fewer fibromyocytes within lesions as well as within the protective fibrous cap of the lesions. Moreover, TCF21 expression was strongly associated with SMC phenotypic modulation in diseased human coronary arteries, and higher levels of TCF21 expression were associated with decreased CAD risk in human CAD-relevant tissues. These results establish a protective role for both TCF21 and SMC phenotypic modulation in this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2965729444,"The genome is organized in three-dimensional units called topologically associating domains (TADs), through a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA-binding factor CTCF. Genomic rearrangements of TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and disease, but genome-wide depletion of CTCF has no drastic effects on transcription. Here, we investigate TAD function in vivo in mouse limb buds at the Sox9-Kcnj2 locus. We show that the removal of all major CTCF sites at the boundary and within the TAD resulted in a fusion of neighboring TADs, without major effects on gene expression. Gene misexpression and disease phenotypes, however, were achieved by redirecting regulatory activity through inversions and/or the repositioning of boundaries. Thus, TAD structures provide robustness and precision but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Aberrant disease-related gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires CTCF-dependent redirection of enhancer-promoter contacts."

https://openalex.org/W2964961432,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major problem among military veterans and civilians alike, yet its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study and bioinformatic analyses, which included 146,660 European Americans and 19,983 African Americans in the US Million Veteran Program, to identify genetic risk factors relevant to intrusive reexperiencing of trauma, which is the most characteristic symptom cluster of PTSD. In European Americans, eight distinct significant regions were identified. Three regions had values of P < 5 × 10−10: CAMKV; chromosome 17 closest to KANSL1, but within a large high linkage disequilibrium region that also includes CRHR1; and TCF4. Associations were enriched with respect to the transcriptomic profiles of striatal medium spiny neurons. No significant associations were observed in the African American cohort of the sample. Results in European Americans were replicated in the UK Biobank data. These results provide new insights into the biology of PTSD in a well-powered genome-wide association study. This study identifies eight significant genetic associations with intrusive reexperiencing of trauma in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a large biobank focused on US veterans."

https://openalex.org/W2964744158,"The receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 play important roles in necroptosis that are closely linked to the inflammatory response. Although the activation of necroptosis is well characterized, the mechanism that tunes down necroptosis is largely unknown. Here we find that Parkin (also known as PARK2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in Parkinson's disease and as a tumour suppressor, regulates necroptosis and inflammation by regulating necrosome formation. Parkin prevents the formation of the RIPK1-RIPK3 complex by promoting polyubiquitination of RIPK3. Parkin is phosphorylated and activated by the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Parkin deficiency potentiates the RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction, RIPK3 phosphorylation and necroptosis. Parkin deficiency enhances inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. These findings demonstrate that the AMPK-Parkin axis negatively regulates necroptosis by inhibiting RIPK1-RIPK3 complex formation; this regulation may serve as an important mechanism to fine-tune necroptosis and inflammation."

Unconventional translation (RAN translation) of C9orf72 repeats generates dipeptide repeat proteins that can cause neurodegeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2966050078,Soil organic carbon plays an important role in the stability and fertility of soil and is influenced by different management practice. We quantified active and passive carbon pools from total soil organic carbon (TOC) in seven different land use systems of northeast India. TOC was highest (2.75%) in natural forest and lowest in grassland (1.31%) and it decreased with increasing depth in different pools of lability. Very Labile Carbon (VLC) fraction ranged from 36.11 to 42.74% of TOC across different land use system. Active carbon (AC) pool was highest in Wet Rice Cultivation (61.64%) and lowest (58.71%) in natural forest. Higher AC pools (VLC and less labile) in most land use systems barring natural forests suggest that the land use systems in the region are vulnerable to land use change and must adopt suitable management practice to harness carbon sequestration.
https://openalex.org/W2966861845,"SNP-heritability is a fundamental quantity in the study of complex traits. Recent studies have shown that existing methods to estimate genome-wide SNP-heritability can yield biases when their assumptions are violated. While various approaches have been proposed to account for frequency- and linkage disequilibrium (LD)-dependent genetic architectures, it remains unclear which estimates reported in the literature are reliable. Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of genetic architecture, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by allele frequency and/or LD. We show analytically and through extensive simulations starting from real genotypes (UK Biobank, N = 337 K) that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator is robust across a wide range of architectures. We provide estimates of SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits in the UK Biobank and show that, consistent with our results in simulations, existing biobank-scale methods yield estimates up to 30% different from our theoretically-justified approach. The authors use theoretical justifications coupled with extensive simulations to accurately estimate SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits and diseases from the UK Biobank data, irrespective of the underlying genetic architecture of the trait."
https://openalex.org/W2966723213,"Whole genome sequencing can provide essential public health information. However, it is now known that widely used short-read methods have the potential to miss some randomly-distributed segments of genomes. This can prevent phages, plasmids, and virulence factors from being detected or properly identified. Here, we compared assemblies of three complete Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26:H11/H- genomes from two different sequence types (ST21 and 29), each acquired using the Nextera XT MiSeq, MinION nanopore-based sequencing, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. Each closed genome consisted of a single chromosome, approximately 5.7 Mb for CFSAN027343, 5.6 Mb for CFSAN027346, and 5.4 MB for CFSAN027350. However, short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) using Nextera XT MiSeq failed to identify some virulence genes in plasmids and on the chromosome, both of which were detected using the long-read platforms. Results from long-read MinION and PacBio allowed us to identify differences in plasmid content: a single 88 kb plasmid in CFSAN027343; a 157kb plasmid in CFSAN027350; and two plasmids in CFSAN027346 (one 95 Kb, one 72 Kb). These data enabled rapid characterization of the virulome, detection of antimicrobial genes, and composition/location of Stx phages. Taken together, positive correlations between the two long-read methods for determining plasmids, virulome, antimicrobial resistance genes, and phage composition support MinION sequencing as one accurate and economical option for closing STEC genomes and identifying specific virulence markers."
https://openalex.org/W2966739804,"Animals have evolved specialized neural circuits to defend themselves from pain- and injury-causing stimuli. Using a combination of optical, behavioral and genetic approaches in the larval zebrafish, we describe a novel role for hypothalamic oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the processing of noxious stimuli. In vivo imaging revealed that a large and distributed fraction of zebrafish OXT neurons respond strongly to noxious inputs, including the activation of damage-sensing TRPA1 receptors. OXT population activity reflects the sensorimotor transformation of the noxious stimulus, with some neurons encoding sensory information and others correlating more strongly with large-angle swims. Notably, OXT neuron activation is sufficient to generate this defensive behavior via the recruitment of brainstem premotor targets, whereas ablation of OXT neurons or loss of the peptide attenuates behavioral responses to TRPA1 activation. These data highlight a crucial role for OXT neurons in the generation of appropriate defensive responses to noxious input. Detecting and responding to noxious stimuli is essential for survival. Wee et al. show that noxious stimuli elicit intense and widespread activity in zebrafish oxytocin neurons, which promote defensive behavior by activating hindbrain premotor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2964896589,"Soil salinization is a serious problem that affects the seedling growth in many regions. A greenhouse experiment was carried to investigate the adaptation ability of seedlings (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) in coastal saline alkaline environment. Seedlings of sorghum were treated by different salt and alkali stress (NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3 were 2:1:0, 2:1:1, 2:1:2). The treatments consisted of three levels of salinity (100, 200 and 300 mmol/L) and pH values were 7.08, 8.78 and 9.04. The results showed that the seedlings of sorghum have good adaptability to salt stress under low pH (pH ≤7.08). The plant height, the maximum leave areas of seedlings all dropped and root length first ascended and then descended with the increasing of salt and alkali stress. The contents of Chlorophyll b degraded significantly under salt and alkali stress. Salt and alkali stress stimulated the accumulation of organic solutes (proline and protein) and inorganic ions (Na+, Cl-, SO42-). Our results showed that salt and alkali stress have significant effect on growth indexes except root length and the interaction effect has significantly on physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2966045124,"Maslinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is distributed in the peel of olives. Previous studies found that maslinic acid inhibited inflammatory response and antioxidant effects. We investigated whether maslinic acid ameliorates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and evaluated the regulation of lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Male C57BL/6 mice fed a normal diet or HFD (60% fat, w/w) were tested for 16 wk. After the fourth week, mice were injected intraperitoneally with maslinic acid for 12 wk. In another experiment, HepG2 cells were treated with oleic acid to induce lipid accumulation or maslinic acid to evaluate lipogenesis. Maslinic acid significantly reduced body weight compared with HFD-fed mice. Maslinic acid reduced liver weight and liver lipid accumulation and improved hepatocyte steatosis. Furthermore, serum glucose, leptin, and free fatty acid concentrations significantly reduced, but the serum adiponectin concentration was higher, in the maslinic acid group than in the HFD group. In liver tissue, maslinic acid suppressed transcription factors involved in lipogenesis and increased adipose triglyceride lipase. In vitro, maslinic acid decreased lipogenesis by activating AMPK. These findings suggest that maslinic acid acts against hepatic steatosis by regulating enzyme activity involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation in the liver.-Liou, C.-J., Dai, Y.-W., Wang, C.-L., Fang, L.-W., Huang, W.-C. Maslinic acid protects against obesity-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice through regulation of the Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2966499722,"The present study aims to address the problem of chromium (Cr) toxicity by providing important insights into the mechanisms involved in its bioremediation. Among the 22 Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium isolates obtained from Sesbania sesban root nodules, Sinorhizobium sp. SAR1 (JX174035.1) tolerated the maximum Cr concentration (1mM) and hence was used for further studies. The excess secretion of extra polymeric substances, as seen from scanning electron micrographs, could be a probable mechanism of adaptation to the Cr stress. The Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data did not show any peaks of Cr. The biosorption studies done on the isolate gave maximum adsorption capacity as 285.71mg/g. The isotherm studies showed a better fit to Langmuir isotherm. The Weber and Morris plot established that the phenomenon of adsorption was governed by film diffusion mechanism. The FTIR analysis suggested the role of cell wall components and extracellular polymeric substances in Cr adsorption to the biomass of Sinorhizobium. On the basis of these results a compiled mechanism of Cr (VI) adsorption and its biotransformation into Cr (III) by Sinorhizobium sp. SAR1 is explained. This work outlines a comprehensive detail for the exact phenomenon of Cr biotransformation by Sinorhizobium sp. SAR1. These results may further help in developing and enhancing effective bioremediation approaches."

Owing to lack of proper surveillance programs and health facilities, developing countries of Asia and Africa carry a disproportionately heavy share of the RVA disease burden. The aim of this hospital-based study was to investigate the circulation of RVA genotypes in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan in 2015 and 2016, prior to the implementation of RVA vaccine. 639 faecal samples collected from children under 10 years of age hospitalized with AGE were tested for RVA antigen by ELISA. Among 171 ELISA positive samples, 143 were successfully screened for RT-PCR and sequencing. The prevalence of RVA was found to be 26.8% with the highest frequency (34.9%) found among children of age group 6–11 months. The most predominant circulating genotypes were G3P[8] (22.4%) followed by G12P[6] (20.3%), G2P[4] (12.6%), G1P[8] (11.9%), G9P[6] (11.9%), G3P[4] (9.1%), G1P[6] (4.2%), G9P[8] (4.2%), and G3P[6] (0.7%). A single mixed genotype G1G3P[8] was also detected. The findings of this study provide baseline data, that will help to assess if future vaccination campaigns using currently available RVA vaccine will reduce RVA disease burden and instigate evolutionary changes in the overall RVA biology. The high prevalence of RVA infections in Pakistan require to improve and strengthen the surveillance and monitoring system for RVA. This will provide useful information for health authorities in planning public health care strategies to mitigate the disease burden caused by RVA."
https://openalex.org/W2965495200,"Basal protein turnover, which largely relies on the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates, is instrumental for maintenance of muscle mass and function. However, the regulation of ubiquitinated protein degradation in healthy, nonatrophying skeletal muscle is still evolving, and potential tissue-specific modulators remain unknown. Using an unbiased expression analysis of 34 putative autophagy genes across mouse tissues, we identified unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (Ulk)2, a homolog of the yeast autophagy related protein 1, as particularly enriched in skeletal muscle. Subsequent experiments revealed accumulations of insoluble ubiquitinated protein aggregates associated with the adaptors sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) and next to breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein gene 1 protein (NBR1) in adult muscles with ULK2 deficiency. ULK2 deficiency also led to impaired muscle force and caused myofiber atrophy and degeneration. These features were not observed in muscles with deficiency of the ULK2 paralog, ULK1. Furthermore, short-term ULK2 deficiency did not impair autophagy initiation, autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or protease activities of the lysosome and proteasome. Altogether, our results indicate that skeletal muscle ULK2 has a unique role in basal selective protein degradation by stimulating the recognition and proteolytic sequestration of insoluble ubiquitinated protein aggregates associated with p62 and NBR1. These findings have potential implications for conditions of poor protein homeostasis in muscles as observed in several myopathies and aging.—Fuqua, J. D., Mere, C.

https://openalex.org/W2965254155,"Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The ability of cancer cells to become invasive and migratory contribute significantly to metastatic growth, which necessitates the identification of novel anti-migratory and anti-invasive therapeutic approaches. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a mucin-like glycoprotein, contributes to joint synovial homeostasis through its friction-reducing and anti-adhesive properties. Adhesion to surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) components is critical for cancer cells to invade the ECM and eventually become metastatic, raising the question whether PRG4 has an anti-invasive effect on cancer cells. Here, we report that a full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) suppresses the ability of the secreted protein transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) to induce phenotypic disruption of three-dimensional human breast cancer cell-derived organoids by reducing ligand-induced cell invasion. In mechanistic studies, we find that rhPRG4 suppresses TGFβ-induced invasiveness of cancer cells by inhibiting the downstream hyaluronan (HA)-cell surface cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) signalling axis. Furthermore, we find that rhPRG4 represses TGFβ-dependent increase in the protein abundance of CD44 and of the enzyme HAS2, which is involved in HA biosynthesis. It is widely accepted that TGFβ has both tumor suppressing and tumor promoting roles in cancer. The novel finding that rhPRG4 opposes HAS2 and CD44 induction by TGFβ has implications for downregulating the tumor promoting roles, while maintaining the tumor suppressive aspects of TGFβ actions. Finally, these findings point to rhPRG4's potential clinical utility as a therapeutic treatment for invasive and metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2965500021,"Factors that underlie the clustering of metabolic syndrome traits are not fully known. We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in kindreds with extreme phenotypes of early-onset atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome, and identified novel loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the pancreatic elastase chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 2A (CELA2A). We further show that CELA2A is a circulating enzyme that reduces platelet hyperactivation, triggers both insulin secretion and degradation, and increases insulin sensitivity. CELA2A plasma levels rise postprandially and parallel insulin levels in humans. Loss of these functions by the mutant proteins provides insight into disease mechanisms and suggests that CELA2A could be an attractive therapeutic target. Exome sequencing identifies loss-of-function CELA2A mutations in families with early-onset atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome. Functional studies show that CELA2A is a circulating enzyme that reduces platelet activation, triggers insulin secretion and degradation, and increases insulin sensitivity."

Cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-mediated protein delivery requires the binding of CPPs to a protein to carry the protein into the cell through the cell wall and lipid bilayer. Thus, we prepared ionic complexes of a CPP-containing carrier peptide and a cargo protein, namely, Citrine yellow fluorescent protein, and subsequently studied their physicochemical properties. Two types of carrier peptides, BP100(KH)9 and BP100CH7, were investigated for delivery efficiency into rice callus. Both BP100(KH)9 and BP100CH7 successfully introduced Citrine protein into rice callus cells under pressure and vacuum treatment. Moreover, delivery efficiency varied at different growth stages of rice callus; 5-day rice callus was a more efficient recipient for Citrine than 21-day callus."

However, deep learning models typically require a large amount of annotated training data while often only small labeled datasets are available for many natural language processing tasks in biomedical literature. Building large-size datasets for deep learning is expensive since it involves considerable human effort and usually requires domain expertise in specialized fields. In this work, we consider augmenting manually annotated data with large amounts of data using distant supervision. However, data obtained by distant supervision is often noisy, we first apply some heuristics to remove some of the incorrect annotations. Then using methods inspired from transfer learning, we show that the resulting models outperform models trained on the original manually annotated sets."
https://openalex.org/W2965650402,"Background Prioritizing zoonotic diseases is one of the emerging tasks for developing multi-sectoral collaboration within One Health. Globally, many efforts have been made to prioritize zoonotic diseases at national levels, especially in low resource settings. Prioritization of zoonoses has been conducted in different countries at different levels (i.e. national, regional and local) for different purposes. India has also initiated prioritization of zoonotic diseases at the national level. However, in a country like India with wide climatic variations, different animal-human and vector densities, it is important to look at these zoonotic conditions in local settings too. The present study aims to determine which zoonoses should be prioritized for collaboration between stakeholders in the Indian city of Ahmedabad. Methods The present study followed a participatory research method, entailing a stakeholder workshop for prioritizing zoonotic diseases in Ahmedabad. It was carried out through a facilitated consultative process involving 19 experts in zoonoses from the human and animal health systems during a one-day workshop in September 2018. To prioritize the zoonotic diseases, the One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) tool of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was adopted. The Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and decision-tree analysis were used to rank the diseases. Results Out of 38 listed zoonotic diseases, 14 were selected for prioritization. These were scored and weighed against five criteria: severity of disease in humans, potential for epidemic and/or pandemic, availability of prevention and/or control strategies, burden of animal disease existing inter-sectoral collaboration. The top five diseases that have been prioritized for Ahmedabad are Rabies, Brucellosis, Avian Influenza (H5N1), Influenza A (H1N1) and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever. Sensitivity analysis did not indicate significant changes in zoonotic disease prioritization based on criteria weights. Conclusion Prioritization of zoonotic diseases at the local level is essential for development of effective One Health strategies. This type of participatory disease prioritization workshop is highly recommended and can be replicated in other Indian cities, as well as in other low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2965699718,"Plant cell walls development is an integrated process during which several components are deposited successively. In the cell walls in grass, the accessibility of structural polysaccharides is limited by the cell walls structure and composition mainly as a result of phenolic compounds. Here, we studied the patterns of cell walls establishment in the internode supporting the ear in three distinct maize genotypes. The developmental patterns observed in the internode cell walls in terms of its composition are reported with an emphasis on lignification, p-coumaroylation and feruloylation. We combined biochemical and histological approaches and revealed that internode cell walls development in maize before flowering is characterized by the rapid deposition of secondary cell walls components and robust lignification in both the pith and the rind. After flowering and until silage maturity, the slow deposition of secondary walls components occurs in the cortical region, and the deposited lignins are rich in β-O-4 bonds and are highly p-coumaroylated. We conclude the paper by proposing a revised spatiotemporal model based on that proposed by Terashima et al. (1993) for cell walls development in grass."

This study aimed to assess the outcome of TB treatment and factors facilitating treatment success among people living with HIV/AIDS in Fako Division of the South West Region of Cameroon. Methods A hospital-based retrospective cohort study was conducted by manually reviewing medical records of HIV/TB co-infected patients from January 2010 to September 2017. A structured data collection form was used to review the medical records of HIV patients co-infected with TB aged 10 years and older. Patients with incomplete files were dropped from the study. Treatment success was defined as the sum of patients who were declared cured and those who had completed treatment, as per the World Health Organization’s recommendations. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was carried out to identify factors facilitating successful TB treatment outcome. Significance was obtained through adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval and a p<0.05. Results A total of 2,986 files were reviewed but 2,928 (98.1%) were retained. Out of the 2,928 medical files of adult TB patients reviewed, 1,041 (35.6%, [95% CI 33.8%-37.3%]) were HIV/TB co-infected. The 1,041 co-infected patients had a mean age of 37.07 (SD of10.02) years and 56.3% were females. The treatment outcome of TB patients were 795(76.4%) cured, 23(2.2%) treatment completed, 99(9.5%) were lost to follow-up, 16 (1.5%) failed, 72(6.9%) died and 36(3.5%) transferred out. A successful treatment outcome was achieved in 818(78.6%,[95% CI: 76.0%–81.0%]) patients. Being a female [COR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.19–2.17, p = 0.002], receiving TB treatment in 2014 [COR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.11–3.60, p = 0.021] and 2015 [COR 2.50, 95% CI: 1.39–4.50, p = 0.002], having relapsed TB infection [COR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.93, p = 0.031], receiving ART [COR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.28–2.97, p = 0.002] and Cotrimoxazole [COR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.12–3.66, p = 0.019] were factors significantly associated with successful treatment. After adjusting for confounders, successful treatment outcome were associated with being a female [AOR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.21–2.22, p = 0.001], diagnosis of TB in 2014 [AOR 1.90; 95% CI: 1.04–3.45, p = 0.036] and 2015 [AOR 2.43; 95% CI: 1.33–4.43, p = 0.004]. Conclusion There is a high TB treatment success rate among HIV/TB co-infected patients in our setting, although below the target set by the WHO. Specific interventions aimed at enhancing patient outcomes are recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2964861131,"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. The exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, but substantial evidence indicates that it has a genetic component. Genome wide association studies demonstrate variants within miR-137 host gene are a risk factor for schizophrenia. However, the direct relationship between the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the dosage of miR-137 remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing miR-137 (miR-137 Tg mice) with the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter and examined schizophrenia-related phenotypes in these mice. Overexpression of miR-137 was observed in various brain regions of the miR-137 Tg mice, with down-regulation of putative miR-137 targets. MiR-137 Tg mice showed sensory gating deficits in a prepulse inhibition test, social deficits in a sociability and social novelty test, and cognitive deficits in a novel object recognition test. Interestingly, the predicted-altered pathways of the medial prefrontal cortex of miR-137 Tg mice were partially overlapped with those of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in postmortem brain of patients who died in equal to or less than 4 years after initial diagnosis of schizophrenia in published data. These results suggest that overexpression of miR-137 in the whole brain induces the several phenotypes that are relevant to aspects of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Based on these findings, miR-137 Tg mice may have the potential to become a useful tool in researching the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders."

Inhibiting STAT3 is a promising target-specific chemotherapeutic strategy for tumors with aberrant STAT3 signaling. Here we investigated the antitumor effects of novel pyrazole-based STAT3 pathway inhibitors named MNS1 (Mayo Neurosurgery 1) in both pediatric and adult HGG tumor cells. MNS1 compounds selectively decreased cell viability and proliferation in patient-derived HGG cells with minimal toxicity on normal human astrocytes. These inhibitors selectively blocked IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear localization of pSTAT3 without affecting other signaling molecules including Akt, STAT1, JAK2 or ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Functional analysis showed that MNS1 compounds induced apoptosis and decrease tumor migration. The anti-tumor effects extended into a murine pHGG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma) patient derived xenograft, and systemic toxicity was not evident during dose escalation in mice. These results support further development of STAT3 inhibitors for both pediatric and adult HGG."

Using biological and behavioral outcomes, we compared programs to increase access to VCT, male condoms or both among youth in Western Kenya with the standard available HIV prevention services within this setting.A four arm, unblinded randomized controlled trial.The sample includes 10,245 youth aged 17 to 24 randomly assigned to receive community-based VCT, 150 male condoms, both VCT and condoms, or neither program. All had access to standard HIV services available within their communities. Surveys and blood samples for HSV-2 testing were collected at baseline (2009-2010) and at follow up (2011-2013). VCT was offered to all participants at follow up. HSV-2 prevalence, the primary outcome, was assessed using weighted logistic regressions in an intention-to-treat analysis.For the 7,565 respondents surveyed at follow up, (effective tracking rate = 91%), the weighted HSV-2 prevalence was similar across groups (control group = 10.8%, condoms only group = 9.1%, VCT only group = 10.2%, VCT and condoms group = 11.5%). None of the interventions significantly reduced HSV-2 prevalence; the adjusted odds ratios were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.61-1.25) for condoms only, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.64-1.38) for VCT only, and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.79-1.58) for both interventions. The VCT intervention significantly increased HIV testing (adj OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.32-5.41 for VCT only, and adj OR: 5.52, 95% CI: 3.90-7.81 for condoms and VCT group). There were no statistically significant effects on risk of HIV, or on other behavioral or knowledge outcomes including self-reported pregnancy rates.This study suggests that systematic community-based VCT campaigns (in addition to VCT availability at local health clinics) and condom distribution are unlikely on their own to significantly reduce the prevalence of HSV-2 among youth."

https://openalex.org/W2966348819,"The wild type huntingtin protein (Htt), supports the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a survival factor for striatal neurons, through cytoplasmic sequestering of RE-1silencing transcription factor (REST). In Huntington´s Disease an inherited degenerative disease, caused by a CAG expansion in the 5´coding region of the gene, the mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt), causes that REST enters pathologically into the nucleus of cells, resulting in the repression of neuronal genes including BDNF, resulting in the progressive neuronal death. It has been reported that Htt associates with Hsp90 and this interaction is involved in regulation of huntingtin aggregation. Discovering mechanisms to reduce the cellular levels of mutant huntingtin and REST provide promising strategies for treating Huntington disease. Here, we use the yeast two-hybrid system to show that N-terminus or REST interacts with the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and identifies REST as an Hsp90 Client Protein. To assess the effects of Hsp90 we used antisense oligonucleotide, and evaluated the levels mHtt and REST levels. Our results show that direct knockdown of endogenous Hsp90 significantly reduces the levels of REST and mutant Huntingtin, decreased the percentage of cells with mHtt in nucleus and rescued cells from mHtt-induced cellular cytotoxicity. Additionally Hsp90-specific inhibitors geldanamicyn and PUH71 dramatically reduced mHtt and REST levels, thereby providing neuroprotective activity. Our data show that Hsp90 is necessary to maintain the levels of REST and mHtt, which suggests that the interactions between Hsp90-REST and Hsp90-Huntingtin could be potential therapeutic targets in Huntington's disease."

As such, it represents an ideal environment for examining the people, interactions, and flow of scientific information. Using interactions involving the four most popular Twitter hashtags for paleontology, this embedded mixed methods study defined the members of this social world and investigated how they influenced and controlled the flow of information, as well as how their expression of scientific practice was related to their identity. Results provide further evidence for the diversity of people and practice involved in this domain of science and indicate that the magnitude and breadth of the public's impact may be larger than previously projected. Certain types of messages were shown to be effective for different segments of the community, but news posts, essentially media outlet stories, were ineffective for generating any form of engagement. This study adds to our understanding of the important scientific contribution being made by members of the public as they interact with professional scientists and educators as peers in an open social media platform that supports a diverse and active community."
https://openalex.org/W2966379532,"This paper aims to describe the prevalent forms of intimate partner violence (IPV), and the factors associated with IPV among women and men living in the two migrant communities of Baglung district, Nepal. 357 adult women and men were enrolled following a family model, interviewing young married women with daughter-in-law status in the home, their husbands, and mothers-in-law and fathers-in-laws using an electronic questionnaire. Random effects regression modelling compared men and women, as well as young married women with daughter-in-law status and older women with mothers-in-law with status. 28.6% of women had ever experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner compared to 18.2% of men ever perpetrated these forms of violence against their wives. Being older, male controlling behaviour and poor relations with husband increased women’s IPV in their lifetime while perceptions that the mother-in-law is kind were protective. Being ashamed of being unemployed and childhood trauma were associated with men perpetrating IPV in their lifetime. Borrowing money or food increased young married women’s lifetime IPV risk while mother-in-law cruelty and male control increased older married women’s lifetime IPV exposure. Factors associated with IPV in the past year among men were being younger, job seeking, experiences of childhood trauma and depression exposure among men while difficulty accessing money for emergencies, holding inequitable gender attitudes, and depression was associated with women’s increased IPV exposure. Unemployment stress, holding inequitable gender attitudes and mother-in-law kindness were associated with young women’s increased IPV risk and hunger, mother-in-law cruelty and depression with older women’s IPV risk. There is a need to critically challenge harmful social and gender norms by using approaches that are sensitive to young married women’s position and unequal gender relations in the family. IPV prevention interventions need to employ a holistic approach that combines changing social and gender norms and improving socioeconomic conditions of women living in migrant communities."
https://openalex.org/W2966429973,"Objective We sought to determine whether the early luteal serum progesterone (P4) level predicts the success of IVF treatment with oral dydrogesterone for luteal support. Method This retrospective monocentric cohort study included 242 women who underwent IVF treatment with fresh embryo transfer (ET) between July 2017 and June 2018. The population was unselected, and women were treated according to our unit’s usual stimulation protocols. For the luteal phase support (LPS), all women were supplemented with a 10 mg three-times-daily dose of oral dydrogesterone beginning on the day of oocyte pick-up (OPU). Blood sampling was performed on the day of ET (Day 2–3 after OPU) to determine the early luteal serum progesterone level. Results ROC curve analysis allowed us to determine two thresholds for the prediction of live birth using the early P4 level. Women who had early luteal P4 levels greater than 252 nmol/l had a significantly higher live birth rate (27.1%) than women with early luteal P4 between 115 and 252 nmol/l (17.2%) and women with early luteal P4 below 115 nmol/l (6.0%; p = 0.011). After a multiple regression analysis, an early luteal P4 level greater than 252 nmol/l was still associated with a higher chance of a live birth than a P4 between 115 and 252 nmol/l (OR = 0.40 [0.18–0.91]; p = 0.028) or a P4 below 115 nmol/l (OR = 0.10 [0.01–0.52]; p = 0.006). Conclusions Our study suggests a positive association between early P4 levels and reproductive outcomes in IVF using oral dydrogesterone for luteal support. The inconsistencies between our results and those of other studies suggest that extrapolation is impractical. Further larger prospective cohort studies should be conducted to determine reliable thresholds that could be used to personalize luteal phase support."
https://openalex.org/W2966677000,"Previous studies have reported an association between family relationships and suicidal behavior, and found that people with high suicidal ideation are not likely to consult with others about their distress. An effective consulting service is therefore necessary for such individuals. Crisis hotlines are effective for reducing suicide risk, but their associated suicide ideation rate and odds ratio of family problems children remain unclear. The present study investigated the suicidal ideation rate and odds ratio of callers under 20 years of age (N = 24,333) with family problems to the Japanese crisis hotline in 2012. There were 5,242 (21.5%), 18,061 (74.2%), and 1,030 (4.2%) calls related to family problems, other problems, and both, respectively. The suicidal ideation rate and odds ratio of callers with family problems were 2.2% and 0.426, respectively. This result suggested that callers with family problems have a significantly lower rate and odds ratio for suicidal ideation compared with others. However, some associations with a high suicide ideation rate were found for individual items among callers with family problems such as abuse (20.4%), family breakdown (16.1%), and domestic violence (10.6%). Further studies are needed to understand the suicidal ideation of callers with family problems and develop more effective preventive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2964521628,"Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a potent morphogen that regulates the ontogenesis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and therefore reproductive success. Indeed, FGF8 and FGFR1 deficiency severely compromises vertebrate reproduction in mice and humans and is associated with Kallmann Syndrome (KS), a congenital disease characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism associated with anosmia. Our laboratory demonstrated that FGF8 signaling through FGFR1, both of which are KS-related genes, is necessary for proper GnRH neuron development in mice and humans. Here, we investigated the possibility that non-genetic factors, such as the epigenome, may contribute to KS onset. For this purpose, we developed an embryonic explant model, utilizing the mouse olfactory placode (OP), the birthplace of GnRH neurons. We show that TET1, which converts 5-methylcytosine residues (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylated cytosines (5hmC), controls transcription of Fgf8 during GnRH neuron ontogenesis. Through MeDIP and ChIP RT-qPCR we found that TET1 bound to specific CpG islands on the Fgf8 promoter. We found that the temporal expression of Fgf8 correlates with not only TET1 binding, but also with 5hmC enrichment. siRNA knockdown of Tet1 reduced Fgf8 and Fgfr1 mRNA expression. During this time period, Fgf8 also switched histone status, most likely via recruitment of EZH2, a major component of the polycomb repressor complex-2 (PRC2) at E13.5. Together, these studies underscore the significance of epigenetics and chromatin modifications to temporally regulated genes involved in KS."

https://openalex.org/W2964634960,"This study was undertaken to examine biometric measurements during the growth phase of male and female Santa Inês sheep reared in Brachiaria brizantha pastures in northeastern Brazil. The experiment involved 24 castrated males and 24 females at an initial age of 90 days, with an average body weight of 19.04 ± 0.96 kg. Treatments consisted of the effect of four cultivars (Marandu, Xaraés, Piatã and Paiaguás) and two sexes. Six animals were used per treatment, in a randomized-block experimental design. The following characteristics were evaluated: abdominal circumference (AC), body condition score (BCS), body length (BL), body weight (BW), body capacity 1 (BC1), body capacity 2 (BC2), chest width (CW), heart girth (HG), leg circumference (LC), leg length (LL), rump height (RH), rump width (RW) and withers height (WH). Data were subjected to descriptive analysis, Pearson's correlation, ANOVA and Tukey's, Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Univariate and multiple regressions were applied to estimate BW with a maximum error level of 5%. Significant differences were observed for the biometric measurements between sexes and cultivars (p<0.05). Body weight was highly correlated (>70%) with AC, WH, CG, RW, BC1 and BC2. The male sheep grazed on cultivars Piatã showed the best values for BW (40.43 kg), HG, RW, WH, LL, LC (102.46; 20.8; 65.23; 60.44; 42.54 cm respectively) and BC1 (4.25 kg/cm). Females grazed on cultivar Marandu had higher values for RW, CW, LL (17.26; 20.1; 75.98 cm respectively), BC1 (6.03 kg/cm) and BC2 (0.422 kg/cm). The equations that best estimated live weight were BC1 and HG. In male and female Santa Inês sheep, biometric parameters grow differently depending on the cultivar where they are grazed during the growth phase. Cultivars Marandu and Piatã are the most recommended for sheep production, as they provided the best performance and body development in those animals."
https://openalex.org/W2965440282,"Castanopsis sclerophylla (Lindl.) Schott is an important species of evergreen broad-leaved tree in subtropical areas and has high ecological and economic value. However, there are few studies on its chloroplast genome. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of C. sclerophylla was determined using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The complete chloroplast genome of C. sclerophylla is 160,497 bp long, including a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions (25,675 bp) separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 90,255 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,892 bp. The overall GC content of the chloroplast genome is 36.82%. A total of 131 genes were found; of these, 111 genes are unique and annotated, including 79 protein-coding genes, 27 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and four ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs). Twenty-one genes were found to be duplicated in the IR regions. Comparative analysis indicated that IR contraction might be the reason for the smaller chloroplast genome of C. sclerophylla compared to three congeneric species. Sequence analysis indicated that the LSC and SSC regions are more divergent than IR regions within Castanopsis; furthermore, greater divergence was found in noncoding regions than in coding regions. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed that four species of the genus Castanopsis form a monophyletic clade and that C. sclerophylla is closely related to Castanopsis hainanensis with strong bootstrap values. These results not only provide a basic understanding of Castanopsis chloroplast genomes, but also illuminate Castanopsis species evolution within the Fagaceae family. Furthermore, these findings will be valuable for future studies of genetic diversity and enhance our understanding of the phylogenetic evolution of Castanopsis."

The chronologies are compared to local and remote environmental drivers suspected to influence the biology of the system, including air and seawater temperature, precipitation and freshwater discharge. The Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System (BiOS), a key oceanographic feature quantified by satellite-derived absolute dynamic topography, is also compared to the chronologies. The chronologies at the two southern sites are more strongly influenced by local river discharge, while the two northern chronologies are more strongly influenced by BiOS. These results highlight the broadscale importance of BiOS to the Adriatic system as well as the heterogeneity of nearshore environmental and drivers of growth. These G. pilosa chronologies provide unique multidecadal, continuous, biological time series to better understand the ecology and fine-scale variability of the Adriatic with potential for other shallow, semi-enclosed seas."
https://openalex.org/W2966780791,"Entrainment is a ubiquitous property not only of interacting non-linear dynamical systems but also of human movements. In the study reported here, two premises of entrainment theory were investigated in a tapping task conducted in both interpersonal (i.e. between individuals) and intrapersonal (i.e. between effectors) conditions. Hypothesis 1 was that interacting oscillatory systems should demonstrate synchronisation, which was predicted to emerge as in-phase tapping behaviour in both inter- and intrapersonal conditions. Support for Hypothesis 1 was observed in the in-phase synchronisation of tapping in both individual bimanual trials and uni-manual and bimanual tapping in dyads. By contrast, Hypothesis 2 was that the oscillatory system with the faster initial rate would decelerate, whereas the one with the slower initial rate would accelerate, as manifest in increased self-paced tapping rates amongst participants with initially slower rates and decreased rates amongst ones who initially tapped at faster rates. However, that pattern predicted in Hypothesis 2 was not observed; on the contrary, all participants increased their tapping rates in interpersonal conditions, which occurred significantly amongst participants with the lowest preferred tapping rates. Such an outcome indicates a novel aspect of synchronised movement in humans that warrants further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2965477145,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is a forage and amenity grass species widely cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. As such, perennial ryegrass populations are exposed to a range of environmental conditions and stresses on a seasonal basis and from year to year. One source of potential stress is limitation on water availability. The ability of these perennial grasses to be able to withstand and recover after periods of water limitation or drought can be a key component of grassland performance. Thus, we were interested in looking at changes in patterns of gene expression associated with increasing water stress. Clones of a single genotype of perennial ryegrass were grown under non-flowering growth room conditions in vermiculite supplemented with nutrient solution. Leaf and root tissue was sampled at 4 times in quadruplicate relating to estimated water contents of 35%, 15%, 5% and 1%. RNA was extracted and RNAseq used to generate transcriptome profiles at each sampling point. Transcriptomes were assembled using the published reference genome sequence and differential gene expression analysed using 3 different programmes, DESeq2, edgeR and limma (with the voom transformation), individually and in combination, deriving Early, Middle and Late stage comparisons. Identified differentially expressed genes were then associated with enriched GO terms using BLAST2GO. For the leaf, up-regulated differentially expressed genes were strongly associated with GO terms only during the Early stage and the majority of GO terms were associated with only down-regulated genes at the Middle or Late stages. For the roots, few differentially expressed genes were identified at either Early or Middle stages. Only one replicate at 1% estimated water content produced high quality data for the root, however, this indicated a high level of differential expression. Again the majority of enriched GO terms were associated with down-regulated genes. The performance of the different analysis programmes and the annotations associated with identified differentially expressed genes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2965748747,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease in which left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is common. However, the association between diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular (RV) loading conditions and function has not been investigated in asymptomatic AS patients.A total of 41 patients underwent right heart catheterization and simultaneous echocardiography at rest and during maximal supine exercise, stratified according to resting diastolic function. Cardiac chamber size and morphology was assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). RV stroke work index, pulmonary artery (PA) compliance, PA elastance, PA pulsatility index, and right atrial pressure (RAP) were calculated at rest and maximal exercise. Ten patients (24%) had normal LV filling pattern, 20 patients (49%) had grade 1, and 11 patients (27%) had grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. Compared to patients with normal diastolic filling pattern, patients with diastolic dysfunction had lower RV end-diastolic volume (66 ± 11 ml/m2 vs. 79 ± 15 ml/m2, p = 0.02) and end-systolic volume (25 ± 7 ml/m2 vs. 32 ± 9 ml/m2, p = 0.04). An increase in mean RAP to ≥15 mmHg following exercise was not seen in patients with normal LV filling, compared to 4 patients (20%) with mild and 7 patients (63%) with moderate diastolic dysfunction (p = 0.003). PA pressure and PA elastance was increased in grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and correlated with RV volume and maximal oxygen consumption (r = -0.71, p < 0.001).Moderate diastolic dysfunction is associated with increased RV afterload (elastance), which is compensated at rest, but is associated with increased RAP and inversely related to maximal oxygen consumption during maximal exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2965984191,"Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of a non-locking plate applied to the anteromedial surface of the proximal humerus on loads at the implant-bone interface of non-locking and locking lateral plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures with a medial gap. Methods Twenty synthetic humeri models were used. In fifteen, the proximal portion of the humerus was osteotomized to create a two-part surgical neck fracture, with a 10-mm medial gap and a 5-mm lateral gap; five models were controls. In the osteotomized humeri, five models were stabilized with a locking lateral plate (group L), five with a locking lateral plate and an anteromedial non-locking plate (group L+T), and five with a non-locking lateral plate and a non-locking anteromedial plate (group T+T). All humeri were tested under axial loading until catastrophic failure, which was characterized as complete closure of the medial gap. Stiffness was calculated using force vs. displacement curves. The data were analyzed via descriptive and inferential studies, at a 5% significance level. Results Statistically significant differences were seen among all the constructions. The combination of a lateral locking plate with an anteromedial non-locking plate (group L+T) was the stiffest construction, while the combination of a non-locking lateral plate with a non-locking anteromedial plate (group T+T) was the least stiff, even in comparison with a single locking lateral plate (p = 0.01). When the two groups which utilized a lateral locking plate (groups L+T and L) were compared, the group with additional anteromedial support demonstrated greater stiffness (p = 0.03), and stiffness values for the control group comprised of intact humeri models were even higher (p = 0.01). Conclusion Combining a lateral locking plate with a non-locking anteromedial plate provides a stiffer construction for fixation of unstable two-part proximal humerus fractures with a medial gap. Mechanical benefits of medial support with a second non-locking antero-medial plate seems to be related with better construct stability in terms of strength and fatigue, potentially reducing the risk of varus collapse of the humerus head and fracture healing disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2966483953,"It has been suggested that Jmjd6 plays an important role in gene regulation through its demethylation or hydroxylation activity on histone and transcription factors. In addition, Jmjd6 has been shown to regulate RNA splicing by interaction with splicing factors. In this study, we demonstrated that Jmjd6a is expressed in developing Xenopus laevis eye during optic vesicle formation and retinal layer differentiation stages. Knockdown of Jmjd6a by an antisense morpholino resulted in eye malformation including a deformed retinal layer and no lens formation. We further found down-regulation of gene expression related to eye development such as Rx1, Otx2, and Pax6 in Jmjd6a morpholino injected embryos. Jmjd6 interacts with splicing factor U2AF25 and GSK3β RNA in the anterior region of Xenopus embryos. Knockdown of Jmjd6a led to deletion of GSK3β RNA exon 1 and 2, which resulted in generation of N'-terminal truncated GSK3β protein. This event further caused decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin and subsequently increased β-catenin stability. Therefore, our result may suggest that Jmjd6a plays an important role in Xenopus eye development through regulation of GSK3β RNA splicing and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
