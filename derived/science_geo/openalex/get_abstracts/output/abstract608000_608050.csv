https://openalex.org/W2794791791,"Alterations in both cell metabolism and transcriptional programs are hallmarks of cancer that sustain rapid proliferation and metastasis 1 . However, the mechanisms that control the interaction between metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation remain unclear. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) regulates transcriptional reprogramming by activating the oncogenic steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3). We used a kinome-wide RNA interference-based screening method to identify potential kinases that modulate the intrinsic SRC-3 transcriptional response. PFKFB4, a regulatory enzyme that synthesizes a potent stimulator of glycolysis 2 , is found to be a robust stimulator of SRC-3 that coregulates oestrogen receptor. PFKFB4 phosphorylates SRC-3 at serine 857 and enhances its transcriptional activity, whereas either suppression of PFKFB4 or ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-deficient Ser857Ala mutant SRC-3 abolishes the SRC-3-mediated transcriptional output. Functionally, PFKFB4-driven SRC-3 activation drives glucose flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway and enables purine synthesis by transcriptionally upregulating the expression of the enzyme transketolase. In addition, the two enzymes adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 (AMPD1) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which are involved in purine metabolism, were identified as SRC-3 targets that may or may not be directly involved in purine synthesis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of SRC-3 at Ser857 increases its interaction with the transcription factor ATF4 by stabilizing the recruitment of SRC-3 and ATF4 to target gene promoters. Ablation of SRC-3 or PFKFB4 suppresses breast tumour growth in mice and prevents metastasis to the lung from an orthotopic setting, as does Ser857Ala-mutant SRC-3. PFKFB4 and phosphorylated SRC-3 levels are increased and correlate in oestrogen receptor-positive tumours, whereas, in patients with the basal subtype, PFKFB4 and SRC-3 drive a common protein signature that correlates with the poor survival of patients with breast cancer. These findings suggest that the Warburg pathway enzyme PFKFB4 acts as a molecular fulcrum that couples sugar metabolism to transcriptional activation by stimulating SRC-3 to promote aggressive metastatic tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2795473923,"Collagens are the most abundant extracellular matrix proteins in vertebrates and have a characteristic triple-helix structure. Hydroxylation of proline residues is critical for helix stability, and diminished prolyl hydroxylase activity causes wide-spread defects in connective tissues. Still, the role of proline hydroxylation in the binding of collagen receptors such as integrins is unclear. Here, we isolated skin collagen from genetically modified mice having reduced prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. At room temperature, the reduced proline hydroxylation did not affect interactions with the recombinant integrin α2I domain, but at 37 °C, collagen hydroxylation correlated with the avidity of α2I domain binding. Of note, LC–MS/MS analysis of isolated skin collagens revealed no major changes in the hydroxyproline content of the main integrin-binding sites. Thus, the disrupted α2I domain binding at physiological temperatures was most likely due to structural destabilization of the collagenous helix. Integrin α2I binding to the triple-helical GFPGER motif was slightly weaker than to GFOGER (O = hydroxyproline). This phenomenon was more prominent when α1 integrin was tested. Integrin α1β1 expressed on CHO cells and recombinant α1I domain showed remarkably slower binding velocity and weaker avidity to GFPGER when compared with GFOGER. Structural modeling revealed the critical interaction between Arg-218 in α1I and the hydroxyproline residue in the integrin-binding motif. The role of Arg-218 was further validated by testing a variant R218D α1I domain in solid-phase binding assays. Thus, our results show that the lack of proline hydroxylation in collagen can affect integrin binding by a direct mechanism and via structural destabilization of the triple helix."
https://openalex.org/W2796242973,"Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2796450262,"Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in in vitro liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin."
https://openalex.org/W2795388985,"Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort (1991-2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR's of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend <0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR's of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale."
https://openalex.org/W2795894102,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Vietnam experience disproportionate rates of HIV infection. To advance understanding of how structural barriers may shape their engagement with HIV prevention services, we draw on 32 in-depth interviews and four focus groups (n = 31) conducted with MSM in Hanoi between October 2015- March 2016. Three primary factors emerged: (1) Diversity, both in relation to identity and income; Vietnamese MSM described themselves as segregated into Bong kin (hidden, often heterosexually-identified MSM) and Bong lộ ('out,' transgender, or effeminate MSM). Lower-income, 'hidden' MSM from rural areas were reluctant to access MSM-targeted services; (2) Stigma: MSM reported being stigmatized by the healthcare system, family, and other MSM; and (3) Healthcare access: this was limited due to economic barriers and lack of MSM-friendly services. Our research suggests the need for multiple strategies to reach diverse types of MSM as well as to address barriers in access to health services such as stigma and costs. While a great deal has been written about the diversity of MSM in relation to gender performance and sexual identities, our research points to the substantial structural-level barriers that must be addressed in order to achieve meaningful and effective HIV prevention for MSM worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2795694659,"Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet et al. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab."
https://openalex.org/W2795639806,"Determining digestive enzyme activity is of potential interest to obtain and understand valuable information about fish digestive physiology, since digestion is an elementary process of fish metabolism. We described for the first time (i) three digestive enzymes: amylase, trypsin and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), and (ii) three gut morphometric parameters: relative gut length (RGL), relative gut mass (RGM) and Zihler’s index (ZI) in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and we studied the effect of temperature and body size on these parameters. When mimicking seasonal variation in temperature, body size had no effect on digestive enzyme activity. The highest levels of amylase and trypsin activity were observed at 18°C, while the highest IAP activity was recorded at 20°C. When sticklebacks were exposed to three constant temperatures (16, 18 and 21°C), a temporal effect correlated to fish growth was observed with inverse evolution patterns between amylase activity and the activities of trypsin and IAP. Temperature (in both experiments) had no effect on morphometric parameters. However, a temporal variation was recorded for both RGM (in the second experiment) and ZI (in both experiments), and the later was correlated to fish body mass."
https://openalex.org/W2795724967,"The objective of this study was to identify distinct trajectories and their predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of women during pregnancy in a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 3936 Dutch pregnant women in Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Information on potential predictors was collected in early pregnancy by questionnaire. Latent Class Mixture Modelling and Multinomial Logistic Regression were applied to assess the trajectory and predictors of HRQOL during pregnancy. HRQOL was measured by SF-12 in early, mid- and late pregnancy; physical and mental component summary (PCS-12/MCS-12) scores were calculated. Four physical HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (‘healthy’) in 63.3%, consistently low (‘vulnerable’) in 10.8%; a small increase (‘recovering’) in 12.8% and a large decrease (‘at risk’) in 13.1%. Three mental HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (‘healthy’) in 86.1%; a large increase (‘recovering’) in 7.5%; and a large decrease (‘at risk’) in 6.4%. Compared with healthy trajectories, the likelihood of following the ‘vulnerable’ physical HRQOL trajectory rather than a healthy trajectory was increased by daily fatigue(OR: 4.82[2.76, 8.40]), pelvic pain (OR:4.76[2.91, 7.78]) and back pain (OR:5.29[3.21, 8.70]); pregnancy-specific anxiety increased the likelihood of following the ‘at risk’ mental HRQOL trajectory (OR:7.95[4.84, 13.05]). Healthy physical and mental HRQOL trajectories during pregnancy were most common. Predictors indicative of poor HRQOL trajectories included pregnancy-related symptoms and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2796228621,"Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress."
https://openalex.org/W2795522385,"Waterbirds disperse a wide range of plant seeds via their guts, promoting biotic connectivity between isolated habitat patches. However, the intensity of digestive forces encountered by seeds, and therefore their potential to survive digestive tract passage, varies within and between waterbird species. Here, we investigate under controlled conditions how the interaction between seed traits and digestive strategies affect the germinability of seeds following waterbird-mediated dispersal. We exposed seeds of 30 wetland plant species to the main digestive processes in the dabbling duck digestive system: mechanical, chemical and intestinal digestion. These were simulated by 1) a pressure test and scarification treatment, 2) incubation in simulated gastric juice, and 3) incubation in intestinal contents of culled mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We evaluated their separate and combined effects on seed germination, and identified the role of seed size and seed coat traits in resisting the digestive forces. Seeds were generally resistant to separate digestive processes, but highly sensitive to a combination. Resistance to mechanical break-down was reduced by up to 80% by chemical pre-treatment, especially for seeds with permeable coats. Scarified seeds were 12-17% more vulnerable to chemical and intestinal digestive processes than undamaged seeds. Large seeds and seeds with thin, permeable coats were particularly sensitive to chemical and intestinal digestion. These results indicate that efficient digestion of seeds requires multiple digestive processes. The gizzard, responsible for mechanical digestion, plays a key role in seed survival. Omnivorous birds, which have relatively light gizzards compared to pure herbivores or granivores, are thus most likely to disperse seeds successfully. Regardless of digestive strategy, small seeds with tough seed coats are most resistant to digestion and may be adapted to endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds."
https://openalex.org/W2795757007,"We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS."
https://openalex.org/W2796179251,"In keeping with China’s President Xi Jinping’s “Chinese Dream,” China has set a goal of becoming a world-class innovator by 2050. China’s higher education Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research environment will play a pivotal role in influencing whether China is successful in transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy. Past studies on China’s research environment have been primarily qualitative in nature or based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, we surveyed STEM faculty from China’s top 25 universities to get a clearer understanding of how faculty members view China’s overall research environment. We received 731 completed survey responses, 17% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from abroad and 83% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from domestic institutions of higher education. We present results on why returnees decided to study abroad, returnees’ decisions to return to China, and differences in perceptions between returnees and domestic degree holders on the advantages of having a foreign degree. The top five challenges to China’s research environment identified by survey respondents were: a promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2796237160,"Background Neurodegeneration occurs during the early stages of multiple sclerosis. It is an essential, devastating part of the pathophysiology. Tools for measuring the degree of neurodegeneration could improve diagnostics and patient characterization. Objective This study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of biomarkers of degeneration in patients with recent clinical onset of suspected multiple sclerosis, and to evaluate these biomarkers for characterizing disease course. Methods This cross-sectional study included 271 patients with clinical features of suspected multiple sclerosis onset and was the baseline of a prospective study. After diagnostic investigations, the patients were classified into the following disease groups: patients with clinically isolated syndrome (n = 4) or early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (early RRMS; n = 93); patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with disease durations ≥2 years (established RRMS; n = 39); patients without multiple sclerosis, but showing symptoms (symptomatic controls; n = 89); and patients diagnosed with other diseases (n = 46). In addition, we included healthy controls (n = 51) and patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 23). We analyzed six biomarkers of neurodegeneration: cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels; cerebral spinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein; cerebral spinal fluid tau; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; macula volume; and the brain parenchymal fraction. Results Except for increased cerebral spinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels, median 670 ng/L (IQR 400–2110), we could not find signs of early degeneration in the early disease group with recent clinical onset. However, the intrathecal immunoglobin G production and cerebral spinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels showed diagnostic value. Moreover, elevated levels of cerebral spinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein, thin retinal nerve fiber layers, and low brain parenchymal fractions were associated with progressive disease, but not with the other phenotypes. Thin retinal nerve fiber layers and low brain parenchymal fractions, which indicated neurodegeneration, were associated with longer disease duration. Conclusions In clinically suspected multiple sclerosis, intrathecal immunoglobin G production and neurofilament light chain levels had diagnostic value. Therefore, these biomarkers could be included in diagnostic work-ups for multiple sclerosis. We found that the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and the brain parenchymal fraction were not different between individuals that were healthy, symptomatic, or newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This finding suggested that neurodegeneration had not reached a significant magnitude in patients with a recent clinical onset of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2795742827,"In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2796298471,"Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2795536869,"Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire."
https://openalex.org/W2795544909,"The electron transport chain of E. coli contains three different quinone species, ubiquinone (UQ), menaquinone (MK) and demethylmenaquinone (DMK). The content and ratio of the different quinone species vary depending on the external conditions. To study the function of the different quinone species in more detail, strains with deletions preventing UQ synthesis, as well as MK and/or DMK synthesis were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The strains were characterized with respect to growth and product synthesis. As quinones are also involved in the control of ArcB/A activity, we analyzed the phosphorylation state of the response regulator as well as the expression of selected genes.The data show reduced aerobic growth coupled to lactate production in the mutants defective in ubiquinone synthesis. This confirms the current assumption that ubiquinone is the main quinone under aerobic growth conditions. In the UQ mutant strains the amount of MK and DMK is significantly elevated. The strain synthesizing only DMK is less affected in growth than the strain synthesizing MK as well as DMK. An inhibitory effect of MK on aerobic growth due to increased oxidative stress is postulated.Under fermentative growth conditions the mutant synthesizing only UQ is severely impaired in growth. Obviously, UQ is not able to replace MK and DMK during anaerobic growth. Mutations affecting quinone synthesis have an impact on ArcA phosphorylation only under anaerobic conditions. ArcA phosphorylation is reduced in strains synthesizing only MK or MK plus DMK."
https://openalex.org/W2795592387,"Objectives Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period. Methods Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up. Results Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change. Discussion The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient. Those family carers could benefit most from appropriate support. The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required.

The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60-100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., Caudovirales) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias."
https://openalex.org/W2795953613,"Background Effective antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy minimizes the risk of vertical HIV transmission. Some women present late in their pregnancy for first antenatal visit; whether these women achieve viral suppression by delivery and how suppression varies with time on ART is unclear. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected pregnant women initiating antiretroviral therapy for the first time at Bwaila Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi from June 2015 to November 2016. Multivariable Poisson models with robust variance estimators were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association between duration of ART and both viral load (VL) ≥1000 copies/ml and VL ≥40 copies/ml at delivery. Results Of the 252 women who had viral load testing at delivery, 40 (16%) and 78 (31%) had VL ≥1000 copies/ml and VL ≥40 copies/ml, respectively. The proportion of women with poor adherence to ART was higher among women who were on ART for ≤12 weeks (9/50 = 18.0%) than among those who were on ART for 13–35 weeks (18/194 = 9.3%). Compared to women who were on ART for ≤12 weeks, women who were on ART for 13–20 weeks (RR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.36–0.74) or 21–35 weeks (RR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.14–0.48) had a lower risk of VL ≥40 copies/ml at delivery. Similar comparisons for VL ≥1000 copies/ml at delivery showed decrease in risk although not significant for those on ART 13–20 weeks. Conclusion Longer duration of ART during pregnancy was associated with suppressed viral load at delivery. Early ANC attendance in pregnancy to facilitate prompt ART initiation for HIV-positive women is essential in the effort to eliminate HIV vertical transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2795932837,"Neurite outgrowth is a crucial process in developing neurons for neural network formation. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of neurite outgrowth is essential for developing strategies to stimulate neurite regeneration after nerve injury and in neurodegenerative disorders. FE65 is a brain-enriched adaptor that stimulates Rac1-mediated neurite elongation. However, the precise mechanism by which FE65 promotes the process remains elusive. Here, we show that ELMO1, a subunit of ELMO1-DOCK180 bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), interacts with the FE65 N-terminal region. Overexpression of FE65 and/or ELMO1 enhances, whereas knockdown of FE65 or ELMO1 inhibits, neurite outgrowth and Rac1 activation. The effect of FE65 alone or together with ELMO1 is attenuated by an FE65 double mutation that disrupts FE65-ELMO1 interaction. Notably, FE65 is found to activate ELMO1 by diminishing ELMO1 intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction and to promote the targeting of ELMO1 to the plasma membrane, where Rac1 is activated. We also show that FE65, ELMO1, and DOCK180 form a tripartite complex. Knockdown of DOCK180 reduces the stimulatory effect of FE65-ELMO1 on Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth. Thus, we identify a novel mechanism by which FE65 stimulates Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth by recruiting and activating ELMO1.

FE65 is a brain-enriched adaptor protein with several protein interaction domains, including a WW domain and two C-terminal PTB 2The abbreviations used are:PTBphosphotyrosine-bindingAPPamyloid precursor proteinARF6ADP-ribosylation factor 6CHOChinese hamster ovaryDOCK180dedicator of cytokinesis 180ELMO1engulfment and cell motility protein 1GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGSTglutathione S-transferaseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyPMplasma membraneNTRN-terminal regionEIDELMO inhibitory domainICAintensity correlation analysisICQintensity correlation quotientPLAproximity ligation assayY2Hyeast two-hybridE18embryonic day 18EGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleIPimmunoprecipitation. domains (see Fig. 1A). It is generally believed that FE65 acts as a “scaffold” protein to recruit various interactors to form a functional complex. Indeed, a number of FE65-interacting proteins (FIPs) are identified for its conserved domains. These findings have provided insights into the biological functions of FE65. For instance, FE65, via its PTB2 domain, is shown to interact with Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) and to alter APP processing. Moreover, the FE65 PTB1 domain is found to interact with the small GTPase ARF6 (reviewed in Refs. 1Minopoli G. Gargiulo A. Parisi S. Russo T.

Additionally, FE65 is implicated in neurodevelopment. FE65 knockout mice have been shown to have significant impairment in hidden-platform acquisition ability and reversal learning (3Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. Isoform-specific knockout of FE65 leads to impaired learning and memory.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75 (14689444): 12-2410.1002/jnr.10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Increased neonatal mortality and abnormal circling behavior are reported for FE65/FE65L1 double knockout mice. In fact, aberrant laminin organization of meningeal fibroblasts and axonal projection and pathfinding impairments in several brain regions have been observed in the mice (4Guénette S. Chang Y. Hiesberger T. Richardson J.A. Eckman C.B. Eckman E.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Essential roles for the FE65 amyloid precursor protein-interacting proteins in brain development.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (16407979): 420-43110.1038/sj.emboj.7600926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, neuromuscular junction abnormalities and long-term potentiation impairments are observed in the mice (5Strecker P. Ludewig S. Rust M. Mundinger T.A. Görlich A. Krächan E.G. Mehrfeld C. Herz J. Korte M. Guénette S.Y. Kins S. FE65 and FE65L1 share common synaptic functions and genetically interact with the APP family in neuromuscular junction formation.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27734846): 2565210.1038/srep25652Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have also shown that FE65 stimulates neurite outgrowth, an essential process for neural network formation, by activating ARF6-Rac1 signaling (6Cheung H.N. Dunbar C. Mórotz G.M. Cheng W.H. Chan H.Y. Miller C.C. Lau K.F. FE65 interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor 6 to promote neurite outgrowth.FASEB J. 2014; 28 (24056087): 337-34910.1096/fj.13-232694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because FE65 does not possess any guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalytic activity, the underlying mechanisms by which FE65 stimulates the signaling pathway remain elusive. Nevertheless, the above findings underscore FE65 plays significant developmental roles in the nervous system. Despite the fact that a number of interactors for the conserved domains are identified, FE65 N-terminal region (NTR) binding partners have not been properly determined yet. As an adaptor, it is possible that FE65 NTR is also involved in protein recruitment. To this end, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using FE65 NTR as “bait” and identified engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1) as a novel FE65 interactor. ELMO1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein containing an N-terminal Ras-binding domain, an ELMO inhibitory domain (EID), an ELMO domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, an ELMO autoregulatory domain (EAD), and a C-terminal PXXP motif (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Ref. 7Patel M.

ELMO1 is reported to be involved in various processes, including phagocytosis, cell migration, cancer metastasis, dendritic spine morphogenesis, and lymphocyte migration (reviewed in Refs. 8Ravichandran K.S.

Many of these processes require dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. The effects of ELMO1 are attributable, at least in part, to Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPases that regulate actin dynamics. Rac1 is activated by the GEFs, which promote the exchange of GDP to GTP in Rac1. By contrast, GTPase-activating proteins inactivate Rac1 by promoting GTP hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 12Ridley A.J. Rho GTPases and actin dynamics in membrane protrusions and vesicle trafficking.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16 (16949823): 522-52910.1016/j.tcb.2006.08.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In cells, ELMO1 complexes with DOCK180 to form a bipartite GEF in cells awaiting the yet to be identified activation signal(s) to mediate Rac1-dependent cytoskeleton remodeling (7Patel M.

Here, we show that FE65 interacts with ELMO1 and in turn diminishes ELMO1 intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction. Moreover, FE65-ELMO1 interaction plays a role in stimulating Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth. From a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library using FE65(1–217) fragment as “bait,” a cDNA clone encoding ELMO1(626–727), which contains part of the pleckstrin homology domain, EAD, and the PXXP motif, was isolated. Their interaction in yeast was confirmed using a β-gal colony-lift filter assay (Fig. 1B). To further analyze the FE65-ELMO1 interaction, bacterially expressed GST and GST-ELMO1(626–727) fusion proteins were used as baits to pull down FE65 from transfected cells. In this assay, ELMO1(626–727), but not GST, pulled down FE65 (Fig. 1C). We next tested the FE65-ELMO1 interaction by using immunoprecipitation assays from transfected cells. FE65 was transfected either alone or co-transfected with Myc-tagged ELMO1. ELMO1 was then immunoprecipitated via the Myc tag. FE65 was detected in immunoprecipitates from the FE65 + ELMO1 but not FE65 singly transfected control cells (Fig. 1D). To demonstrate that endogenous FE65-ELMO1 interaction, we immunoprecipitated ELMO1 from rat brains and probed the immunoprecipitate for FE65. As shown in Fig. 1E, both ELMO1 and FE65 were present in the immunoprecipitates. The above biochemical assays indicate that FE65 interacts with ELMO1. However, they could not exclude the possibility that FE65-ELMO1 interaction is mediated by an intermediate molecule. To examine whether this interaction is direct, we incubated Escherichia coli purified His-FE65(1–217) with E. coli purified GST or GST-ELMO1(626–727) baits. As shown in Fig. 1F, His-FE65(1–217) could be pulled down by GST-ELMO1(626–727) but not GST. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FE65 interacts directly with ELMO1. Next, we determined the regions in FE65 and ELMO1 that mediate their interaction. In addition to FE65(1–217), we further prepared three FE65 NTR yeast “bait” constructs. Yeast cells were co-transformed with ELMO1(626–727) prey construct and different FE65 NTR baits and then grown on double and quadruple dropout SD agar plates. We found that the transformants could not grow on a quadruple dropout plate when FE65 amino acids 1–60 were deleted (Fig. 1G, top). This suggests that the first 60 residues of FE65 are essential for FE65-ELMO1 interaction. We then determined the residue(s) in FE65 that is critical for mediating FE65-ELMO1 interaction by generating a number of FE65 mutants and tested their abilities to interact with ELMO1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We found that FE65 Lys-48 and Arg-51 (FE65m) are crucial for FE65-ELMO1 interaction, as the interaction was markedly reduced by an FE65 K48A/R51A double mutation (Fig. 1H). On the other hand, ELMO1(626–680) could not interact with FE65(1–217) in yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1G, bottom). This suggests that amino acids 681–727 of ELMO1, which contain EAD and PXXP, are required for the interaction. ELMO1 Met-692 and Glu-693 are two critical residues in EAD for mediating protein interaction, at least with ELMO1 EID (15Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. An evolutionarily conserved autoinhibitory molecular switch in ELMO proteins regulates Rac signaling.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20 (21035343): 2021-202710.1016/j.cub.2010.10.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the two residues are essential for FE65-ELMO1 interaction. As shown in Fig. 1G, an ELMO1 M692A/E693A (ELMO1m) double mutation abolished the interaction between ELMO1(626–727) and FE65(1–217) in the yeast two-hybrid system. We confirmed the importance of the two residues by a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which FE65-ELMO1 interaction was markedly reduced by an ELMO1m double mutation (Fig. 1I). Together, our result suggests that FE65(1–60) and ELMO1 EAD are required for FE65-ELMO1 interaction. Previously, we have found that FE65 stimulates Rac1-dependent neurite outgrowth (6Cheung H.N. Dunbar C. Mórotz G.M. Cheng W.H. Chan H.Y. Miller C.C. Lau K.F. FE65 interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor 6 to promote neurite outgrowth.FASEB J. 2014; 28 (24056087): 337-34910.1096/fj.13-232694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because ELMO1 also enhances Rac1 activation and is widely expressed in different cell types, including neurons (Fig. 2A), we anticipated that FE65-ELMO1 interaction promotes neurite extension. To test this, 2 days in vitro rat primary cortical neurons were transfected with FE65, ELMO1, and FE65 + ELMO1 together with enhanced GFP-expressing plasmid (pEGFP-C1), which serves as a morphology marker for the transfected neurons. The expressions of FE65 and/or ELMO1 were confirmed by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 2B, top right and bottom). The lengths of the longest neurite from the growth cone tip to the periphery of the cell body of the transfected neurons were measured 24 h post-transfection. This is a widely employed neurite measurement approach (e.g. see Refs. 6Cheung H.N. Dunbar C. Mórotz G.M. Cheng W.H. Chan H.Y. Miller C.C. Lau K.F.

Notably, overexpression of ELMO1 also promoted neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2B). As we have shown that ELMO1 interacts with FE65 (Fig. 1) and FE65 is expressed in neurons (Fig. 2A), the effect of overexpression of ELMO1 on neurite outgrowth might be due to the transfected ELMO1 that interacted with endogenous FE65 in the neurons. In fact, a more pronounced stimulatory effect was observed in FE65 + ELMO1 co-transfected neurons, and such an effect was not observed in FE65m + ELMO1 (Fig. 2B). As FE65m could not interact with ELMO1 properly, our findings suggest that FE65-ELMO1 interaction could promote neurite outgrowth.Figure 3.FE65-ELMO1 interaction activates Rac1. A–C, CHO cells were transfected with the constructs EV control plasmid, FE65, FE65m, and ELMO1 and either control, FE65, or ELMO1 siRNAs as indicated. Active Rac1 was pulled down from the transfected cell lysates using GST-PAK1 PBD bait (supplied in the Rac1 activation assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific)), which binds Rac1-GTP. Rac1-GTP bound to the bait was analyzed on immunoblots using anti-Rac1 23A8 (1:5000), FE65 E20 (1:5000), Rac1 23A8 (1:5000), ELMO1 B-7 (1:5000), and α-tubulin DM1A (1:5000), and expression levels in the cell lysates are also shown.

FE65(1–217), FE65(1–95), FE65(61–217), and FE65(1–60) were cloned into pGBKT7. ELMO1(626–727), ELMO1(626–680), and ELMO1(626–727)M692A/E693A (ELMO1m(627–727)) were cloned into pGADT7. FE65 and ELMO1 constructs were co-transformed into yeast Y2H Gold. The transformants were grown on double (−Leu/−Trp; DDO) and quadruple (−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp; QDO) dropout SD agar plates. FE65 Lys-48 and Arg-51 (H) and ELMO1 Met-692 and Glu-693 (I) are crucial residues for the interaction. Myc-tagged ELMO1 was immunoprecipitated from the transfected lysates using anti-Myc 9B11. ELMO1 and FE65 in the immunoprecipitates were detected using rabbit anti-ELMO1 antibody (1:5000) and goat anti-FE65 antibody E20 (1:5000), respectively. IgG and B-7 refer to the presence of mouse control IgG and anti-ELMO1 in the immunoprecipitations, respectively. Lysates and pulldown/IP samples in C, D, E, F, H, and I were probed with anti-α-tubulin DM1A antibody (1:5000) to illustrate lysate loading and pulldowns/IP specificity, respectively. FE65 and ELMO1 levels were measured by a C-DiGit blot scanner (LI-COR) and analyzed by LI-COR® Image StudioTM software.

Rac proteins and the control of axon development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 (12850224): 384-39010.1016/S0959-4388(03)00071-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether FE65-ELMO1 interaction influences Rac1 activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of FE65 or ELMO1 could activate Rac1. However, FE65m could not stimulate Rac1. Of note, Rac1 was strongly activated in FE65 + ELMO1, but not FE65m + ELMO1, co-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Because FE65m has reduced binding ability toward ELMO1, our findings suggest that FE65-ELMO1 plays a role in promoting Rac1 activation. To further dissect the roles of FE65 and ELMO1 in neurite outgrowth, an siRNA knockdown approach was employed. Akin to our previous finding (6Cheung H.N. Dunbar C. Mórotz G.M. Cheng W.H. Chan H.Y. Miller C.C. Lau K.F. FE65 interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor 6 to promote neurite outgrowth.FASEB J. 2014; 28 (24056087): 337-34910.1096/fj.13-232694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), knockdown of FE65 reduced the basal neurite extension significantly (Fig. 2C). A similar effect was observed in ELMO1 knockdown neurons (Fig. 2C). These observations further suggest that both FE65 and ELMO1 are essential for neurite outgrowth. Intriguingly, the stimulatory effect of overexpression of ELMO1 on neurite outgrowth and Rac1 were markedly reduced in FE65 knockdown cells (Figs. 2D and 3B). This suggests that FE65 is required, at least in part, for the effects of ELMO1 on neurite outgrowth and Rac1 activation. On the other hand, overexpression of FE65 could not stimulate neurite growth in ELMO1 knockdown neurons (Fig. 2E), and its effect on Rac1 activation was also decreased markedly in ELMO1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3C). Collectively, our findings suggest that FE65 plays a role, at least in part, in stimulating Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth by interacting with ELMO1. As stated before, ELMO1 is a subunit of the ELMO1-DOCK180 bipartite Rac1 GEF complex (13Laurin M. Côté J.F. Insights into the biological functions of Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors.Genes Dev. 2014; 28 (24637113): 533-54710.1101/gad.236349.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether FE65 alters the GEF complex formation. To do this, FLAG-DOCK180 was precipitated by anti-FLAG M2 antibody from DOCK180 + ELMO1- and DOCK180 + ELMO1 + FE65-transfected cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amounts of ELMO1 in both immunoprecipitates were similar. Notably, FE65 was also detected in the immunoprecipitate from ELMO1 + DOCK180 + FE65-transfected cell lysate (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we were able to determine a tripartite complex of DOCK180, ELMO1, and FE65 at the endogenous level by immunoprecipitating DOCK180 from rat brain lysate (Fig. 4B). Taken together, both FE65 and DOCK180 can bind simultaneously to ELMO1 to form a tripartite complex. Because DOCK180 is the catalytic subunit of ELMO1-DOCK180 bipartite Rac1 GEF complex (13Laurin M. Côté J.F. Insights into the biological functions of Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors.Genes Dev. 2014; 28 (24637113): 533-54710.1101/gad.236349.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we tested whether DOCK180 was essential for FE65-mediated Rac1 activation. Similar to our previous observation, overexpression of FE65 activated Rac1 (Fig. 4C). However, the effect of FE65 on Rac1 activation was reduced significantly in DOCK180 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly, knockdown of DOCK180 decreased the effect of ELMO1 on Rac1 activation (Fig. 4C). The combined effect of FE65 and ELMO1 on Rac1 was also markedly lowered in DOCK180 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). We also determined the effect of DOCK180 knockdown on FE65-ELMO1-mediated neurite extension. As shown in Fig. 4D, knockdown of DOCK180 reduced the stimulating effects of FE65, ELMO1, and FE65 + ELMO1 on neurite outgrowth. Together, our results suggest that DOCK180 is required, at least in part, for FE65-ELMO1–mediated Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth. To interact in cells, FE65 and ELMO1 must be located within the same subcellular compartment. Because Rac1 is mainly activated on the plasma membrane (19Bustelo X.R. Ojeda V. Barreira M. Sauzeau V. Castro-Castro A. Rac-ing to the plasma membrane: the long and complex work commute of Rac1 during cell signaling.Small GTPases. 2012; 3 (22714419): 60-6610.4161/sgtp.19111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both FE65 and ELMO1 stimulate Rac1, we determined whether FE65 and ELMO1 are expressed on the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane was prepared from both FE65 + ELMO1 co-transfected cells and primary cortical neurons by using a Qproteome plasma membrane protein kit (Qiagen). Approximately 30% of plasma membrane elution and 1% total lysate (as size control) were subjected to immunoblotting for FE65, ELMO1, and various subcellular compartment markers. We found that both FE65 and ELMO1 were detected in the plasma membrane elutions from FE65 + ELMO1 co-transfected cells (Fig. 5A) and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 5B). The above biochemical plasm"

Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant χ2 difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (rs 0.92–1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants."

In this study, the combined effect of 50 Hz-EMFs and 5-FU in the treatment of breast cancer was explored. MCF-7 and MCF10A cells were pre-exposed to 50 Hz-EMFs for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 h and then treated with different concentrations of 5-FU for 24 h; cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. After pre-exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs for 12 h, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 and MCF10A cells were detected via flow cytometry and DNA synthesis was measured by EdU incorporation assay. Apoptosis-related and cell cycle-related gene and protein expression levels were monitored by qPCR and western blotting. Pre-exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs for 12 h enhanced the antiproliferative effect of 5-FU in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in a dose-dependent manner but not in normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs had no effect on apoptosis and P53 expression of MCF-7 and MCF10A cells, whereas it promoted DNA synthesis, induced entry of MCF-7 cells into the S phase of cell cycle, and upregulated the expression levels of cell cycle-related proteins Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E. Considering the pharmacological mechanisms of 5-FU in specifically disrupting DNA synthesis, this enhanced inhibitory effect might have resulted from the specific sensitivity of MCF7 cells in active S phase to 5-FU. Our findings demonstrate the enhanced cytotoxic activity of 5-FU on MCF7 cells through promoting entry into the S phase of the cell cycle via exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs, which provides a novel method of cancer treatment based on the combinatorial use of 50 Hz-EMFs and chemotherapy."

Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies enhance tumor-specific immunity through a variety of mechanisms including: blockade of CD80 or CD86 binding to CTLA-4, repressing regulatory T cell function and selective elimination of intratumoral regulatory T cells via an Fcγ receptor-dependent mechanism. AGEN1884 is a novel IgG1 antibody targeting CTLA-4. It potently enhanced antigen-specific T cell responsiveness that could be potentiated in combination with other immunomodulatory antibodies. AGEN1884 was well-tolerated in non-human primates and enhanced vaccine-mediated antigen-specific immunity. AGEN1884 combined effectively with PD-1 blockade to elicit a T cell proliferative response in the periphery. Interestingly, an IgG2 variant of AGEN1884 revealed distinct functional differences that may have implications for optimal dosing regimens in patients. Taken together, the pharmacological properties of AGEN1884 support its clinical investigation as a single therapeutic and combination agent."

However, the detail of blood glucose dynamics is not well known. The aim of the present study was to evaluate glycemic fluctuations by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Materials and methods A total of 105 CLD patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were enrolled in this study. Various parameters of glycemic variability were evaluated. The association of these parameters with liver functional reserve was examined. The parameters were also evaluated according to glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Results and discussion Data of all patients showed that mean blood glucose (MBG) levels and the difference between highest and lowest blood glucose (ΔBG) increased significantly with worsening of liver functional reserve (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). Although many of the cases were being treated for diabetes, postprandial hyperglycemia was seen in 92% of patients. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was seen in 22% of patients. In non-anemic patients with HbA1c levels of < 7.0%, the percentage of patients with mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) of ≥ 77.4 mg/dL and that of MBG levels of > 145 mg/dL were higher in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients than in chronic hepatitis (CH) patients. In them, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) of > 2.5 and LC were significantly associated with the increase in MAGE. LC was also significantly associated with increased MBG levels. Conclusion The CGM systems were useful in finding hidden abnormalities of blood glucose fluctuations in CLD patients with T2DM, especially in non-anemic CLD patients with HbA1c levels of < 7.0%."
https://openalex.org/W2796112340,"Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2942009598,"The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain proteins or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the ‘initial infectivity’ was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2952596279,"Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents’ behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question."

The initial phase of this project examined student performance in the classroom component of a newly established curriculum named “Foundations in Biomedical Sciences (FiBS)”. Quantitative measures including undergraduate grade point average (GPA), graduate record examination (GRE; a standardized, computer-based test) scores for the verbal (assessment of test takers’ ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information and concepts provided in writing) and quantitative (assessment of test takers’ problem-solving ability) components of the examination, previous research experience, and competitiveness of previous research institution were used in the study. These criteria were compared with competencies in the program defined as students who pass the curriculum as well as students categorized as High Performers. These data indicated that there is a significant positive correlation between FiBS performance and undergraduate GPA, GRE scores, and competitiveness of undergraduate institution. No significant correlations were found between FiBS performance and research background. By taking a data-driven approach to examine admissions and performance, we hope to refine our admissions criteria to facilitate an unbiased approach to recruitment of students in the life sciences and to share our strategy to support similar goals at other institutions."

Many of these landscape planning efforts rely on geospatial models that characterize the ecological integrity of the landscape.

We built upon these modeling frameworks by developing a Landscape Integrity Index (LII) model using geospatial datasets of the human footprint, as well as incorporation of other indicators of ecological integrity such as biodiversity and vegetation departure. Our LII model serves as a general indicator of ecological integrity in a regional context of human activity, biodiversity, and change in habitat composition. We also discuss the application of the LII framework in two related coarse-filter landscape conservation approaches to expand the size and connectedness of protected areas as regional mitigation for anticipated land-use changes."

Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women."

Scl1 proteins from several M types bind to ECM proteins, cFn and Lm, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but not FH and CFHR1; the converse is also true.

Here, we established that surface-exposed loops within the V domain structure guide Scl1 to bind EDA/cFn, as well as two other Scl1 ligands, laminin and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) of LDL. A second conserved constituent within variable Scl1-V domain is a common topography of the electrostatic surface potential surrounding guiding loops, which includes a negatively charged patch formed by collective Asp and Glu residues contributed by all three monomeric chains. The proposed model accommodates binding of common ligands by phylogenetically diverse Scl1 variants. This work implies the evolutionary response of the Scl1-V domain to selective pressure, resulting in the retention of the conserved structure and function of ligand binding. This underscores the importance of Scl1-binding to EDA-containing fibronectins deposited at the pathogen portal of entry. Two streptococcal collagen-like proteins, Scl1 and Scl2, display a similar “lollipop-like” structural organization (Fig. 1A), which is composed of an N-terminal globular V-domain head and a C-terminal CL-domain stalk (14Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Höök M. Lukomski S. Streptococcal Scl1 and Scl2 proteins form collagen-like triple helices.J. Biol.

Multiple-sequence alignments illustrate a significant variations in the V regions, both between and within the Scl1 and Scl2 families (Fig. 1B). Despite sequence variation, several secondary structure prediction algorithms deduced that both Scl1-V and Scl2-V domains contain two conserved α-helices interconnected by hypervariable regions. Crystallography data rendered for the recombinant Scl2-V construct, derived from M3-type GAS, revealed that rScl2.3-V protein forms a homotrimer, with three pairs of conserved α-helices forming a six-helix bundle and hypervariable regions forming surface-exposed loops (PDB code 4NSM). To examine the conservation of the helix-loop-helix motif, homology models of two sequence-diverse Scl1- and Scl2-V domains were generated (Fig. 1C), using the structure of the Scl2.3-V domain as template. The homology model structure of the Scl1.1-V domain from M1-type GAS was based on the consensus sequence alignment (24% sequence identity on 65 amino acid residues), and the model of the Scl2.28-V domain from M28 GAS was obtained with the same approach (51.5% identity with Scl2.3-V sequence on 74 residues). Homology models predict with high confidence that Scl1.1-V (E = 3.5 × 10−16) and Scl2.28-V (E = 1.8 × 10−40) domains each adopt a six-helix bundle trimeric structure similar to that of Scl2.3-V template. The solved crystal structure and homology models rendered here show that globular domains of Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 variants can trimerize without the presence of the CL domain, an observation that was also found in Scl2 proteins from other M types (45Yu Z. Mirochnitchenko O. Xu C. Yoshizumi A. Brodsky B. Inouye M.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that trimeric rScl1-V constructs will retain their binding function to ECM ligands. Full-length rScl1 proteins, derived from different GAS M types, bind to host cFn via interactions with EDA, which is mediated by Scl1-V domain (25Caswell C.C. Oliver-Kozup H. Han R. Lukomska E.

Full-length recombinant Scl1 constructs, derived from M1-type (rScl1.1FL) and M3-type (rScl1.3FL) strains, as well as their corresponding V domain–only proteins (rScl1.1V and rScl1.3V) were immobilized in wells and tested for ECM–ligand binding. Unexpectedly, neither rScl1.1V nor rScl1.3V constructs bound rEDA and cFn, whereas the corresponding full-length rScl1FL control proteins bound both ligands (Fig. 2). Thus, whereas the V domains of Scl1 proteins can fold independently of their CL domains, there are currently unknown structural constraints that require the presence of continuous CL domains for EDA/cFn recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2795838041,"Shigella represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of Shigella serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 Shigella isolates between 2008 to 2014. Shigella flexneri was identified as predominant species, and several S. flexneri serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant S. flexneri serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). Shigella sonnei was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different Shigella antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant Shigella isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as blaOXA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among Shigella subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant S. flexneri isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, S. sonnei isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 S. flexneri isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of Shigella were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens."

State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2795996737,"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (<8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP."
https://openalex.org/W2796184513,"It is generally recognized that insect odorant binding proteins (OBPs) mediate the solubilisation and transport of hydrophobic odorant molecules and contribute to the sensitivity of the insect olfactory system. However, the exact mechanism by which OBPs deliver odorants to olfactory receptors and their role, if any, as selectivity filters for specific odorants, are still a matter of debate. In the case of Anopheles gambiae, recent studies indicate that ligand discrimination is effected through the formation of heterodimers such as AgamOBP1 and AgamOBP4 (odorant binding proteins 1 and 4 from Anopheles gambiae). Furthermore, AgamOBPs have been reported to be promiscuous in binding more than one ligand simultaneously and repellents such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-toluamide) and 6-MH (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) interact directly with mosquito OBPs and/or compete for the binding of attractive odorants thus disrupting OBP heterodimerisation. In this paper, we propose mechanisms of action of DEET and 6-MH. We also predict that ligand binding can occur in several locations of AgamOBP1 with partial occupancies and propose structural features appropriate for repellent pharmacophores."
https://openalex.org/W2796438685,"Dispersal is a demographic process that can potentially counterbalance the negative impacts of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. However, mechanisms of dispersal may become modified in populations living in human-dominated habitats. Here, we investigated dispersal in Guinea baboons (Papio papio) in areas with contrasting levels of anthropogenic fragmentation, as a case study. Using molecular data, we compared the direction and extent of sex-biased gene flow in two baboon populations: from Guinea-Bissau (GB, fragmented distribution, human-dominated habitat) and Senegal (SEN, continuous distribution, protected area). Individual-based Bayesian clustering, spatial autocorrelation, assignment tests and migrant identification suggested female-mediated gene flow at a large spatial scale for GB with evidence of contact between genetically differentiated males at one locality, which could be interpreted as male-mediated gene flow in southern GB. Gene flow was also found to be female-biased in SEN for a smaller scale. However, in the southwest coastal part of GB, at the same geographic scale as SEN, no sex-biased dispersal was detected and a modest or recent restriction in GB female dispersal seems to have occurred. This population-specific variation in dispersal is attributed to behavioural responses to human activity in GB. Our study highlights the importance of considering the genetic consequences of disrupted dispersal patterns as an additional impact of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and is potentially relevant to the conservation of many species inhabiting human-dominated environments."
https://openalex.org/W2795504801,"Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent."
https://openalex.org/W2795674726,"Introduction Multiple jobholders (MJHs) have a higher risk of injury compared to single jobholders (SJHs), but it is unknown if return-to-work (RTW) after a work injury is affected by multiple jobholding. This study examined the association between multiple versus single jobholding and time to RTW for workers with a work-related musculoskeletal disorder (MSD). Methods We used administrative workers’ compensation data to identify injured workers with an accepted MSD lost-time claim between 2010–2014 in British Columbia, Canada (n = 125,639 SJHs and 9,029 MJHs). The outcome was days until RTW during twelve months after the first day of time-loss. The MJH and SJH cohorts were balanced using coarsened exact matching that yielded a final matched cohort of 8,389 MJHs and 8,389 SJHs. The outcome was estimated with Cox regression, using piecewise models, and the hazard ratios were stratified by type of MSD, a serious injury indicator, gender, weekly workdays preceding MSD, and wage categories. Results MJHs were less likely to RTW compared to SJHs within the first six months after the first time-loss day, with greater and longer lasting effects for males, workers with a serious injury, and a higher wage. No difference between MJHs and SJHs was found for workers who had a six- or seven-day work week preceding MSD, for workers with dislocations, and for workers who were still off work after six months. Conclusions Overall, MJHs with a workweek of maximum five days are disadvantaged compared to SJHs in terms of RTW following a work-related MSD within the first six months after the first time-loss day. This difference might be caused by more precarious job contracts for MJHs that challenges RTW because of lack of support for modified work, higher workload, and reduced likelihood that MJHs file a workers’ compensation claim. Despite adjusting for type of MSD, severity of injury and occupation, the differences persisted for the vast majority of the study sample."
https://openalex.org/W2796140918,"Chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy conditioning regimens required for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) cause significant morbidity and mortality as a result of insufficient immune surveillance mechanisms leading to increased risks of infection and tumor recurrence. Such conditioning causes host stromal cell injury, impairing restoration of the central (thymus) and peripheral (spleen and lymph node) T cell compartments and slow immune reconstitution. The chemokine, CCL21, produced by host stromal cells, recruits T- and B-cells that provide lymphotoxin mediated instructive signals to stromal cells for lymphoid organogenesis. Moreover, T- and B-cell recruitment into these sites is required for optimal adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumor antigens. Previously, we reported that CCL21 was markedly reduced in secondary lymphoid organs of transplanted animals. Here, we utilized adenoviral CCL21 gene transduced dendritic cells (DC/CCL21) given by footpad injections as a novel approach to restore CCL21 expression in secondary lymphoid organs post-transplant. CCL21 expression in secondary lymphoid organs reached levels of naïve controls and resulted in increased T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes (LNs). An increase in both lymphoid tissue inducer cells and the B cell chemokine CXCL13 known to be important in LN formation was observed. Strikingly, only mice vaccinated with DC/CCL21 loaded with bacterial, viral or tumor antigens and not recipients of DC/control adenovirus loaded cells or no DCs had a marked increase in the systemic clearance of pathogens (bacteria; virus) and leukemia cells. Because DC/CCL21 vaccines have been tested in clinical trials for patients with lung cancer and melanoma, our studies provide the foundation for future trials of DC/CCL21 vaccination in patients receiving pre-transplant conditioning regimens."

Diverse secretory cell types employ the regulated pathway for the secretion of mucins, proteases, inflammatory mediators, biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and peptide hormones. The core machinery for Ca2+-triggered SG–plasma membrane fusion characterized in neural, neuroendocrine, and myeloid secretory cells consists of SG arginine (R)-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins that form fusion-competent complexes with plasma membrane glutamine(Q)-SNARE proteins (1Milovanovic D.

There are potential therapeutic applications for inhibitors of SG exocytosis for a number of secretory cell types, including mast cells. Mast cells store pre-formed vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and proteases in SGs (8Moon T.C. Befus A.D. Kulka M.

Mediator release occurs by Ca2+-dependent SG exocytosis (termed degranulation) in response to allergens, pathogens, and cytokines acting at the cell surface.

This work utilized a series of assays to identify protein targets of inhibitors that act at final steps in Ca2+-dependent SG exocytosis in mast cell-like RBL-2H3 cells. A high-throughput fluorescence-based assay was used to screen an ∼25,000-compound diversity library for inhibitors of ionomycin-induced degranulation. Follow-up assays with a permeable cell assay and a SNARE-dependent liposome fusion assay discovered inhibitors that target a protein required for mast cell SG exocytosis. A family of 2-aminobenzothiazole compounds (termed bexins) was characterized as inhibitors of Munc13-4, an essential Ca2+-dependent priming factor for Ca2+-triggered degranulation in mast cells. Additional studies suggest that bexins interfere with membrane interactions required for Munc13-4 function in Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion. To identify small-molecule inhibitors of degranulation, a high-throughput assay for regulated SG exocytosis in RBL-2H3 mast cells was developed. A fluorescent fusion protein, atrial natriuretic factor–enhanced GFP (ANF-EGFP) was expressed as SG cargo so that a cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise elicited its release by Ca2+-triggered SG exocytosis. Stably expressed ANF-EGFP co-localized with the SG membrane amine transporter protein VMAT2 and the endogenous SG protease RMCP2 (Fig. 1, A–F). The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin stimulated the secretion of ANF-EGFP from RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1G). Stimulation by ionomycin bypasses upstream signaling components and cellular Ca2+ entry mechanisms, so the assay focused on steps in Ca2+-dependent SG exocytosis downstream of Ca2+ entry. The ANF-EGFP secretion assay was adapted to robotic liquid transfer in 384-well plates, and an ∼25,000-compound diversity library (Life Chemicals II) was screened. Cells were pretreated with each test compound (4 μm each) in DMSO (0.1% final) for 15 min before stimulation with 2 μm ionomycin for 15 min. Secreted ANF-EGFP in the medium was removed, and cells were solubilized in detergent to measure secreted and cell-retained fluorescence, respectively. Percent secretion was calculated as (medium fluorescence/(medium + cellular fluorescence) × 100%). 32 wells on each 384-well plate received 0.1% DMSO, and 16 of these were stimulated with ionomycin for calculating Z' values per plate. The average percentages of ANF-EGFP secretion for unstimulated and stimulated controls were 5% and 41%, respectively. The average Z' value per plate was 0.51 (Fig. 1G), indicating a good signal for the identification of inhibitors (15Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol.

Inhibitors in the primary screen were identified as compounds that reduced secretion by more than 4 S.D. from the mean. These were retested at three concentrations (0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 μm), and 129 compounds were confirmed to inhibit stimulated degranulation by more than 50% at 4 μm. The inhibitory compounds were clustered into classes based on major ring systems as analyzed in DataWarrior using a combination of the FragFp library and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature from the ChemAxon JChem Suite. Five major classes (A–E) and a diverse class (F) of inhibitors were identified (Fig. 1H). 38 of the 129 strong inhibitors were 2-aminobenzothiazoles (class A). Based on subsequent results, these were termed bexins (benzothiazole exocytosis inhibitors). Two of the strongest 2-aminobenzothiazoles, bexin-1 and -2, exhibited IC50 values of ∼3 μm (Fig. 2, left column). By examining the compound library, we also identified compounds with similar 2D structures that were not inhibitory in the primary screen, such as bexin-5 and -6; these were at least ∼20-fold less effective than bexin-1 (Fig. 2, left column). Despite very similar 2D structures for bexin-1 and -5, energy minimizations performed in SYBYL and the PRODRG server (16Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The benzothiazole ring is extended in the same plane as the pyrazole ring in bexin-1, whereas these ring systems adopt a more compact chair-like configuration in bexin-5. In subsequent studies, bexin-5 was used as an inactive control for inhibitory bexin-1. Inhibitors in other classes (B–F) were shown to be of less interest in subsequent studies (Fig. 4).Figure 4.Permeable RBL-2H3 cell assay for late steps in Ca2+-triggered secretory granule exocytosis. A, RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing ANF-EGFP were permeabilized (see “Experimental procedures”), washed, and incubated under the indicated conditions for 15 min at 37 °C to detect the release of ANF-EGFP normalized to cell content (percent secretion). A representative study is shown, with mean ± S.D. for n = 3. Key additions that promoted ANF-EGFP release were 1 μm Ca2+, 2 mm MgATP, Munc13-4, and 10 μm GTPγS.

Similarly, bexin-2, and -3 inhibited secretion in RBL-2H3 cells but exhibited reduced inhibition in PC12 cells, even at 80 μm (Fig. 2, right column). By contrast, bexin-6, which was inactive in RBL-2H3 cells, was weakly inhibitory in PC12 cells. One explanation for different results in two cell types might be differences in membrane permeability. However, this was rendered unlikely in studies with permeable cells where drug potencies were similar to those in intact cells. Alternatively, different secretory cells might utilize different protein isoforms in regulated SG exocytosis. In this case, RBL-2H3 cells, but not PC12 cells, might express a specific protein isoform that is a target for bexins (see “Discussion”). Overall, the results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that bexins are not general inhibitors of the regulated secretory pathway but may target specific protein isoforms that are essential for regulated SG exocytosis in RBL-2H3 mast cells. To determine the specificity of inhibitory compounds for stimulated SG exocytosis, we utilized several orthogonal assays. The ionomycin-stimulated secretion of endogenous β-hexosaminidase was found to be strongly inhibited by bexin-1, -2, and -3 at 20 μm but not by bexin-5 or -6 (Fig. 3A). As anticipated, other compounds from the secondary screen also inhibited ionomycin-evoked β-hexosaminidase secretion, indicating that inhibition was not selective for SG cargo. Importantly, bexin-1 also inhibited ionomycin-stimulated β-hexosaminidase secretion in bone marrow–derived mast cells (Fig. 3B). Bexin-1 at 10 μm also inhibited IgE-stimulated β-hexosaminidase secretion from bone marrow–derived mast cells by 78%, whereas bexin-5 did not inhibit (IgE-stimulated, 18.7% ± 7.4%; IgE plus bexin-1, 4.1% ± 4.6%, p < 0.05; IgE plus bexin-5, 31.1% ± 11.3%). Thus, inhibition by bexins was not stimulus-dependent. In another orthogonal assay, TNFα C-terminally fused with the pH-sensitive GFP variant ecliptic pHluorin was stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells. Transmembrane TNFα with its C terminus oriented toward the acidic SG lumen was nonfluorescent in resting cells because of low pH quenching. SG exocytosis stimulated by ionomycin treatment resulted in increased fluorescence at the cell surface, detected by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3C). The exocytosis of TNFα-pHluorin was fully inhibited by bexin-1, -2, and -3 but not by bexin-5 or -6 (Fig. 3C). As anticipated, other compound hits from the secondary screen also inhibited. Collectively, the orthogonal assays confirmed the strong inhibitory effects of bexin-1, -2, and -3 on regulated SG exocytosis independent of stimulus or SG cargo. To determine whether other membrane trafficking pathways were affected by compounds, we monitored the uptake of fluorescent transferrin as a measure of endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Neither bexin-1 nor bexin-5 at 20 μm had any effect on transferrin uptake by RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 3D). By contrast, several other compounds from the secondary screen decreased transferrin uptake, indicating that they likely affect endocytosis. Last, compounds in serial dilutions from 2.5 to 40 μm exhibited little cytotoxicity, as assessed with the Alamar Blue reduction assay using 20 times longer incubations than those in secretion assays (Fig. 3E). To further screen for inhibitors that act at late steps in Ca2+-dependent secretion, we employed an assay with permeable RBL-2H3 cells. Ca2+-triggered SG exocytosis can be reconstituted in washed permeable RBL-2H3 cells (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22508512): 301-31210.1083/jcb.201109132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized by a single pass through a ball homogenizer (>90% trypan blue–positive) and washed to remove soluble factors. Incubation of the permeable cells with Ca2+ and MgATP alone caused a modest release of ANF-EGFP (Fig. 4A), and addition of cytosol further stimulated secretion (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22508512): 301-31210.1083/jcb.201109132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of cytosol was fully replaced by the addition of 10 nm recombinant Munc13-4, as reported previously (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J.

The addition of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs further increased Ca2+-triggered ANF-EGFP release (Fig. 4A), similar to previous reports for permeabilized mast cells (18Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Essential synergy between Ca2+ and guanine nucleotides in exocytotic secretion from permeabilized rat mast cells.J.

Secretion in the complete permeable cell assay was comparable with that in intact ionomycin-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells (∼40–50% ANF-EGFP secreted within 10 min). The reconstituted permeable cell assay reduced complexity and provided a direct assay for late steps in Ca2+-triggered SG exocytosis (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22508512): 301-31210.1083/jcb.201109132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anticipating that small-molecule inhibitors acting at late steps would inhibit secretion in this assay, we assembled a sublibrary of 37 compounds representative of the chemical diversity in the secondary screen for classes A–E or the strongest inhibitors in the diverse class F (Fig. 1H). Representative results of testing these compounds in triplicate assays are shown in Fig. 4, C and D (see legend). Only three compounds, bexin-1, -2, and -3, inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion at 20 μm (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Bexin-1 inhibited secretion by 5 μm, whereas the less active bexin-5 failed to inhibit at 20 μm (Fig. 4B) or 40 μm (data not shown). None of the other compounds inhibited secretion in this assay except for three compounds that were very slightly inhibitory at 40 μm (Fig. 4D). Thus, inhibitory bexins uniquely appeared to act at late steps in Munc13-4–dependent SG exocytosis in permeable RBL-2H3 cells. Active bexins reliably inhibited Ca2+-dependent SG exocytosis in intact or permeable RBL-2H3 cells (Figs. 2–Figure 3., Figure 4.). To determine whether bexins might directly interfere with priming or fusion events that follow SG translocation and docking, we utilized a liposome fusion assay that reconstitutes aspects of priming and fusion. Donor liposomes containing R-SNAREs with DiD and acceptor liposomes containing Q-SNAREs with DiI engage in concentration-dependent lipid mixing, measured as increased FRET. Previous studies showed that SNARE-dependent lipid mixing in liposomes is stimulated by accessory proteins such as Munc13-4 + Ca2+ (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J.

We used this highly reduced system to determine whether bexins act directly on any of the essential proteins involved in SG exocytosis. SNARE-dependent lipid mixing was accelerated by inclusion of Munc13-4 and Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A–C), as reported previously (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R. Horiuchi H. Martin T.F. Munc13-4 reconstitutes calcium-dependent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.J.

Bexin-1 and -3 fully inhibited Ca2+/Munc13-4–stimulated SNARE-dependent lipid mixing without affecting the basal rates of lipid mixing in the absence of Munc13-4 or Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A and B). Bexin-5, which was 20-fold less active than bexin-1 in intact or permeable cell assays, had little effect on Ca2+/Munc13-4-stimulated SNARE-dependent lipid mixing (Fig. 5C). Bexin-1 and -3 exerted inhibitory effects with IC50 values of ∼5 μm (Fig. 5D), which approximated the IC50 values observed in intact and permeable cell assays. In a delayed addition study (Fig. 5E), bexin-1 was found to inhibit Ca2+/Munc13-4–stimulated lipid mixing with minimal latency following its addition. To further assess inhibition in the SNARE-dependent lipid mixing assay, we conducted additional studies on the bexins. It was unlikely that active bexins affected SNARE protein function because the basal rates of SNARE-dependent lipid mixing were unaffected. We monitored the rates of SNARE complex formation in an independent anisotropy assay to monitor binding of the fluorescent cytoplasmic R-SNARE VAMP2 to Q-SNARE syntaxin/SNAP25–containing liposomes (Fig. 5F). Neither bexin-1 nor bexin-5 inhibited SNARE complex formation in this assay, consistent with a lack of effect of bexins on SNARE function. We assessed the selectivity of bexins as inhibitors of Ca2+/Munc13-4–dependent liposome fusion by testing other SNARE-binding regulatory proteins. Munc18-1 accelerates SNARE-dependent liposome fusion (20Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Selective activation of cognate SNAREpins by Sec1/Munc18 proteins.Cell. 2007; 128 (17218264): 183-19510.1016/j.cell.2006.12.016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), but active bexin-1 and -3 as well as inactive bexin-5 failed to inhibit Munc18-1–stimulated lipid mixing (Fig. 5G). The results suggested that bexin-1 and -3 exert relatively selective inhibitory effects on Ca2+/Munc13-4. Munc13-4 contains N- and C-terminal Ca2+-binding C2 domains that bracket a central Munc homology domain–containing region. We also tested a protein fragment consisting of two tandem C2 domains (C2AB) from synaptotagmin-1. C2AB with Ca2+ stimulated SNARE-dependent lipid mixing, as reported previously (21Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.R. Reconstitution of Ca2+-regulated membrane fusion by synaptotagmin and SNAREs.Science. 2004; 304 (15044754): 435-43810.1126/science.1097196Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5G). Bexin-1 and, to a lesser extent, bexin-3 inhibited C2AB-stimulated lipid mixing, whereas bexin-5 was without effect. These findings suggest that active bexins may target the C2 domains of Munc13-4 and possibly those of other proteins. Munc13-4 associates with acidic phospholipid-containing liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner through its C-terminal C2 domain (17Boswell K.L. James D.J. Esquibel J.M. Bruinsma S. Shirakawa R.

A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W2796281049,"Despite the recent advances in transcriptomics, gene expression studies addressing cattle´s skeletal muscle adaptations in response to compensatory growth are warranted, particularly regarding lipid metabolism due to its impact in meat sensory and nutritional traits. In the present study, in comparison to ad libitum feeding, a period of feed restriction was used in order to understand the changes in bull´s lipid metabolism and gene expression of the adipogenic and lipogenic pathways after re-alimentation. Thus, 40 young Alentejana bulls were either fed ad libitum (CG group) from 9 to 18 months of age or subjected to food restriction from 9 to 15 months of age, and fed ad libitum until 24 months of age (DG group). The intramuscular fat (IMF) and total fatty acids (FA) contents were similar between groups. The major FA (>2%) contents were similar (16:0, 16:1c9, 18:1c9 and 18:2n-6) between treatments with the exception of 18:0 content that was 15% lower in DG than in CG and 20:4n-6 that tended to be greater on DG bulls. Regarding minor FA (<2%), the DG group presented greater proportions (P<0.01) of 17:1c9, 18:1t9, 18:1t10 (, 18:1c11), 18:1c13, 18:3n-6, 22:0, 22:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 and lower (P<0.05) proportions of 20:0, 18:1t16+c14, and branched chain FA (iso-15:0, anteiso-15:0, iso-16:0 and anteiso-17:0) than the CG group. Delta-9 desaturase activity indices were consistently greater (P<0.05) in DG, when compared to the CG group. Regarding microarray analysis, differentially expressed genes between CG and DG bulls were grouped in 5 main biological functions: lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms, small molecule biochemistry, molecular transport and translational modification. Discontinuous growth down-regulated the expression of ACACB (FC (fold-change) = 1.32), FABP3 (FC = 1.45), HADHA (FC = 1.41) and SLC37A4 (FC = 1.40) genes, when compared to the CG system (FDR<0.05). In contrast, in the CG bulls, the expression of ELOVL5 (FC = 1.58) and FASN (FC = 1.71) was down-regulated when compared to DG bulls. These results were confirmed to be significant (P<0.05) in the case of ELOVL5, FASN and SLC37A4, and almost significant for FABP3 by qRT-PCR analysis. The SCD1 and SCD5 gene expressions were not found to be affected by growth path. These results contribute to the still scarce knowledge about the mechanisms involved in fatty acid metabolism during compensatory growth which have decisive role on meat quality produced in Mediterranean areas."
https://openalex.org/W2795915045,"Sick neonates in malaria endemic areas are frequently transfused with donor blood unscreened for malaria parasite. Consequently, they are at risk of transfusional malaria which can lead to increased neonatal mortality. The study aimed to determine the burden of transfusional malaria in neonates to help in policy formulation on prevention of transfusional malaria.One hundred and sixty four neonates admitted into the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital over a 10 month period who were scheduled for blood transfusion were screened for malaria parasites pre-transfusion, at three and 14 days post transfusion using Giemsa stained thick and thin films. Donor blood was screened for malaria parasites at the point of transfusion. Neonates who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion were followed up for signs of malaria.All recruited neonates tested negative to malaria parasite pre- transfusion. One hundred and twenty (73.2%) were term neonates with 94(57.3%) aged 1-7days. Four (2.4%) neonates developed malaria parasitaemia three days post transfusion and all four developed fever that resolved on treatment for malaria. Three (1.8%) of 164 donor blood samples had malaria parasitaemia and all three (100%) neonates who were transfused with the infected donor blood developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion. However, one neonate who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion was transfused with non-infected donor blood.The prevalence of transfusional malaria in this study is low (2.4%). However, 100% of neonates who received malaria infected donor blood developed transfusional malaria. We therefore recommend routine screening of donor pre-transfusion, testing of neonates who develop fever post transfusion and treatment of those who test positive to malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2796452850,"In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three C. raciborskii strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink C. raciborskii in a test tube experiment and (2) impair C. raciborskii growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all C. raciborskii strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases C. raciborskii blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom. A higher dose of LMB is needed to obtain a more efficient control of C. raciborskii blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2795595091,"Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs in vitro. Thus, we investigated the in vivo effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250-280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test. Following one week of habituation to the vivarium, rats were bilaterally implanted under deep anesthesia with cannulas aimed at the CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1 coordinates in mm from Bregma: AP -3.14; lateral +/-2; DV -3.0). Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min). The effects of these infusions and the effects of PKD1 knockdown were examined in MWM or NOD test.DHPG infusion increased the latency to reach the platform in the MWM test and reduced the preference for the novel object in the NOD task. We found that the DHPG effects were dose-dependent and could be maintained for up to 2 days. Notably, these effects could be prevented by pre-infusion of the group1 mGluR antagonist MPEP, the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673, or by PKD1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 area.Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence that PKD1-mediated signaling may play a critical role in the induction of learning and memory impairments by DHPG infusion into the hippocampal CA1 area."
https://openalex.org/W2795660062,"Kisspeptins acting on their cognate G protein-coupled receptor, kisspeptin receptor, play important roles in the suppression of cancer cell metastasis and regulation of the reproductive system, and therefore are important for therapeutic intervention. All native functional human kisspeptins (kisspeptin-54, kisspsptin-14 and kisspeptin-13) share the 10 amino acids of kisspeptin-10 at their C-terminus (45-54). However, they are inactivated rapidly by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through the cleavage of the peptide bond between glycine51 and leucine52, which limits their clinical applications. Development of MMP-resistant analogues of kisspeptins may provide better therapeutic outputs. In the present study, two kisspeptin phosphinic peptides were designed and synthesized, and their ability to induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through kisspeptin receptor and their inhibition on MMP-2 and MMP-9 whose activity correlates with cancer metastasis were assessed. The results showed that one analogue, phosphinic kisspeptin R isomer (PKPR), exhibited kisspeptin receptor-agonistic activity and also inhibitory activity on MMP-2, indicating that PKPR may serve as a lead for the further development of kisspeptin analogues for therapeutic purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2796199434,"90Sr, which was released into the atmosphere and the ocean following the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disasters, is an important nuclear fission element. Compounds that inhibit the absorption of 90Sr into the bloodstream and enhance its elimination can be beneficial in decreasing the absorbed radiation dose in people exposed to 90Sr. Recently, we prepared complexes of myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate (InsP6) with zinc or lanthanum as decorporation agents. These complexes, called Zn-InsP6 and La-InsP6 respectively, are insoluble in water and can potentially chelate additional metal cations. Hypothesizing that these complexes can assist the excretion of 90Sr from the body, we evaluated them using 85Sr instead of 90Sr. In in vitro binding experiments, Zn-InsP6 showed higher strontium adsorption capacity than La-InsP6. We then performed in vivo biodistribution experiments of Zn-InsP6 in mice after oral administration of 85SrCl2. Mice treated with Zn-InsP6 showed significantly lower bone accumulation of radioactivity than mice in a non-treatment control group. Zn-InsP6 adsorbed radiostrontium in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibited this ion's absorption into the bloodstream, and enhanced its excretion in the feces. Therefore, Zn-InsP6 appears to be a promising 90Sr ""decorporation"" agent."
https://openalex.org/W2796047454,"Hydrogen isotope analysis of feather keratin (δ2HF) has become an essential tool for tracking movements between breeding and wintering populations of migratory birds. In particular, δ2HF has been used to create δ2HF isoscapes that can be used to assign the geographic origins of molt. The majority of past studies have sampled a portion of a single feather as an isotopic proxy for the entire plumage although surprisingly little is known about variation of stable isotopes within and between feather tracts of individuals in local populations. Here we examine δ2HF variation in 24 pterylographic variables (9 primaries, 6 secondaries, 6 rectrices, and 3 patches of ventral contour feathers) in individual specimens of black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) breeding in the Big Santeetlah Creek watershed (5350 ha), southern Appalachian Mountains. By restricting our study to territorial ASY males (after second year) inhabiting a small watershed, we could focus on δ2HF variation generated during the complete prebasic annual molt in a circumscribed population while factoring out age and sexual differences in foraging behavior, isotopic incorporation, and post-breeding dispersal. Summed within-individual variation (δ2HF) across 24 pterylographic variables ranged from 12 to 60‰ (= 21.8 ± 9.4‰), with 81% of the individuals exhibiting variation ≥ 16‰ (reproducibility of analyses was ≤ 4 ‰). Adjacent feathers in feather tracts tend to have more similar δ2HF values than feathers grown weeks apart, consistent with the stepwise replacement of flight feathers. The pooled population sample exhibited significant δ2HF variation in primaries (-78 to -21‰), secondaries (-80 to -17‰), rectrices (-78 to -23‰), and ventral contour feathers (-92 to -32‰). Strong year effects in δ2HF variation were observed in each of the 24 pterylographic variables. Altitudinal effects were observed only in ventral contour feathers. The current findings demonstrate that within-individual variation (δ2HF) may be much greater than previously thought in migratory species that molt on or near breeding territories. Our study also highlights the need for greater pterylographic precision in research design of isotope-based studies of avian movement. Within-individual and within-population δ2HF variation should be incorporated in geographic assignment models. In a broader context, the staggered Staffelmauser pattern of molt in wood warblers provides an exceptional view of the seasonal variation of hydrogen isotopes circulating in blood plasma during the six-week period of annual molt."
