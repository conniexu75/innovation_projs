The Malaysian government has planned to procure COVID-19 vaccine through multiple agencies and companies in order to vaccinate at least 70% of the population. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, acceptance and perception of Malaysian adults regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.An online survey was conducted for two weeks in December 2020. A bilingual, semi-structured questionnaire was set up using Google Forms and the generated link was shared on social media (i.e., Facebook and WhatsApp). The questionnaire consisted of questions on knowledge, acceptance and perception of COVID-19 vaccine. The association between demographic factors with scores on knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for two categorical variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test used for more than two categorical variables.A total of 1406 respondents participated, with the mean age of 37.07 years (SD = 16.05) years, and among them 926 (65.9%) were female. Sixty two percent of respondents had poor knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (mean knowledge score 4.65; SD = 2.32) and 64.5% were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. High knowledge scores associated with higher education background, higher-income category and living with who is at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19. They were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were in a lower age group, have higher education levels and were female.Even though knowledge about vaccine COVID-19 is inadequate, the majority of the respondents were willing to get vaccinated. This finding can help the Ministry of Health plan for future efforts to increase vaccine uptake that may eventually lead to herd immunity against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3192433980,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of healthcare services worldwide, especially in underdeveloped countries. There is a clear need to develop novel computer-assisted diagnosis tools to provide rapid and cost-effective screening in places where massive traditional testing is not feasible. Lung ultrasound is a portable, easy to disinfect, low cost and non-invasive tool that can be used to identify lung diseases. Computer-assisted analysis of lung ultrasound imagery is a relatively recent approach that has shown great potential for diagnosing pulmonary conditions, being a viable alternative for screening and diagnosing COVID-19. Objective To evaluate and compare the performance of deep-learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 infections from lung ultrasound imagery. Methods We adapted different pre-trained deep learning architectures, including VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet50. We used the publicly available POCUS dataset comprising 3326 lung ultrasound frames of healthy, COVID-19, and pneumonia patients for training and fine-tuning. We conducted two experiments considering three classes (COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy) and two classes (COVID-19 versus pneumonia and COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19) of predictive models. The obtained results were also compared with the POCOVID-net model. For performance evaluation, we calculated per-class classification metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) and overall metrics (Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). Lastly, we performed a statistical analysis of performance results using ANOVA and Friedman tests followed by post-hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with the Holmâ€™s step-down correction. Results InceptionV3 network achieved the best average accuracy (89.1%), balanced accuracy (89.3%), and area under the receiver operating curve (97.1%) for COVID-19 detection from bacterial pneumonia and healthy lung ultrasound data. The ANOVA and Friedman tests found statistically significant performance differences between models for accuracy, balanced accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve. Post-hoc analysis showed statistically significant differences between the performance obtained with the InceptionV3-based model and POCOVID-net, VGG19-, and ResNet50-based models. No statistically significant differences were found in the performance obtained with InceptionV3- and Xception-based models. Conclusions Deep learning techniques for computer-assisted analysis of lung ultrasound imagery provide a promising avenue for COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. Particularly, we found that the InceptionV3 network provides the most promising predictive results from all AI-based techniques evaluated in this work. InceptionV3- and Xception-based models can be used to further develop a viable computer-assisted screening tool for COVID-19 based on ultrasound imagery."
https://openalex.org/W3187198111,"Introduction On February 26 th 2020, a high alert was issued in Sweden in response to the diagnosis of the first few coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the country. Subsequently, a decreased supply of essential goods, including medical products, was anticipated. We aimed to explore the weekly patterns of prescription dispensing and over-the-counter (OTC) medication sales in Sweden in 2020 compared with previous years, to assess the influence of the government restrictions on medication sales, and to assess whether there is evidence of medication stockpiling in the population. Methods Aggregated data on the weekly volume of defined daily doses (DDDs) of prescription medication dispensed and OTC sales from 2015 to 2020 were examined. From 2015â€“2019 data, the predicted weekly volume of DDDs for 2020 was estimated and compared to the observed volume for each ATC anatomical main group and therapeutic subgroup. Results From mid-February to mid-March 2020, there were increases in the weekly volumes of dispensed medication, peaking in the second week of March with a 46% increase in the observed versus predicted number of DDDs dispensed (16,440 vs 11,260 DDDs per 1000 inhabitants). A similar pattern was found in all age groups, in both sexes, and across metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions. In the same week in March, there was a 96% increase in the volume of OTC sold (2,504 vs 1,277 DDDs per 1000 inhabitants), specifically in ATC therapeutic subgroups including vitamins, antipyretics, painkillers, and nasal, throat, cough and cold preparations. Conclusion Beginning in mid-February 2020, there were significant changes in the volume of prescription medication dispensed and OTC drugs sold. The weekly volume of DDDs quickly decreased following recommendations from public authorities. Overall, our findings suggest stockpiling behavior over a surge in new users of medication."
https://openalex.org/W3193156613,"Soybean [ Glycine max (L . ) Merr .] is a crop of great interest worldwide. Exploring molecular approaches to increase yield genetic gain has been one of the main challenges for soybean breeders and geneticists. Agronomic traits such as maturity, plant height, and seed weight have been found to contribute to yield. In this study, a total of 250 soybean accessions were genotyped with 10,259 high-quality SNPs postulated from genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and evaluated for grain yield, maturity, plant height, and seed weight over three years. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a Bayesian Information and Linkage Disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK) model. Genomic selection (GS) was evaluated using a ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP) model. The results revealed that 20, 31, 37, and 23 SNPs were significantly associated with maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield, respectively; Many SNPs were mapped to previously described maturity and plant height loci ( E2 , E4 , and Dt1 ) and a new plant height locus was mapped to chromosome 20. Candidate genes were found in the vicinity of the two SNPs with the highest significant levels associated with yield, maturity, plant height, seed weight, respectively. A 11.5-Mb region of chromosome 10 was associated with both yield and seed weight. Overall, the accuracy of GS was dependent on the trait, year, and population structure, and high accuracy indicates that these agronomic traits can be selected in molecular breeding through GS. The SNP markers identified in this study can be used to improve yield and agronomic traits through the marker-assisted selection and GS in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3190211536,"Keel bone fractures (KBF) in commercial poultry production systems are a major welfare problem with possible economic consequences for the poultry industry. Recent investigations suggest that the overall situation may be worsening. Depending on the housing system, fracture prevalences exceeding 80% have been reported from different countries. No specific causes have yet been identified and this has consequently hampered risk factor identification. The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of KBF in Danish layer hens and to identify risk factors in relation to KBF in all major productions systems, including parent stock production. For risk factor identification, production data from the included flocks was used. In total, 4794 birds from 40 flocks were investigated at end-of-lay. All birds were euthanized on farm and underwent inspection and palpation followed by necropsy. All observations were recorded and subsequently analysed using the SAS statistical software package. In flocks from non-caged systems, fracture prevalence in the range 53%-100%, was observed whereas the prevalence in flocks from enriched cages ranged between 50-98%. Furthermore, often multiple fractures (â‰¥4) were observed in individual birds (range 5-81% of the birds with fractures) depending on the flock. The localization of the fractures at the distal end of the keel bone is highly consistent in all flocks (>96%). Macroscopically the fractures varied morphologically from an appearance with an almost total absence of callus, most frequently observed in caged birds, to large callus formations in and around the fracture lines, which was a typical finding in non-caged birds. Despite being housed under cage-free conditions, parent birds had significantly fewer fractures (all flocks were 60 weeks old) per bird, than other birds from cage-free systems. The body weight at end-of-lay had an effect on the risk of having fractures, heavy hens have significantly fewer fractures at end-of-lay. The older the hens were at onset of lay, the lower was the flock prevalence at end-of-lay. Additionally, the daily egg size at onset of lay was of importance for the risk of developing fractures, the production of heavier eggs initially, resulted in higher fracture prevalence at depopulation. The odds ratio of body weight, (+100 g) was 0.97, age at onset of lay (+1 week) was 0.87 and daily egg weight at onset (+1 gram) was 1.03. In conclusion, the study demonstrated a very high prevalence of KBF in hens from all production systems and identified hen size, age at onset of lay and daily egg weight at onset of lay to be major risk factors for development of KBF in the modern laying hen. Further research regarding this is warranted to strengthen the longevity and enhance the welfare of laying hens."
https://openalex.org/W3190464732,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve cognitive function. However, it is not clear how high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) regulates the cognitive function and its neural mechanism, especially in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to examine whether HD-tDCS can modulate cognitive function in individuals with MCI and to determine whether the potential variety is related to spontaneous brain activity changes recorded by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Forty-three individuals with MCI were randomly assigned to receive either 10 HD-tDCS sessions or 10 sham sessions to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and the regional homogeneity (ReHo) was computed using rs-fMRI data from all participants. The results showed that the fALFF and ReHo values changed in multiple areas following HD-tDCS. Brain regions with significant decreases in fALFF values include the Insula R, Precuneus R, Thalamus L, and Parietal Sup R, while the Temporal Inf R, Fusiform L, Occipital Sup L, Calcarine R, and Angular R showed significantly increased in their fALFF values. The brain regions with significant increases in ReHo values include the Temporal Inf R, Putamen L, Frontal Mid L, Precentral R, Frontal Sup Medial L, Frontal Sup R, and Precentral L. We found that HD-tDCS can alter the intensity and synchrony of brain activity, and our results indicate that fALFF and ReHo analysis are sensitive indicators for the detection of HD-tDCS during spontaneous brain activity. Interestingly, HD-tDCS increases the ReHo values of multiple brain regions, which may be related to the underlying mechanism of its clinical effects, these may also be related to a potential compensation mechanism involving the mobilization of more regions to complete a function following a functional decline."
https://openalex.org/W3188765265,"A potential pesticide degrading bacterial isolate (2D), showing maximum tolerance (450 mgâˆ™L -1 ) for cypermethrin, fipronil, imidacloprid and sulfosulfuron was recovered from a pesticide contaminated agricultural field. The isolate degraded cypermethrin, imidacloprid, fipronil and sulfosulfuron in minimal salt medium with 94, 91, 89 and 86% respectively as revealed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) analysis after 15 days of incubation. Presence of cyclobutane, pyrrolidine, chloroacetic acid, formic acid and decyl ester as major intermediate metabolites of cypermethrin biodegradation was observed in gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results based on 16S rDNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis showed maximum similarity of 2D with Bacillus cereus (Accession ID: MH341691). Stress responsive and catabolic/pesticide degrading proteins were over expressed in the presence of cypermethrin in bacteria. Enzymatic kinetics of laccase was deduced in the test isolate under normal and pesticide stress conditions which suggested that the production of enzyme was induced significantly in pesticide stress (163 Î¼g.Î¼L -1 ) as compare to normal conditions(29 Î¼g.Î¼L -1 ) while the K m value was decreased in pesticides stress condition ( K m = 10.57 mM) and increases in normal condition ( K m = 14.33 mM).Amplification of laccase gene showed a major band of 1200bp. The present study highlights on the potential of 2D bacterial strain i.e., high tolerance level of pesticide, effective biodegradation rate, and presence of laccase gene in bacterial strain 2D, could become a potential biological agent for large-scale treatment of mixture of pesticide (cypermethrin, fipronil, imidacloprid and sulfosulfuron) in natural environment (soil and water)."
https://openalex.org/W3187659967,"Background Separating ill or possibly infectious people from their healthy community is one of the core principles of non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, there is scarce evidence on how to successfully implement quarantine orders. We investigated a community quarantine for an entire village in Germany (Neustadt am Rennsteig, March 2020) with the aim of better understanding the successful implementation of quarantine measures. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Neustadt am Rennsteig six weeks after the end of a 14-day mandatory community quarantine. The sample size consisted of 562 adults (64% of the community), and the response rate was 295 adults, or 52% (33% of the community). Findings National television was reported as the most important channel of information. Contact with local authorities was very limited, and partners or spouses played a more important role in sharing information. Generally, the self-reported information level was judged to be good (211/289 [73.0%]). The majority of participants (212/289 [73.4%]) approved of the quarantine, and the reported compliance was 217/289 (75.1%). A self-reported higher level of concern as well as a higher level of information correlated positively with both a greater acceptance of quarantine and self-reported compliant behaviour. Interpretation The community quarantine presented a rare opportunity to investigate a public health intervention for an entire community. In order to improve the implementation of public health interventions, public health risk communication activities should be intensified to increase both the information level (potentially leading to better compliance with community quarantine) and the communication level (to facilitate rapport and trust between public health authorities and their communities)."
https://openalex.org/W3192499525,"Introduction The growing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great threat to millions of people worldwide. Nurses and nursing students are an important group of health professionals who are most likely to face many challenges in this unprecedented scenario. The present study aimed at exploring nursesâ€™ and nursing studentsâ€™ perception of psychological preparedness for the pandemic (COVID-19) management. Materials &amp; methods The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing studentsâ€™ group of India. The survey link including the questionnaires was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)â€“Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results The mean age of the subjects was 31.72Â±9.58 years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44Â±10.82, 33.19Â±5.23, 16.79Â±2.73 and 9.61Â±2.26 respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness. Conclusion The findings suggested that self-efficacy, optimism and resilience can be considered as predictors for psychological preparedness in pandemic management. Appropriate training could influence self-efficacy while programs addressing resilience and coping may strengthen psychological preparedness which can help in further management of ongoing pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3188020503,"Phytate is a dominant form of organic phosphorus (P) in the environment. Complexation and precipitation with polyvalent metal ions can stabilize phytate, thereby significantly hinder the hydrolysis by enzymes. Here, we studied the stability and hydrolyzability of environmentally relevant metal phytate complexes (Na, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Al, Fe, Al/Fe, Mn, and Cd) under different pHs, presence of metal chelators, and thermal conditions. Our results show that the order of solubility of metal phytate complexes is as follows: i) for metal species: Na, Ca, Mg &gt; Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd &gt; Al, Fe, ii) under different pHs: pH 5.0 &gt; pH 7.5), and iii) in the presence of chelators: EDTA&gt; citric acid. Phytate-metal complexes are mostly resistant towards acid hydrolysis (except Al-phytate), and dry complexes are generally stable at high pressure and temperature under autoclave conditions (except Ca phytate). Inhibition of metal complex towards enzymatic hydrolysis by Aspergillus niger phytase was variable but found to be highest in Fe phytate complex. Strong chelating agents such as EDTA are insufficient for releasing metals from the complexes unless the reduction of metals (such as Fe) occurs first. The insights gained from this research are expected to contribute to the current understanding of the fate of phytate in the presence of various metals that are commonly present in agricultural soils."
https://openalex.org/W3188382880,"Background Asian-Americans are one of the most understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. To increase representation of Asian subgroups, researchers have traditionally relied on data collection at community venues and events. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has created serious challenges for in-person data collection. In this case study, we describe multi-modal strategies for online recruitment of U.S. Vietnamese parents, compare response rates and participant characteristics among strategies, and discuss lessons learned. Methods We recruited 408 participants from community-based organizations (CBOs) (n = 68), Facebook groups (n = 97), listservs (n = 4), personal network (n = 42), and snowball sampling (n = 197). Using chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance, we compared participants recruited through different strategies regarding sociodemographic characteristics, acculturation-related characteristics, and mobile health usage. Results The overall response rate was 71.8% (range: 51.5% for Vietnamese CBOs to 86.6% for Facebook groups). Significant differences exist for all sociodemographic and almost all acculturation-related characteristics among recruitment strategies. Notably, CBO-recruited participants were the oldest, had lived in the U.S. for the longest duration, and had the lowest Vietnamese language ability. We found some similarities between Facebook-recruited participants and those referred by Facebook-recruited participants. Mobile health usage was high and did not vary based on recruitment strategies. Challenges included encountering fraudulent responses (e.g., non-Vietnamese). Perceived benefits and trust appeared to facilitate recruitment. Conclusions Facebook and snowball sampling may be feasible strategies to recruit U.S. Vietnamese. Findings suggest the potential for mobile-based research implementation. Perceived benefits and trust could encourage participation and may be related to cultural ties. Attention should be paid to recruitment with CBOs and handling fraudulent responses."
https://openalex.org/W3191048537,"Traffic safety problems are still very serious and human factor is the one of most important factors affecting traffic crashes. Taking Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data as the research object, this study defines six control indicators and uses principal component analysis and K-means++ clustering methods to get the driving style of different drivers. Then use the Bayesian Networks Toolbox (BNT) and MCMC algorithm to realize the structure learning of Bayesian network. and parameter learning was completed through Netica software. Finally, the vehicle-based traffic crash risk model was created to conduct sensitivity analysis, posterior probability inference, and simulation data was used to detect the feasibility of the model. The results show that the Bayesian network modeling can not only express the relationship between the crash risk and various driving behaviors, but also dig out the inherent relationship between different influencing factors and investigate the causes of driving risks. The results will be beneficial to accurately identify and prevent risky driving behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3187831271,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has a direct role as a mediator in the pathogenesis of various disorders with an inflammatory component, including those with allergic aetiology. The peripheral blood concentration of PAF is dynamically regulated by plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). Previous research suggest that low activity of plasma PAF-AH could be a predictive marker for increased severity of some types of allergic hypersensitivity reactions-especially anaphylaxis. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association between plasma PAF-AH activity and severity in patients with anaphylactic reactions following a wasp or bee sting.The study group of 89 patients was divided into two subgroups depending on the increasing severity of the most severe anaphylactic reaction in the past, which was assessed according to the MÃ¼ller's scale. The first subgroup included participants with a history of hypersensitivity reactions up to grade II. The second subgroup consisted of patients who have experienced at least one grade III or IV reactions in the past. A control group of 20 people was established. Plasma PAF-AH activity was measured using a colorimetric method.It has been observed that plasma activity of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was significantly lower in patients with anaphylaxis history compared to the control group with negative atopic history (on average 21.38 nmol/min/ml for the control group, 9.47 nmol/min/ml for the first subgroup and 10.16 nmol/min/ml for the second subgroup, in both cases p < 0.0001).The plasma activity of PAF-AH is a promising parameter that can help to distinguish a group of patients not threatened with development of anaphylaxis and not requiring laborious or expensive prophylactic procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3193058099,"In this work two types of biodegradable polysuccinimide-based, electrospun fibrous membranes are presented. One contains disulfide bonds exhibiting a shorter (3 days) in vivo biodegradation time, while the other one has alkyl crosslinks and a longer biodegradation time (more than 7 days). According to the mechanical measurements, the tensile strength of the membranes is comparable to those of soft the connective tissues and visceral tissues. Furthermore, the suture retention test suggests, that the membranes would withstand surgical handling and in vivo fixation. The in vivo biocompatibility study demonstrates how membranes undergo in vivo hydrolysis and by the 3 rd day they become poly(aspartic acid) fibrous membranes, which can be then enzymatically degraded. After one week, the disulfide crosslinked membranes almost completely degrade, while the alkyl-chain crosslinked ones mildly lose their integrity as the surrounding tissue invades them. Histopathology revealed mild acute inflammation, which diminished to a minimal level after seven days."
https://openalex.org/W3187080577,"Aims The aim of this study was to compare discrepancies between diagnosed and autopsied causes of death in 1,112 hospital autopsies and to determine the factors causing this discrepancies. Methods 1,112 hospital autopsies between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively studied. Ante-mortem diagnoses were compared to causes of death as determined by autopsy. Clinical diagnoses were extracted from the autopsy request form, and post-mortem diagnoses were assessed from respective autopsy reports. Variables, such as sex, age, Body Mass Index, category of disease, duration of hospital stay and new-borns were studied in comparison to discrepancy. P-values were derived from the Mann-Whitney U test for the constant features and chi-2 test, p-values &lt; 0,05 were considered significant. Results 73.9% (n = 822) patients showed no discrepancy between autopsy and clinical diagnosis. The duration of hospitalisation (6 vs. 9 days) and diseases of the cardiovascular system (61.7%) had a significant impact on discrepancies. Conclusion Age, cardiovascular diseases and duration of hospital stay significantly affect discrepancies in ante- and post-mortem diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W3192170282,"Extracellular vesicles secreted from IFNÎ³-stimulated rat dendritic cells (referred to here as IFNÎ³-DC-EVs) contain miRNAs which promote myelination (including but not limited to miR-219), and preferentially enter oligodendrocytes in brain slice cultures. IFNÎ³-DC-EVs also increase myelination when nasally administered to naÃ¯ve rats. While we can infer that these extracellular vesicles enter the CNS from functional studies, here we demonstrate biodistribution throughout the brain after nasal delivery by way of imaging studies. After nasal administration, Xenolight DiR-labelled IFNÎ³-DC-EVs were detected 30 minutes later throughout the brain and the cervical spinal cord. We next examined cellular uptake of IFNÎ³-DC-EVs by transfecting IFNÎ³-DC-EVs with mCherry mRNA prior to nasal administration. mCherry-positive cells were found along the rostrocaudal axis of the brain to the brainstem. These cells morphologically resembled oligodendrocytes, and indeed cell-specific co-staining for neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes showed that mcherry positive cells were predominantly oligodendrocytes. This is in keeping with our prior in vitro results showing that IFNÎ³-DC-EVs are preferentially taken up by oligodendrocytes, and to a lesser extent, microglia. To confirm that IFNÎ³-DC-EVs delivered cargo to oligodendrocytes, we quantified protein levels of miR-219 mRNA targets expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and found significantly reduced expression. Finally, we compared intranasal versus intravenous delivery of Xenolight DiR-labelled IFNÎ³-DC-EVs. Though labelled IFNÎ³-DC-EVs entered the CNS via both routes, we found that nasal delivery more specifically targeted the CNS with less accumulation in the liver. Taken together, these data show that intranasal administration is an effective route for delivery of IFNÎ³-DC-EVs to the CNS, and provides additional support for their development as an EV-based neurotherapeutic that, for the first time, targets oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3192397436,"Dugongs ( Dugong dugon ) are seagrass specialists distributed in shallow coastal waters in tropical and subtropical seas. The area and distribution of the dugongsâ€™ feeding trails, which are unvegetated winding tracks left after feeding, have been used as an indicator of their feeding ground utilization. However, current ground-based measurements of these trails require a large amount of time and effort. Here, we developed effective methods to observe the dugongsâ€™ feeding trails using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images (1) by extracting the dugong feeding trails using deep neural networks. Furthermore, we demonstrated two applications as follows; (2) extraction of the daily new feeding trails with deep neural networks and (3) estimation the direction of the feeding trails. We obtained aerial photographs from the intertidal seagrass bed at Talibong Island, Trang Province, Thailand. The F1 scores, which are a measure of binary classification modelâ€™s accuracy taking false positives and false negatives into account, for the method (1) were 89.5% and 87.7% for the images with ground sampling resolutions of 1 cm/pixel and 0.5 cm/pixel, respectively, while the F1 score for the method (2) was 61.9%. The F1 score for the method (1) was high enough to perform scientific studies on the dugong. However, the method (2) should be improved, and there remains a need for manual correction. The mean area of the extracted daily new feeding trails from September 12â€“27, 2019, was 187.8 m 2 per day (n = 9). Total 63.9% of the feeding trails was estimated to have direction within a range of 112.5Â° and 157.5Â°. These proposed new methods will reduce the time and efforts required for future feeding trail observations and contribute to future assessments of the dugongsâ€™ seagrass habitat use."
https://openalex.org/W3187484402,"Since the first complete set of Platyhelminth nuclear receptors (NRs) from Schistosoma mansoni were identified a decade ago, more flatworm genome data is available to identify their NR complement and to analyze the evolutionary relationship of Platyhelminth NRs. NRs are important transcriptional modulators that regulate development, differentiation and reproduction of animals. In this study, NRs are identified in genome databases of thirty-three species including in all Platyhelminth classes (Rhabditophora, Monogenea, Cestoda and Trematoda). Phylogenetic analysis shows that NRs in Platyhelminths follow two different evolutionary lineages: 1) NRs in a free-living freshwater flatworm ( Schmidtea mediterranea ) and all parasitic flatworms share the same evolutionary lineage with extensive gene loss. 2) NRs in a free-living intertidal zone flatworm ( Macrostomum lignano ) follow a different evolutionary lineage with a feature of multiple gene duplication and gene divergence. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is the most conserved region in NRs which contains two C4-type zinc finger motifs. A novel zinc finger motif is identified in parasitic flatworm NRs: the second zinc finger of parasitic Platyhelminth HR96b possesses a CHC2 motif which is not found in NRs of all other animals studied to date. In this study, novel NRs (members of NR subfamily 3 and 6) are identified in flatworms, this result demonstrates that members of all six classical NR subfamilies are present in the Platyhelminth phylum. NR gene duplication, loss and divergence in Platyhelminths are analyzed along with the evolutionary relationship of Platyhelminth NRs."
https://openalex.org/W3188062322,"In the last decade, survival of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has dramatically increased due wide availability of effective antiretroviral therapy. However, PLHIV remain at a comparatively higher risk of non-communicable comorbidities. We sought to determine the burden of COPD and its associations in an urban tertiary HIV clinic in Uganda.HIV-infected adults attending the Makerere University Joint AIDS program; aged â‰¥30 years without acute ailments were screened for COPD using study questionnaires and spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<0.7). We determined its prevalence and association with demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI) and known risk factors. Of 288 participants enrolled, 177 (61%) were female; 253 (88%) were from urban residences, median age was 45 years (IQR: 39-51), 71(25%) were 'ever' smokers, 284(99%) reported biomass fuel use and 72(25%) had a history of tuberculosis. All except 1 participant were on antiretroviral therapy, median current CD4 (cells/mm3) was 558 (IQR 402-753) and 275(96%) were virologically suppressed. Nearly half (130/288, 45%) had recurrent respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of COPD was 3.1% (9/288) [95% CI: 1.63-5.92]. COPD was associated with: previous tuberculosis, (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 6.36, [95% CI 1.64-35.84], P = 0.036), self-reported chronic shortness of breath (AOR: 9.06, [95% CI 1.34-61.10], P = 0.024) and a BMI <21 Kg/m2 (AOR: 10.42 [95% CI: 1.61-100.00], P = 0.013).In this HIV population, COPD prevalence was low and was associated with previous tuberculosis, self-reported chronic shortness of breath and BMI <21 Kg/m2."
https://openalex.org/W3189925621,"Child hospitalization for pneumonia remains common, and pneumonia is a major cause of child mortality. Early identification of clinical factors associated with serious outcomes may help target risk-mitigation strategies.Pneumonia cases occurring in the Drakenstein Child Health Study, a prospective birth cohort outside Cape Town, South Africa were analysed, and factors associated with serious outcomes of pneumonia were identified. Pregnant women were enrolled antenatally, followed through pregnancy, and mother-child pairs from birth to 2 years. Active surveillance for pneumonia was done. Children hospitalized with pneumonia had chest radiography and blood drawn for inflammatory markers; course, outcome and duration of hospitalization were investigated. Serious outcomes were defined as in-hospital mortality or admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Prolonged hospitalization was also explored as a proxy for severity. Features associated with serious outcomes or prolonged hospitalization were analysed using modified Poisson regression.Among 1143 live born infants, there were 174 hospitalized pneumonia events in 133 children under 2 years. Three children (1.7%) died, 14 (8%) required ICU admission for respiratory support. In modified Poisson regression, age < 2 months, preterm birth, or hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92%) were significantly associated with serious outcomes. Preterm birth, low birth weight, HIV exposure, stunting, or underweight-for-age (UWFA) were associated with prolonged hospitalization. Chest radiography, elevated C reactive protein, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were not useful to predict death or ICU admission in children hospitalized with pneumonia.In this cohort, death from pneumonia was rare, but clinical features associated with serious outcomes and prolonged hospitalization were identified. These may help with risk stratification, to identify children who may benefit from enhanced monitoring or earlier escalation to respiratory support."
https://openalex.org/W3191922604,"In geriatric research of non-fatal events, participants often die during the study follow-up without having the non-fatal event of interest. Cause-specific (CS) hazard regression and Fine-Gray (FG) subdistribution hazard regression are the two most common estimation approaches addressing such competing risk. We explain how the conventional CS approach and the FG approach differ and why many FG estimates of associations are counter-intuitive. Additionally, we clarify the indirect link between models for hazard and models for cumulative incidence. The methodologies are contrasted on data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based study in adults aged 65 years and older."
https://openalex.org/W3192149447,"The bandgap of two-dimensional (2D) materials plays an important role in their applications to various devices. For instance, the gapless nature of graphene limits the use of this material to semiconductor device applications, whereas the indirect bandgap of molybdenum disulfide is suitable for electrical and photo-device applications. Therefore, predicting the bandgap rapidly and accurately for a given 2D material structure has great scientific significance in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Compared to the extremely high computation cost of conventional first-principles calculations, machine learning (ML) based on statistics may be a promising alternative to predicting bandgaps. Although ML algorithms have been used to predict the properties of materials, they have rarely been used to predict the properties of 2D materials. In this study, we apply four ML algorithms to predict the bandgaps of 2D materials based on the computational 2D materials database (C2DB). Gradient boosted decision trees and random forests are more effective in predicting bandgaps of 2D materials with an R2 >90% and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ~0.24 eV and 0.27 eV, respectively. By contrast, support vector regression and multi-layer perceptron show that R2 is >70% with RMSE of ~0.41 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively. Finally, when the bandgap calculated without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is used as a feature, the RMSEs of the four ML models decrease greatly to 0.09 eV, 0.10 eV, 0.17 eV, and 0.12 eV, respectively. The R2 of all the models is >94%. These results show that the properties of 2D materials can be rapidly obtained by ML prediction with high precision."
https://openalex.org/W3192223204,"Humans deploy a number of specific behaviours for forming social bonds, one of which is laughter. However, two questions have not yet been investigated with respect to laughter: (1) Does laughter increase the sense of bonding to those with whom we laugh? and (2) Does laughter facilitate prosocial generosity? Using changes in pain threshold as a proxy for endorphin upregulation in the brain and a standard economic game (the Dictator Game) as an assay of prosociality, we show that laughter does trigger the endorphin system and, through that, seems to enhance social bonding, but it does not reliably influence donations to others. This suggests that social bonding and prosociality may operate via different mechanisms, or on different time scales, and relate to different functional objectives."
https://openalex.org/W3128640023,"The impacts of autonomous vehicles (AV) are widely anticipated to be socially, economically, and ethically significant. A reliable assessment of the harms and benefits of their large-scale deployment requires a multi-disciplinary approach. To that end, we employed Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to make such an assessment. We obtained opinions from 19 disciplinary experts to assess the significance of 13 potential harms and eight potential benefits that might arise under four deployments schemes. Specifically, we considered: (1) the status quo, i.e., no AVs are deployed; (2) unfettered assimilation, i.e., no regulatory control would be exercised and commercial entities would ""push"" the development and deployment; (3) regulated introduction, i.e., regulatory control would be applied and either private individuals or commercial fleet operators could own the AVs; and (4) fleets only, i.e., regulatory control would be applied and only commercial fleet operators could own the AVs. Our results suggest that two of these scenarios, (3) and (4), namely regulated privately-owned introduction or fleet ownership or autonomous vehicles would be less likely to cause harm than either the status quo or the unfettered options."
https://openalex.org/W3187584147,"Tuberculosis (TB) household contact tracing is a form of targeted active case-finding for which community health workers ('outreach teams') in South Africa are primarily responsible for its implementation. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to understand the role of outreach teams in delivering TB household contact tracing.The study took place in three districts of South Africa between May 2016 and February 2017. We conducted 78 in-depth interviews (IDI) (comprising 35 key stakeholders, 31 TB index patients and 12 HHCs) and five focus group discussions (FGD) (40 outreach team members in four FGDs and 12 community stakeholders in one FGD).Outreach teams contributed positively by working across health-related programmes, providing home-based care and assisting with tracing of persons lost to TB care. However, outreach teams had a limited focus on TB household contact tracing activities, likely due to the broad scope of their work and insufficient programmatic support. Outreach teams often confused TB household contact tracing activities with finding persons lost to TB care. The community also had some reservations on the role of outreach teams conducting TB household contact tracing activities.Creating awareness among outreach workers and clinic personnel about the importance of and activities related to TB household contact tracing would be required to strengthen the delivery of TB household contact tracing through the community-based primary health care teams. We need better monitoring and evaluation systems, stronger integration within a realistic scope of work, adequate training on TB household contact tracing and TB infection prevention control measures. Involving the community and educating them on the role of outreach teams could improve acceptance of future activities. These timely results and lessons learned should inform contact tracing approaches in the context of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3188437806,"Building rapport during police interviews is argued as important for improving on the completeness and accuracy of information provided by witnesses and victims. However, little experimental research has clearly operationalised rapport and investigated the impact of rapport behaviours on episodic memory. Eighty adults watched a video of a mock crime event and 24-hours later were randomly allocated to an interview condition where verbal and/or behavioural (non-verbal) rapport techniques were manipulated. Memorial performance measures revealed significantly more correct information, without a concomitant increase in errors, was elicited when behavioural rapport was present, a superiority effect found in both the free and probed recall phase of interviews. The presence of verbal rapport was found to reduce recall accuracy in the free recall phase of interviews. Post-interview feedback revealed significant multivariate effects for the presence of behavioural (only) rapport and combined (behavioural + verbal) rapport. Participants rated their interview experience far more positively when these types of rapport were present compared to when verbal (only) rapport or no rapport was present. These findings add weight to the importance of rapport in supporting eyewitness cognition, highlighting the potential consequences of impoverished social behaviours for building rapport during dyadic interactions, suggesting 'doing' rather than simply 'saying' may be more beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W3189786276,"Air pollution has a severe impact on human physical and mental health. When the air quality is poor enough to cause respiratory irritation, people tend to stay home and avoid any outdoor activities. In addition, air pollution may cause mental health problems (depression and anxiety) which were associated with high crime risk. Therefore, in this study, it is hypothesized that increasing air pollution level is associated with higher indoor crime rates, but negatively associated with outdoor crime rates because it restricts people's daily outdoor activities. Three types of crimes were used for this analysis: robbery (outdoor crime), domestic violence (indoor crime), and fraud (cybercrime). The results revealed that the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model performed best with lower AIC values. In general, in the higher population areas with more severe air pollution, local authorities should allocate more resources, extra police officers, or more training programs to help them prevent domestic violence, rather than focusing on robbery."
https://openalex.org/W3190437513,"Objective, reliable behavioral tests are needed to refine on-site welfare assessments of dogs housed at commercial breeding (CB) kennels and provide a basis to inform predictions of their behavior when retired from such kennels. This study tested the reliability, construct validity, and applicability of a protocol for the behavioral assessment of dogs from CB kennels that might be useful in comprehensive welfare assessments of this population. A sample of 447 dogs from 26 CB kennels in the Midwestern US were assessed in their pens. Responses to an approach test (performed on three consecutive days) and a behavioral reactivity test (e.g., traffic cone, toys, umbrella) were recorded. Results showed moderate to perfect (K w = 0.51â€“1.00) inter-rater reliability between three independent observers. Approach test-retest analysis showed high correlation of approach test scores on days 1, 2 and 3 (r = 0.85, p&lt;0.0001). Exploratory factor analysis extracted four main factors: Food Motivation (F1), Sociability (F2), Boldness (F3) (e.g., response to novel objects), and Responsiveness (F4) (e.g., response to an umbrella opening) confirming the ability of the test to measure behaviors of interest. All factors showed high internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s alpha 0.81â€“0.93) further supporting the robustness of the test construct. The demonstrated reliability of this protocol suggests that it may be usefully applied to assessing the behavior of dogs as a component of their welfare assessment in CB kennels. Doing so using even larger sample sizes may yield insights on the effects of housing and management practices on dog welfare while at the kennels, which may also help inform approaches that improve rehoming outcomes for retiring breeding dogs. Practical applications and limitations are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W3191729050,"Research on stress occupied a central position during the 20th century. As it became evident that stress responses affect a wide range of negative outcomes, various stress management techniques were developed in attempt to reduce the damages. However, the existing interventions are applied for a range of different stress responses, sometimes unsuccessfully.The aim of this study was to examine whether there are specific clusters of stress responses representing interpersonal variation. In other words, do people have dominant clusters reflecting the different aspects of the known stress responses (physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive)?The researchers derived a measure of stress responses based on previous scales and used it in two studies in order to examine the hypothesis that stress responses can be grouped into dominant patterns according to the type of response.The results of Study 1 revealed four distinctive response categories: psychological (emotional and cognitive), physiological gastro, physiological muscular, and behavioral. The results of Study 2 revealed five distinctive response categories: emotional, cognitive, physiological gastro, physiological muscular, and behavioral.By taking into consideration each person's stress response profile while planning stress management interventions and then offering them a tailored intervention that reduces the intensity of these responses, it might be possible to prevent further complications resulting in a disease (physical or mental)."
https://openalex.org/W3189208611,"Breast cancer is an important public health problem worldwide, with important disparities in incidence, mortality, and survival rates between developed and developing countries due to inequalities regarding access to measures for the prevention and treatment of the disease. In Brazil, there are higher rates of incidence and a downward trend in mortality in regions of greater socioeconomic development.To evaluate the effect of age, period, and birth cohort on breast cancer mortality in women aged 20 years and older in the states of the Northeast Region of Brazil, an area of high socioeconomic vulnerability, from 1980 to 2019.The death records were extracted from the DATASUS Mortality Information System website (Department of National Health Informatics) from the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Estimable functions were used to estimate the age-period and cohort models (APC) using the Epi library from the R statistical software version 6.4.1.The average breast cancer mortality rate for the period was 20.45 deaths per 100,000 women. The highest coefficients per 100,000 women were observed in the states of Pernambuco (21.09 deaths) and CearÃ¡ (20.85 deaths), and the lowest in MaranhÃ£o (13.58 deaths) and PiauÃ­ (15.43 deaths). In all of the locations, there was a progressive increase in mortality rates in individuals over 40 years of age, with higher rates in the last five-year period (2015-2019). There was an increase in the risk of death for the five-year period of the 2000s in relation to the reference period (1995-1999) in the Northeast region and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, MaranhÃ£o, ParaÃ­ba, and PiauÃ­. In addition, there was an increased risk of death for women born after the 1950s in all locations.The highest mortality rates in all five-year periods analyzed were observed in states with greater socioeconomic development, with an increase in mortality rates in the 2000s, and a higher risk of death in the younger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3190368485,"Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with abnormal liver function, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Cordycepin improves hepatic metabolic pathways leading to recovery from liver damage. We investigated the effects of cordycepin in streptozotocin-induced T1DM mice via the expression of liver proteins. Twenty-four mice were divided into four equal groups: normal (N), normal mice treated with cordycepin (N+COR), diabetic mice (DM), and diabetic mice treated with cordycepin (DM+COR). Mice in each treatment group were intraperitoneally injection of cordycepin at dose 24 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Body weight, blood glucose, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were measured. Liver tissue protein profiling was performed using shotgun proteomics, while protein function and protein-protein interaction were predicted using PANTHER and STITCH v.5.0 software, respectively. No significant difference was observed in fasting blood glucose levels between DM and DM+COR for all time intervals. However, a significant decrease in final body weight, food intake, and water intake in DM+COR was found. Hepatic oxaloacetate and citrate levels were significantly increased in DM+COR compared to DM. Furthermore, 11 and 36 proteins were only expressed by the N+COR and DM+COR groups, respectively. Three unique proteins in DM+COR, namely, Nfat3, Flcn, and Psma3 were correlated with the production of ATP, AMPK signaling pathway, and ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), respectively. Interestingly, a protein detected in N+COR and DM+COR (Gli3) was linked with the insulin signaling pathway. In conclusion, cordycepin might help in preventing hepatic metabolism by regulating the expression of energy-related protein and UPS to maintain cell survival. Further work on predicting the performance of metabolic mechanisms regarding the therapeutic applications of cordycepin will be performed in future."
https://openalex.org/W3190494818,"Preterm birth (PTB; <37 weeks gestation), is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity. Among those born preterm, risk increases as gestational age at birth decreases. Psychosocial factors such as depression symptoms and social determinants of health (SDH) may increase risk for PTB. Research is needed to understand these risk factors and identify effective interventions. This retrospective cohort study recruited English- and Spanish-speaking women presenting symptoms of preterm labor or admitted for PTB from an urban county hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area (n = 47). We used an iterative analytic approach by which qualitative data informed an exploratory quantitative analysis. Key exposures were presence of self-reported depression symptoms during pregnancy, SDH along eight domains, and receipt of behavioral health services. The outcome was gestational age at birth. T-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and linear regression models were used to test associations between the exposures and gestational age. Most participants were Black (25.5%) or Latina (59.6%). After adjusting for covariates, participants with depression symptoms had an average gestational age 3.1 weeks shorter (95% CI: -5.02, -1.20) than women reporting no symptoms. After adjusting for covariates, high number of adverse social determinants (â‰¥ 4) suggested an association with shorter gestational age (p = 0.07, 1.65 weeks, 95% CI: -3.44, 0.14). Receipt of behavioral health services was associated with a significantly later gestational age; the median difference was 5.5 weeks longer for depression symptoms, 3.5 weeks longer for high social determinants, and 6 weeks longer for depression symptoms and high social determinants. Among a cohort of high-risk pregnant women, both depression symptoms during pregnancy and co-occurring with exposure to high adverse SDH are associated with shorter gestational age at birth, after controlling for psychosocial factors. Receipt of behavioral health services may be an effective intervention to address disparities in PTB."
https://openalex.org/W3193022625,"Introduction PrEP awareness in Latin America has been poorly characterized, with studies in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru highlighting awareness of 65% among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). We assessed the association between higher risk of HIV infection, indicative of PrEP eligibility, and PrEP awareness among MSM from these countries. Methods This was a secondary analysis of a web-based survey advertised on social media platforms from March-June 2018 in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Eligible individuals were cisgender MSM, â‰¥18 years old, HIV negative or of unknown status, who lived in these countries, and provided informed consent. Higher risk of HIV infection was defined as having 10 or more points in the HIV Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM). We used multivariable Poisson regression models to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) testing the association between higher risk for HIV and PrEP awareness. Results After exclusions, 19,457 MSM were included in this analysis. In Brazil, 53.8% were classified as higher risk for HIV, 51.9% in Mexico, and 54.2% in Peru. Higher risk for HIV was minimally associated with PrEP awareness among those in Brazil (aPR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.06), but no such association was observed in Mexico or Peru. Having more than a high school education, high income, daily use of geosocial networking (GSN) applications, and substance use were associated with PrEP awareness. Conclusion Higher risk of HIV infection was associated with increased PrEP awareness in Brazil. However, this association was weak indicating that PrEP awareness could be strengthened with further prevention efforts. In the remaining countries, results were non-conclusive between risk and awareness. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness are paramount to increase PrEP willingness and uptake and in turn prevent new HIV infections. Social media platforms could play an important role to achieve this goal."

In this study, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the neural correlates of action-observation and action execution regions during a live task. Thirty adults reached for objects or observed an experimenter reaching for objects while their cerebral hemodynamic responses including oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) were recorded in the sensorimotor and parietal regions. Our results indicated that the parietal regions, including bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right supra-marginal region (SMG) and right angular gyrus (AG) share neural activity during action-observation and action-execution. Our findings confirm the applicability of fNIRS for the study of the AON and lay the foundation for future work with developmental and clinical populations."

Using a representative sample of the Hungarian population, we investigated the support for commonly used preventive measures (social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing masks) comparing two different policy tools (nudges and regulations). Because of the high risk and unfamiliarity of the pandemic, the respondentsâ€™ risk perception and experience with the disease was also assessed. All preventive measures were generally supported and, contrary to the findings of previous nudge research, there was no clear pattern whether regulations or nudges are preferred. People with higher level of risk perception supported both types of policies more but slightly favoured the regulations. Those who had contact with the disease (either themselves or a close friend or family member contracting COVID-19) reported a higher level of risk perception. When the person themselves was afflicted, this higher levels of risk perception did not translate to a higher level of support, moreover, it even decreased support for the regulations according to regression analysis. In case of a loved one contracting the disease, there was an increased support for both types of measures, but that is explained by the higher risk perception."
https://openalex.org/W3187821460,"The estimation of recent gene flow rates among vast and often weakly genetically differentiated tree populations remains a great challenge. Yet, empirical information would help understanding the interaction between gene flow and local adaptation in present-day non-equilibrium forests. We investigate here recent gene flow rates between two large native Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) populations in central Iberian Peninsula (Spain), which grow on contrasting edaphic conditions six kilometers apart from each other and show substantial quantitative trait divergence in common garden experiments. Using a sample of 1,200 adult and offspring chloroplast-microsatellite haplotypes and a Bayesian inference model, we estimated substantial male gametic gene flow rates (8 and 21%) between the two natural populations, and even greater estimated immigration rates (42 and 64%) from nearby plantations into the two natural populations. Our results suggest that local pollen shedding within large tree populations does not preclude long-distance pollen immigration from large external sources, supporting the role of gene flow as a homogenizing evolutionary force contributing to low molecular genetic differentiation among populations of widely distributed wind-pollinated species. Our results also indicate the high potential for reproductive connectivity in large fragmented populations of wind-pollinated trees, and draw attention to a potential scenario of adaptive genetic divergence in quantitative traits under high gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W3188894541,"Copenhagen rats are highly resistant to mammary carcinogenesis, even after treatment with chemical carcinogens and hormones; most studies indicate that this is a dominant genetic trait. To test whether this trait is also dominant after radiation exposure, we characterized the susceptibility of irradiated Copenhagen rats to mammary carcinogenesis, as well as its inheritance, and identified tumor-suppressor genes that, when inactivated or mutated, may contribute to carcinogenesis. To this end, mammary cancer-susceptible Sprague-Dawley rats, resistant Copenhagen rats, and their F1 hybrids were irradiated with 4 Gy of Î³-rays, and tumor development was monitored. Copy-number variations and allelic imbalances of genomic DNA were studied using microarrays and PCR analysis of polymorphic markers. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative PCR in normal tissues and induced mammary cancers of F1 rats. Irradiated Copenhagen rats exhibited a very low incidence of mammary cancer. Unexpectedly, this resistance trait did not show dominant inheritance in F1 rats; rather, they exhibited intermediate susceptibility levels (i.e., between those of their parent strains). The susceptibility of irradiated F1 rats to the development of benign mammary tumors (i.e., fibroadenoma and adenoma) was also intermediate. Copy-number losses were frequently observed in chromosome regions 1q52-54 (24%), 2q12-15 (33%), and 3q31-42 (24%), as were focal (38%) and whole (29%) losses of chromosome 5. Some of these chromosomal regions exhibited allelic imbalances. Many cancer-related genes within these regions were downregulated in mammary tumors as compared with normal mammary tissue. Some of the chromosomal losses identified have not been reported previously in chemically induced models, implying a novel mechanism inherent to the irradiated model. Based on these findings, Sprague-Dawley Ã— Copenhagen F1 rats offer a useful model for exploring genes responsible for radiation-induced mammary cancer, which apparently are mainly located in specific regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 5."

However, such studies require valuable reference data, obtained from analyses of modern individuals, in habitats of well-known conditions. In this article, we present the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of bone collagen from modern red deer (N = 242 individuals) dwelling in various habitats (N = 15 study sites) in Europe. We investigated which of the selected climatic and environmental factors affected the Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N values in bone collagen of the studied specimens. Among all analyzed factors, the percent of forest cover influenced the carbon isotopic composition most significantly, and decreasing forest cover caused an increase in Î´ 13 C values. The Î´ 15 N was positively related to the proportion of open area and (only in the coastal areas) negatively related to the distance to the seashore. Using rigorous statistical methods and a large number of samples, we confirmed that Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N values can be used as a proxy of past habitats of red deer."

The method involves the expression of a specific GPI-AP tagged with GFP, solubilization, immunoprecipitation, separation by electrophoresis, blotting onto PVDF, release and extraction of the GPI-lipid moiety and analysis by mass spectrometry. By using this protocol, we could determine the precise GPI-lipid structure of the GPI-AP Gas1-GFP in a modified yeast strain.

Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured guide in the participants' homes by trained data collectors. Data were transcribed, translated, and then coded using a structured code book. All data were organized using Dedoose software for analysis.Twenty-one interviews were conducted primarily with mothers (90.5%, n = 19) among newborns who were most often discharged home alive (90.5%, n = 19). Four themes emerged from the interviews. These were the parental adaptation to having a sick neonate in NCU, adaptation to the NCU environment, interaction with people (healthcare providers and fellow parents) in the NCU, and financial stressors.The admission of a newborn to the NCU is a source of stress for parents and caregivers in rural Rwanda, however, there were several positive aspects which helped mothers adapt to the NCU. The experience in the NCU can be improved when healthcare providers communicate and explain the newborn's status to the parents and actively involve them in the care of their newborn. Expanding the NCU access for families, encouraging peer support, and ensuring financial accessibility for neonatal care services could contribute to improved experiences for parents and families in general."

We found that for some SES measures the probability of care provision for parents was greater in higher SES categories than in the lowest category, although the results were not systematically related to the order of SES categories or consistent across SES measures. The results did not change even after the difference in the probability of parents' survival according to SES was considered. Overall, we did not find evidence that individuals with lower SES were more likely to provide care to parents than higher-SES individuals. Although a negative association between SES and care burden has been repeatedly reported in terms of care intensity, the caregiving decision could be different in relation to SES. Further research is necessary to generalize the results."
https://openalex.org/W3191348435,"Brucella is a facultative extracellular-intracellular pathogen that belongs to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Precise sensing of environmental changes and a proper response mediated by a gene expression regulatory network are essential for this pathogen to survive. The plant-related Alphaproteobacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens also alternate from a free to a host-associated life, where a regulatory invasion switch is needed for this transition. This switch is composed of a two-component regulatory system (TCS) and a global inhibitor, ExoR. In B . abortus , the BvrR/BvrS TCS is essential for intracellular survival. However, the presence of a TCS inhibitor, such as ExoR, in Brucella is still unknown. In this work, we identified a genomic sequence similar to S . meliloti exoR in the B . abortus 2308W genome, constructed an exoR mutant strain, and performed its characterization through ex vivo and in vivo assays. Our findings indicate that ExoR is related to the BvrR phosphorylation state, and is related to the expression of known BvrR/BrvS gene targets, such as virB8 , vjbR , and omp25 when grown in rich medium or starving conditions. Despite this, the exoR mutant strain showed no significant differences as compared to the wild-type strain, related to resistance to polymyxin B or human non-immune serum, intracellular replication, or infectivity in a mice model. ExoR in B . abortus is related to BvrR/BvrS as observed in other Rhizobiales; however, its function seems different from that observed for its orthologs described in A . tumefaciens and S . meliloti ."
https://openalex.org/W3192056121,"The zoonotic pathogen Coxiella burnetii , the causative agent of the human disease Q fever, is an ever-present danger to global public health. Investigating novel metabolic pathways necessary for C . burnetii to replicate within its unusual intracellular niche may identify new therapeutic targets. Recent studies employing stable isotope labelling established the ability of C . burnetii to synthesize lactate, despite the absence of an annotated synthetic pathway on its genome. A noncanonical lactate synthesis pathway could provide a novel anti- Coxiella target if it is essential for C . burnetii pathogenesis. In this study, two C . burnetii proteins, CBU1241 and CBU0823, were chosen for analysis based on their similarities to known lactate synthesizing enzymes. Recombinant GST-CBU1241, a putative malate dehydrogenase (MDH), did not produce measurable lactate in in vitro lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assays and was confirmed to function as an MDH. Recombinant 6xHis-CBU0823, a putative NAD + -dependent malic enzyme, was shown to have both malic enzyme activity and MDH activity, however, did not produce measurable lactate in either LDH or malolactic enzyme activity assays in vitro . To examine potential lactate production by CBU0823 more directly, [ 13 C]glucose labelling experiments compared label enrichment within metabolic pathways of a cbu0823 transposon mutant and the parent strain. No difference in lactate production was observed, but the loss of CBU0823 significantly reduced 13 C-incorporation into glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates. This disruption to central carbon metabolism did not have any apparent impact on intracellular replication within THP-1 cells. This research provides new information about the mechanism of lactate biosynthesis within C . burnetii , demonstrating that CBU1241 is not multifunctional, at least in vitro , and that CBU0823 also does not synthesize lactate. Although critical for normal central carbon metabolism of C . burnetii , loss of CBU0823 did not significantly impair replication of the bacterium inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W3189631079,"Tillering and secondary branching are two plastic traits with high agronomic importance, especially in terms of the ability of plants to adapt to changing environments. We describe a quantitative trait analysis of tillering and secondary branching in two novel BC1F2 populations totaling 246 genotypes derived from backcrossing two Sorghum bicolor x S. halepense F1 plants to a tetraploidized S. bicolor. A two-year, two-environment phenotypic evaluation in Bogart, GA and Salina, KS permitted us to identify major effect and environment specific QTLs. Significant correlation between tillering and secondary branching followed by discovery of overlapping sets of QTLs continue to support the developmental relationship between these two organs and suggest the possibility of pleiotropy. Comparisons with two other populations sharing S. bicolor BTx623 as a common parent but sampling the breadth of the Sorghum genus, increase confidence in QTL detected for these two plastic traits and provide insight into the evolution of morphological diversity in the Eusorghum clade. Correspondence between flowering time and vegetative branching supports other evidence in suggesting a pleiotropic effect of flowering genes. We propose a model to predict biomass weight from plant architecture related traits, quantifying contribution of each trait to biomass and providing guidance for future breeding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3192525709,"Identifying causative variants in cis-regulatory elements (CRE) in neurodevelopmental disorders has proven challenging. We have used in vivo functional analyses to categorize rigorously filtered CRE variants in a clinical cohort that is plausibly enriched for causative CRE mutations: 48 unrelated males with a family history consistent with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in whom no detectable cause could be identified in the coding regions of the X chromosome (chrX). Targeted sequencing of all chrX CRE identified six rare variants in five affected individuals that altered conserved bases in CRE targeting known XLID genes and segregated appropriately in families. Two of these variants, FMR1CRE and TENM1CRE, showed consistent site- and stage-specific differences of enhancer function in the developing zebrafish brain using dual-color fluorescent reporter assay. Mouse models were created for both variants. In male mice Fmr1CRE induced alterations in neurodevelopmental Fmr1 expression, olfactory behavior and neurophysiological indicators of FMRP function. The absence of another likely causative variant on whole genome sequencing further supported FMR1CRE as the likely basis of the XLID in this family. Tenm1CRE mice showed no phenotypic anomalies. Following the release of gnomAD 2.1, reanalysis showed that TENM1CRE exceeded the maximum plausible population frequency of a XLID causative allele. Assigning causative status to any ultra-rare CRE variant remains problematic and requires disease-relevant in vivo functional data from multiple sources. The sequential and bespoke nature of such analyses renders them time-consuming and challenging to scale for routine clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3188453126,"We previously reported that dye was effective to prevent the leakage of enzyme solutions from pancreatic glands during an islet isolation procedure. However, the dye used for islet isolation has not yet been optimized. In this study, we focused on pyoktanin blue (PB), diagnogreen (DG), and indigo carmine (IC) as potential candidates among clinically established dyes. A serial dilution assay was performed to determine minimal effective concentrations of each dye for detecting damaged pancreatic tissues. According to the outcome of serial dilution assays, double minimum effective concentrations of each dye were used for in vitro toxicity assays on islets and used in the isolation procedure to investigate whether they adversely affect islet isolation efficiency. The evaluations included islet yield, ADP/ATP, ATP/DNA, glucose stimulation test, and insulin/DNA assays. Islet viability cultured with PB contained medium was significantly lower than the other dyes. DG and IC appeared to be non-toxic to the islets. In isolation experiments, the islet yield in the DG group was considerably lower than that in the Control group, suggesting that DG might inhibit enzyme activity. The present study demonstrates that IC could be a promising candidate for an effective dye to detect damaged pancreatic tissues without affecting the enzyme activity and islet quality."
https://openalex.org/W3188739392,"Objective To compare the psychometric performance of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI-BRA) and Skindex-16 to assess quality of life (QoL) in Brazilian patients with dermatological diseases. Methods This was a cross-sectional study carried out in a dermatology outpatient clinic of the SÃ£o Paulo State University, with 188 patients with dermatological diseases. QoL was evaluated using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI-BRA) and Skindex-16. Cronbachâ€™s alpha and Intraclass Correlation for Perfect Concordance (ICC) were used to analyse the reliability and temporal stability, respectively. Results A positive correlation was found between the total Skindex-16 score and DLQI-BRA (0.75). Both instruments showed a significant (p&lt; 0.01) reduction in their scores at the second assessment, demonstrating that they were sensitive in detecting changes in responsiveness in cases where there was a clinical change. Cronbach alpha coefficients for the instruments showed satisfactory performance (&gt;0,7), but Skindex-16 displayed the highest Cronbach alpha (0.94; CI = 0.93â€“0.95). Conclusion Both instruments tested showed a good psychometric performance assessing QoL in patients with skin dermatoses. The instruments displayed reliability and temporal stability as well as responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3189277533,"The credibility and the reliability of Internet webpages to seek medication-related information is questionable. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate perception and experience of pharmacists with the use of Internet-based medication information by their patients.This is a cross-sectional descriptive study that was conducted to evaluate perception and experience of pharmacists with the use of Internet-based medication information by their patients. During the study period, 200 pharmacists were approached to participate in the study using a paper-based survey to assess their perceptions and current experience with the use of Internet-based medication information by their patients. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean/standard deviation for continuous variables, and frequency/percentages for qualitative variables). Also, simple linear regression was utilized to screen factors affecting pharmacists' perception scores of the use of Internet-based medication information.Among 161 recruited pharmacists, the majority (n = 129, 80.1%) reported receiving inquiries from patients about Internet-based medication information within the last year. Among them, only 22.6% (n = 29) of pharmacists believed that Internet-based medication information is somewhat or very accurate. Unfortunately, only 24.2% (n = 31) of them stated that they always had enough time for their patient to discuss their Internet-based medication information. Regarding pharmacists' perception of the use of Internet-based medication information by their patients, more than half of the pharmacists (>50%) believe that Internet-based medication information could increase the patient's role in taking responsibility. On the other hand, 54.7% (n = 88) of the pharmacists believed that Internet-based medication information would contribute to rising the healthcare cost by obtaining unnecessary medications by patients. Finally, pharmacists' educational level was found to significantly affect their perception scores toward patient use of Internet-based medication information where those with higher educational level showed lower perception score (r = -0.200, P-value = 0.011).Although pharmacists felt that usage of Internet-based data by patients is beneficial, they also have believed that it has a negative impact in terms of rising the healthcare cost, and it promotes unnecessary fear or concern about medications. We suggest that pharmacists be trained on principles of critical appraisal to become professional in retrieval information on the Internet that might improve their delivery of healthcare information and their recommendations to patients."
