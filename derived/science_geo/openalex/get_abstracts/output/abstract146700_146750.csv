https://openalex.org/W2157740207,"Apoptosis can be triggered by members of the Bcl-2 protein family, such as Bim, that share only the BH3 domain with this family. Gene targeting in mice revealed important physiological roles for Bim. Lymphoid and myeloid cells accumulated, T cell development was perturbed, and most older mice accumulated plasma cells and succumbed to autoimmune kidney disease. Lymphocytes were refractory to apoptotic stimuli such as cytokine deprivation, calcium ion flux, and microtubule perturbation but not to others. Thus, Bim is required for hematopoietic homeostasis and as a barrier to autoimmunity. Moreover, particular death stimuli appear to activate apoptosis through distinct BH3-only proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1964051078,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase contains a rotary motor involved in biological energy conversion. Its membrane-embedded F0 sector has a rotation generator fueled by the proton-motive force, which provides the energy required for the synthesis of ATP by the F1 domain. An electron density map obtained from crystals of a subcomplex of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase shows a ring of 10 c subunits. Each c subunit forms an alpha-helical hairpin. The interhelical loops of six to seven of the c subunits are in close contact with the gamma and delta subunits of the central stalk. The extensive contact between the c ring and the stalk suggests that they may rotate as an ensemble during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1971727526,"Activation of the protein kinase Raf can lead to opposing cellular responses such as proliferation, growth arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation. Akt (protein kinase B), a member of a different signaling pathway that also regulates these responses, interacted with Raf and phosphorylated this protein at a highly conserved serine residue in its regulatory domain in vivo. This phosphorylation of Raf by Akt inhibited activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway and shifted the cellular response in a human breast cancer cell line from cell cycle arrest to proliferation. These observations provide a molecular basis for cross talk between two signaling pathways at the level of Raf and Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2015609730,"Memories for habits and skills (""implicit or procedural memory"") and memories for facts (""explicit or episodic memory"") are built up in different brain systems and are vulnerable to different neurodegenerative disorders in humans. So that the striatum-based mechanisms underlying habit formation could be studied, chronic recordings from ensembles of striatal neurons were made with multiple tetrodes as rats learned a T-maze procedural task. Large and widely distributed changes in the neuronal activity patterns occurred in the sensorimotor striatum during behavioral acquisition, culminating in task-related activity emphasizing the beginning and end of the automatized procedure. The new ensemble patterns remained stable during weeks of subsequent performance of the same task. These results suggest that the encoding of action in the sensorimotor striatum undergoes dynamic reorganization as habit learning proceeds."
https://openalex.org/W2017292900,"Extracellular signals often result in simultaneous activation of both the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways (where ERK is extracellular-regulated kinase, MEK is mitogen-activated protein kinase or ERK kinase, and PI3K is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). However, these two signaling pathways were shown to exert opposing effects on muscle cell hypertrophy. Furthermore, the PI3K-Akt pathway was shown to inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway; this cross-regulation depended on the differentiation state of the cell: Akt activation inhibited the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in differentiated myotubes, but not in their myoblast precursors. The stage-specific inhibitory action of Akt correlated with its stage-specific ability to form a complex with Raf, suggesting the existence of differentially expressed mediators of an inhibitory Akt-Raf complex."
https://openalex.org/W2074173591,"In the S locus-controlled self-incompatibility system of Brassica, recognition of self-related pollen at the surface of stigma epidermal cells leads to inhibition of pollen tube development. The female (stigmatic) determinant of this recognition reaction is a polymorphic transmembrane receptor protein kinase encoded at the S locus. Another highly polymorphic, anther-expressed gene, SCR, also encoded at the S locus, fulfills the requirements for the hypothesized pollen determinant. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies prove that the SCR gene product is necessary and sufficient for determining pollen self-incompatibility specificity, possibly by acting as a ligand for the stigmatic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1980264776,"The hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is specific destruction of the synovial joints. In a mouse line that spontaneously develops a disorder with many of the features of human RA, disease is initiated by T cell recognition of a ubiquitously expressed self-antigen; once initiated, pathology is driven almost entirely by immunoglobulins. In this study, the target of both the initiating T cells and pathogenic immunoglobulins was identified as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, a glycolytic enzyme. Thus, some forms of RA or related arthritides may develop by a mechanism fundamentally different from the currently popular paradigm of a joint-specific T cell response."

https://openalex.org/W1979996406,"Defining how the molecular constituents of the tight junction interact is a prerequisite to understanding tight junction physiology. We utilized in vitro binding assays with purified recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitation analyses to define interactions between ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, occludin, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin cosedimentation studies showed that ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin all interact directly with F-actin in vitro, indicating that actin is engaged in multiple interactions at the tight junction. Low speed sedimentation analyses demonstrated that neither ZO-2, ZO-3, nor occludin act as F-actin cross-linking proteins, and further evidence indicates that these proteins do not bind to actin filament ends. The binding interactions of ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin were corroborated in vivo by immunofluorescence colocalization experiments which showed that all three proteins colocalized with actin aggregates at cell borders in cytochalasin D-treated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Exploration of other tight junction protein interactions demonstrated that ZO-2 binds directly to both ZO-1 and occludin. Contrary to previous beliefs, our immunoprecipitation results indicate that ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 existin situ primarily as independent ZO-1·ZO-2 and ZO-1·ZO-3 complexes rather than a trimeric ZO-1·ZO-2·ZO-3 grouping. These studies elucidate direct binding interactions among tight junction-associated proteins, giving insight into their organization as a multimolecular structure.

This complex includes the TJ, adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The TJ forms a barrier to paracellular movement of substances, keeping the apical and basolateral fluid compartments on opposite sides of the epithelial cell layer distinct. The TJ also acts in the maintenance of apicalversus basolateral plasma membrane compositional asymmetry by restricting the movement of lipids and integral membrane proteins within the plane of the membrane. The molecular composition of the TJ is now beginning to be described. Since the identification and characterization of the first TJ protein ZO-1 (2Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), a host of other proteins which localize to the TJ have been identified.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), together with ZO-1, are members of the MAGUK family of proteins (6Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) displaying a characteristic multidomain structure comprised of the PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domains. ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, unlike other members of the MAGUK family, each also have an acidic domain, a basic arginine-rich region, and a proline-rich domain. Other peripheral membrane proteins localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the TJ include cingulin (7Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J.

Some of these proteins are believed to act in signal transduction events, indicating that TJ barrier dynamics may be regulated locally by signaling events within the TJ plaque. Transmembrane protein components of the TJ include occludin (13Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita Sa Tsukita Sh J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), JAM (14Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L.

Rodriguez-Soriano J. McCredie D. Milford D. Sanjad S. Lifton R.P. Science. 1999; 285: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Actin filaments are known to be associated with the TJ cytoplasmic plaque (18Hirokawa N. Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C171-C175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are believed to act in the regulation of TJ permeability (20Madara J.L. Barenberg D. Carlson S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21Madara J.L. Pappenheimer J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which actin acts has not been determined directly, although several investigators propose a linkage of actin·ZO-1·occludin based on cosedimentation studies using the C-terminal half of ZO-1 (22Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28753-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 23Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the observed ZO-1·actin interaction is due to unidentified intermediary proteins as actin binding was assayed from whole cell lysates. Evidence exists that occludin, and not other transmembrane elements of the TJ, functions in the linkage between the TJ and the actin cytoskeleton (24Kojima T. Sawada N. Yamamoto M. Kokai Y. Mori M. Mochizuki Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Itoh et al. (25Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5966-5981Google Scholar) have hypothesized that ZO-2 also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, as an exogenously expressed C-terminal ZO-2 construct distributes along actin stress fibers in fibroblasts. Limited information exists regarding interactions among TJ-associated proteins. ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 can be coimmunoprecipitated from MDCK cells (3Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is known that ZO-1 can directly bind to the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of occludin (22Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28753-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 27Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita Sa Tsukita Sh J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and the Ras-effector molecule AF-6 (11Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S.-I. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi C. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have previously shown via in vitrobinding assays that ZO-3 interacts directly with ZO-1 and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of occludin, but does not bind ZO-2 (5Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Based on immunoprecipitation of protein constructs from transfected cells, recent reports suggest that ZO-1 and ZO-2 interact with each other via their second PDZ domains (22Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28753-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 25Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5966-5981Google Scholar). However, these binding studies were also performed with whole cell lysates, and the possibility that the interaction is indirect and mediated by other proteins cannot be excluded. Recent data suggest that the N terminus of ZO-2 also interacts with the C-terminal tail of occludin (25Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5966-5981Google Scholar), although again, this was assayed using whole cell lysates. Defining how the molecular components of the TJ interact will provide information crucial to understanding TJ physiology. Here we define the interactions between ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, occludin, and F-actin through the use of purified proteins in in vitro binding assays. Our data show that the interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and junctional components are more complex than anticipated, consisting of multiple possible linkage mechanisms. In addition, our results reveal that previous views on the existence of a three-member complex of ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 require revision. The emerging complexity of protein-protein interactions at the TJ has both functional and regulatory implications. Recombinant protein expression and purification was performed according to previously published methods (5Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In brief, full-length 6-histidine tagged ZO-3 (pHTc/ZO-3) and ZO-2 (pHTb/ZO-2) proteins were each expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a Baculovirus eukaryotic expression system (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Empty pFastBac vector (pHTc), coding for the 6-histidine tag plus 36 nonspecific amino acids served as negative control. Protein from Sf9 cell lysate was purified on Probond nickel resin (Invitrogen Corp.), eluted with 300–500 mm imidazole, and used in binding assays or cosedimentation experiments. JShak2, a 6-histidine tagged jellyfish Shaker-type K+-channel peptide (amino acids 402–476; Ref. 28Jegla T. Grigoriev N. Gallin W.J. Salkoff L. Spencer A.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7989-7999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, a gift from Dr. Warren Gallin, University of Alberta) in the pRSET expression vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) served as a negative control for ZO-2 and ZO-3/actin cosedimentation studies. GST-occludin cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (amino acids 358–505) of chicken occludin (13Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita Sa Tsukita Sh J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar) in pGEX-2T (a gift from Drs. Jim Anderson and Alan Fanning, Yale University), and GST alone were expressed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione. [35S]Methionine-labeled in vitrotranscribed/translated ZO-1 was prepared with the TNTTMT7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega Corp.) using as template full-length human ZO-1 cDNA (obtained from Drs. Anderson and Fanning) in pBluescript SK+ under control of the T7 promoter. The following antibodies were used: rat anti-ZO-1 mAb R40.76 (29Anderson J.M. Stevenson B.R. Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-ZO-2 polyclonal Ab R9989 (3Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), guinea pig anti-ZO-3 (5Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (a gift from Carolyn Machamer, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The anti-ZO-3 antibody does not cross-react with ZO-1 or ZO-2. A rabbit anti-occludin antibody (raised against amino acids 255–510) (Ref. 30Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar; a gift from Drs. Alpha Yap and Barry Gumbiner) was used for immunoblot detection of both recombinant occludin and GST alone as it was raised against a GST fusion protein. A second rabbit anti-occludin antibody raised against the most C-terminal 150 amino acids (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) was used for immunofluorescence experiments. A mixture of anti-tetra-His and anti-penta-His antibodies (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to recognize the 6-histidine tag of the JShak2 fusion protein. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies for immunoblots and indirect immunofluorescence. Immunoblot detection via ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed according to manufacturer protocols. Actin cosedimentation experiments were performed according to modification of the methods of Fanning et al. (22Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28753-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized G-actin (>95% pure grade) (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) was diluted to 10 mg/ml with distilled water, so that buffer conditions were then 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1% dextran, 5% sucrose. Further dilution with actin binding buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) to a final actin concentration of 2.5 mg/ml was followed by 30 min incubation on ice to initiate polymerization. Polymerized F-actin was stabilized by adding phalloidin (Sigma) to 25 μg/ml (22Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28753-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Purified ZO-2, ZO-3, JShak2, GST-occludin, or GST were dialyzed into actin binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to inhibit aggregate formation, then pre-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. F-actin binding was assayed in 100-μl reactions containing a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml F-actin (or actin binding buffer alone), and precentrifuged purified test protein. Each reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before spinning 30 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was removed and pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of gel sample buffer to maintain equivalent stoichiometry between supernatant and pellet fractions. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting. For actin cosedimentation assays using sheared actin, shearing was accomplished by pipetting the F-actin solution 20 times through a narrow bore pipette tip. Shearing of F-actin was confirmed by falling ball viscometry (31MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) to measure relative viscosity of unsheared versus sheared F-actin solutions. Test proteins were added to unsheared or sheared F-actin immediately after shearing. Low speed sedimentation analysis was performed according to established methods (32Espindola F.S. Espreafico E.M. Coelho M.V. Martins A.R. Costa F.R. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl reactions containing 0.25 mg/ml actin alone, or in the presence of purified ZO-2, ZO-3, or occludin were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 20 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellet fractions were resuspended in an equal volume of gel sample buffer. Supernatant and pellet fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect F-actin. Control MDCK (strain II) and MDCK cells expressing exogenous vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-tagged ZO-3 (MDCK/Z3) (5Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) were grown on rat tail collagen-coated coverslips to near confluency. Cytochalasin D experiments were performed according to established methods (33Stevenson B.R. Begg D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslips were treated for 60 min with either 2 μg/ml cytochalasin D (from a 5 mg/ml dimethyl sulfoxide stock) or an equal concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide alone as a negative control. Cells were then immediately fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS and fixed for immunofluorescence as described (34Howarth A.G. Hughes M.R. Stevenson B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C461-C469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used to stain F-actin. Coverslips were viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). For costaining experiments, control coverslips stained for ZO-2, ZO-3, occludin, or actin alone showed no visible fluorescence from either fluorochrome when viewed with the opposite filter set (data not shown). Negative control peptide from cells containing pHTc alone, or purified ZO-2 dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline was bound to Probond resin and washed with phosphate wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole) with 0.2% Tween 20, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Protein-containing resin was incubated with the completed ZO-1 in vitrotranscription/translation reaction diluted so that final binding conditions were 140 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Binding proceeded overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing with phosphate wash buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20. Washed resin was resuspended in gel sample buffer, boiled, and bound protein complexes were run on SDS-PAGE. Enhancement of 35S signal was accomplished by sequential incubation of the gel in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid (30 min), and 1 m salicylic acid solution (30 min). The gel was dried and exposed to Fuji RX film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan). GST-occludin or GST alone was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and Probond-purified ZO-2 was added. Final binding conditions were 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Tween 20. Binding was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C.

Low stringency immunoprecipitations, defined as conditions that maintain some protein-protein interactions, were performed according to previously published techniques (3Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A.

Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were solubilized as described, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. In experiments requiring equivalent starting material, total protein concentration of the supernatant fraction was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) prior to immunoprecipitation. This supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with anti-ZO-1 mAb followed by goat anti-rat IgG coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anti-ZO-2 followed by protein A-Sepharose, or anti-ZO-3 followed by protein A-Sepharose. Sepharose beads were washed according to the procedures of Pasdar and Nelson (37Pasdar M. Nelson W.J. J.

Low stringency immunoprecipitation followed by high stringency immunoprecipitation was performed with modification of previously published techniques (38Li Z. Gallin W.J. Lauzon G. Pasdar M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1005-1019PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolically labeled MDCK cells were first immunoprecipitated under low stringency conditions (described above), and the resulting immune complexes were eluted from the Sepharose beads under high stringency conditions (39Stevenson B.R.

Although actin filaments have been observed at the TJ (18Hirokawa N. Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Madara J.L. Am. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) suggested an association between actin and ZO-1, although these experiments did not rule out the possibility that the interaction occurs via intermediary proteins. We performed a series of actin cosedimentation assays to test directly the F-actin binding ability of other TJ proteins, using purified recombinant ZO-2 and ZO-3. We also tested the F-actin binding ability of occludin to determine if linkage to the cytoskeleton is mediated exclusively by peripheral membrane proteins or if actin can bind directly to a transmembrane element. The actin cosedimentation assay is based on the observation that polymerized actin filaments are readily pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (Fig.1 A). When ZO-2 (Fig.1 B) is added to the reaction, there is a significant shift of ZO-2 from the supernatant to the pellet fraction only in the presence of F-actin. A negative control protein ((His)6-tagged JShak2 fusion protein) did not cosediment with F-actin (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the ZO-2/actin association is not due to the 6-histiding tag binding F-actin. Furthermore, ZO-2 still cosedimented with F-actin after the 6-histidine tag had been removed by Factor Xa cleavage (data not shown). ZO-3 was similarly found to cosediment with F-actin (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, GST-occludin was also found to cosediment specifically with F-actin, while the GST alone negative control peptide did not (Fig. 1 D). ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin proteins also cosedimented with F-actin when spun through a 10% glycerol cushion (data not shown), further indicating that the observed interactions with actin are specific and are not due to trapping by actin filaments. Combined, these data suggest that F-actin is capable of specifically binding multiple TJ proteins. F-actin binding proteins can be classified based on the type of interaction with actin. For example, there are F-actin end-binding (capping) proteins such as CapZ (40Casella J.F. Craig S.W. Maack D.J. Brown A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), side binding proteins (non-cross-linking) such as tropomyosin (41Cote G.P. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7257-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cross-linking proteins such as α-actinin (42Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We tested if ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin bind to actin filament ends by utilizing actin cosedimentation experiments with unsheared versus sheared actin filaments. Shearing creates shorter actin filaments and therefore more actin ends available for binding. Confirmation of shearing was done by falling ball viscometry, which is a means of measuring relative viscosity of a solution. Our shear conditions resulted in a significant decrease in viscosity. We observed a fall rate of 0.69 cm/s ± 0.035 for unsheared F-actin and 0.90 cm/s ± 0.025 for sheared F-actin. The amount of pelletable F-actin did not change after shearing (Fig.2 A). We conclude that these shear conditions result in a greater number of F-actin ends. When ZO-2, ZO-3, or occludin was incubated with either unsheared (−) or sheared (+) actin filaments, there was no change in the amount of test protein found in the pellet (Fig. 2 A), indicating that these proteins do not preferentially bind to F-actin ends. F-actin side-binding proteins can act as cross-linkers if they have the ability to bind to more than one actin filament simultaneously. To test ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin for actin filament cross-linking ability, we performed low speed sedimentation assays by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min (32Espindola F.S. Espreafico E.M. Coelho M.V. Martins A.R. Costa F.R. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the majority of single actin filaments remain in the supernatant (Fig.2 B), whereas cross-linked filament networks readily pellet. Incubating ZO-2, ZO-3, or occludin with F-actin did not cause an increase in the amount of F-actin pelleted under these conditions (Fig.2 B), suggesting that these proteins do not act to cross-link or bundle F-actin. While the cosedimentation experiments indicate that ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin bind F-actin directly"

An actin filament connected to a c subunit oligomer of F 0 was able to rotate by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The rotary torque produced by the c subunit oligomer reached about 40 piconewton-nanometers, which is similar to that generated by the γ subunit in the F 1 motor. These results suggest that the γ and c subunits rotate together during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Thus, coupled rotation may be essential for energy coupling between proton transport through F 0 and ATP hydrolysis or synthesis in F 1 ."

https://openalex.org/W2015441766,"Smads are intracellular signaling mediators of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that regulates a wide variety of biological processes. Among them, Smads 2 and 3 are activated specifically by TGF-β. We identified c-Ski as a Smad2 interacting protein. c-Ski is the cellular homologue of thev-ski oncogene product and has been shown to repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC). Smad2/3 interacts with c-Ski through its C-terminal MH2 domain in a TGF-β-dependent manner. c-Ski contains two distinct Smad-binding sites with different binding properties. c-Ski strongly inhibits transactivation of various reporter genes by TGF-β. c-Ski is incorporated in the Smad DNA binding complex, interferes with the interaction of Smad3 with a transcriptional co-activator, p300, and in turn recruits HDAC. c-Ski is thus a transcriptional co-repressor that links Smads to HDAC in TGF-β signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1617105089,"The four giant planets in the Solar System have abundances of 'metals' (elements heavier than helium), relative to hydrogen, that are much higher than observed in the Sun. In order to explain this, all models for the formation of these planets rely on an influx of solid planetesimals. It is generally assumed that these planetesimals were similar, if not identical, to the comets from the Oort cloud that we see today. Comets that formed in the region of the giant planets should not have contained much neon, argon and nitrogen, because the temperatures were too high for these volatile gases to be trapped effectively in ice. This means that the abundances of those elements on the giant planets should be approximately solar. Here we show that argon, krypton and xenon in Jupiter's atmosphere are enriched to the same extent as the other heavy elements, which suggests that the planetesimals carrying these elements must have formed at temperatures lower than predicted by present models of giant-planet formation."

Exact quantum mechanical calculations of reactive scattering on a potential energy surface without Cl–HD van der Waals forces predict that the HCl and DCl products will be produced almost equally, whereas the same calculations on a new ab initio potential energy surface with van der Waals forces show a strong preference for the production of DCl. This preference is also seen in crossed molecular beam experiments on the reaction. The study of chemical reaction dynamics has now advanced to the stage where even comparatively weak van der Waals interactions can no longer be neglected in calculations of the potential energy surfaces of chemical reactions."

Therefore, at realistic LM conditions, the isotropic wave velocities of MgO remain comparable to seismic velocities, as previously noticed in athermal high-pressure calculations. Also, the predicted strong pressure-induced anisotropy is preserved toward the bottom of the LM, so lattice-preferred orientations in MgO may contribute substantially to the observed seismic anisotropy in the D"" layer."

A high-resolution study of Caribbean sediments provides a subdecadally resolved record of tropical upwelling and trade wind variability spanning the past 825 years. These results confirm the importance of a decadal (12- to 13-year) mode of Atlantic variability believed to be driven by coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere dynamics. Although a well-defined interdecadal mode of variability does not appear to be characteristic of the tropical Atlantic, there is evidence that century-scale variability is substantial. The tropical Atlantic may also have been involved in a major shift in Northern Hemisphere climate variability that took place about 700 years ago."

In Brassica , the S receptor kinase (SRK) has been implicated in the self-incompatibility response, but the molecular mechanisms involving SRK are unknown. One putative downstream effector for SRK is ARC1, a protein that binds to the SRK kinase domain. Here it is shown that suppression of ARC1 messenger RNA levels in the self-incompatible Brassica napus W1 line is correlated with a partial breakdown of self-incompatibility, resulting in seed production. This provides strong evidence that ARC1 is a positive effector of the Brassica self-incompatibility response."

In this study, we examined the expression of the recently isolated VEGF gene family members (placenta growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-B, and VEGF-C) in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and bovine retinal pericytes cultured under various oxygen tensions. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the two cell types possess not only VEGF (VEGF-A) mRNA, but also VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF mRNAs. Among them, only VEGF-A mRNA was induced under hypoxia. Competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that, under normoxic conditions, the rank order of mRNA content in endothelial cells was PlGF > VEGF-B > VEGF-C > VEGF-A and that mRNA coding for PlGF was expressed at >100-fold higher levels than VEGF-A mRNA. In pericytes, the rank order was VEGF-C > VEGF-A > VEGF-B > PlGF, and ∼7-fold higher levels of VEGF-C mRNA compared with VEGF-A mRNA were noted in this cell type.

Because the nucleotide sequences of bovine VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF mRNAs were not known, we first isolated the bovine cDNA equivalents and determined their primary structures. We then analyzed the expression of these factors in endothelial cells and pericytes cultured under various oxygen tensions and quantified their mRNA content in both cell types by competitive RT-PCR.

Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in the medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 10 μg/ml heparin in a cluster dish or flask were placed in a controlled atmosphere culture chamber (Bellco, Vineland, NJ), a humidified airtight incubation apparatus with inflow and outflow valves, into which a gas mixture containing 5% CO2 and 0, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20% O2 balanced with N2 was flushed for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 liter/min. The chamber was sealed to maintain a constant gas composition and kept at 37 °C. The gas phase was renewed every 24 h, and the O2 and CO2 in the culture chambers were immediately equilibrated to the set values by the gas flushing and kept constant for at least 24 h to an accuracy of ±5% (7Nomura M.

Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from cells that had been cultured under various oxygen tensions, using the QuickPrep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then analyzed by RT-PCR using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (7Nomura M.

It is known that alternatively spliced products are generated from VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF genes (4Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar, 5Nicosia R.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 11-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were thus designed to discriminate between all the mRNA variants. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers and probes employed were as follows. The 5′- and 3′-primers and probe for human PlGF mRNA detection corresponded to nucleotides 628–647, 927–948, and 667–693 (11Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), respectively; those for human VEGF-B mRNA corresponded to nucleotides 196–215, 495–514, and 350–378 (12Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar); for human VEGF-C mRNA, nucleotides 340–360, 724–748, and 606–634 (13Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar); for bovine PlGF mRNA, nucleotides 429–448, 755–775, and 639–664; for bovine VEGF-B mRNA, nucleotides 450–471, 825–844, and 654–685; and for bovine VEGF-C mRNA, nucleotides 261–283, 587–608 and 488–520. The primers for human and bovine VEGF-A mRNA amplification were the same as described previously (7Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and corresponded to nucleotides 44–47 and 689–717 of the human cDNA (3Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). The probes used for human and bovine VEGF-A corresponded to nucleotides 176–205 and 797–827 of the respective cDNAs (3Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). The amounts of poly(A)+ RNA templates and cycle numbers for amplification were chosen in quantitative ranges where the reactions proceeded linearly, which had been determined by plotting the signal intensities as functions of the template amounts and cycle numbers; 30 ng of template and 35 cycles were chosen for amplifying human VEGF-A mRNA, 20 ng and 25 cycles for human PlGF mRNA, 30 ng and 25 cycles for human VEGF-B mRNA, 30 ng and 35 cycles for human VEGF-C mRNA, 30 ng and 25 cycles for bovine VEGF-A mRNA, 20 ng and 30 cycles for bovine PlGF mRNA, 20 ng and 30 cycles for bovine VEGF-B mRNA, and 10 ng and 25 cycles for bovine VEGF-C mRNA. Temperatures and time periods employed for melting and annealing/extension were 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s, respectively. An aliquot of each RT-PCR mixture was electrophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane, and hybridized with specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes that had been32P-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The radioactivities of the hybridized bands were measured with a BAS1000 BioImage analyzer (Fuji PhotoFilm Co. Ltd., Hamamatsu, Japan). The RT-PCR products were sequence-verified. For competitive RT-PCR (22Wang A.M. Doyle M.V. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar), each reaction should contain a known amount of a competitor RNA that undergoes amplification with the same primers as does the endogenous mRNA and should yield products distinguishable from those derived from endogenous templates on gel electrophoresis. To construct vectors from which such competitor RNAs are generated, composite primers were synthesized and used to amplify cloned bovine cDNA or human endothelial cell poly(A)+ RNA so that the resultant cDNAs would have ∼50–200-bp internal deletions at their 5′-sides. The composite primer for human and bovine VEGF-A mRNAs was made complementary to nucleotides 44–70 and 244–269 of the human cDNA, but devoid of the internal region 71–243; the primer for human PlGF mRNA corresponded to nucleotides 628–647 and 741–760; that for human VEGF-B mRNA corresponded to nucleotides 196–215 and 301–322; for human VEGF-C mRNA, to nucleotides 340–360 and 513–534; for bovine PlGF mRNA, to nucleotides 429–448 and 561–580; for bovine VEGF-B mRNA, to nucleotides 450–471 and 587–607; and for bovine VEGF-C mRNA to nucleotides 261–283 and 378–398. The resultant PCR products were ligated into a pCR2.1 vector to transform INVαF′ cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Competitor RNAs were then synthesized from purified plasmids by in vitrotranscription using a riboprobe combination system (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm after denaturation at 65 °C. Two-fold serial dilutions of competitor RNA (ranging between 10 and 10−5 amol) plus 10–60 ng of poly(A)+ RNA underwent a series of RT-PCRs using the same primer set described under “Quantitative RT-PCR” and a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit or a GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). After amplification, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green (FMC Corp. BioProducts, Rockland, ME). Signal intensities of the bands were measured with an Epilight EP-250 (Aishin Cosmos Co. Ltd., Toyota, Japan). Subconfluent cultures of endothelial cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PlGF antisense or sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% O2 and further incubated in methionine/cysteine-free Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture with or without the antisense or sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C under 5% O2. After the incubation, the conditioned media were removed, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the radioactivities of the supernatants were measured by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method (23Yonekura H. Migita H. Sakurai S. Wang H. Harada S. Abedin Md J. Yamagishi S. Yamamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the saved conditioned media containing the same radioactivities (∼1400 μl on average) were precleared with a 30-μl packed volume of protein G-Sepharose precoupled with normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. The precleared conditioned media were then immunoprecipitated with a 30-μl packed volume of protein G-Sepharose precoupled with 1 μg of goat anti-PlGF antibodies or normal goat IgG at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. We used two types of goat anti-PlGF antibodies for immunoprecipitation; one was a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant human PlGF protein, and the other was raised against the C-terminal 20-amino acid peptide of human PlGF-1. The former antibody was expected to react with both PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 because the sequence of the bacterially expressed immunogen mostly overlapped between the two isoforms. On the other hand, since the sequence of the C-terminal 20 amino acids employed to raise the latter antibody was perfectly matched with PlGF-1, but only partly identical to PlGF-2 (12 out of 20) due to heterogeneity in that very region, this antibody was expected to scarcely recognize PlGF-2 and thereby to specify PlGF-1. Coupling of antibodies or normal IgG with protein G-Sepharose was performed in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. After immunoprecipitation, the gels were washed twice with buffer A and four times with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Immunoprecipitated materials were extracted from the Sepharose beads with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min and then electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. For fluorography, gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides and their sense counterparts were synthesized and purified by two cycles of reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography at TOAGOSEI Co. (Tokyo). PlGF antisense and sense oligonucleotides corresponded to nucleotides 322–339 of human PlGF mRNA (11Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), with their sequences then being 5′-CAGCCTCATGACCGGCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGCCGGTCATGAGGCTG-3′, respectively. VEGF-A antisense and sense oligonucleotides corresponded to nucleotides 57–78 of human VEGF-A mRNA (3Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar), with their respective sequences being 5′-CCCAAGACAGCAGAAAGTTCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTTGGG-3′ (7Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Antisense effects on endothelial cell production of PlGF proteins were assessed by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins released into culture medium using the Genzyme/Techne anti-recombinant human PlGF protein antibodies as described above under “Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation.” Antisense effects on endothelial cell DNA synthesis were assessed as described previously (7Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, human microvascular endothelial cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well of a Falcon 24-well plate and placed at 37 °C for 12 h. After cell attachment, media were changed to the HuMedia-EB2 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum containing antisense or sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides, and cells were incubated for 24 h. Then, [3H]thymidine was added to a final concentration of 5 μCi/ml, and cells were further incubated for 24 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min. The resultant precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized by mixing with 200 μl of 1 n NaOH at room temperature for 20 min, followed by neutralization with the same volume of 1 n HCl.3H radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The bovine PlGF cDNA encodes a 149-amino acid protein with a 20-amino acid signal sequence (Fig.1 A). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of bovine and human cDNAs shared 74.9 and 75.2% identities, respectively. It has been reported that alternative splicing events give rise to three isoforms of human PlGF, namely PlGF-1, -2, and -3 (5Nicosia R.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 11-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Vecchio S.D. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, all the bovine cDNAs isolated corresponded to PlGF-1, which lacks a heparin-binding domain that endows the ligand with the ability to adsorb the extracellular matrix (24Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Vecchio S.D. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). The bovine VEGF-B cDNA encodes a 188-amino acid protein with a 21-amino acid signal sequence (Fig. 1 B). The mature VEGF-B protein of 167 amino acids had three basic amino acid clusters in its carboxyl-terminal region that may function as heparin-binding sites (Fig. 1 B). Another isoform (VEGF-B186) has been reported to occur in human also by alternative splicing (25Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Four out of the five cDNA clones isolated from the heart library corresponded to VEGF-B167, and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the bovine and human VEGF-B167 cDNAs shared 93.7 and 93.6% identities, respectively. The remaining one clone encoded VEGF-B186, which lacks putative heparin-binding sites. The bovine VEGF-C cDNA encodes a 420-amino acid protein with a 20-amino acid signal sequence (Fig. 1 C). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of bovine and human cDNAs shared 86.9 and 88.1% identities, respectively. As shown in Fig.2, quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that microvascular endothelial cells possess not only VEGF-A mRNA, but also VEGF-B, VEGF-C and PlGF mRNAs. RT-PCR with VEGF-A primers gave signals at 319 and 420 bp, which corresponded to VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165 mRNAs, respectively. The levels of both VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165 mRNAs significantly increased as the O2 concentration dropped to 2.5% (∼3–4-fold) and further to 0% (∼10-fold) (Fig. 2 A). PlGF primers yielded 321- and 384-bp products, which corresponded to PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 2 B). This indicated that microvascular endothelial cells could generate both the soluble and heparin-binding forms of PlGF. VEGF-B primers gave signals at 395 and 496 bp, which corresponded to VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186 mRNAs, respectively; the signal intensity of the latter was consistently stronger than that of the former regardless of the O2 tensions (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the soluble form of VEGF-B is predominant in microvascular endothelial cells. With VEGF-C primers, only a single band was noted at 409 bp (Fig. 2 C). The levels of mRNAs for VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF were not significantly changed in endothelial cells by exposure to hypoxia or anoxia (Fig. 2, B–D), in contrast with that of VEGF-A mRNA (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 3, quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence in bovine retinal pericytes of not only VEGF-A mRNA, but also VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF mRNAs, as in endothelial cells. RT-PCR with VEGF-A primers gave signals at 470 and 602 bp, which corresponded to VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165 mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The levels of both mRNA species increased significantly as the atmospheric O2 concentration decreased to 0% (∼8-fold) (Fig. 3 A). PlGF primers yielded 347- and 410-bp products, which corresponded to PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 3 B). VEGF-B primers gave VEGF-B167- and VEGF-B186-corresponding signals at 395 and 496 bp, respectively (Fig. 3 C). In contrast with the case in endothelial cells, the former species was more prominent than the latter in pericytes (Fig. 3 C). This indicated that the heparin-binding form of VEGF-B predominated in pericytes. With VEGF-C primers, a single band was noted at 348 bp (Fig. 3 D), which exactly corresponded to the bovine mRNA. Under hypoxia, the PlGF, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C mRNA levels were essentially unchanged (Fig. 3, B–D). Since the RT-PCR analyses revealed that both endothelial cells and per"

We previously demonstrated that Stx induced apoptosis in human renal tubular cell line ACHN cells (Taguchi, T., Uchida, H., Kiyokawa, N., Mori, T., Sato, N., Horie, H., Takeda, T and Fujimoto, J. (1998)Kidney Int. 53, 1681–1688). To study the early signal transduction after Stx addition, Gb3-enriched microdomains were prepared from ACHN cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of Triton X-100 lysate as buoyant, detergent-insoluble microdomains (DIM). Gb3 was only recovered in DIM and was associated with Src family kinase Yes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of proteins in the DIM fraction increased by 10 min and returned to the resting level by 30 min after the addition of Stx. Since the kinase activity of Yes changed with the same kinetics, Yes was thought to be responsible for the hyperphosphorylation observed in DIM proteins. Unexpectedly, however, all of the Yes kinase activity was obtained in the high density, detergent-soluble fraction. Yes was assumed to be activated and show increased Triton X-100 solubility in the early phase of retrograde endocytosis of Stx-Gb3 complex. Since Yes activation by the Stx addition was suppressed by filipin pretreatment, Gb3-enriched microdomains containing cholesterol were deeply involved in Stx signal transduction.

Stx consists of an A subunit of 32 kDa associated with five B subunits of 7.5 kDa each. The A subunits act to remove the adenine base at position 4324 of 28 S rRNA and are responsible for inactivation of protein synthesis and toxicity (2Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawara T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The A subunits lacking B subunits, however, do not show any toxicity because of their inability to bind to the cell surface receptor. The B subunits bind specifically to cell surface glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptors-Gb3, 2Glycosphingolipids are abbreviated according to the recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (26Iwabuchi K.

Once Stx is internalized, protein synthesis is suppressed, leading to cell death. Cell death is widely known to take place through two distinctive processes, necrosis or apoptosis. In contradiction to Williams's report (4Williams J.M. Boyd B. Nutrikka A. Lingwood C.A. Barnet-Foster D.E. Milford D.V. Taylor C.M. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 105: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a number of recent studies have clearly demonstrated that Stx induces apoptosis in several different cell types, including Burkitt's lymphoma cells (5Mangeney M.

Especially, the later two studies indicate the importance of apoptotic cell death as one mechanism of damage to renal epithelium in the pathogenesis of HUS. Although the B subunit has no inhibitory effect on protein synthesis, a series of studies indicates that it alone participate to transduce cell signaling and can induce apoptosis in some instances such as Burkitt's lymphoma (5Mangeney M.

In recent years, our knowledge of the characteristics and cellular function of low density, detergent-insoluble microdomains (DIM) rich in GSL, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, and lipid-modified protein, namely caveolae or raft, has considerably increased. Originally, caveolae were thought to function only in receptor-mediated potocytosis (10Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar); however, speculation into their biological role has since expanded to include such diverse functions as endocytosis independent of the coated pit pathway, sorting and internalization of GPI-anchored proteins, and signal transduction. Many studies have examined the receptor molecules and the signal transducers in DIM. Some gangliosides in DIM were reported to be associated with transducer molecules that are activated by stimulation of ganglioside (11Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol.

By analogy to this model, the Stx receptor Gb3 is expected to reside in DIM and to be involved in signal transduction. Here we show that Gb3 is only found in DIM and is associated with the Src family tyrosine kinase Yes. We further demonstrate that Stx binding to Gb3 causes temporal activation of Yes, suggesting that DIM is deeply involved in Gb3-mediated signal transduction. The activation-related topology of Yes and the recruitment of Yes after Stx addition are discussed. The rat IgM anti-Gb3 mAb 38.13 was purchased from Coulter/Immunotec, Inc. (Westbrook, MA). The mouse IgM anti-Gb3 mAb 1A4 was a generous gift from Dr. Hakomori of the University of Washington (Seattle, WA). Anti-Yes mAb, anti-Lyn mAb, and rabbit anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories Inc. (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CD24 mAb OKB2 was purchased from Ortho Diagnostic System Inc. (Raritan, NJ). Antibodies for Stx-1 used were 13C4 mAb from ATCC CRL 1794 (13Strockbine N.A. Marques L.R. Holmes R.K. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 695-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal Ab (14Noda M. Yutsudo T. Nakabayashi N. Hirayama T. Takeda Y. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gb3 from bovine erythrocytes and filipin complex were purchased from Sigma. Stx-1 was prepared as described previously (14Noda M. Yutsudo T. Nakabayashi N. Hirayama T. Takeda Y. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The human renal tubular derived ACHN cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1611) and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Inc). Cell surface proteins were labeled with sulfo-succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) according to the method of Lisanti (15Lisanti M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the binding assay of Stx, 5 × 106 cells were incubated with Stx-1 at 100 ng/ml in the culture medium on ice for 30 min. DIM were prepared as described by Sargiacomo et al. (16Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, cells in a 15-cm culture plate were lysed and homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in 1.5 ml of PIPES-buffered saline (25 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and aprotinin (10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml). Cell extracts were adjusted to 40% sucrose in PIPES-buffered saline. A linear gradient (5–30% sucrose in PIPES-buffered saline) was formed above the lysate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor. A light scattering band was recovered as DIM. Detergent-free purification of DIM under hypertonic conditions (0.5 mNa2CO3, pH 11) (17Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) was also performed. According to Iwabuchi's description (12Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the gradient fractions were dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. The residues were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated on a high performance thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v/v). DIM prepared from biotinylated cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and suspended in the same buffer, or further solubilized in Triton X-100/HTG lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside (HTG, Dojin Chem. Co., Kumamoto, Japan), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and aprotinin), followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. DIM or its lysate thus obtained were mixed with protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) bound to anti-CD77 mAb. After the agarose beads were thoroughly washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Confluent cultures of cells treated with Stx-1 (400 pg/ml) at 37 °C were solubilized in 1 ml of Triton X-100/HTG lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Yes antibody and precipitated with protein A-agarose. Half of the immunoprecipitates were suspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mmMnCl2) containing 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1.18 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide gel. The kinase activity to incorporate [γ-32P]ATP to enolase or Yes was measured by BAS 2000. The amount of Yes applied for kinase assay was estimated by Western blotting. The kinase assay was also done on Yes immunoprecipitated from both DIM lysate and DS. DIM were prepared from cells pretreated with filipin (0.08–10 μg/ml) in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 30 min, and the amounts of Yes and caveolin in the DIM were analyzed by Western blotting. Yes activities of those cells were assayed at 10 min after the Stx addition. Most cellular proteins were recovered in fractions 10–12 (Fig. 1 a). Many parts of biotinylated proteins were liberated with 1% Triton X-100 from plasma membrane and found in fractions 10–12 as high density DS (Fig.1 b). However, some were not solubilized from plasma membrane and thus were recovered in buoyant, low density fractions, fractions 5–7, as DIM. A total of 6.29 mg and 5.93 μg of protein was recovered from confluent ACHN cells (∼1 × 107) in a 15-cm plate in DS and DIM, respectively. In contrast, about 30–50% of the Src family tyrosine kinase, Yes (Fig. 1 c) and Lyn (Fig.1 d) and all GPI-anchored CD24 protein, a marker of distal tubules in kidney (Fig. 1 e) were found in DIM. Caveolin, a structural protein rich in caveolae, separated similarly to the Src family tyrosine kinases and was found in both DIM and DS (Fig.1 f). Stx bound to ACHN cells was certainly detected in DIM (Fig. 1 g). Detergent-free preparation under hypertonic conditions gave similar distribution pattern except that a little more protein was recovered in DIM than under detergent-containing conditions (data not shown). Most of lactosylceramide, Gb3, and Gb4 were found in DIM (Fig. 2 a). Immunostaining with 1A4 confirmed that Gb3 was only localized in DIM (Fig. 2 b). Sphingomyelin and cholesterol were also detected only in DIM (Fig. 2 c). These results indicate that DIM thus obtained is a typical low density, glycolipid-enriched microdomain distinct from other plasma membrane. In anti-Gb3 mAb 38.13 immunoprecipitates from DIM, a biotinylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27.2 kDa was always found (Fig. 3 a,lane 1, arrow). In contrast to the nonspecific binding proteins that migrate around 62 and 50 kDa, this 27.2-kDa protein band was not detected in normal rat IgM immunoprecipitates (lane 2). When this blot was reprobed with anti-Yes mAb or anti-caveolin antibody, Yes was clearly detected (Fig. 3 b, upper panel), but caveolin was not identified (Fig. 3 b, lower panel). Although another Src-family kinase Lyn was found in DIM, Lyn was not detected in mAb 38.13 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation with another anti-Gb3 mAb, 1A4, gave similar results (data not shown). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of DIM protein is affected by Stx, DIM was prepared from cells cultured in the presence of Stx for various times, and the tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with 4G10 mAb. The amount of protein recovered in DIM was not changed by Stx treatment (5.93 ± 0.23 μg/1 × 107 cells,n = 5). DIM prepared in hypertonic buffer was examined by immunoblotting, because hypertonic buffer was found to retain more substrate proteins for tyrosine kinase than 1% Triton X-100 buffer. Although several proteins were spontaneously tyrosine-phosphorylated without Stx treatment, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues increased to a maximum at 10 min after Stx addition and then decreased to resting level at 60 min (Fig. 4 a). Thus, we concluded that Stx specifically stimulates tyrosine kinases, which temporally induce hyperphosphorylation of DIM proteins. The amount of Yes protein present in DIM (Fig. 4 b) as well as associated with Gb3 (Fig. 4 c) increased to a maximum level at 10 min after the Stx addition and then decreased. This indicates that Stx stimulation recruited Yes into the DIM, resulting in an increase in Yes association with Gb3. One may argue whether Stx binding to Gb3 interferes with the formation of an immune complex between Gb3 and anti-Gb3 mAb; however, flow cytometric analysis showed that Stx-bound ACHN cells were stained by 1A4 with the same mean fluorescence intensity as unbound cells (data not shown). This means that anti-Gb3 mAb can react with Gb3 to which Stx has already bound. To confirm that Yes activity is mediated by Stx signal transduction, Yes was partially purified by immunoprecipitation from whole cell lysate of Stx-treated cells, and the enzyme kinetics of the Yes protein was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 a, there is no significant variation in immunoprecipitated Yes protein in each preparation. Stx treatment resulted in a 2- fold increase in Yes activity on enolase between 3 and 10 min, which returned to the resting level at 30–60 min (Fig. 5, b (left) andc (closed circle)). Interestingly, autophosphorylation of Yes also occurred in a similar time course fashion following Stx treatment (Fig. 5, b (left) and c (closed triangle)). On the other hand, Yes activity of the untreated cells almost remained at the resting level (Fig. 5, b (right) and c(open symbols). Stx solution preadsorbed with immobilized anti-Stx-1 mAb 13C4, which inhibits Stx binding to Gb3 on the cell surface, did not show this augmentation, whereas one preadsorbed with irrelevant mAb showed the augmentation similar to unadsorbed Stx (data not shown), indicating that Stx specifically induced Yes kinase activation. Since Gb3, to which Stx binds, was localized in DIM and since Yes was associated with Gb3, we predicted the increase in Yes activity shown above occurring in DIM. However, we failed to detect any increase in Yes activity in the DIM fraction (Fig.6). In contrast, Yes kinase activity in DS showed the same kinetics as that of whole cell lysate, indicating that the activated Yes was mostly located in the DS. That Yes activity in DIM was lost or inactivated in the experimental procedure was unlikely, because Yes in DS prepared simultaneously exhibited enough activity as shown above. Based on all of these results, we hypothesized that Yes becomes detergent-soluble, in other words loosely anchored to DIM, when it is activated by Stx stimulation through Gb3. Filipin is known to disrupt the structure and function of DIM by binding to cholesterol a constituent of DIM (18Park H. Go Y.-M. St. John P.L. Maland M.C. Lisanti M.P. Abrahamson D.R. Jo Hanjoong J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32304-32311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with filipin dose-dependently reduced the amount of Yes protein, but not caveolin, recovered in DIM (Fig.7 a). Furthermore, Yes activation by Stx binding was dramatically suppressed in filipin-treated cells without loss of cell viability (Fig.7 b). This inhibitory effect of filipin further supports the idea that cholesterol-enriched DIM is indeed involved in Stx-mediating signal transduction. In the present study, we demonstrated that Gb3 associates with Yes in DIM on the cell surface of human renal tubular epithelium-derived cells and that Stx binding to Gb3 temporarily causes activation of Yes. Specific interactions between GSL and receptor molecules such as GM3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (19Hanai N. Nores G.A. MacLeod C. Torres-Mendez C.R. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GM1 and Trk, a high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (20Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyada T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), suggest that GSL participates in signal transduction by interacting with membrane receptor molecules. In contrast, Gb3 is itself a receptor for Stx. Lingwood's group (21Khine A.A. Firtel M. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Ghislain J. Lingwood C.A. Fish E.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3655-3663PubMed Google Scholar) reported the role of Gb3 as a signal transducer in CD19 and interferon-α2. Although some glycolipids are also known to be receptors for bacteria toxins (23Karlsson K.A. Angstrom J. Bergstrom J. Lanne B. APMIS Suppl. 1992; 27: 71-83PubMed Google Scholar), they are not known to stimulate Src family kinases like Gb3 as shown in this study. This is the first example that shows a link between Yes and the GSL Gb3 localized in DIM in a special type of cells. Src family members are anchored to the plasma membrane via myristylation and/or palmitoylation at the N-terminal region, and clusters of basic residues near the anchoring site promote membrane binding (24Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Since Gb3 is only in the external leaflet of the membrane bilayer, there can be other membrane-spanning molecules that link Yes and Gb3. The biotinylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27.2 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Gb3 mAb is a possible candidate that ligates Gb3 with Yes in ACHN cells. The precise characterization of this 27.2-kDa protein is now under way. While the total amount of Yes per cell did not change during the course of the process, the amount of Yes in DIM increased after Stx treatment. Thus, we speculate, as a consequence of Stx stimulation, the entry of inactive Yes, previously present in DS, into DIM, resulting in the association with Gb3. Stx was reported to be internalized after binding to Gb3 into the Golgi apparatus via retrograde endocytosis as a Stx-Gb3 complex in Vero cells (25Schapiro F.B. Lingwood C. Furuya W. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C319-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this is also the case in ACHN, Yes is supposed to move into the intracellular space with the Stx-Gb3 complex. However, we confirmed that all Yes protein in ACHN cells was recovered in membrane fractions and was completely solubilized with detergent containing both 60 mm HTG and 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown), suggesting that Yes remains anchored to the membrane throughout the process of Stx stimulation. Interestingly, we observed that the entire Yes kinase activity was detected not in DIM but in DS. This indicates the increased solubility of active Yes in Triton X-100. Thus, it is probable that, once bound to Gb3, inactive Yes may become active either by dephosphorylation with protein phosphatase or by another mechanism, resulting in the increased solubility in Triton X-100, i.e. recovered in DS, and may be easily liberated from DIM. Since activation of Src family kinases does not affect the sequence of motif anchoring to membrane, the conformational change caused by the activation may be responsible for being loosely anchored to plasma membrane. This may explain why Yes in DIM being activated with Stx was easily solubilized in Triton X-100 and did not move into the intracellular space with the Stx-Gb3 complex. Iwabuchi et al. (26Iwabuchi K. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33766-33773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) separated the detergent-insoluble, GM3-enriched, cholesterol-free microdomains involved in cell adhesion of B16 melanoma cells from the other microdomains containing caveolin and termed them the “glycosignaling domain.” They showed that adhesion of B16 cells to Gg3 was not affected by filipin treatment. Since disruption of DIM integrity of ACHN cells with filipin dramatically suppressed the Yes activation with Stx, Gb3-enriched microdomains containing cholesterol may collectively act in transducing Stx signal as one mass of glycosignaling domain. It is not clear yet that activation of Yes by Stx binding to Gb3 in ACHN cells proceeds to the final process of cell death. A precise study on the downstream events following Stx-mediated activation of Yes is particularly important not only to understand the role of Gb3 in cellular function but also to develop a therapeutic approach to prevent Stx-mediated renal dysfunction in HUS.

We found that Axin also serves as a scaffold protein for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and further determined the structural requirement for this activation. Overexpression of Axin in 293T cells leads to differential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, with robust induction for c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, moderate induction for p38, and negligible induction for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Axin forms a complex with MEKK1 through a novel domain that we term MEKK1-interacting domain. MKK4 and MKK7, which act downstream of MEKK1, are also involved in Axin-mediated JNK activation. Domains essential in Wnt signaling, i.e.binding sites for adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and β-catenin, are not required for JNK activation, suggesting distinct domain utilization between the Wnt pathway and JNK signal transduction. Dimerization/oligomerization of Axin through its C terminus is required for JNK activation, although MEKK1 is capable of binding C terminus-deleted monomeric Axin. Furthermore, Axin without the MEKK1-interacting domain has a dominant-negative effect on JNK activation by wild-type Axin.

The mechanism by which Axin negatively regulates the Wnt signal transduction pathway for axis formation is as yet unclear. It was recently demonstrated that Axin binds directly to adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),1 glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and β-catenin and acts as a scaffold upon which these proteins assemble to coordinate the regulation of β-catenin levels for Wnt signaling (10Hart M.J. de los Santos R.

In the absence of Wnt signals, Axin links these components together and enables the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β, leading to the degradation of β-catenin. In response to Wnt signals, GSK-3β activity is inhibited such that β-catenin levels become elevated. β-catenin is then translocated into the nucleus, where it binds to the T-cell factor or lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors (16Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Axin is therefore a multifunctional protein contributing to many aspects of biology ranging from the regulation of gene transcription and cell growth control to morphogenesis. Although Axin is a member of the large family of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (19Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

It does not bind to Gα subunits and is therefore unlikely to serve as a GTPase-activating protein. 2C. Chen, and S.-C. Lin, unpublished observations. 2C. Chen, and S.-C.

We suspected that Axin may play a more general role in addition to the regulation of axis formation, perhaps in cell signaling pathways.

We therefore investigated whether the scaffold protein Axin could regulate MAPK activities. Here we show that overexpression of Axin in human embryonic kidney 293T cells leads to differential activation of MAPK, with robust induction for c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), moderate induction for p38, and very little induction for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Two novel functional regions of Axin have been identified that are critical for JNK activation and completely distinct from domains required for Wnt signaling. We demonstrate that Axin forms a complex with MEKK1 and provide evidence that the dimerization/oligomerization of Axin is required for JNK activation. Consistent with a dual function of Dishevelled in the Wnt pathway and JNK-mediated tissue polarity signaling pathway, our studies reveal that Axin may also assume a dual role in cells through its activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway. The full-length Axin cDNA was obtained by screening a mouse pituitary λgt11 cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction-generated 1-kilobase 5′-coding fragment as probe, tagged with either HA or Myc at the N terminus, and cloned into the ClaI and BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. A series of different constructs of Axin (see Figs. 3 and 4) were created using convenient restriction enzyme sites. Briefly, to construct mutants N1 (198–832), N2 (400–832), and N3 (509–832), the N terminus of wild-type Axin was deleted at theNcoI, XbaI, and SpeI sites, respectively, and fused in-frame to HA or Myc tag. To construct mutants C1(1–600), C2 (1–746), C3 (1–398), and C4 (1–230), the C terminus of wild-type Axin was deleted at SpeI, ApalI,XbaI, and PstI, respectively. For mutant M1 (1–353/509–832), the 1.0-kilobase N-terminal fragment of wild-type Axin obtained by BamHI digestion was fused in-frame to the polymerase chain reaction-generated C-terminal fragment encoding Axin aa 509–832. To construct mutant M2 (1–209/353–832), wild-type Axin was digested internally at AflII and BamHI sites, blunted with Klenow fragment, and religated in-frame. To construct mutant M3 (198–353/509–832), the N-terminal fragment of mutant N1 obtained by BamHI digestion was used to replace that of mutant M1 to generate an in-frame M3. To construct mutant M4 (198–398), the region between NcoI and XbaI of wild-type Axin was released, fused in-frame with Myc tag at the N terminus, blunted with Klenow fragment, and ligated to pCMV5 to generate stop codon at the C terminus.

Schematic representation indicates the mutants of the N-terminal deletions (N1–N3), the C-terminal deletions (C2–C4), and the internal deletions (M3 and M4) of Axin used in transient transfection of 293T cells for immunoprecipitation assay. The RGS homologous domain, binding sites for GSK-3β and β-catenin, and Dishevelled (Dsh) homologous domain are indicated. The numbers at the left indicate the N and C termini, and dotted lines represent deletions. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of each Myc-tagged Axin construct together with 2 μg of HA-MEKK1-C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-MEKK1 for MEKK1-C or with anti-Myc for Axin proteins. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting separately using anti-Myc for Axin and anti-HA for MEKK1-C. The abilities of the Axin proteins to interact with MEKK1 are summarized as + for positive interaction and − for no interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using SuperfectTM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 4 μg with the empty vector pCMV5 as necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h posttransfection and lysed in a lysis buffer (29Zhang Y. Neo S.Y.

FLAG-tagged JNK1, FLAG-tagged p38, and FLAG-tagged ERK2 were immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma), and their kinase activities were determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–79), 1 μg of GST-activating transcription factor-2 (1–109), and 5 μg of myelin basic protein as substrates, respectively (29Zhang Y.

Fold activation of the kinases was determined by an imaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics model 425E) and normalized to their expression levels. Data are expressed as fold kinase activation compared with vector-transfected cells, with the values representing the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Transiently transfected 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Myc-tagged Axin proteins or HA-tagged MEKK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (29Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Yaw L.P. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with either anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22), anti-HA, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. To test whether Axin could activate MAPK, we cotransfected HA-tagged Axin separately with FLAG-ERK2, FLAG-JNK1, or FLAG-p38 into 293T cells (Fig.1 a). Axin robustly activated JNK (∼10-fold), as did TRAF2, a well known activator of JNK (30Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Expression of a C-terminal truncated Axin (mutant C1) significantly diminished the JNK activation to ∼2-fold. Axin activated p38 to a lesser extent (∼3-fold) compared with sorbitol-stimulated p38 induction (∼10-fold); the mutant C1 effected much lower p38 activity (∼1.2-fold). In contrast, Axin had virtually no effect on ERK activity (∼1.1-fold induction), which was highly activated (∼10-fold) in a control experiment in which cells were exposed to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The MAPK cascade consists of three conserved components: a family of serine/threonine kinases called MAPK kinase kinase/MEKK, which activate MAPK kinase/MEK. MAPK kinase/MEK in turn activate MAPK by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (21Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 22Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 23Garrington T.P.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). It has been shown that overexpression of MAPK kinase kinase, such as MEKK1 (31Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), ASK1 (32Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazo K.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar), induces the activation of the JNK cascade. To explore whether these MAPK kinase kinases play a part in the induction of JNK by Axin, 293T cells were separately cotransfected with Axin, FLAG-JNK1, and wild-type HA-MEKK1, HA-ASK1, HA-TAK1, or their respective kinase-inactive mutants (Fig. 1 b). Immunokinase assays showed that wild-type HA-MEKK1, HA-ASK1, and HA-TAK1 elevated the basal levels of JNK activity, as expected. Dominant-negative HA-ASK1-K709M and HA-TAK1-K63W did not appear to alter JNK activation mediated by Axin. In contrast, the ATP binding-deficient, dominant-negative HA-MEKK1-K1255M reduced Axin activation of JNK by 3-fold, suggesting that MEKK1 acts in the same signaling pathway in Axin-mediated activation of JNK. This is consistent with the observation that coexpression of Axin with HA-MEKK1 did not cause an additive effect on JNK activation compared with JNK induction by expression of HA-MEKK1 alone (Fig. 1 b). Because both MKK4 and MKK7 are known to phosphorylate and activate JNK (28Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 35Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar), we determined whether JNK activation by Axin is mediated through MKK4 and MKK7 (Fig.1 c). In agreement with the common observation that in the absence of an upstream stimulus wild-type MKK4 displays a relatively weak activation of JNK, overexpression of HA-MKK4 did not increase basal activity of JNK (Fig. 1 c). However, when HA-MKK4 was coexpressed with Axin, JNK activation was more pronounced than that with expression of Axin alone, suggesting MKK4 activation by Axin. Consistently, the dominant-negative HA-MKK4-DN diminished Axin-mediated JNK activation. Overexpression of wild-type HA-MKK7 alone stimulated JNK activity, whereas coexpression with Axin further elevated JNK activity. Kinase-inactive HA-MKK7-DN partially inhibited JNK activation, despite the slightly elevated basal JNK activity. These results implicate both MKK4 and MKK7 in the Axin-mediated JNK activation, in agreement with the fact that these MAPK kinases act downstream of MEKK1 (21Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 22Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 23Garrington T.P.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). We further examined the structural requirements of MEKK1 for Axin-mediated JNK activation. It has been shown that the regulation of MEKK1 activity by proteins such as 14-3-3 (36Fanger G.R. Widmann C. Porter A.C. Sather S. Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3476-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Grb2 (37Pomerance M. Multon M.-C. Parker F. Venot C. Blondeau J.-P. Tocque B. Schweighoffer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24301-24304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is through interaction with the N-terminal region of MEKK1. To investigate whether the N terminus of MEKK1 plays a role in Axin-mediated JNK activation, we cotransfected Axin with constructs expressing either the 150-kDa (HA-MEKK1-N3.1) or the 80-kDa (HA-MEKK1-N1.9) N-terminal fragment of MEKK1 (38Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to the observation that Grb2-MEKK1-mediated JNK activation by EGF is inhibited by the N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK1 (37Pomerance M. Multon M.-C. Parker F. Venot C. Blondeau J.-P. Tocque B. Schweighoffer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24301-24304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we did not see a similar inhibitory effect of HA-MEKK1-N3.1 or HA-MEKK1-N1.9 on Axin-mediated JNK activation (Fig.2 a). On the contrary, we observed that the C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK1, which is mutated at its ATP-binding site (HA-MEKK1-C-K1255M), blocked Axin-induced JNK activity (Fig. 2 a) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 b). These results indicate that the kinase domain of MEKK1 may directly mediate Axin activation of JNK, in which case it should bind to Axin. To test this, we performed immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2 c) and found that Myc-tagged Axin was coprecipitated with the C-terminal kinase fragment HA-MEKK1-C, as well as the full-length HA-MEKK1, but not with the N-terminal fragments HA-MEKK1-N3.1 or HA-MEKK1-N1.9. Conversely, only HA-MEKK1-C and full-length HA-MEKK1 were coprecipitated with Myc-Axin (Fig.2 c). No physical interaction between Axin and HA-ASK1 or HA-TAK1 was detected by similar immunoprecipitation assays in transfected 293T cells (data not shown). We conclude that Axin forms a complex with the C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK1 to bring about an induction in JNK activity. The surprising finding that Axin can activate JNK activity (Fig. 1 a) prompted us to examine which region(s) on the Axin protein is involved in JNK activation. Axin is known to possess multiple functional domains: an RGS homologous domain, which binds APC; distinct binding sites for GSK-3β and β-catenin; and a Dishevelled homologous (DIX) domain (1Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). We generated a series of deletion mutants of HA-tagged Axin (Fig. 3,top panel) and assayed their abilities to activate JNK (Fig.3, bottom panels). Removal of the N-terminal region aa 1–197, which encompass the RGS homologous domain for APC binding (mutant N1), did not affect Axin-induced JNK activity. Similarly, deletion of aa 354–508, which removes the binding sites for GSK-3β and β-catenin (mutant M1), had no deleterious effect on JNK activation. On the other hand, C-terminal deletion mutants C1 and C2, in which the binding sites for APC, GSK-3β, and β-catenin were retained, lost their ability to activate JNK. These results indicate that Axin activation of JNK does not require the RGS homologous domain, GSK-3β, or β-catenin binding sites and that the domains on Axin responsible for Wnt signaling are distinct from those involved in JNK activation. Indeed, removal of the region of aa 210–352 (mutant M2) completely abolished JNK activation, whereas fusion of the same region with the C-terminal region aa 509–832 (mutant M3) fully restored JNK activation. Therefore, activation of JNK by Axin requires the region flanked by the RGS homologous domain and GSK-3β binding domain, and the C terminus (see below). To investigate which region(s) of Axin interacts with MEKK1, various deletion mutants of Myc-tagged Axin were separately coexpressed with HA-MEKK1-C in 293T cells (Fig. 4). The N-terminal deletion mutant N1 (aa 198–832), but not N2 (aa 400–832) or N3 (aa 509–832), was coprecipitated with HA-MEKK1-C. The C-terminal deletion mutants C2 (aa 1–746) and C3 (aa 1–398), but not C4 (aa 1–230), were coprecipitated with HA-MEKK1-C. Clearly, the region aa 217–352 of Axin is necessary for it to complex with MEKK1. This is in agreement with the ability of mutants M4 (aa 198–398) and M3 (aa 198–353/509–832) to coprecipitate with HA-MEKK1-C (Fig. 4), whereas mutant M2 (aa 1–209/353–832) did not coprecipitate with HA-MEKK1-C (Fig. 5 b). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies also showed a similar pattern (Figs. 4and 5 b). The requirement of aa 217–352 on Axin to complex MEKK1 for the induction of JNK activity is consistent with the above observation that mutants N2 and M2 deleted in this region were incapable of activating JNK (Fig. 3). It has recently been shown that the C terminus of Axin can bind to itself (39Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggesting that Axin may form dimers or multimers for its function. In this study, we found that the C-terminal self-binding domain is important for JNK activation (Fig. 3). We further investigated whether dimerization/oligomerization of Axin is a prerequisite for its binding to MEKK1, or whether MEKK1 binding is required for Axin oligomerization. To test these possibilities, wild-type Axin, mutant M2 (without the MEKK1-binding site), mutant C1 (without the C-terminal self-binding domain), and MEKK1-C were transfected in different combinations (Fig. 5, a–c). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using differently tagged Axin constructs showed that full-length Axin (Fig. 5 a, i) or mutant M2 (Fig. 5 a, ii) could form a complex with itself, whereas mutant C1 (Fig. 5 a, iii) lost the ability to bind to itself. Whereas the mutant M2 alone did not complex with MEKK1-C (Fig.5 b), in the presence of wild-type Axin, mutant M2 was detected in the MEKK1-C immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5 c), indicating that mutant M2 is capable of complexing with the wild-type Axin. Interestingly, mutants C1 and C2, without the extreme C-terminal end (which includes the DIX domain), were fully capable of binding to MEKK1-C (Fig. 4 and data not shown), but they lost their ability to activate JNK (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Axin oligomerization is required for JNK activation through MEKK1. One would then expect Axin without the MEKK1-binding domain to display a dominant-negative effect when coexpressed with wild-type Axin. Indeed, the Axin mutant M2 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the Axin-activated JNK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 d). We have explored the possibility that the scaffold protein Axin, which plays a central role in axis formation and perhaps in tumorigenesis (40Pennisi E. Science. 1998; 281: 1438-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) also exerts a function in the MAPK pathway. It is demonstrated here that Axin overexpression preferentially activates JNK. We have delineated the Axin-mediated JNK activation pathway,"

A search for ligands for these two domains in mouse tissues led to the identification of several cell subpopulations able to bind a chimeric protein containing the CR domain of the murine form of the receptor fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (CR-Fc) (10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These CR-Fc+ cells included marginal zone metallophilic Mø (MZMMø) and subcapsular sinus Mø in spleen and lymph nodes (LN) of naive animals and, probably, follicular dendritic cells in immunized animals. During the course of an immune response CR-Fc+ cells with dendritic morphology appeared to migrate in draining LN through the follicles and interfollicular areas. Based on these data, an antigen transport pathway (highlighted by CR-Fc labeling) and an alternative role for the MR in antigen uptake and presentation were proposed (5Linehan S.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Stahl P.D. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S.

A first step toward the interpretation of those results is the identification of the molecules that interact with CR-Fc. Preliminary data indicated the presence of several ligands in spleen and LN lysates with apparent molecular mass ranging from 360 to 100 kDa (10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This study presents the identification of two of these ligands as sialoadhesin (Sn), an Mø-restricted membrane molecule (12Crocker P.R. Mucklow S. Bouckson V. McWilliam A. Willis A.C. Gordon S.

Biochemical characterization of these interactions showed that CR-Fc binding to both molecules is sugar-dependent. These results indicate that the CR domain of the MR itself has lectin-like activity and that the different ligands recognized in tissue lysates could be different proteins expressed by CR-Fc+ cells sharing the same sugar structure. These findings provide additional evidence for the important role that tissue-specific post-translational modifications play in determining the function of a molecule and raise the possibility that Sn or CD45 may display different binding properties in different cells.

The procedure used was based on the method described by Williams and Barclay (24Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., Oxford1986Google Scholar). Spleens from different mouse strains (100 g) were homogenized using a Polytron in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5% (v/v) Tween 40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaN3, 2 mm EDTA and the following protease inhibitors: 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μm leupeptin. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C using a 60.Ti rotor. The membrane pellet was washed twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaN3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors and solubilized with stirring in 2 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NaN3, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a 60.Ti rotor and precleared using human IgG (Sigma) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (10 ml, 2 mg/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared as described elsewhere (25Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development. 131. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-127Google Scholar). The lysate was then applied twice to a CR-Fc-protein A-Sepharose column (10 ml, 2 mg/ml). After extensive washing in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl (450 ml), bound material was eluted using 0.5% (v/v) diethylamine in 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 into tubes containing 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7 (1/10 of final volume). 2-ml fractions were collected and 10-μl aliquots were tested for CR-Fc binding activity by dot blot. Tissue and cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NaN3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors, clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge to remove nuclei and at 55,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TC100 centrifuge to remove insoluble material. Prior to immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared using protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After preclearance, lysates were incubated with 3D6-Sepharose or YBM42.2.2-Sepharose (5 mg Ab/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), prepared as described (24Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., Oxford1986Google Scholar). Beads were washed in lysis buffer or in washing buffers A, B, and C (A: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; B: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; C: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% (w/v) SDS), and bound material was eluted with 0.5% (v/v) diethylamine in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 or (w/v) octyl glucopyranoside, as described previously, or by boiling in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Analysis of CR-Fc binding and Sn and CD45 detection were performed following standard Western blot protocols. Briefly, samples (total tissue lysates or immunoprecipitated material) were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled, electrophoresed in a 5 or 6% SDS-PAGE, as indicated, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond C plus; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with CR-Fc (10 μg/ml) or rat IgG (5 μg/ml) in blocking buffer. Binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 mouse anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in the case of Fc chimeric proteins or, in the case of rat IgG, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Chemicon, Harrow, UK) or F(ab′)2 mouse anti-rat IgG (Jackson Laboratories) and a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To avoid recognition by the secondary Abs of CR-Fc or rat mAb released from the Sepharose, primary reagent conjugated to digoxigenin or a rabbit polyclonal raised against domain 1 of Sn were used. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin F(ab′)2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or F(ab′)2 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories) was then used as secondary reagents. Digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd., Abingdon, UK) was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Spleen lysate was prepared as described above but using two additional protease inhibitors as follows: aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml) and precleared using rat IgG (Sigma) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (10 ml, 5 mg Ab/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared as described (24Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., Oxford1986Google Scholar). Sn was purified using SER-4-Sepharose (5 ml, 10 mg/ml) and CD45 using YBM42.2.2-Sepharose (10 ml, 5 mg Ab/ml). Columns were washed using lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors and eluted using 0.5% (v/v) diethylamine in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described previously. N-Glycans were released from purified Sn by in situ digestion with peptideN-glycosidase F (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd.) as described (26Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified Sn was electrophoresed under reducing conditions, visualized by Coomassie staining, excised from the gel, alkylated and treated with peptide N-glycosidase F to release the N-linked glycans. 2-AB labeling was carried out using the Oxford GlycoSystems Signal labeling kit (27Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). WAX was performed on a GlycoSep-C column (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd) (7 × 50 mm) attached to a Waters HPLC system as described previously (28Guile G.R. Wong S.Y. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2-AB-labeled glycan pools were aliquoted and dried using a vacuum centrifugal concentrator. Each aliquot was incubated with a different enzyme array. Conditions for the individual enzymes in the arrays were as follows: Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd.), 1–2 units/ml; bovine testes galactosidase (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd.), 1–2 units/ml; bovine kidney fucosidase (Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd.) 1–2 units/ml. Enzyme digests were performed at 37 °C for 16–24 h in 100 mm citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.2 mm zinc acetate, 150 mmNaCl. After incubation, enzymes were removed by filtration through nitrocellulose and analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described (29Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). NP-HPLC was performed using a Glycosep-N column as described (29Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) using 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B. The column was calibrated in glucose units using 2-AB-labeled dextran hydrolysate. Structures were assigned from the NP-HPLC elution positions expressed in glucose units, previously determined incremental values for the addition of monosaccharide residues to glycan cores (29Guile G.R.

Spleens were cut into small pieces using a sterile surgical blade and incubated in RPMI media (ICN Biomedicals Ltd., Thame, UK) containing 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (RPMI, 2% fetal calf serum) for 30 min at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. Labeling was performed by incubating spleens fragments in RPMI, 2% fetal calf serum containing35SO4 (ICN Biomedicals, Ltd., 250 μCi/ml, 1 ml per spleen) at 37 °C for 4 h in the absence or presence of NaClO3 as described (31Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Tissue was washed in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaN3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors, transferred to a tissue grinder, and homogenized. Membrane proteins were extracted by adding 10% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaN3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (1/5 of total volume) and incubating the samples at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation as described previously. By using the chimeric protein CR-Fc, several putative ligands for the CR domain of the MR were detected in spleen and peripheral (p) LN lysates by ligand blot analysis (10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To characterize these molecules, affinity chromatography was performed using CR-Fc coupled to protein A-Sepharose and spleen lysate as the ligand(s) source (see “Experimental Procedures”). CR-Fc ligands were eluted at high pH and collected in 2-ml fractions. Most CR-Fc binding activity was found in fractions 4 and 5, but activity was also present in fractions 3 and 6. A major band of 180 kDa apparent mass on non-reducing SDS-PAGE was found in fractions 4 and 5 after Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 A, − DTT). Additional proteins could be detected by silver stain (data not shown). Ligand blot analysis of these fractions confirmed that the 180-kDa protein bound CR-Fc and revealed the presence of other ligands not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A, CR-Fc binding). Under reducing conditions the apparent mass of the 180-kDa protein was shifted to >220 kDa, suggesting that the 180-kDa protein contained several internal disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 A, + DTT). This pattern resembled that described for Sn, an Mø-restricted membrane molecule highly expressed by metallophilic and subcapsular sinus Mø (CR-Fc+ cells) but not restricted to these cell populations (12Crocker P.R. Mucklow S. Bouckson V. McWilliam A. Willis A.C. Gordon S. Milon G. Kelm S. Bradfield P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4490-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Crocker P.R. Kelm S. Dubois C. Martin B. McWilliam A.S. Shotton D.M. Paulson J.C. Gordon S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Crocker P.R. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1862-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using the anti-Sn Ab 3D6, and amino-terminal sequencing (NH2-TWGVSSPKNVQG-) confirmed that Sn was the major component of the CR-Fc ligand preparation isolated by affinity chromatography. The specificity of the purification procedure was tested by probing with an Ab against F4/80, an Mø-specific membrane molecule absent in CR-Fc+ cells (10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). No F4/80 antigen was detected in the preparation (data not shown). To confirm that Sn was a ligand for CR-Fc, ligand blot analysis was performed on Sn purified independently from spleen using an Sn-specific affinity column (13Crocker P.R. Kelm S. Dubois C. Martin B. McWilliam A.S. Shotton D.M. Paulson J.C. Gordon S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and Sn isolated from the CR-Fc-ligand preparation using 3D6-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 B, Sn from both sources bound CR-Fc in an Fc-independent fashion. Binding of CR-Fc to Sn was dose-dependent and less than 25 ng of Sn could be detected in this assay (data not shown). By immunohistochemistry, CR-Fc did not label splenic red pulp Mø, medullary Mø in LN, or stromal Mø in bone marrow, all Sn+cells. It neither recognized thioglycollate-elicited Mø treated with mouse serum (thio-Mø + NMS), which express large amounts of Sn (32Crocker P.R. Hill M. Gordon S. Immunology. 1988; 65: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar), nor the cell line 9B12, a CHO-derived stable transfectant expressing full-length Sn (data not shown). Therefore, CR-Fc did not label all Sn+ cells. To test if the absence of correlation between Sn expression and CR-Fc binding was due to lack of accessibility or reduced Sn expression in the CR-Fc−,Sn+ cell populations, Sn was immunoprecipitated from spleen, pLN, 9B12, and thio-Mø + NMS protein lysates using 3D6-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures”) and tested for its ability to interact with CR-Fc. Only Sn purified from spleen and pLN bound CR-Fc even when Sn from thio-Mø + NMS or 9B12 were in excess (Fig.2 A). It should be noted that the CR-Fc binding specific activity of Sn from pLN is higher than that from spleen. This result correlates with the data obtained by immunohistochemistry, since the percentage of Sn+, CR-Fc+ cells is higher in LN. Sn migrated as a broad band on SDS-PAGE indicating that it consisted of a range of glycoforms (data not shown). To determine the role that glycosylation might play in the interaction of Sn with CR-Fc, Sn immunoprecipitated from spleen, pLN, and thio-Mø + NMS protein lysates was treated with peptide N-glycanase F, to removeN-linked glycans and tested for the ability of the deglycosylated protein to bind CR-Fc. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the removal of N-linked sugars completely abolished the ability of Sn to bind CR-Fc compared with control samples incubated in the same buffer but without the enzyme. Under these conditions the binding of 3D6 (an antibody that recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope) was reduced in the deglycosylated sample but was still detectable, indicating thatN-glycans play a role in maintaining the structure of Sn. To test how CR-Fc binding was affected by protein conformation, Sn from pLN was reduced and alkylated and used in the binding assay. Under these conditions, the epitope recognized by 3D6 was eliminated, but CR-Fc binding, although reduced, could still be observed indicating that this interaction was maintained after the disruption of disulfide bonds (Fig. 2 C). In addition to Sn, other CR-Fc ligands were present in the preparation obtained by affinity chromatography (Figs. 1 and3). In an attempt to identify these molecules, the preparation of CR-Fc ligands was probed by Western blot with different mAbs. One of these Ab was YBM42.2.2, a rat IgG that recognizes all isoforms of CD45 (18Watt S.M. Gilmore D.J. Davis J.M. Clark M.R. Waldmann H. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1987; 1: 297-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, YBM42.2.2 recognized a 100-kDa band that is strongly labeled by CR-Fc and two minor bands of about 180 kDa (see Fig.4 A for a better resolution). This result indicated that CD45 was present in this preparation but in a mostly degraded form that could have originated from two of the low molecular weight isoforms. Confocal analysis of splenic CR-Fc+ cells showed that they express CD45 (data not shown). To assess the contribution of CD45 to CR-Fc binding, spleen and LN from CD45−/− mice (16Byth K.F. Conroy L.A. Howlett S. Smith A.J.H. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) were tested by immunohistochemistry as described (10Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CR-Fc labeling was mostly unaffected; MZM and subcapsular sinus Mø were CR-Fc+. Reduced labeling in the B cell areas could be observed, correlating with lack of a completely developed follicular dendritic cell network shown by FDC-M2 labeling (20Lane P. Burditte C. Hubele S. Scheidegger D. Mÿller U. Kosco M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Protein lysates from spleens of CD45−/− and wt mice were tested for CR-Fc binding as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3 B). In general there was a reduction in CR-Fc binding, but the only qualitative difference between the strains was found in the 180-kDa area where two bands were absent in the tissue from the knock-out mice. These results are in agreement with the data presented in Fig. 3 A.Figure 4CR-Fc binds selected isoforms of CD45 in a sugar-dependent fashion. A, CR-Fc binding to CD45 immunoprecipitated from pLN lysates. pLN lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3D6-Sepharose (a) or YBM42.2.2-Sepharose (b and c), with (b) or without (c) a preclearing step using 3D6-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated material was electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with digoxigenin-labeled 3D6 (α-Sn) (10 μg/ml),CR-Fc (10 μg/ml), or YBM42.2.2 (5 μg/ml)(α-CD45). Binding was detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin F(ab′)2(α-Sn), anti-human Fc F(ab′)2(CR-Fc), or anti-rat IgG (α-CD45). In the sample immunoprecipitated with 3D6-Sepharose (a), CR-Fc recognized a single band corresponding to Sn, and no CD45 could be detected. In samples b and c, which contained undetectable (b) or trace (c) levels of Sn, CR-Fc recognized two bands (∼180 kDa) that correspond to the low molecular weight isoforms of CD45 (indicated by arrowheads). Note that rat IgG is recognized in samples a–c by the anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (3rd panel). B, CR-Fc binding to CD45 is sugar-dependent. CD45 immunoprecipitated from pLN tissue lysates was incubated overnight in the absence (−) or in the presence (+) of PNGase F and probed for CR-Fc or YBM42.2.2 binding (α-CD45), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment of CD45 withN-glycosidase increased its mobility in SDS-PAGE and abrogated its ability to interact with CR-Fc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test direct binding of CR-Fc to CD45, spleen and pLN lysates were immunoprecipitated using YBM42.2.2-Sepharose, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and bound proteins were eluted using diethylamine or by boiling in 0.05% SDS. Early experiments showed that Sn co-precipitated with CD45 (data not shown) and that, for the satisfactory resolution of the different CR-Fc+ bands, samples had to be electrophoresed in a 5% SDS-PAGE gel. To establish the contribution that the presence of Sn could have on CR-Fc binding, an additional preclearance step was introduced in the immunoprecipitation protocol; after incubation with protein A-Sepharose, lysates were precleared with 3D6-Sepharose. CR-Fc binding was tested as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are shown in Fig. 4 A. Two low molecular weight isoforms of CD45 (∼180 kDa) bound CR-Fc, and this interaction was independent of the presence of Sn. Peptide N-glycanase F treatment confirmed the sugar requirement for CR-Fc binding to CD45 (Fig. 4 B). To confirm the data obtained by immunoprecipitation, Sn and CD45 were purified from spleen lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and CR-Fc binding and non-binding forms were separated using a CR-Fc-protein A-Sepharose column.

This arrangement ensures efficient transmission of contractile activity, via the firm, actin-anchoring regions, while the more elastic caveolae-containing “hinge” regions facilitate rapid cellular adaptation to changes in cell length. Since cellular mechanics are undoubtedly regulated by components of the membrane and cytoskeleton, we have investigated the potential role played by annexins (a family of phospholipid- and actin-binding, Ca2+-regulated proteins) in regulating sarcolemmal organization. Stimulation of smooth muscle cells elicited a relocation of annexin VI from the cytoplasm to the plasmalemma. In smooth, but not in striated muscle extracts, annexins II and VI coprecipitated with actomyosin and the caveolar fraction of the sarcolemma at elevated Ca2+ concentrations. Recombination of actomyosin, annexins, and caveolar lipids in the presence of Ca2+ led to formation of a structured precipitate. Participation of all 3 components was required, indicating that a Ca2+-dependent, cytoskeleton-membrane complex had been generated. This association, which occurred at physiological Ca2+ concentrations, corroborates our biochemical fractionation and immunohistochemical findings and suggests that annexins play a role in regulating sarcolemmal organization during smooth muscle contraction.

Irrespective whether they belong to the gastrointestinal, the urogenital tract, or the vascular system, their contraction exerts a force, which is transmitted along their entire length to the surrounding extracellular matrix via the sarcolemma. The smooth muscle cell sarcolemma is segregated into domains of rib-like adherens junctions alternating with regions containing vesicular invaginations (1Draeger A. Stelzer E.H.K. Herzog M. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ehler E. Babiychuk E. Draeger A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Actin filaments are assembled within the submembranousadherens junctions or dense plaques, and are coupled to the sarcolemma via a complex set of molecules; these, in turn, are linked to the extracellular matrix by transmembrane integrin receptors (3Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly G. Nuckolls C. Turner C. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). The “non-junctional” regions are comprised of caveolae which occur in close proximity to Ca2+-storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (4Gabella G. Cell Tissue Res. 1976; 170: 187-201PubMed Google Scholar, 5Villa A. Podini P. Panzeri M.C. Soling H.D. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). During contraction, the sarcolemma displays a sequential arrangement of firm, inward-caving anchoring regions and flexible, outward bulging, hinge-like domains, an organization which is reminiscent of a barrel when viewed in three-dimensions (6Small J.V. Fürst D.O. Thornell L.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Small J.V. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently lipid-binding, Ca2+-regulated proteins purified by us from porcine stomach smooth muscle were identified as belonging to the annexin protein family. Implicated in membrane organization, these proteins have also been assigned roles in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and signal transduction (for review, see Ref. 8Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to pinpoint the intracellular location of these annexins and to elucidate the mode of their action in smooth muscle cells. Antibody labeling of thin tissue sections of human taenia coli revealed the intracellular distribution of annexin VI in smooth muscle to depend upon the contraction state of the cells. Consequently, our biochemical experiments revealed the formation of a Ca2+- and annexin-dependent membrane-cytoskeleton complex. We propose that such a complex is involved in sarcolemmal organization during smooth muscle contraction. Since several of the antibodies employed in this study have a restricted cross-reactivity, it was necessary to use human material for immunolabeling. Consent for working with this tissue was obtained from the Medical-Ethical Commission of the University of Bern. Thin longitudinal strips of taenia coli were obtained during surgery or post-mortem, within 12 h of death. These muscle strips were secured at both ends, in a slightly extended state, and then either fixed immediately (“native” tissue) in 4% paraformaldehyde (see below) or plunged into ice-cold Ca2+-free Na+-Tyrode's solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EGTA, for periods between 15 min and 12 h to ensure complete relaxation. Isometric contraction of a number of the “relaxed” muscle strips (still secured) was elicited by incubation either in K+-Tyrode's buffer (140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or in Na+-Tyrode's solution containing 2 mmCaCl2 and 10 nm angiotensin II, for 1–30 min in each instance. In some cases, smooth muscle strips were subjected to contraction-relaxation-contraction cycles. Native, relaxed or contracted, tissue was fixed in Na+- or K+-Tyrode's solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 2–3 h at ambient temperature. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline, muscle strips were cryprotected by immersion overnight in a polyvinylpyrrolidone/sucrose mixture (9Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). They were then mounted on aluminum cryopins and plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Semi-thin (∼0.25 μm thick) cryosections were prepared according to the method described by Tokuyasu (10Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), retrieved on droplets of 2 m sucrose containing 0.75% gelatin, transfered to siliconized glass slides, and then maintained in phosphate-buffered saline for no longer than 1 h prior to immunolabeling. Immunolabeling was performed as described by Jostarndt-Fögen et al. (11Jostarndt-Fögen K. Djonov V. Draeger A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against annexins II and VI and a polyclonal antibody against caveolin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Fluorescent labeling was performed using Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Baltimore, MD). No difference in pattern or intensity of staining was observed between surgically derived material and that obtained up to 12 h post-mortem. Tissue sections were examined in a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope and images collected using a digital CCD camera (Ultrapix, Astrocam). Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Minced porcine stomach muscle (100 g) was extracted in 300 ml of buffer A (60 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mmimidazol, pH 7.0) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.2 mmCaCl2. After centrifugation at 6,000 × gfor 30 min, the supernatant was filtered through glass wool and subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 50,000 × gfor 90 min. The pellets thereby obtained were washed 3 times (with intervening centrifugations at 6,000 × g for 30 min) in 10 volumes of buffer B (120 mm KCl and 20 mmimidazol, pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 and finally resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. This represented the purified membrane-cytoskeleton complex. For purification of annexin and lipid fractions, the membrane-cytoskeleton complex was extracted with 5 volumes of buffer B containing 1 mm EGTA. The extracts were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min. To the annexin/lipid supernatant 1.2 mm CaCl2 was added. The pellet obtained after centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min was washed in buffer B, 0.2 mm CaCl2 (this step led to removal of most of contaminating actin/tropomyosin and low-Ca2+-sensitive annexin V) and re-extracted with 3 volumes of buffer B containing 1 mm EGTA. The resulting pellet was washed 3 times (intervening centrifugation 6,000 ×g for 30 min) and finally resuspended in buffer B. This represented the purified lipid fraction of membrane-cytoskeleton complex. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 60 min; the resulting supernatant consisted of the purified annexin fraction (annexin II and VI). For N-terminal amino acid sequencing, annexin VI was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration (Q-Sepharose FF and Sephacryl S-200 HR; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). As the actomyosin fraction of the membrane-cytoskeleton complex was contaminated by lipids, smooth muscle actomyosin was purified according to the method described by Sobieszek and Bremel (12Sobieszek A. Bremel R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) for use in recombination experiments. In short, minced porcine stomach muscle (100 g) was extracted in 300 ml of buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet washed 3 times in the same buffer (with intervening centrifugations at 6,000 × g for 30 min). This was then homogenized in 3 volumes of buffer A containing 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm ATP and the whole centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through glass wool, and its MgCl2concentration raised to 25 mm. This fraction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 6,000 × gfor 30 min. The resulting pellet was washed extensively in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA; it consisted of purified actomyosin. 5′-Nucleotidase was assayed using 5′-AMP as substrate. In brief, samples (2–5 μl) were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 10 mm AMP and 10 mm MgCl2 (final volume, 300 μl), for 10–30 min at 37 °C. For control runs, the protein was inactivated prior to incubation by treatment with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction products were quantified spectrophotometrically (A 820) as described by Parkin et al.(13Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed in a pulsed liquid-phase sequenator 477A (Applied Biosystems) using the Edman degradation technique and a program adapted from Hunkapillar et al. (14Hunkapillar M.W. Hewick R. Dreyer W. Hood L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The released amino acids were analyzed on-line by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The masses of the samples were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a VG Platform single-stage quadruple mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). SDS-PAGE1 was performed according to the procedure described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were visualized by Coomassie staining. Blotting of gels on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was carried out according to the method described by Towbin et al. (16Towbin H.T. Staehelin J. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against α-smooth muscle and β-cytoplasmic actin, smooth muscle myosin, and vinculin were obtained from Sigma. Immunoreactivity was detected using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized with diaminobenzidine. Samples (10–50 μl) were extracted in a 1:1 mixture (1 ml) of chloroform and methanol for 10 min on ice. 0.25 ml of water was then added and the emulsion centrifuged for 5 min. The lower organic layer was carefully removed and dried. Samples were resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform and spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), which was developed according to Macala et al. (17Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid concentration was estimated by the simultaneous application of lipid standards of known concentration. Lipids were detected by spraying TLC plates with a 5% (w/v) ethanolic solution of phosphomolybdic acid, followed by heating at 120 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method described by Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]free) were calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (19Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) and Harrison and Bers (20Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1250-C1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the MAX CHELATOR computer program designed by Chris Patton (Stanford University, Hopkins Marine Station). Constant changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells during contraction-relaxation cycles require effective regulatory mechanisms for co-ordinated cytoskeleton and sarcolemma rearrangement to protect the cells from mechanical damage. It is not inconceivable that these changes are regulated by calcium-dependent pathways. In our quest for Ca2+-dependent interactions between plasma membrane and actin-based cytoskeleton, we were investigating a redistribution of membrane lipids and actin in smooth muscle extracts in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Porcine stomach smooth muscle (100 g) was homogenized in 3 volumes of buffer A in the presence of 2 mm EGTA and the supernatant collected after low-speed centrifugation (6,000 × g, 30 min) was then subjected to a high-speed centrifugation (50,000 × g, 90 min) to remove insoluble material (first high-speed pellet). One-half of the supernatant was left on ice while to the other 2.2 mmCaCl2 was added and after incubation of both fractions at ambient temperature for 30 min they were further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 90 min. Resulting high-speed Ca2+ and EGTA pellets as well as the first high-speed pellet were extensively washed (10,000 × g, 30 min) in buffer B containing additionally 0.2 mm CaCl2(Ca2+ pellet) or 1 mm EGTA (EGTA pellet) and finally resuspended in 10 ml (20 ml for the first high speed pellet) of buffer B per 0.2 mm CaCl2. We observed an accumulation of cytoskeletal and contractile elements (α-smooth muscle and β-cytoplasmic actin isoforms, smooth muscle myosin), annexins (II and VI), and membrane lipids in the high-speed Ca2+ pellet (Fig.1 a and b, lane 4) in comparison to that obtained in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1,a, lanes 5–5′, and b, lane 5). Polypeptides of molecular mass of 32 and 38 kDa present in the Ca2+ pellet were identified by mass-spectrometry as annexin V and tropomyosin (not shown). Incubation of the Ca2+ pellet at 0.47 or 12.2 μm [Ca]free led to separation of both suspensions into two phases (Fig.2 a). At 0.47 [Ca]free lipids were evenly distributed over the total volume, while actomyosin formed the lower phase. At 12.2 μm [Ca]free, the smaller upper phase did not contain lipids nor actomyosin, both of which constituted the lower phase (Fig. 2 a). At elevated [Ca2+]free, the recombination of the lipid and annexin fractions of the Ca2+ pellet with purified actomyosin (Fig. 2 b), led to the formation of a structured precipitate, identical to that shown in Fig. 2 a. At low [Ca2+]free or in the absence of either annexin or lipid fractions, actomyosin rapidly accumulated at the bottom of the tube (see Fig. 2 b). Thus, both lipid and annexin fractions are responsible for the Ca2+-dependent changes in actomyosin precipitation pattern. This observation, in concert with the Ca2+-dependent co-fractionation of actomyosin, annexins, and lipids in smooth muscle extracts (Fig. 1) suggested the formation of a lipid-annexin-actomyosin (membrane-cytoskeleton) complex at elevated Ca2+ concentrations. The Ca2+sensitivity of this complex formation (Fig. 2 b) corresponded to that of annexin II and VI binding within the complex (Fig.2 c), suggesting that these proteins act as Ca2+-sensitive linkers between actomyosin (actin-based cytoskeleton) and lipids (sarcolemma). Detailed analysis of the lipid composition revealed that the lipid fraction of the Ca2+ pellet was enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (Fig. 1 b) properties attributed to the so-called “detergent insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains,” characteristic for caveolae (21Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In addition, these structures contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (i.e. 5′-nucleotidase) (21Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Western blotting and 5′-nucleotidase activity measurements demonstrated that in contrast to vinculin, a specific marker for adherens junctions, both caveolar-specific marker proteins, caveolin and 5′-nucleotidase, were enriched in the Ca2+ pellet (Fig.3, a and b). A comparative study, performed on smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle extracts points to the specificity of the membrane-cytoskeleton complex for smooth muscle (Fig. 4). Neither the annexins, nor actomyosin were present in skeletal or heart muscle high speed pellets (Fig. 4 a). Besides, 5′-nucleotidase activity and an elevated cholesterol, sphingomyelin contents were observed exclusively in smooth muscle samples (Fig. 4,b and c). In agreement with Ca2+-dependent translocation of annexin VI observed in biochemical experiments its distribution in smooth muscle cells depended upon their state of contraction. When fixed in rigor (native tissue), this protein was located exclusively within the plasmalemma (Fig. 5 a). After relaxation of cells in a Ca2+ free solution for periods between 15 min and 12 h, annexin VI became diffusely distributed within the cytosol (Fig. 5 b). Subsequent incubation of this relaxed muscle in a contraction solution, prompted relocation of annexin VI to the plasmalemma (Fig. 5 c). Stimulation of muscle strips which had been maintained in a relaxed state for longer than 12 h led to an increasingly patchy plasmalemmal staining for annexin VI, which was accompanied by enhanced labeling of the nuclear lamina and spotted cytosol (Fig. 5 d). The low intensity of staining of annexin II in smooth muscle cells rendered difficult an assessment of its potential redistribution during contraction. The mechanical link coupling cytoskeletal and contractile proteins to the sarcolemma of smooth muscle cells is essential for transmitting tension from the cell's interior to the exterior. The sarcolemma is segregated into regularly spaced domains of rib-like adherens junctions alternating with caveolae containing regions (1Draeger A. Stelzer E.H.K. Herzog M. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ehler E. Babiychuk E. Draeger A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In adherens junctions or plasmalemma-associated dense plaques, actin filaments are coupled to transmembrane integrins via a cascade of submembranous proteins. While the mechanisms regulating the assembly of dense plaques are still the subject of intense investigation, it is generally taken for granted that these structures exist in a fixed, assembled state throughout the entire contraction-relaxation cycle. Our work postulates on the existence of an additional, and reversible, cytoskeleton-membrane complex, which is forged in the caveolar domain of the sarcolemma in response to a rise in Ca2+concentration following smooth muscle cell stimulation. The Ca2+ sensitivity of this complex indicates that it can be formed in vivo under the conditions prevailing during smooth muscle contraction (22Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-481Google Scholar). The plasmalemmal sites are obvious loci for the formation of such reversible, cytoskeletal links, since the plasmalemma is closely apposed to cytoskeletal elements. Apart from the adherensjunction, known to serve as attachment site for the actin filaments, actin and myosin subfragment 1 have been identified in fractions of purified caveolae (23Izumi T. Shibata Y. Yamamoto T. Anat. Rec. 1988; 220: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Chang W.J. Ying Y.S. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M.

Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, annexins II and VI were found to be components of different membranous preparations, usually also containing significant amounts of actin (24Chang W.J. Ying Y.S. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar,25Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E.

Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The particular distribution of membrane domain markers such as caveolin and 5′-nucleotidase, together with high amounts of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the Ca2+ pellet, suggests that the caveolar domain of the sarcolemma takes part in the formation of the Ca2+-regulated membrane-cytoskeleton complex. In agreement with these data, the Ca2+ pellet did not include vinculin, the main component of the adherens junctions. A property shared by all members of the annexin protein family is their capacity to bind acidic phospholipids and actin-based cytoskeletal elements in a Ca2+-dependent manner (30Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31Glenney J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4258-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 32Glenney J.R.J.

These characteristics render them ideal candidates to play a role as Ca2+-sensitive linkers between the cell's membranous structures and cytoskeleton. However, while the well documented interactions between annexins and acidic phospholipids or actin-based cytoskeletal elements could play a role in formation of the membrane-cytoskeleton complex described here, the precise mechanisms responsible have not been elucidated to date. Even in unstimulated cells, the localization of annexins and their precise allocation to a distinct intracellular compartment remain a subject of controversy (for reviews, see Refs. 8Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholarand 37Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Observations concerning the translocation of annexins in stimulated cells are thus often contradictory. These apparent contradictions reflect the great complexity and diversification of the responses to stimulation manifested by different cell and tissue types and the multitude of different annexins present within a given cell (36Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Srivastava M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Massey-Harroche D. Mayran N. Maroux S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3007-3015PubMed Google Scholar). Discrepancies can also be accounted for by the developmental state of a cell or by experimental variables, such as fixation, type of antibody used, or the duration of stimulation (39Selbert S. Fischer P. Menke A. Jockusch H. Pongratz D. Noegel A.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that, while Kaufman et al. (40Kaufman M. Leto T. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) ascribed the translocation of annexin I from the cytosol of resting neutrophils to the plasma membrane to a rise in intracellular Ca2+concentration, Raynal et al. (41Raynal P. Kuijpers G. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), on the other hand, demonstrated that in human fibroblasts annexins I, II, VI, and VII do not redistribute during treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. And in myogenic cell lines, as well as in human fibroblasts, annexins II, IV, V, VI, or VII have been shown to relocate to the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic vesicles, or other intracellular membranes, in response to rises in Ca2+concentration (39Selbert S.

In our study, human smooth muscle of surgical or autoptic origin was always in a state of rigor upon our receipt of it, this being recognized by the plasmalemmal localization of annexin VI's. After inducing relaxation by incubation in an EGTA-containing solution, a diffuse redistribution of annexin VI to the cytosol was observed. In the only previous investigation, annexin VI has been localized to the sarcolemma of smooth muscle cells indicating that the tissue the authors used for their study was fixed in the state of rigor(43Iida H. Hatae T. Shibata Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present paper we, for the first time, demonstrate that stimulation of smooth muscle led to a rapid and reversible relocation of annexin VI from the cytosol to the plasma. However, if smooth muscle was relaxed for periods longer than ∼12 h prior to contraction or subjected to repeated contraction-relaxation cycles, annexin VI labeling of the plasmalemma became increasingly patchy and the number of cells revealed a nuclear laminal signal. We ascribe this increasingly irregular pattern of redistribution in patches of irregular size and distribution to a gradual decay in plasmalemmal integrity, with an accompanying increase in Ca2+ influx and spurious binding of annexin VI to detached lipid-membrane structures. Annexin II, a vigorously investigated member of this protein family, was indeed but scantily stained in smooth muscle cells with available antibody making difficult an assessment of its potential redistribution during contraction. However, our biochemical data suggest that a relocation of annexin II could, indeed, take place upon smooth muscle stimulation. Other authors have reported such a relocation to occur (from cytoplasmic to membrane sites) after stimulation of a number of cell types (42Barwise J.L. Walker J.H.

In conclusion, we suggest that annexins II and VI play a determinant role in smooth muscle contraction and sarcolemmal organization providing a Ca2+-sensitive link between sarcolemma and underlying actin-based cytoskeleton. A physiological function for such a link would be a co-operative regulation of cytoskeleton and plasmalemma rearrangements during contraction-relaxation cycles to prevent the cell membrane from mechanical damage and to ensure a better force transduction from contractile apparatus to extracellular matrix.

https://openalex.org/W2076554945,"p53 is known to be recruited in response to DNA-damaging genotoxic stress and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the genome. In the present study, the effect of a potent lung cancer carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on p53 expression was investigated. We showed that exposure of A549 and NIH 3T3 cells to B[a]P resulted in an increase in p53 mRNA levels and in p53 promoter activation, indicating that B[a]P-induced p53 expression is partly regulated at the transcriptional level. The p53 promoter region which extends from −58 to −43, overlapping the κB motif, is essential for both the p53 basal promoter activity and p53 promoter activation induced by B[a]P. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) proteins have been revealed to be activated in B[a]P-induced p53 expression. Activated NF-κB complexes were shown to contain predominantly p50 and p65 subunit components in A549 cells and p65 subunit in NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, the overexpression of IκBα completely inhibited NF-κB activation, p53 promoter transactivation and the stimulatory effect on p53 transcription induced by B[a]P. We therefore conclude that B[a]P transcriptionally activates the human p53 gene through the induction of NF-κB activity. p53 is known to be recruited in response to DNA-damaging genotoxic stress and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the genome.

Tong T. Bolden S. Cancer J. Clin. 1995; 45: 8-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Concurrently, the environmental air quality is deteriorating and the number of smokers has increased. Epidemiological studies over the past several decades have provided a considerable body of evidence linking lung cancer to a number of mutagens and carcinogens detected both in the environment and cigarette smoke. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)1 carcinogens, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), are products of incomplete combustion of organic matter and are widespread in the environment. Carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of B[a]P have been well documented in human, animals, and mammalian cell systems (2Tokiwa H. Sera N. Horikawa K. Nakanishi Y. Shigematu N. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Harvey R.G. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: Chemistry and Carcinogenicity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar). Most PAH require metabolic activation to vicinal bay-region or fjord-region dihydrodiol epoxides in order to express their carcinogenic activity and, in general, the PAHs are among the more potent known experimental carcinogens (4Dipple A.

The continuous exposure of cells to exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers. A host of complex cellular DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to counteract the deleterious effects of DNA damage in humans (7Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 69-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition to the existence of several detoxification systems, delays at specific stages of the cell cycle occur after DNA damage, most likely for the efficient and optimal removal of DNA lesions from the cellular genome before cell division (8Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptosis of cells has been shown to be necessary for the elimination of potential precursor cells escaping DNA repair (10Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1807-1812PubMed Google Scholar). p53, a tumor suppressor protein, is believed to play an integral role in such cellular response pathways to DNA damage (9Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O.

The p53 gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes identified in various types of human tumors, and the results of numerous studies suggest that the inactivation or abnormality of p53 is a critical step leading to neoplastic transformation (13Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). It is important to maintain the integrity of the genome (14Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar). A loss of the p53 functions thus results in an enhanced frequency of genomic rearrangements or genomic instability (15Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D.

In accordance with this function, p53 is known to be recruited in response to various DNA-damaging agents such as UV, γ-irradiation, and anticancer drugs (12Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el Deiry W.S.

The increased cellular p53 protein levels exposed to various genotoxic agents are due mainly to an increase in p53 protein stability rather than an increase in steady-state p53 mRNA levels (9Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G.

However, it has been suggested that an increase in p53 protein stability is not solely responsible for p53 recruitment in response to genotoxic stress, and it is more likely that p53 genotoxic stress response is a complex cellular process regulated at the transcriptional, mRNA stability level as well as the protein stability level (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported in a few studies that PAH and its metabolites result in a rapid accumulation of the p53 gene product in human and mouse cells (24Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, whether or not the increase of p53 protein resulting from exposure to carcinogens is also regulated at a transcriptional level is still unclear. In the present study, we found that the B[a]P induced-p53 protein accumulation also involved p53 promoter activation. Furthermore, we characterized what p53 promoter sequences are involved in B[a]P-induced p53 promoter activation and what cellular factors are involved. The results presented herein suggest the transcriptional activation of human p53 promoter by B[a]P-induced NF-κB complexes. B[a]P, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide immediately prior to use and then was added directly to the cell culture medium as 1000× stocks to obtain the desired final concentration. Polyclonal antibodies against IκBα and the subunits of NF-κB (p50, p65, p52, and c-Rel) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies (Ab-6 and Ab-1) were obtained from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). The recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector, p53CATd325, which contains the human p53 gene promoter region −325 to +12 (the 3′ end of the fragment is an XbaI site and is about 12 bp downstream of the major transcription initiation site, the most 3′ end of which is defined as +1 in the present study) (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell.

Human genomic DNA, derived from normal human lymphocytes, was used as a template, and PCR was performed with the following primers: sense, 5′-GTTAGGGTGTGGATATTACG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAATCCAGGGAAGCGTGTCA-3′. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and then ligated into pCAT Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains the CAT reporter gene but lacks a eukaryotic promoter region. The orientation and sequence of the inserted fragment were confirmed by sequencing. With p53CATd325 as a template, p53 promoter fragments from −135 to +12 (d135), from −80 to +12 (d80), and from −50 to +12 (d50) with 5′HindIII and 3′ XbaI ends were prepared by PCR and then were cloned into the pCAT Basic vector digested withHindIII and XbaI. Various linker-scanning mutations (mt 1 to mt 3) shown in Fig. 2 were introduced to p53CATd325 by an improved site-directed mutagenesis method using PCR (27Kuipers O.P. Boot H.J. de Vos W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4558-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The pSV-β-galactosidase (β-gal) control vector, a β-gal-expressing plasmid, was obtained from Promega. A human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549 (distal respiratory epithelium-like), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CC Laboratories, Cleveland, OH). A mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH 3T3 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For DNA transfection, cells were plated at a density of 5×105 cells/60-mm diameter culture dish 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of various CAT reporter plasmids and 1 μg of a pSV-β-gal control vector by LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 20 h after transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h with B[a]P or cisplatin (CDDP) in a serum-free medium and then were harvested to determine their CAT activity and β-gal activity. After the transfection and exposure to B[a]P or CDDP, the cells were washed twice in PBS, harvested in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in 100 μl of 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three freeze-thawing cycles. The preparation was microcentrifuged, and the supernatant (cell extract) was removed. To determine the transfection efficiencies, a portion of the cell extract was used to check the β-gal activity by a colorimetric assay using chlorophenol red-3-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (28Takayama K. Ueno H. Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Yatsunami J. Hara N. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was assayed as previously reported (29Takayama K. Morohashi K. Honda S. Hara N. Omura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cell extracts, normalized for β-gal activity, were heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then were incubated with 1-deoxy[dichloroacetyl-a-14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and acetyl CoA for 2 h and assayed for CAT activity by thin layer chromatography (Sigma-Aldrich). The CAT activity was visualized and quantified by a Fuji BAS 2000 phosphorimager (Fuji Photo Film, Odawara, Japan). For the isolation of nuclear extracts, all procedures were performed on ice. Nearly confluent monolayers of A549 and NIH 3T3 cells, which had been treated with B[a]P or control medium for the appropriate time, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping into 1 ml of PBS, and pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice with PBS, and then suspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The pellet was vortexed and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant represented the cytoplasmic extract. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the nuclei were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing nuclear extract was removed and the protein concentration was determined. The nuclear extracts were then stored at −70 °C until further use. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, 35 fmol of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For reactions involving competitor oligonucleotides, the unlabeled competitor and the labeled probes were premixed before addition to the reaction mixture. For supershift assays, the reaction mixture minus the probe was incubated with 2 μl of specific antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was then added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 2 h on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (30:1) in a Tris borate-EDTA buffer system. The dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides used for the gel shift analysis were as follows: an oligonucleotide p53wt, 5′-TGGGATTGGGGTTTTCCCCTCC-3′, containing the κB site from the p53 promoter; a canonical NF-κB consensus sequence, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Promega); and an oligonucleotide p53 mt, 5′-TGGGATTATCGTTTTAAGCTCC-3′, containing the mutated κB site from the p53 promoter (mutated positions are underlined). The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4-polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), after which unincorporated nucleotides were removed with NICK spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal amounts of protein were denatured by heating to 95 °C in SDS reducing buffer and were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were probed with polyclonal anti-IκBα antibody or monoclonal anti-p53 antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using a ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were grown for 24 h, then treated for 4, 8, or 24 h with B[a]P (10 μm). At the end of the treatments, the total RNA was extracted by using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNAs (20 μg) from each treatment were denatured with formaldehyde-formamide and separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNAs were then transferred to the Hybond-N nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was hybridized with the full-length human p53 cDNA or a 0.83-kilobase PstI fragment of mouse p53 cDNA (30Zakut H.R. Oren M. Bienz B. Lavie V. Hazum S. Givol D. Nature. 1983; 306: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α32P]dCTP by random priming using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and purified through NICK spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A β-actin cDNA probe was later used to rehybridize the same membrane. The levels of p53 mRNA were quantified with the Fuji BAS 2000 phosphorimager and normalized to β-actin values. Adenovirus infection was carried out essentially as described previously (28Takayama K. Ueno H. Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Yatsunami J. Hara N. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent A549 cells rinsed with serum-free medium twice were added to a recombinant adenovirus expressing IκBα (a kind gift from Dr. Hikaru Ueno), which was diluted to a desired titer with serum-free medium. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature under gentle agitation, the medium containing an adenovirus was removed. The cells were washed and incubated in fresh growth medium for 3 days until assayed. Although the results of previous studies showed that the cellular p53 protein levels increase upon exposure to B[a]P and its metabolites, and suggested that this increase is due mainly to an increase in p53 protein stability (24Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi H.T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K.

Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2313-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it has not been studied as to whether transcriptional activation is also involved in p53 recruitment in response to carcinogen treatment. To investigate the mechanisms leading to p53 protein accumulation in human lung adenocarcinoma cells after carcinogen treatment, the A549 cells that retain a wild-type p53 gene were exposed to B[a]P for increasing periods of time under serum-free conditions. Western blotting showed an increased p53 expression following stimulation of A549 cells with B[a]P (Fig.1 A). 2.1- or 5.1-fold increase in p53 protein levels was detected after 4 or 8 h of treatment; they remained elevated even after 24 h (Fig. 1 A). NIH 3T3 cells exposed to B[a]P also showed similar results in a Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1 C). A Northern blotting analysis revealed an increased accumulation of p53 mRNA (2.5-fold) in B[a]P-treated A549 cells at 8 and 24 h (Fig.1 B), which was most likely responsible, in part, for the increased p53 protein levels. The discrepancy between p53 protein and mRNA levels after the treatment for 4 h may be the result of an increased stability of the protein, consistent with the previous findings (23Hellin A.C.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. A similar stimulatory effect with B[a]P on p53 mRNA increase was observed in the A549 cells treated with the CDDP (data not shown). The p53 mRNA levels in NIH 3T3 cells also increased in response to B[a]P treatment (Fig.1 D), although the extent was less than in A549 cells. The above described results prompted us to examine whether B[a]P activates the p53 gene promoter. A previous study identified that an 85-bp fragment spanning the p53 promoter region, the 3′ end of which is about 10 bp downstream of the major transcriptional initiation sites, is all that is required for full promoter activity (26Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and this region is also required for genotoxic stress-responsive activities (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we used the p53 promoter-CAT fusion plasmid containing a 325-bp p53 promoter region, the 3′ end of which is also about 10 bp downstream of the major transcriptional initiation sites as shown in Fig.2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of this 325-bp region is nearly the same as that of 2.4-kilobase promoter (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and this region includes all transcription factor binding motifs discovered upstream of the major transcriptional initiation sites (for a review, see Ref. 33Furlong E.E. Rein T. Martin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5933-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The p53CATd325 reporter plasmid was transfected into A549 and NIH 3T3 cells, and CAT activity was measured after exposure to B[a]P or CDDP. As shown in Fig.3, B[a]P and CDDP were able to induce p53 promoter activation. 30 μmB[a]P was able to induce the p53 promoter-driven CAT gene expression 3–4-fold above the control level in A549 and NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, the p53 promoter-CAT reporter genes that contain 135- and 80-bp p53 promoter region (pCATd135 and pCATd80; Fig. 2) were transfected into A549 cells and showed 2.0- and 2.3-fold increases of CAT activity, in the basal level, respectively, and an enhanced response to B[a]P. However, further deletion to −50 (pCATd50) resulted in a 3.2-fold reduction in the basal level and complete unresponsiveness to B[a]P treatment (Fig. 4). Essentially similar results were also obtained with NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the cis-elements required for basal and B[a]P stress-responsive activities reside within this 80-bp region of the p53 promoter and further suggest that the p53 promoter region from −325 to −135 contains a region that represses the p53 proximal promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the 80-bp p53 core promoter region contains potential binding motifs for NF-κB (34Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (35Ronen D. Rotter V. Reisman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4128-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We introduced three linker-scanning mutations in this p53 core promoter region (Fig. 2), and p53 promoter-CAT reporters containing these mutated 325-bp p53 promoter regions were examined for their basal promoter activities and responsiveness to B[a]P treatment. The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the mutations (mt 1 and mt 2) in the p53 promoter region from −58 to −43, overlapping the κB motif, result in 4.4- and 3.2-fold reduction in the basal promoter activity, respectively, and severely impair the p53 promoter activation induced by B[a]P. A mutation (mt 3) affecting a potential helix-loop-helix transcription factor binding motif did not have any significant deteriorative effect on the basal as well as on p53 B[a]P stress-responsive promoter activity. These results thus indicate that the p53 promoter region extending from −58 to −43, overlapping the κB motif, is essential for both the p53 basal promoter activity and p53 promoter activation induced by B[a]P. The results from a deletion analysis of p53 gene promoter region in the present and previous study (34Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to determine whether NF-κB proteins are involved in B[a]P-induced p53 expression. We first examined the induction of NF-κB complexes in B[a]P-treated A549 and NIH 3T3 cells. Gel shift assays performed with nuclear extracts from A549 cells showed that stimulation with B[a]P at 10 μm induced a strong NF-κB DNA binding activity within 4 h and maintained until 24 h after B[a]P treatment. This induction was observed when the nuclear extracts were incubated with a canonical NF-κB consensus probe (data not shown) or with a NF-κB p53 probe derived from −39 to −60 of the p53 promoter (wt NF-κB p53 probe) (Fig.5 A). A similar stimulating effect of B[a]P on NF-κB DNA binding activity was also observed in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 B). Competition studies were performed with a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled wt NF-κB p53 probe, an oligonucleotide probe with mutations in the p53 NF-κB site (mt NF-κB p53 probe) and the canonical NF-κB consensus probe. As shown in Fig.6, the protein binds NF-κB consensus site specifically, as the binding activity was fully inhibited by the unlabeled wt NF-κB p53 probe and by the canonical NF-κB consensus probe but not by the mt NF-κB p53 probe. A further characterization of the nuclear proteins binding to the NF-κB motif was obtained by preincubating the nuclear extracts with antibodies against the p50, p65, p52, and c-Rel NF-kB subunits. Both p50 and p65 antibodies partially shifted the B[a]P-induced complex in A549 cells (Fig. 6 A), whereas p52 and c-Rel antibodies did not. These data indicate that B[a]P activates NF-kB p50 and p65 proteins in A549 cells. Analysis of specific subunit components in the complex revealed the presence of p65 protein in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.6 B). A recombinant adenovirus expressing IκBα (rAd.IκBα) was used to infect A549 cells. After 3 days of infection with the recombinant adenovirus, the A549 cells expressed high levels of IκBα in a m.o.i.-dependent manner, based on the Western blotting findings (Fig.7 A). The amounts expressed were estimated to be about 60–70 times higher as compared with the endogenous protein. The stimulation of the infected cells at day 3 with B[a]P for 6 h did not detectably decrease the IκBα levels. In transient transfection assays, B[a]P stimulation in A549 cells infected with the rAd.IκBα did not induce any significant p53 promoter activation as compared with the level of activation in the control cells (Fig. 7 B; compare with Fig.3). An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay analysis demonstrated that the overexpression of the IκBα led to a complete suppression of B[a]P-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 7 C). No stimulatory effect of B[a]P on p53 mRNA levels was observed in the A549 cells infected with the rAd.IκBα (data not shown). p53 recruitment in response to various genotoxic stresses is an important cellular response to maintain the integrity of the genome (14Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar). After metabolic activation, carcinogens, such as PAHs, bind to DNA and form predominantly covalent carcinogen-DNA adduct, and thus express their carcinogenic and genotoxic activity (3Harvey R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2081610534,"A reconstitution system allowed us to measure the ATPase activity of specific isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump continuously, and to measure the effects of adding or removing calmodulin. The rate of activation by calmodulin of isoform 4b was found to be very slow, with a half-time (at 235 nm calmodulin and 0.5 μm free Ca2+) of about 1 min. The rate of inactivation of isoform 4b when calmodulin was removed was even slower, with a half-time of about 20 min. Isoform 4a has a lower apparent affinity for calmodulin than 4b, but its activation rate was surprisingly faster (half time about 20 s). This was coupled with a much faster inactivation rate, consistent with its low affinity. A truncated mutant of isoform 4b also had a more rapid activation rate, indicating that the downstream inhibitory region of full-length 4b contributed to its slow activation. The results indicate that the slow activation is due to occlusion of the calmodulin-binding domain of 4b, caused by its strong interaction with the catalytic core. Since the activation of 4b occurs on a time scale comparable to that of many Ca2+ spikes, this phenomenon is important to the function of the pump in living cells. The slow response of 4b indicates that this isoform may be the appropriate one for cells which respond slowly to Ca2+signals.

The requirement for this extra step may have profound effects on the shape of Ca2+ spikes, particularly if the binding of calmodulin to the pump is slow. The activation by calmodulin of several calmodulin-regulated enzymes is fast, but it has been observed that the activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is slow in human erythrocytes (1Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the binding of calmodulin to the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is very tight, this slowness in the activation was surprising. Erythrocytes contain a mixture of isoforms 1 and 4 of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (2Strehler E.E. James P. Fischer R. Heim R. Vorherr T. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2835-2842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it was not clear which isoform was responsible for the slow activation. It was possible to study the rate of activation in erythrocytes because almost all of their Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity is due to the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, but extension of such studies to other cell types has been difficult. The major difficulty is the presence in almost all kinds of cells of non-pump Ca2+ ATPases whose activity swamps that of the pump.Some studies using Ca2+ indicators in whole cells other than erythrocytes have given results consistent with slow activation of the pump. In human neutrophils (3Scharff O. Foder B. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) it was concluded that a Ca2+ spike was caused by delayed activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. In this case the arguments were based in part on the use of a calmodulin antagonist, which is rather nonspecific. In vascular endothelial cells (4Klishin A. Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C1117-C1128Crossref Google Scholar) a similar conclusion was based on the use of La3+, VO43− and Hg2+ as inhibitors of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. Each of these reagents also inhibits other pumps and enzymes. In T cells (5Bautista D.M. Lewis R.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A379Google Scholar), a similar conclusion was based on the behavior of the cells when the SERCA pump and the mitochondria were inhibited by specific inhibitors. Their conclusions were based on the assumption that the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump was the only remaining mechanism for Ca2+ efflux. It is evident from these studies that, since no highly specific inhibitor exists for the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, complex experiments and reasoning are required to make a conclusion about the role of this pump in most kinds of whole cells.In the present study, we have developed and applied a system to investigate the rate of activation by calmodulin of specific isoforms of the pump in a reconstituted system. This system overcomes the problem of non-pump ATPases, since their amount is drastically reduced by the reconstitution procedure. Using this system, we have measured the rate of activation of the pump on specific isoforms and constructs expressed in COS cells. The results show that isoform 4b of the pump has a very slow activation by calmodulin, which is partly due to the presence of the downstream inhibitory region of this pump. We show that isoform 4a is more rapidly activated than is 4b; this result was surprising, since isoform 4a has a lower apparent affinity for calmodulin than 4b. We also show that the rate of dissociation of calmodulin from isoform 4b is even slower than the association rate, with a half-time of tens of minutes.RESULTSThe assay of the pump ATPase activity in microsomal membranes isolated from COS cells is almost impossible because of the high level of non-pump Mg2+-ATPase in these membranes. One of the reasons for devising the reconstitution method was to reduce this interfering Mg2+-ATPase. Experiments with the reconstituted preparation showed that its Mg2+-ATPase activity was decreased to 10% of that seen in the original membranes, while its ATPase activity due to the pump was not affected. In the reconstitutions with isoforms 4a and 4b, this resulted in a Mg2+-ATPase activity of about 30% of the pump ATPase activity, a level which could easily be subtracted out.To verify that the reconstituted enzyme behaves as the pump in the original membrane, we compared the affinity for Ca2+ of a reconstituted preparation of PMCA4b with the enzyme present in erythrocyte membranes. The K 1/2 for Ca2+ of the reconstituted preparation in the presence of 235 nm calmodulin was 0.32 μmCa2+ for the reconstituted preparation and 0.23 μm for the erythrocyte membranes. In the absence of calmodulin, the K 1/2 for Ca2+ was over 10 μm in the reconstituted preparation, which is also like the corresponding result for erythrocyte membranes. These results show that the kinetic behavior of the reconstituted pump is like its behavior when it is in its natural environment (9Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To check the molecular integrity of isoforms 4a and 4b, and to estimate the amount of each present in our assays, we performed quantitative Western blots on reconstituted liposomes containing these forms. Quantitation was performed by scanning the blots directly, followed by computer analysis (10Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi Á. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The blots were stained with antibody 5F10, which recognizes all isoforms of PMCA (11Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and purified human red cell PMCA (12Graf E. Verma A.K. Gorski J.P. Lopaschuk G. Niggli V. Zurini M. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4511-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used as standard. The sample of purified pump used contained a small amount of a proteolytic fragment. Such fragments are frequently found in human tissues, and their presence and size depends on the exact history of the tissue (11Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that the reconstituted preparation contained a band of the expected size for both isoforms 4a and 4b. A very faint band of slightly higher molecular weight was also visible, particularly when 4a was expressed. This band was due to the presence of a small amount of endogenous COS cell PMCA, which is isoform 1b. However, the addition of Ca2+ and/or calmodulin did not produce any noticeable change in the slope when ATPase assays were performed with membranes from cells transfected with empty plasmid. This shows that the contribution of this endogenous pump is negligible. From these Western blots, we found the pump concentration to be 3–7 nm after the liposomes were suspended in the medium for the ATPase assay. This confirms that the concentration of pump is negligible compared with that of calmodulin, as required by the theory (see “Materials and Methods”).The rate of activation of isoform 4b is shown in Fig.2. The rate of the ATPase at the shortest time we were able to measure was already faster than the rate without calmodulin, but the reaction gradually accelerated over a period of scores of seconds until it reached the final calmodulin-stimulated rate. The fit of the theory to the data was excellent, with a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0.99998 for the data shown.Figure 2Slow activation of isoform 4b by 235 nm calmodulin. Calmodulin was added at zero time, and the rate of ATP splitting was measured. The experiment shown was one of six; the standard error of the mean of k for the six experiments was ±0.0016 s−1. The solid line is made up of the actual data points, and the dashed line is a least squares line fitted to the linear portion of the curve (the data points from 120 s to the end of the experiment). Comparison of these two lines makes the curvature of the early data evident. The equation described under “Materials and Methods” was fitted to the data also, but it is not shown in the main panel of the figure, since it is nearly indistinguishable from the line made up of the data points. The inset shows the data points for the first 50 s, and a solid line representing the fit given by Equation 5. Some small deviations from the theoretical curve occurred in the first 30 s, as shown, but the fit was much better at all longer times. For this experiment, the value of k calculated from the fitted curve was 0.0151 ± 0.0001 s−1, which gave a value of 3.9 × 106m−1 min−1 for k1, and a t 12 of 46 s. The value ofv o was 62 nmol mg−1 min−1, and the sum of v o + v c was 147 nmol mg−1 min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We expected the rate of the reaction for isoform 4a to be even slower, because of the lower apparent affinity of this isoform for calmodulin (9Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the data showed a nearly straight line, with almost all the deviation from linearity occurring in the first 30 s (Fig.3). Although the deviation from linearity was small, it was reproducible, and the value fork 1 obtained was about four times higher than that of isoform 4b.Figure 3More rapid activation of isoform 4a by 235 nm calmodulin. Methods and symbols are as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The experiment shown was one of five; the S.E. of the mean of k for the five experiments was ±0.0065 s−1. Unlike isoform 4b, which shows curvature for 120 s, 4a attains linearity more quickly. This curve was representative of three separate experiments on vesicles reconstituted from different batches of COS cell membranes. For this experiment, the value of k calculated from the fitted curve was 0.0597 ± 0.0007 s−1, which gave a value of 15.2 × 106m−1, min−1 for k1, and a t 12 of 12 s. The fitted curve had a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0.99997. The value of v o was 42 nmol mg−1 min−1 and the sum ofv o + v c was 108 nmol mg−1 min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The truncated mutant ct92 is derived from isoform 4b, and contains the entire molecule up to the end of the calmodulin-binding region, but lacks the downstream regulatory region which is responsible for part of the autoinhibition of the enzyme (13Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like isoform 4a, it showed a nearly linear calmodulin-activated rate, with a deviation from linearity at short times which was reproducible (Fig.4). The results were of lower quality than those gotten with the full-length versions of isoforms 4a and 4b because of the lower activity of the exogenously expressed enzyme, but the activation rate clearly had a value between that of 4b and that of 4a.Figure 4Activation of the truncated mutant 4b-ct92 by 235 nm calmodulin. Methods and symbols are as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The experiment shown was one of three; the S.E, of the mean of k for the three experiments was ± 0.0029 s−1. Because of lower activity, this sample showed greater fluctuations around the theoretical line. Nonetheless, the departure from linearity at short times was definite and reproducible in three separate experiments on vesicles reconstituted from different batches of COS cell membranes. For this experiment, the value of k calculated from the fitted curve was 0.0299 ± 0.0004 s−1, which gave a value of 7.6 × 106m−1min−1 for k 1, and at 12 of 23 s. The fitted curve had a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0.99995. The value of v o was 6 nmol mg−1min−1, and the sum of v o +v c was 35 nmol mg−1min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To better compare the activation rates of the three constructs, Fig.5 shows first derivatives. In this figure it can be clearly seen that isoform 4b takes the longest to achieve its steady-state rate, with 4a being the fastest and ct92 intermediate.Since the rate at which calmodulin activates isoform 4b is slow, and calmodulin binds to the pump very tightly, the rate of inactivation of 4b when calmodulin dissociates is expected to be very slow. That this is the case was confirmed by the experiment shown in Fig.6. In this experiment, the enzyme was loaded with calmodulin, and the calmodulin concentration was then lowered well below its K d for the pump by adding an excess of a calmodulin-binding peptide. The slowing of the pump's rate of reaction was then observed using the coupled enzyme reaction. The slowing of the pump's rate occurred over a long time, and was not complete when the reaction was terminated after an hour of incubation at 37 °C. The theory fitted the data quite well, and gave a half-time for inactivation of 23 min.Figure 6Inactivation of isoform 4b after removal of calmodulin. Free calmodulin was removed from the solution at zero time by addition of the calmodulin-binding peptide from myosin light chain kinase. Symbols are as described in the legend to Fig.2, except that Equation 7 was used to fit the data. The experiment shown was one of three; the standard error of the mean ofk -1 for the three experiments was ± 0.000278 s−1. Once again, the theory fits the data excellently, so that the fitted line was omitted in the main panel. Theinset allows the data points and the fitted line to be distinguished, so that the nature of the fit can be seen better. This curve was representative of two separate experiments on vesicles reconstituted from different batches of COS cell membranes. For this experiment, the value of k -1 calculated from the fitted curve was 0.000493 ± 0.000004 s−1 or 0.0296 min−1, which gave a t 12 of 23 min. The fitted curve had a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0.99999. The value of v o was 34 nmol mg−1 min−1, and the sum ofv o + v c was 119 nmol mg−1 min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the case of isoform 4a, the binding of calmodulin is less tight than for 4b, but the rate of activation was faster. In order to explain this, it was necessary to postulate a rate of inactivation of 4a which would be much faster than that of 4b. This was confirmed by the experiment shown in Fig. 7, done in the same way as Fig. 6. The half-time for inactivation was less than a minute, nearly 30 times faster than for 4b.Figure 7Inactivation of isoform 4a after removal of calmodulin. Free calmodulin was removed from the solution at zero time by addition of the calmodulin-binding peptide from myosin light chain kinase. Symbols and methods are as described in the legend to Fig. 6. The experiment shown was one of three; the S.E. of the mean of k -1 for the three experiments was ± 0.0037 s−1. Like the other figures the linear fit is shown in the main panel, to make the curvature of the data evident. This curve was representative of two separate experiments on vesicles reconstituted from different batches of COS cell membranes. For this experiment, the value of k -1 calculated from the fitted curve was 0.0135±0.0003 s−1 or 0.81 min−1, which gave a t 12 of 0.85 min. The fitted curve had a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0.99999. The value ofv o was 62 nmol mg−1 min−1, and the sum of v o + v c was 82 nmol mg−1 min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur measurements use a method similar to that employed by Scharff and Foder in 1982 (1Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Their pioneering work was limited by the equipment and materials available at that time. We were able to extend their work significantly by using expressed isoforms of the pump, rather than the mixture of isoforms available in natural membranes. In order to use expressed isoforms, it was necessary to develop a method for eliminating the large amount of non-pump Ca2+-ATPase found on the surface of almost all cells. COS cell membranes have a large amount of such an ATPase, which makes the measurement of the pump ATPase inaccurate. The uncertainty of ATPase measurements on such membranes is made more acute by the fact that the true Ca2+pump ATPase consists of two components, the ATPase stimulated by Ca2+ and the ATPase stimulated by calmodulin. Since either Mg2+ or Ca2+ also stimulate the non-pump ATPases, only the calmodulin-stimulated component of the pump ATPase can be measured in normal cell membranes. The confusion is further compounded by the fact that the amount of calmodulin stimulation varies, depending on the membrane lipid composition. All of these factors make it impossible to measure the amount of Ca2+pump ATPase in normal cell membranes. Only human erythrocyte membranes are truly exempt from this difficulty, since they are nearly devoid of non-pump ATPases. Because of this situation, our prior studies of the pump using COS cell membranes have been restricted to measurements of Ca2+ uptake.The reconstitution method described here solves this problem by preferentially solubilizing the pump from the membranes and reconstituting it into liposomes. The use of a non-ionic detergent for the extraction solubilizes the pump, while the non-pump ATPases remain insoluble. Although the pump is unstable after long exposures to such detergents, the prompt reconstitution of the pump into liposomes restores its stability. We accomplished the reconstitution by introducing Bio-Beads into the liposome suspension, which removed the detergent used for solubilization. Our experience shows that the amount of non-pump ATPase in these reconstituted liposomes is quite low, and the ATPase due to the pump can easily be measured. Since ATPase activity can be measured continuously by coupled enzyme systems, kinetics studies such as those described here are now possible.By comparing the slopes in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, 6, and 7 with the concentration of reconstituted pump present in the assay medium, we estimated that the activity of the enzyme was 4 to 8 μmol min−1 (mg of pump protein)−1. These numbers compared very well with the activities reported for the purified pump from human red cells (12Graf E. Verma A.K. Gorski J.P. Lopaschuk G. Niggli V. Zurini M. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4511-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Our data showed a difference between isoforms 4a and 4b in the rate of activation of the pump by calmodulin. This difference was in a surprising direction. A previous study showed that isoform 4a required 125 nm calmodulin for half-maximal activation, while isoform 4b required only 18 nm (9Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the affinity of calmodulin for isoform 4a was so much lower than for 4b, we expected the rate of activation of 4a by calmodulin to be even slower than 4b. The results here showed the opposite, with the rate of activation of 4a being about four times faster than that of 4b (Figs. 2 and 3). This result suggested that the rate of inactivation of 4a by loss of calmodulin must be very much faster than that of 4b, in order to give the observed relationship between the affinities of the two isoforms for calmodulin. The results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 showed that this was indeed the case, with the rate of inactivation of 4a being about 30 times faster than that of 4b!The rates of calmodulin binding and dissociation have also been measured for three other calmodulin-activated enzymes: cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and myosin light chain kinase. In all cases the rates were much faster than were observed in this study. For cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase,k 1 was about 60 times faster than for isoform 4b at 2.4 × 108m−1min−1 and k -1 was 0.192 min−1 (14Wang J.H. Sharma R.K. Huang C.Y. Chau V. Chock P.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 356: 190-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For unphosphorylated Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase,k 1 was about 600 times faster at 2.4 × 109m−1 min−1 andk -1 was 130 min−1 (15Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). For myosin light chain kinase, k 1 was about 1700 times faster at 6.6 × 109m−1min−1 and k -1 was 34 min−1 (16Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The same workers also measured the corresponding rates for a 17-residue peptide whose sequence was taken from the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase. For this peptide, k 1 was more than 13,000 times faster at 5.3 × 1010m−1min−1 and k -1 was too slow to measure, being less than 0.6 min−1 (16Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Comparison of the myosin light chain kinase peptide with the intact enzyme indicates that occlusion of the calmodulin-binding domain plays an important role in determining both the rate at which calmodulin binds and its affinity for the enzyme. The rate at which calmodulin bound to the same calmodulin-binding domain was about 80 times faster in the free peptide than in the intact enzyme, and the affinity of the peptide for calmodulin was about 30 times greater. Since the rate of activation of isoform 4b was so much slower than any of the other enzymes, it seems probable that the calmodulin-binding domain of 4b is more occluded than the others, making the penetration of calmodulin to its binding site more difficult.The role of occlusion in determining the rate at which calmodulin binds is shown by the increased rate at which ct92 is activated by calmodulin. Two regions (the calmodulin-binding domain and the downstream inhibitory region) in the carboxyl terminus of isoform 4b inhibit the enzyme by interacting with the catalytic core (7Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ct92, the downstream inhibitory region is removed and the degree of inhibition is less (13Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the calmodulin-binding domain is less occluded. This causes the faster interaction of calmodulin with ct92.The differences between isoforms 4a and 4b are difficult to analyze from a structural point of view. The calmodulin-binding domain of 4a is longer than that of 4b (17Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and has a loop inserted into its middle which does not bind calmodulin (18Verma A.K. Paszty K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 527-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is difficult to tell how these properties would affect the rates of calmodulin binding, but the generally faster rates observed for 4a may indicate that its calmodulin-binding domain is less occluded than that of 4b.The slow binding and dissociation of calmodulin will certainly influence the role of this pump in living cells. The activation of isoform 4b, with t 12 of 46 s, occurs on the same time scale as do the Ca2+ spikes in many kinds of cells. In cells for which 4b is the dominant mechanism of Ca2+ efflux (such as the kinds of cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells), this slow response would allow a full development of the spike before the pump was activated to terminate it. Cells of this type seldom require a rapid reaction to the Ca2+ signal, so that isoform 4b is the appropriate enzyme for Ca2+ efflux in these cells. The inactivation rate observed here for 4b is so slow (t 12 of 23 min) as to imply that cells of this type would require a long period of quiescence before the Ca2+ pump is inactivated. This would tend to prevent a second Ca2+ spike from developing until a long quiet period had elapsed. While this may actually be the case, it is too early to make such a conclusion definitively. The experiments done here were necessarily different from the situation in a living cell. In these experiments, calmodulin was introduced or removed to measure the rates. In a living cell, the driving force for calmodulin binding and dissociation is the rise and fall of the Ca2+concentration. Experiments in which the Ca2+ concentration is increased or decreased will be necessary to settle this problem.Cells which respond more rapidly to calcium signals, such as nerve and muscle cells, will require a more rapidly responding isoform of the pump. 4a is one such isoform, and it is no accident that it is primarily found in such rapidly-responding cells. Studies of isoforms 1, 2, and 3 will be needed to determine where they fit relative to 4a and 4b.By using a doubly integrated theoretical equation combined with computer handling of the data from the spectrophotometer, we were able to take data at the rate of two points per second, and fit all of the data to the theoretical curve. This gave a more accurate fit than the clever and laborious method available to Scharff and Foder in 1982 (1Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which involved making measurements at longer intervals and plotting them on axes which linearized the resulting plot. Even though their measurements were made on erythrocyte ghost membranes and ours were made on reconstituted COS cell membranes, the two methods gave comparable values for k 1 andk -1. At 1.78 μm free Ca2+, Scharff and Foder (1Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) found values of 1.5 × 106 or 2.6 × 106m−1 min−1 fork 1 and 0.035 or 0.051 min−1 fork -1. At 0.72 μm free Ca2+, they found values of 0.27 × 106 or 0.24 × 106m−1min−1 for k 1 and 0.121 or 0.108 min−1 for k -1. The two different values they obtained for each constant were gotten using different types of experiments (1Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus"

To facilitate genetic and biochemical characterization of the adenosine transporter of the parasite, T. gondii tachyzoites were transfected with an insertional mutagenesis vector, and clonal mutants were selected for resistance to the cytotoxic adenosine analog adenine arabinoside (Ara-A). Whereas some Ara-A-resistant clones exhibited disruption of the adenosine kinase (AK) locus, others displayed normal AK activity, suggesting that a second locus had been tagged by the insertional mutagenesis plasmid. These Ara-A r AK+ mutants displayed reduced adenosine uptake capability, implying a defect in adenosine transport. Sequences flanking the transgene integration point in one mutant were rescued from a genomic library of Ara-A r AK+ DNA, and Southern blot analysis revealed that allAra-A r AK+ mutants were disrupted at the same locus. Probes derived from this locus, designatedTgAT, were employed to isolate genomic and cDNA clones from wild-type libraries. Conceptual translation of theTgAT cDNA open reading frame predicts a 462 amino acid protein containing 11 transmembrane domains, a primary structure and membrane topology similar to members of the mammalian equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Expression of TgAT cRNA inXenopus laevis oocytes increased adenosine uptake capacity in a saturable manner, with an apparent K m value of 114 μm.

Remington J.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, congenital toxoplasmosis is a leading source of neurological birth defects (2Roizen N. Swisher C.N. Stein M.A. Hopkins J. Boyer K.M. Holfels E. Mets M.B. Stein L. Patel D. Meier P. Withers S. Remington J. Mack D. Heydemann P.T. Patton D. McLeod R. Pediatrics. 1995; 95: 11-20PubMed Google Scholar). Intolerance of standard treatment regimens has proved to be a major impediment to effective therapy and prevention, especially among AIDS patients (1Luft B.J. Remington J.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), often requiring cessation of treatment. The need for new therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for toxoplasmosis is therefore acute. Rational therapeutic strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases mandate the exploitation of fundamental biochemical or metabolic differences between pathogen and host.The purine salvage pathway offers a multiplicity of potential targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy, as all protozoan parasites (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press Ltd., London1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar), including Toxoplasma (4Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are unable to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo and must therefore salvage purines from their host. Biochemical and genetic analysis has revealed that adenosine is the predominant purine salvaged by T. gondiiand that adenosine kinase (AK)1 is the most active purine salvage enzyme in parasite extracts (5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 41: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to gain access to AK inside the parasite, however, adenosine derived by catabolism of the adenylate nucleotide pools of the host must first traverse the parasite plasma membrane. Adenosine transport therefore plays a critical nutritional role for T. gondii survival and proliferation, and a high capacity, low affinity purine transporter has been described in intact parasites (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, detailed studies on adenosine transport into this important pathogen (and other organisms as well) have been hampered by the lack of molecular reagents for genetic, biochemical, and functional studies.T. gondii is a parasite that is unusually amenable to genetic manipulation, offering several possible approaches for the isolation of molecular clones encoding its adenosine transporter (8Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar,9Boothroyd J.C. Kim K. Pfefferkorn E.R. Sibley L.D. Soldati D. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 6: 1-29Google Scholar). The parasite genome can be tagged by random integration of plasmid DNA containing a selectable marker, followed by the isolation of mutant parasites expressing phenotypes attributable to gene inactivation (10Roos D.S. Sullivan W.J. Striepen B. Bohne W. Donald R.G.K. Methods. 1997; 13: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Tagged loci can then be rescued as molecular clones for further analysis. Insertional mutagenesis and marker rescue strategies have been exploited to identify (and clone) genetic loci encoding theT. gondii uracil- and hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT) enzymes (11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).The adenosine analog arabinosyl adenine (Ara-A) is transported and metabolized by wild-type T. gondii, leading to death of the parasite. Resistance to Ara-A has been employed to isolate T. gondii mutants deficient in AK activity (13Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and insertional mutagenesis was used to genetically tag and clone the AK gene (14Sullivan W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Donald R.G.K. Naguib F.N.M. el Kouni M.H. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several Ara-A-resistant (Ara-Ar) insertional mutants exhibited normal AK activity, however, and these mutants define a second locus encoding the T. gondii adenosine transporter, as described below. Flanking sequences from this locus were employed to isolate cDNA clones predicted to encode a polypeptide with significant similarity to eukaryotic equilibrative nucleoside transporters, and microinjection into Xenopus laevis oocytes confers adenosine transporter activity exhibiting appropriate kinetic properties and substrate specificity. This TgAT cDNA provides a molecular cornerstone for biochemical and pharmacological studies on nucleoside transporter function in T. gondii and other important pathogens.DISCUSSIONWe have exploited insertional mutagenesis (analogous to transposon tagging in other genetic systems) to tag the locus encoding theTgAT adenosine transporter of T. gondii, and probes derived from sequences flanking one transgene insertion enabled the isolation of wild-type TgAT genomic and cDNA clones (Fig. 2). Insertional mutagenesis provides a generally applicable strategy for the isolation of any gene for which a strong negative selection is available, and this approach has previously been exploited to identify several purine and pyrimidine salvage enzymes in T. gondii (5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 42: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as follows: uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, HGXPRT, and AK (11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This report demonstrates the efficacy of such approaches for the isolation of transport mutants as well.That the TgAT gene encodes a functional adenosine transporter is supported by several lines of evidence. First, disruption of the TgAT locus in Ara-Arinsertional mutant RD3 (which contains only a single transgene) is associated with high level Ara-A resistance and a complete abrogation of adenosine transport (Fig. 1). The ability to isolate a transport-defective mutant after insertion of only a single transgene into the parasite genome provides genetic proof that all adenosine entry into the parasite is mediated by a single gene. Second, expression of TgAT cRNA in X. laevis oocytes increases adenosine transport activity by more than 2 orders of magnitude, and this induced transport is saturable, indicative of a facilitated carrier mechanism. Third, the deduced primary structure ofTgAT sequence is similar to well characterized equilibrative nucleoside transporters from mammals (26Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E.

Like other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family,TgAT is not related to members of the mammalian Na+-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporter family (21Fairlamb A.H.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in terms of either amino acid sequence or predicted membrane topology.As TgAT and LdNT1 are evolutionarily distant from the mammalian homologs, the primary structures of these protozoan transporters should be particularly useful for the identification of key amino acids vital for transport function and/or ligand specificity. A multisequence alignment among TgAT and the human and leishmanial equilibrative nucleoside transporters reveals only 26 amino acids common to all four proteins (Fig. 3). Twenty two of the 26 universally conserved residues are found within putative membrane spanning domains, and 9 of these are located within transmembrane segments 7 and 8, suggesting their importance in ligand permeation or substrate recognition. Interestingly, chimeric constructs between the human (h) and rat (r) equilibrative nucleoside transporters hENT1 and rENT1 has implicated membrane spanning domains in the binding of DPA and other coronary vasodilator drugs, although this study implicated domains 3–6 (34Sundaram M.

Of the 26 amino acids common to the 4 aligned nucleoside transporters, 8 were glycine, 6 were phenylalanine, and 4 were proline residues. Conserved aromatic residues have been shown to play important roles in mediating binding and recognition of ring substrates of the human glucose transporter GLUT1 (35Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Lin J.L. Inuka K. Shanahan M.F. Tsukuda K. Kikuchi M.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1077-C1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a mutation in a conserved proline perturbed the glucose transport activity (38Tamori Y. Hashiramoto M. Clark A.E. Mori H. Muraoka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2982-2986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by reducing conformational flexibility. Only 4 of the conserved amino acids, a glutamate, aspartate, arginine, and threonine, were charged or hydrophilic. It is worth noting that despite the enormous amino acid sequence divergence among eukaryotic equilibrative nucleoside transporters, the predicted membrane topologies are strikingly similar, including 11 membrane spanning domains and a long hydrophilic intracellular loop between putative domains 6 and 7 (Fig. 4). These comparisons suggest that higher order structure among nucleoside transporters is far more important for function than primary sequence.Previous studies (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) identified a non-concentrative adenosine transporter activity in intact extracellular T. gondiitachyzoites. These workers reported that transport was inhibited by an 80-fold excess of either inosine, formycin B, or hypoxanthine but not by pyrimidine nucleosides, implying that the T. gondiiadenosine transporter is purine-selective but recognizes a broad spectrum of purine nucleosides and nucleobases (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Adenosine transport was also inhibited by DPA and (marginally) by NBMPR (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the apparent K m of TgAT for adenosine determined in oocytes of 114 μm (see Fig. 8) was virtually identical to the apparent K m value of 120–150 μm obtained in intact parasites (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, our genetic evidence that TgAT is the sole relevant transporter of adenosine in T. gondii and the similar substrate specificities, kinetic parameters, and inhibitor profiles of TgAT assayed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.9) argues that we have cloned the adenosine transporter previously defined by Schwab et al. (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Adenosine is the preferred substrate for purine salvage by T. gondii (5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this nucleoside is not particularly abundant in the host cell cytosol (<1 μm; Ref. 24Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that metabolic flux through adenosine in the host is sufficient to provide for parasite survival. Alternatively (or in addition), adenosine may be produced by parasite-mediated hydrolysis of host ATP pools (∼5 mm). Intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites reside within a parasitophorous vacuole that contains high levels of nucleotide-degrading enzymes (39Bermudes D. Peck K.-R. Afifi Afifi M. Beckers C.J.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), these nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (combined with a plasma membrane 5′-nucleotidase) could produce adenosine for the parasite to transport. Of course, both of these hypotheses presume a plasma membrane location for the T. gondii adenosine transporter, which remains to be demonstrated, and the absence of a detectable parasite 5′-nucleotidase activity casts some uncertainty about the role of host adenylate pools as a direct source of adenosine. 2E. O. Ngo, H. M. Ngo, and K. A. Joiner, submitted for publication. Although inactivation of the TgAT locus eliminates virtually all adenosine transport, this genetic lesion is not fatal, indicating that the parasites remain able to transport other purine nucleosides and/or nucleobases. Although it is likely that failure to transport adenosine precludes access of exogenous purines to AK, HGXPRT provides an alternative route for purine salvage (4Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp.

One other purine transport activity has been identified in T. gondii, an inosine translocator that is inhibited by excess formycin B and hypoxanthine but not by adenosine, adenine, uridine, or thymidine (7Schwab J.C.

The existence of multiple nucleoside transporter activities within a given parasite species is not unique to T. gondii, as a multiplicity of transporters has been distinguished both biochemically and genetically in L. donovani (43Aronow B.

The equilibrative nucleoside transporters of mammals have broad specificity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and vary in both their ability to recognize purine bases and their sensitivity to inhibitors such as DPA, NBMPR, and dilazep (24Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Recent studies inT. gondii indicated that NBMPR is phosphorylated by the AK of T. gondii and is selectively toxic to T. gondii-infected cells suggesting the uptake of NBMPR by T. gondii (42el Kouni M.H. Guarcello V. Al Safarjalani O.N. Naguib F.N.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43 (in press)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not NBMPR is a substrate forTgAT remains to be determined. Members of the Na+-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporter family can be either purine- or pyrimidine-specific (32Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J.

The molecular and evolutionary basis for this divergence is unknown, although a single serine residue has been implicated in substrate discrimination among members of the Na+-dependent nucleoside transporter family (53Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Whether adenosine transport will ultimately prove useful as a therapeutic target is presently unclear. Purine salvage is essential for parasite survival, but adenosine transport-deficient T. gondii are clearly viable, suggesting that inhibition of purine transport as a therapeutic option would require targeting of multiple purine permeases. The logical conjecture is that other purine permeases function to funnel exogenous purines through HGXPRT, and T. gondii certainly express the metabolic machinery to convert purine nucleosides into HGXPRT substrates (4Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol.

It should be possible to identify and characterize these transporters using insertional mutagenesis methods similar to those employed to clone theTgAT locus. Further studies on TgAT and other transporters are likely to provide insight into the mechanisms of purine transport and salvage by T. gondii and facilitate the assessment of purine transporters and salvage enzymes as valid chemotherapeutic targets for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite and the causative agent of toxoplasmic encephalitis in immunosuppressed patients (1Luft B.J. Remington J.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, congenital toxoplasmosis is a leading source of neurological birth defects (2Roizen N. Swisher C.N. Stein M.A. Hopkins J. Boyer K.M. Holfels E. Mets M.B. Stein L. Patel D. Meier P. Withers S. Remington J. Mack D. Heydemann P.T. Patton D. McLeod R. Pediatrics. 1995; 95: 11-20PubMed Google Scholar). Intolerance of standard treatment regimens has proved to be a major impediment to effective therapy and prevention, especially among AIDS patients (1Luft B.J. Remington J.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), often requiring cessation of treatment. The need for new therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for toxoplasmosis is therefore acute. Rational therapeutic strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases mandate the exploitation of fundamental biochemical or metabolic differences between pathogen and host. The purine salvage pathway offers a multiplicity of potential targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy, as all protozoan parasites (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press Ltd., London1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar), including Toxoplasma (4Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are unable to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo and must therefore salvage purines from their host. Biochemical and genetic analysis has revealed that adenosine is the predominant purine salvaged by T. gondiiand that adenosine kinase (AK)1 is the most active purine salvage enzyme in parasite extracts (5Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 41: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to gain access to AK inside the parasite, however, adenosine derived by catabolism of the adenylate nucleotide pools of the host must first traverse the parasite plasma membrane. Adenosine transport therefore plays a critical nutritional role for T. gondii survival and proliferation, and a high capacity, low affinity purine transporter has been described in intact parasites (7Schwab J.C. Afifi Afifi M. Pizzorno G. Handschumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, detailed studies on adenosine transport"
https://openalex.org/W131642856,"Studies of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans have led to the widely held belief that individuals of a given nematode species are characterized by a property known as eutely, in which all individuals have the same total number of cells1. This property, which is peculiar to nematodes and a few other phyla, has raised the question of whether the developmental mechanisms of nematodes differ from those of larger metazoans. Here we show that many, perhaps most, nematode species are not eutelic in at least one organ, the epidermis, and that in this respect they resemble other model organisms such as fruitflies and mice."

The associated viscomagnetic frictional power at the core boundaries may be converted into heat and would destabilize the D"" thermal layer, leading to the generation of deep-mantle plumes, and would also increase the temperature at the fluid core boundaries, perturbing the core dynamo process.

Since the first cloning of PPARα (NR1C1) from mouse (2Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar), three isoforms (α, β (or δ), and γ) have been identified in many organisms, including human, rat, andXenopus (for review, see Ref. 3Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Many studies suggest that PPARα regulates the fatty acid metabolism by controlling the expression of the genes involved in fatty acid oxidation as well as lipoprotein subunits, positively or negatively (3Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PPARγ (NR1C3) seems to govern more versatile physiological processes such as adipocyte differentiation (4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

Moreover, for optimal binding, PPAR requires an extended half-site constituted by the AGGTCA hexanucleotide motif and four extra residues on the 5′-side (11Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M.

This is in contrast to other nuclear receptors forming heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor, e.g. the retinoic acid receptor (NR1B), thyroid hormone receptor (NR1A), and vitamin D receptor (NR1I1) (15Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Many compounds have been identified as ligands of PPAR (3Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The fibrate class of peroxisome proliferators and leukotriene B4 are relatively selective for PPARα, whereas the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic compounds, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, and anti-inflammatory agents are specific for PPARγ. Unsaturated long-chain fatty acids are probably important endogenous ligands common to PPARα and PPARγ. As in most nuclear receptors, PPAR comprises four discrete functional domains, A/B, C, D, and E, in the order from the amino to the carboxyl terminus (15Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

In general, the C region is highly conserved among the nuclear receptor superfamily and contains two zinc finger motifs involved in DNA binding. The E region is the next most highly conserved and contains the ligand-binding site and ligand-dependent activation domain (AF-2). The D region is a hinge domain between the C and E regions and contains sequences important for heterodimerization and the AF-2 activity. The A/B region is the most variable among nuclear receptors and, in many cases, has a ligand-independent gene-activating function (AF-1). The AF-1 region acts independently of AF-2 when tethered to heterologous DNA-binding domains and sometimes synergizes with AF-2 through intramolecular interaction. Regulation of the receptor activities by growth factors and other extracellular signals is often mediated through mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of specific sites in the AF-1 region. For PPAR, AF-1 activities were found in the A/B region of the γ-isoform (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbæk C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified and characterized the AF-1 domain in the A/B region of PPARα. This domain is enriched with acidic amino acids. Mutational analysis combined with CD spectrum analysis of synthetic peptides showed that the helix-forming property, rather than the negative charge itself, is important for the activating function. The expression vector of full-length PPARα was pNCMVPPARα (11Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), constructed by replacing the lacZ gene in the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vector pCMVβ (24MacGregor G.R. Caskey T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) with mouse PPARα cDNA. A deletion construct lacking the A/B region was created by inserting a double-strand linker composed of 5′-TGTCGAATATGTGGGGACAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTCCCCACATATTCGACACATG-3′ between the BstXI site encompassing the initiation codon and the StuI site in the early portion of the C domain-encoding region. The resulting plasmid, pNCMVPPARαΔA/B, codes for a protein sequence in which the initiation methionine is directly linked to the first cysteine residue (Cys102) of the C domain. For constructing the fusion of yeast Gal4-BD and the A/B domain of PPARα, the cDNA sequence of the corresponding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using an upstream primer (5′-CCAGAATTCATGGTGGACACAGAGAGCCCC-3′) and a downstream primer (5′-CGTTGATCACTCGATGTTCAGGGCACTGCC-3′). The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and BclI, yielding two fragments of 76 and 227 base pairs due to the presence of an internalEcoRI site. The longer fragment was first inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the plasmid pCMX-Gal4-N, which encodes a yeast Gal4-BD (amino acids 1–147) and is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The shorter fragment was then inserted at the EcoRI site, and a clone containing the fragment in the correct orientation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The A/B region-coding sequences of mouse PPARγ2 and PPARδ were also amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted in pCMX-Gal4-N. The cDNA sequence of the PPARγ1 A/B region was created from the PPARγ2 sequence, taking advantage of PPARγ2, which has 30 extra amino acid residues at the N terminus compared with the PPARγ1 sequence, and also, the sequence C-terminal to the second methionine (Met31) is identical to that of PPARγ1. Thus, the region from the NcoI site encompassing the Met31 codon to the position corresponding to the end of the PPARγ2 A/B domain was cleaved and inserted in pCMX-Gal4-N. For assaying the transcriptional activation by PPAR constructs containing the C region, a reporter vector, pAOXPPREluc (11Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), containing the PPAR-binding site and the basal promoter derived from the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene was used (25Osumi T. Wen J.K. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For assaying the activation by Gal4 fusion constructs, tk-GALpx3-luc, containing three copies of the Gal4-binding sites (upstream activation site (UAS)) and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was mostly used. tk-GALpx1-luc, containing one copy of the Gal4-binding site, was also used in some experiments. This construct was accidentally produced by recombination during amplification in bacteria. Deletion constructs of the PPARα A/B region were produced by cutting pCMX-Gal4-PPARαA/B with restriction enzymes having recognition sites in the A/B region-coding sequence. These enzymes were EcoRI (encompassing the codons for Glu26 and Phe27), SacI (Ser45), ScaI (Tyr56), andPvuII (Ser82). DNA sequence coding for the portion C-terminal to amino acid residue 15 was created by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The HeLa human cervical cancer cell line was used in most experiments, whereas the HepG2 human hepatoma line and the CV-1 monkey kidney cell line were used in some cases. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar) with slight modifications. For transfection, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and cultured overnight. The following day, each dish received DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates containing 1 μg of the expression vector of a PPAR construct, 4 μg of an appropriate luciferase reporter plasmid, and 4 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMVβ) as a reference. After 4 h, the precipitates were removed, and the cells were cultured for 40 h in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm ciprofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator. Cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (11Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the β-galactosidase activity. Three or more independent assays were carried out for most series of experiments, and the results are expressed as mean relative values ± S.D. To analyze the secondary structure of the N-terminal region of PPARα, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 21–39 (SPLSEEFLQEMGNIQEISQ) was synthesized on an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Shimadzu PSSM-8) using Tenta Gel TG-RAM resin and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Three extra amino acids (GGY-amide) were attached to the C terminus to make the spectrophotometric determination of peptide concentration feasible without affecting the CD signal (27Doig A.J. Chakrabartty A. Klingler T.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutant peptides containing amino acid substitutions were also synthesized. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column, and their respective molecular masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Shimadzu/Kratos Kompact MALDI II). The CD spectra of these peptides were recorded on a Jasco J-720 CD spectrometer at pH 6.8 in the presence of 0–40% trifluoroethanol (TFE). We first examined whether the transcriptional activating function is affected when the A/B region is deleted from PPARα. When the full-length PPARα expression vector was transfected together with the luciferase reporter vector carrying a single copy of the peroxisome proliferator response element of rat acyl-CoA oxidase, the luciferase expression was enhanced 15-fold as compared with the value obtained with an empty expression vector, pCMVNot (Fig.1, bars 1 and 5). The luciferase expression was further stimulated nearly 4-fold in the presence of ciprofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator (Fig. 1, bar 6). When PPARα with the A/B region deleted was expressed, the luciferase activity decreased by 60–70% in either the presence or absence of ciprofibrate (Fig. 1, bars 3 and 4). Thus, deletion of the A/B region from PPARα decreased the transcriptional activating function ∼3-fold without affecting inducibility by ciprofibrate. We next investigated whether the PPARα A/B region has a ligand-independent activating function (AF-1). For this purpose, we constructed plasmids in which the coding sequence of the A/B region as well as full-length PPARα was tethered to the Gal4-BD-coding sequence. When the fusion construct of full-length PPARα was cotransfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing three copies of Gal4-UAS (tk-GALpx3-luc), strong transcriptional activation dependent on ciprofibrate was observed (Fig.2 A). The scale of ligand dependence was much larger than that obtained with unfused PPARα on the reporter gene driven by the peroxisome proliferator-response element (compare Figs. 1 and 2 A). On the other hand, the fusion construct of the A/B region and Gal4-BD exhibited ∼10-fold activation as compared with the activity of simple Gal4-BD in either the presence or absence of ciprofibrate. Similar results were obtained with tk-GALpx1-luc, which contains a single copy of UAS (data not shown). We compared the AF-1 activities of the PPARα, PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and PPARδ isoforms, all of mouse origin (Fig. 2 B). Under the assay conditions, the AF-1 activity of PPARα was significantly higher than that of other isoforms. The A/B region of PPARγ2 exhibited a small AF-1 activity, but the activity were negligible for PPARγ1 and PPARδ. Much higher AF-1 activity was reported for PPARγ2 compared with PPARγ1 (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbæk C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We tried to narrow down the PPARα AF-1 region in the Gal4-BD fusion context (Fig. 3). When the A/B region sequence was deleted stepwise from the C-terminal side starting at amino acid 101, the construct containing amino acids 1–44 exhibited almost full AF-1 activity, whereas that containing amino acids 1–27 did not. On the other hand, deletion of 14 residues from the N-terminal side decreased the reporter expression by 70%, and deletion of the first 25 residues completely removed the activity. Hence, AF-1 activity is assigned to the N-terminal 44-amino acid sequence, in particular to residues 15–44. We confirmed for representative constructs that the fusion proteins were correctly expressed in the transfected cells. Proteins of the expected sizes were detected by Western blotting with anti-Gal4-BD antibody for Gal4-BD and Gal4 fusion constructs with the PPARα A/B region (amino acids 1–27 and 1–55) (Fig.4, lanes 1–4). The expression levels were comparable except for the wild-type PPARα A/B region fusion construct, which exhibited significantly lower expression reproducibly in repeated experiments. The amino acid sequence of the A/B region of PPARα is shown in Fig.5 A. This region consists of 101 amino acid residues and contains 18 acidic residues, but no basic residues. The region of amino acids 15–44 that was minimally essential for transactivation was particularly enriched with acidic residues in which 10 out of 30 residues were acidic. Thus, the AF-1 region of PPARα seemed to be a typical acidic activation domain. To examine the roles of acidic residues, we performed point mutation studies on the Gal4-BD-PPARαA/B background. We changed doublets of acidic residues (Asp17-Asp18, Glu25-Glu26, and Glu43-Glu44) to asparagine doublets (mutants dm1–3) (Fig. 5 A) and also made combinations of these mutations. Thus, up to six negative charges were removed from the original 10. We did not use glutamine for glutamic acid to avoid the possible creation of a glutamine-rich activation domain. Series of asparagine substitutions were successfully employed for a viral acidic activator, VP16 (28Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Individual doublet mutations of the acidic residues had only a marginal effect on AF-1 activity (Fig.6 A). Combinations of two doublet mutations exhibited a significant decrease in AF-1 activity compared with the AF-1 activity of the wild-type A/B region, particularly the combination of dm1 and dm2. The effect of dm3 seemed smaller than those of dm1 and dm2. The combination of the three doublet mutations resulted in only a slightly larger decrease in the activity compared with the dm1/dm2 combination, and even this mutant still retained a significant level of transcriptional activation as compared with Gal4-BD (2.6-fold). We confirmed these results with the (UAS)1 reporter and also with two other cell lines, HepG2 and CV-1 (data not shown). The results support the importance of acidic residues for AF-1 activity, but the effects of mutations were unexpectedly small if the negative charges themselves are important. The secondary structure of the PPARα A/B region predicted by the Chou-Fasman method (29Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 5 B. Strikingly, almost the whole region minimally essential for AF-1 activity was deduced to take the α-helical configuration. In helical wheel analysis (30Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) of region acid 15–44, most of the acidic amino acids were found on one side, whereas the hydrophobic residues were on the other (Fig. 5 C). Thus, this region seemed to form an amphiphilic α-helix. Doublet mutations dm1 and dm2 were likely to break the helical structure locally, and the combination of dm1 and dm2 expanded the unstructured region additively (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, mutation dm3, which was less effective in decreasing the AF-1 activity in the transfection assay, did not seem to affect the configuration of the main part of the AF-1 domain, either by itself or in combination with other mutations. These predictions led us to assume that the protein structure, rather than the negative charges, in this region was important. To examine this possibility, we searched for other mutations that were expected to break the α-helix based on the Chou-Fasman prediction. We found that Met31 contributes to a great extent to the helix-forming probability. Substitution of Met31 with Gly or Ala was predicted to change the configuration between residues 31 and 38 from α-helix to β-sheet (Fig. 5 B,bottom). Accordingly, we made fusion proteins of M31G and M31A mutant versions of the PPARα A/B region and Gal4-BD. The AF-1 activity was mostly lost in both mutants, with the effect of M31G being more severe than that of M31A (18.6 and 26.9% active as compared with the wild type, respectively) (Fig. 6 B). We also investigated the effects of combinations of the M31G or M31A mutation with dm1, dm2, or dm3. The dm series of mutations resulted in no further decrease in the AF-1 activity over the M31G or M31A mutation (data not shown). We confirmed that the M31G, M31A, and dm3 fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels in the cells upon transfection of the respective expression vectors as compared with Gal4-BD and two deletion mutants (Fig. 4). We next examined whether these mutations indeed broke the α-helical structure by CD spectrum analysis of the synthetic peptides corresponding to the wild-type and mutant AF-1 sequences. We first predicted the α-helical contents of a series of peptides using the AGADIR algorithm (31Muñoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to select the peptide sequences to be synthesized. The peptide sequence 21–39 attached with the GGY tripeptide at the C terminus was expected to have an α-helical content of 4.05% at pH 7.0 (Fig.7 A), whereas M31G and M31A exhibited α-helical contents of 1.00 and 1.73%, respectively. The relative order in helical contents of these peptides did not change when calculation was performed on longer peptide sequences, and the highest values were obtained with the above segment. The E25N/E26N double mutant (dm2) was also expected to have a significantly lower α-helical content. Conversely, we found that the M31L and E26R mutants have the highest predicted helical contents among the possible mutants at residues 31 and 26, respectively. The E26R/M31L double mutant was expected to have an even higher helical content. Based on these predictions, we synthesized the above peptides and measured the CD spectra in the presence and absence of TFE (Fig.7 B). Because the absolute ellipticity values at 222 nm ([θ]222) of the peptides in the absence of TFE were too small to be compared, increasing concentrations of TFE, which is known to stabilize native-like helical structures by strengthening peptide hydrogen bonds, were added to evaluate the helix-forming properties of these peptides. The difference in [θ]222 among peptides was expanded at higher TFE concentrations. The E25N/E26N double mutant (dm2) responded to TFE in an unusual manner, exhibiting almost no spectral change around 222 nm, even when the TFE concentration was raised to 40%. This mutant peptide might have an abnormal secondary structure in solution. The three other mutant peptides were also analyzed, and the calculated α-helical contents at 30% TFE are shown in Fig. 7 C. As expected, M31G and M31A had lower α-helical contents and M31L had a higher α-helical content compared with the wild type. On the other hand, mutation E26R did not increase the α-helical content, contrary to the prediction using the AGADIR algorithm. Thus, mutant E26R had a slightly lower α-helical content compared with the wild type, whereas the value of E26R/M31L was intermediate between those of the wild type and M31L. Based on these results, we produced mutant Gal4-BD-PPARαA/B fusion constructs carrying the mutations M31L, E26R, and E26R/M31L. In the transfection assay, M31L had a strikingly higher AF-1 activity than the wild type (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, E26R had a slightly lower AF-1 activity than the wild type, whereas E26R/M31L had an activity intermediate between those of M31L and the wild type. Thus, change in the charge by +2 in mutant E26R did not drastically affect the transcriptional activating function, as in the case of mutant dm2. We plotted the AF-1 activities of wild-type and mutant constructs against the α-helical contents of corresponding peptides (Fig.7 C). AF-1 activity correlated well with the helical content following an exponential function, suggesting the importance of the α-helix-forming property of this region. We introduced the mutations into the whole PPARα protein sequence. When the expression vectors of mutant PPARs were cotransfected with the reporter vector driven by a peroxisome proliferator response element, M31G exhibited a lower transactivation than wild-type PPARα in both the presence and absence of the peroxisome proliferator (Fig. 1). The M31L mutation yielded a slight increase in activity compared with the wild type, and the difference between the activities of M31L and M31G was quite significant. The effects of these mutations in the intact PPARα context were smaller than those in the Gal4 fusion context, possibly due to the structural constraint. The activities of the wild type and the two mutants, however, were in the same order as those of the Gal4 fusion constructs of the A/B region mutants. These results indicate that a ligand-independent transactivating function is located in the A/B region of mouse PPARα. The sequence important for the activity is restricted to region 1–44, particularly amino acids 15–44. After completion of this study, the AF-1 activity of human PPARα and its regulation through phosphorylation were reported (32Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but the minimally essential region was not specified. The main part of the AF-1 region is highly enriched with acidic residues and devoid of any basic residue. Thus, this region seems to be a typical acidic activation domain. The results of mutation studies, however, raised a question concerning the importance of the negative charge itself. Rather, these results together with the CD spectrum analysis of synthetic peptides suggest the importance of the α-helix-forming properties of this region, i.e. the mutations resulting in a higher helical content gave higher AF-1 activity and vice versa. Helical wheel analysis suggests that this region takes an amphiphilic α-helix. These characteristics are consistent with reported results on acidic activation domains of other proteins: the importance of the negative charge itself was not supported by mutation studies on the viral activator VP16 (33Sullivan S.M. Horn P.J. Olson V.A. Koop A.H. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Triezenberg S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4487-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Involvement of the α-helical structure induced by the interaction with one of the TATA-binding protein associated factors, TAFII31, was shown by an NMR study on VP16 (34Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The importance of the amphiphilic α-helix was also shown in a crystallographic study on the complex of the acidic activation domain of p53 and the attenuator protein MDM2 (35Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). The TFE-induced formation of the α-helix in the PPARα AF-1 region possibly mimics the structural change induced by a protein-protein interaction. Comparison of several acidic activation domains as well as mutation analysis led to a proposal regarding the importance of the FXXφφ motif (34Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), where φ denotes a hydrophobic amino acid. In PPARα, sequence 27–31 corresponds with this motif at Phe27 and Met31, but not at Glu30. The importance of the primary structure including several aromatic and hydrophobic residues was proposed based on sequence comparison among the AF-1 regions of nuclear receptors (36Folkers G.E. van Heede E.C. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23552-23559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The AF-1 region of PPARα contains only one aromatic residue (Phe27) and has no significant similarity to the proposed consensus sequence. Thus, the AF-1 region of PPARα seems to share the proposed characteristics only imperfectly with other acidic activation domains. For PPAR isoforms, phosphorylation at the mitogen-activated protein kinase sites in the A/B regions has been highlighted in relation to AF-1 activity. PPARα was shown to be a phosphoprotein (38Shalev A. Siegrist K.C. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and very recently, the phosphorylation sites were mapped at Ser12and Ser21 (32Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E.

It has also been shown that phosphorylation is promoted by insulin, potentiating the AF-1 activity. The second phosphorylation site (Ser21) is located within the essential region of AF-1 characterized in this study. How phosphorylation at these sites affects the protein structure of the AF-1 region of PPARα would be an interesting issue. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser82 of PPARγ1 or Ser112 of PPARγ2 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase family has been reported by many researchers (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G.

Others (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbæk C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Shao D.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), however, presented contradictory results, claiming potentiation of the activating function of PPARγ as well as promotion of adipogenesis by phosphorylation. Ligand-independent AF-1 activities were shown in the A/B regions of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbæk C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the latter being markedly more active. On the other hand, Shao et al. (22Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) documented an interdomain communication between the A/B and ligand-binding domains of PPARγ, resulting in modulation of ligand-binding affinity. The AF-1 activities of many nuclear receptors have significant functions in regulating the transcriptional regulatory activity, not simply by conferring the activating function in the absence of ligands, but more important, by synergizing with AF-2. Functional interactions between AF-1 and AF-2, direct or indirect, were observed in several instances (e.g. Ref. 39Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 40Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interaction of AF-1 regions with coactivators has also been reported for several nuclear receptors (17Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L.

Comparison of Figs. 1 and 2 suggests that PPARα AF-1 also synergistically activates transcription together with AF-2, as found in other nuclear receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2112133599,"The Acanthamoeba myosin-IA heavy chain gene encodes a 134-kDa protein with a catalytic domain, three potential light chain binding sites, and a tail with separately folded tail homology (TH) -1, -2, and -3 domains. TH-1 is highly resistant to trypsin digestion despite consisting of 15% lysine and arginine. TH-2/3 is resistant to α-chymotrypsin digestion. The peptide link between TH-1 and TH-2/3 is cleaved by trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, and endo-AspN but not V8 protease. The CD spectra of TH-2/3 indicate predominantly random structure, turns, and β-strands but no α-helix. The hydrodynamic properties of TH-2/3 (Stokes' radius of 3.0 nm, sedimentation coefficient of 1.8 S, and molecular mass of 21.6 kDa) indicate that these domains are as long as the whole myosin-I tail in reconstructions of electron micrographs. Furthermore, separately expressed and purified TH-1 binds with high affinity to TH-2/3. Thus we propose that TH-1 and TH-2/3 are arranged side by side in the myosin-IA tail. Separate TH-1, TH-2, and TH-2/3 each binds muscle actin filaments with high affinity. Salt inhibits TH-2/3 binding to muscle actin but not amoeba actin filaments. TH-1 enhances binding of TH-2/3 to muscle actin filaments at physiological salt concentration, indicating that TH-1 and TH-2/3 cooperate in actin binding. An intrinsic fluorescence assay shows that TH-2/3 also binds with high affinity to the protein Acan125 similar to the SH3 domain of myosin-IC. Phylogenetic analysis of SH3 sequences suggests that myosin-I acquired SH3 domain after the divergence of the genes for myosin-I isoforms.

The hydrodynamic properties of TH-2/3 (Stokes' radius of 3.0 nm, sedimentation coefficient of 1.8 S, and molecular mass of 21.6 kDa) indicate that these domains are as long as the whole myosin-I tail in reconstructions of electron micrographs. Furthermore, separately expressed and purified TH-1 binds with high affinity to TH-2/3. Thus we propose that TH-1 and TH-2/3 are arranged side by side in the myosin-IA tail. Separate TH-1, TH-2, and TH-2/3 each binds muscle actin filaments with high affinity. Salt inhibits TH-2/3 binding to muscle actin but not amoeba actin filaments. TH-1 enhances binding of TH-2/3 to muscle actin filaments at physiological salt concentration, indicating that TH-1 and TH-2/3 cooperate in actin binding. An intrinsic fluorescence assay shows that TH-2/3 also binds with high affinity to the protein Acan125 similar to the SH3 domain of myosin-IC. Phylogenetic analysis of SH3 sequences suggests that myosin-I acquired SH3 domain after the divergence of the genes for myosin-I isoforms. tail homology kilobase pairs 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glutathione S-transferase reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiothreitol untranslated region trifluoroethanol hydroxylapatite thioredoxin 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid base pair The myosin superfamily consists of at least 15 classes distinguished by the sequences of their catalytic domains but also differing in the structure of their tails. Class I unconventional myosins are the best characterized with the exception of myosin-II, the conventional myosin of muscle and non-muscle cells. Thirty eight members of the myosin-I family have been identified in 12 organisms at the protein and DNA levels. Many of these organisms express multiple myosin-Is with similar catalytic domains but with different tails, which are presumed to target myosin-I isoforms to various intracellular locations (1Goodson H.V.

Myosin-I tails differ in sequence and domain organization, but less is known about their affinity for various ligands. Biochemical and structural studies on a range of myosin-I molecules are required to understand how the diverse tails determine function. Acanthamoeba myosin-Is were the first unconventional myosins discovered. The three known isoforms (myosin-IA, -IB, and -IC) have heavy chains of 128–140 kDa and light chains of 17–27 kDa (5Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

The sequences of myosin-IB and myosin-IC show that they contain a conserved catalytic domain, a single light chain binding site, a basic region called TH-11 (for tail homology-1), a Gly/Pro/Ala-rich (GPA) region called TH-2, and a 55-residue src homology 3 domain called TH-3. Myosin-IA had not been sequenced. The three tail regions are sequential in myosin-IB, but the SH3 domain of myosin-IC splits TH-2 into two parts. Transient kinetic analysis (10Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) revealed that the catalytic mechanisms of myosin-IA and myosin-IB are similar to each other and to muscle myosin, so it is likely that the tails of these myosins account for their unique functions. The tail domains of Acanthamoeba myosin-Is bind various ligands. The basic TH-1 domain binds acidic phospholipids (11Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 25 kDa of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC (consisting of TH-2 and TH-3) (11Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal 30-kDa α-chymotryptic fragment of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA (12Lynch T.J. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. Robinson E.A. Bowers B. Fujisaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17156-17162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bind actin filaments in the presence and absence of ATP. GST fusion proteins with TH-2 fromDictyostelium long-tail myosin-Is also bind actin filaments with high affinity (13Jung G. Hammer J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The only protein ligand, other than actin, for Acanthamoeba myosin-I tail is Acan125, identified by its ability to bind via PXXP motifs to the SH3 domain ofAcanthamoeba myosin-IC in co-immunoprecipitation andin vitro binding experiments (15Xu P. Zot A.S. Zot H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25316-25319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The biological function of Acan125 is unclear, but it consists of leucine-rich repeats known to mediate protein-protein interactions. The SH3 domain plays an important role in the functions of long-tail myosin-Is, sinceDictyostelium myoB without TH-3 fails to complement the null phenotype (17Novak K.D. Titus M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interaction with receptor protein via TH-3 may contribute to localization of myosin-I molecules, as described for yeast myosin-Is and verprolin Vrp1p (18Anderson B.L. Boldogh I. Evangelista M. Boone C. Greene L.A. Pon L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1357-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We determined the biochemical and hydrodynamic properties of individual domains of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA tail, revealing novel features. The TH-1 domain contributes to actin binding and binds tightly to the TH-2/3 domains. Hydrodynamic data suggest that TH-2/3 must fold back onto TH-1. This biochemical evidence is consistent with three-dimensional reconstructions of electron micrographs of myosin-Is attached to actin filaments (19Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Jontes J.D. Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. Milligan R.A. J.

Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved myosin ATP-binding site (QCVIISGESGAGKTEASK) and to myosin-IA-specific phosphorylation site (AGTTYALNLNKM) (22Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19340-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to amplify a 1-kb fragment, SUB01, from an Acanthamoeba genomic library constructed in the λ phage vector (a gift from Dr. Eric Bateman, University of Vermont). SUB01 was used to screen the genomic library for the myosin-IA gene. From eight positive phage clones, we selected the largest fragment containing SUB01 by restriction mapping and Southern analyses. A 9-kb BamHI fragment was cloned into pBluescript. This fragment did not span the entire myosin-IA gene. We used a 250-bp SalI-BamHI fragment from the 3′ end of the 9-kb BamHI fragment as a probe to identify an overlapping 1.6-kb SalI fragment from the parent phage. Both 9-kb BamHI and 1.6-kb SalI fragments were subcloned into smaller sizes for sequencing on both strands by primer walking. We used 10% formamide in our dideoxy sequencing reactions (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to eliminate “stalling” of DNA polymerase at GC-rich sequences (23Zhang W. Hu G.Y. Deisseroth A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We cloned three cDNA fragments of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA coding for the IQ, TH-1, -2, and -3 domains by RT-PCR using either poly(A) mRNA (data not shown) or total RNA as template (Fig.1 D). Total RNA was isolated from 6 g ofAcanthamoeba in mid-log phase. Cells were lysed with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 80 ml of TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and processed according to the manufacturer. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A) Quik mRNA Isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Reverse transcription of total or poly(A) mRNA was performed at 42 °C for 1 h using Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) with primer R (TTAGATGTCCTCGACGTAGTT). Subsequent PCR reactions were done in 20% glycerol using Elongase Enzyme Mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) with reverse primer R and forward primer 1 (ATAACTACATCGGCAACGACC), primer 2 (CTGCGTGAGAACTATTGGC) or primer 3 (GCGAGTTCAAGAACCTCTCGC). RT-PCR products were cloned into pBluescript for restriction analyses and sequencing. Northern blotting of Acanthamoeba RNA was performed as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We used the cDNA sequences of the RT-PCR products to map intron/exon boundaries in the gene sequence coding for the IQ, TH-1, -2, and -3 domains. We predicted the intron/exon boundaries in the gene sequence coding for the catalytic domain of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA. First, we took advantage of the fact that myosin-I catalytic domain is highly conserved. We compared the Acanthamoeba myosin-IA gene sequence with those in the data base using tBlastx function of BLAST (translated DNA queryversus translated DNA data base) (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) to identify putative exons coding for the catalytic domain. We then searched for the usually conserved 5′ (GTAC) and 3′ (CCAG) splice site sequences flanking the putative exons. These 5′ donor site and 3′ acceptor site sequences were identified in other cloned Acanthamoeba genes: TFIID (26Wong J.M. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), myosin-IB (8Jung G. Schmidt C.J. Hammer J.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 82: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), myosin-IC (7Jung G. Korn E.D. Hammer J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6720-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), actin I (27Nellen W. Gallwitz D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), HMWMI (28Horowitz J.A. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20646-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and myosin-II (29Hammer J.D. Bowers B. Paterson B.M. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We predicted the start codon of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA based on alignment with and what is found for Acanthamoebamyosin-IB and myosin-IC genes, in which the start codon was immediately followed by a 5′ donor splice site. Constructs of tail domains are shown in Fig.1 C. We chose the N terminus of the A123 construct to be immediately downstream of the third IQ motif at residue 757 using the crystal structure of scallop myosin light chain domain as a reference (30Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We chose the N terminus of A23 construct to be residue 985, the same as the N terminus of the 30-kDa α-chymotryptic fragment of native myosin-IA (12Lynch T.J. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. Robinson E.A. Bowers B. Fujisaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17156-17162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the RT-PCR product and appropriate primers to amplify the following constructs: A123 (residues 757–1215), A1 (residues 757–984), A2 (residues 985–1161), and A23 (residues 985–1215). Each PCR product was ligated into pMW172 vector (31Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) atNdeI and BamHI sites. All final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. We expressed all constructs in freshly transformed Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain (Stratagene). Cells were grown overnight at 16 °C in 500 ml of LB/carbenicillin to A 600 = 0.2, induced for expression with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at 16 °C, and harvested. One gram of pelleted cells was resuspended in 25 ml of IPED (IPED, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) buffer with 5 μg/ml aprotinin and 200 μm leupeptin and sonicated 4 times for 30 s with a sonicator tip of 1.2 cm in diameter (Sonifier 450, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) at level 8 and with 4 min incubation on ice between each burst. Crude lysate was spun at 105,000 × g for 30 min to obtain soluble A123. When bacteria were grown at 37 °C rather than 16 °C, >90% of A123 pelleted at 100,000 ×g. Soluble A123 was partially purified by gel filtration on a 2.5 × 99-cm Sephacryl S300 column equilibrated with IPED buffer. Protein was monitored by dye binding (Bio-Rad Protein Assay, Bio-Rad) and A123 by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. A123 migrated in the void volume together with polynucleotides (DNA/RNA) as determined by UV absorbance and agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing A123 were pooled and used for assessment of domain boundaries (see below). Further purification of A123 from S300 fraction was difficult due to tightly bound bacterial nucleic acids. Hydroxylapatite chromatography in 50% formamide removed all detectable nucleic acids and yielded about 500 μg of pure A123 from 1 g of bacteria. Upon removal of formamide, purified A123 was only soluble at pH >9.5. Unlike A123, cells were grown at 37 °C in 650 ml of LB/carbenicillin for 25 h and harvested. For a typical preparation, 3–5 g of bacteria were lysed by sonication in 60 ml of IPED buffer with 0.1 m KCl, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm leupeptin. After clarification, saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7, was added slowly to 20% saturation with gentle stirring for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was pelleted at 100,000 ×g for 15 min and discarded. Similarly the 20–40% fraction was collected by 100,000 × g, and all of the A23 was solubilized in 9 ml of lysis buffer. We detected no A23 in ammonium sulfate precipitates below 20% or above 40% saturation by SDS-PAGE. After dialysis in IPED buffer and clarification at 3000 ×g for 10 min, the 20–40% fraction was passed through a 1 × 9-cm DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with IPED to remove nucleic acids and other bacterial proteins. 7.5 ml of DEAE flow-through was loaded directly on a 1.5 × 99-cm column of Sephacryl S200 (Sigma) equilibrated with IPED with 0.5 m KCl. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and assayed as above. Fractions containing A23 were pooled and dialyzedversus 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.5m KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT. Dialyzed S200 pool was loaded onto a 0.8 × 9-cm column of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP Gel, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. Purified A23 flowed through this hydroxylapatite. Hydroxylapatite flow-through was dialyzed into appropriate buffer and concentrated on a Centricon-3 ultrafilter (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The identity of A23 was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing and by immunoblotting with M1.7 monoclonal antibody (32Hagen S.J. Kiehart D.P. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified A23 was free of DNA/RNA contaminants as determined by UV absorbance (280/260 nm ≈ 2). We measured the concentration of purified A23 using extinction coefficients determined from analytical ultracentrifugation experiments: 0.631 A 280nm/mg/ml/cm or 0.186A 295nm/mg/ml/cm. A typical preparation yielded about 3 mg of A23 from 3 to 5 g of bacteria cells, compared with a yield of less than 3 mg of purified Acanthamoeba myosin-IA from 1 kg of amoebas (5Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Maruta H. Gadasi H. Collins J.H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3624-3630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified A23 was very stable, showing no degradation over 50 h at 23 °C during sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Purification of untagged A23 is crucial for obtaining correct measurement of hydrodynamic properties. A23 with a (His)6-tag aggregated artificially judging from zero length chemical cross-linking and Superdex-S200 gel filtration experiments in 0.1 or 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7. Bacterial expression also yields much larger quantities of pure A23 than digestion of Acanthamoeba myosin-IA with α-chymotrypsin (12Lynch T.J. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. Robinson E.A. Bowers B. Fujisaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17156-17162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to A23, cells were grown and lysed, and crude lysate was ammonium sulfate-fractionated and passed through a column of DEAE-Sepharose in IPED buffer. However, the DEAE flow-through was loaded on a 1 × 9-cm column of CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in IPED buffer. After elution with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in IPED, the fractions containing pure A2 were pooled and dialyzed versus IPED buffer before actin co-pelleting assays. Cells were grown at 30 °C overnight in 500 ml of LB/carbenicillin and harvested. Typically, 1–2 g of bacteria were lysed by sonication in 60 ml of IPED buffer with 0.1 mKCl, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm leupeptin. Insoluble A1 was recovered by pelleting at 105,000 × g for 30 min, extracted with a Dounce homogenizer in 6 m urea/IPED buffer, and loaded on a 1.5 × 17-cm CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same solvent. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in IPED buffer. Fractions containing A1 were pooled and passed through a 1.5 × 17-cm column of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with 6 m urea, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT to remove nucleic acids and other bacterial proteins. HA flow-through was loaded on a 1.5 × 75-cm column of Sephacryl S200 equilibrated with 6 m urea/IPED. Pure A1 was pooled and refolded by dialysis in five sequential steps of decreasing urea concentration into a final buffer containing 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. We clarified refolded A1 at 105,000 × g for 30 min. The identity of soluble A1 was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. A1 was free of DNA and RNA contaminants as determined by UV absorbance. The yield from 1 g of bacteria was 650 μg of A1 at a concentration of 1 μm. A1 was soluble at concentrations ≤1 μm but aggregated at higher concentrations. A1 aggregated during storage at 0 °C, so binding assays described below were performed within 2 days of urea removal. The expression and purification of TrxAD3 and Trx-AD3Δ-(977–994) were modified to increase purity. Soluble bacterial lysate was fractionated with 20–40% saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7. The precipitate was solubilized, dialyzed, and gel-filtered in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 300 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT on a 1.5 × 74-cm column of Sephacryl S300. Fractions containing thioredoxin fusion proteins were pooled and dialyzed versus 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, and 300 mm KCl. Next, sample was loaded onto a 1.5 × 9-cm column of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a 0–0.2 m gradient of potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Hydroxylapatite fractions containing thioredoxin fusion proteins were dialyzed versus 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm KCl and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8, for nickel chromatography as described by Xu et al. (16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pooled S300 fractions of A123 (0.5 mg/ml) were treated for 10, 20, 30, or 60 min with proteolytic enzymes in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT (20 ng/μl trypsin (Sigma) at 0 °C, 4 ng/μl endo-AspN (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0 °C, 10 ng/μl V8 protease (Sigma) at 23 °C, or 10 ng/μl α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) at 23 °C). Reactions were terminated with 10 mm Pefabloc and 10 mm EDTA and frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen. Boiling sample buffer was subsequently added, and digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie or transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Bands on polyvinylidene difluoride were visualized by Amido Black staining and excised for N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation by Dr. W. Fischer of the Salk Institute. Stokes' radius (R S) was measured by gel filtration in 0.5m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA on a 1.4 × 96-cm column of Sephacryl S200 calibrated with blue dextran (void volume), bovine serum albumin (3.55 nm), ovalbumin (3.05 nm), carbonic anhydrase (2.36 nm), chymotrypsinogen A (2.09 nm), cytochrome c (1.7 nm), and ATP (salt volume). Stokes' radius of A23 was obtained from plot of erfc−1 of the partition coefficientsversus Stokes' radius according to Ackers (33Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3237-3238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Acanthamoeba(34Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or rabbit skeletal muscle (35Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) actin was polymerized for 2 h at room temperature in 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0, 20, 40, or 60 mm KCl. Purified A23 at 0.1–0.3 μm was incubated with various concentrations of polymerized actin in final 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0, 20, 40, or 60 mm KCl. The mixtures were centrifuged at 95,000 rpm (rotor TLA 120.2, Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) for 30 min at 23 °C. The supernatants were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and evaporated to dryness in an Eppendorf Concentrator (model 5301, Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY). Each sample was resuspended in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE with a range of A23 standards and stained with Coomassie. A23 was quantified by densitometry of wet gels and analyzed with NIH image software. Binding results were plotted as bound A23 versus total actin concentration, and fit by Equation 1. [A23]bound=(Kd+[A23]+[A])−(Kd+[A23]+[A])2−(4[A23][A])2Equation 1 where [A23]bound is the concentration of A23 bound to actin filaments, [A] is the total actin concentration, [A23] is the total A23 concentration, and K d is the dissociation equilibrium constant. A1 ± A23 pelleting with muscle actin filaments was done in 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 60 mm KCl. Purified A1 at about 0.02 μm ± A23 at about 0.02 μm were incubated with various concentrations of polymerized actin. After centrifugation, the pellets or air-dried supernatants were analyzed as above. CD spectra were collected in an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, NJ) using the manufacturer's 60DS software. Purified A23 samples at 0.263 or 0.132 mg/ml in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, ± 250 mm NaF, ± 50% TFE were placed in a 0.5-mm cell at 22 °C and scanned 4 times between 260 and 185 nm with an integration time of 1 s, a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, a collection frequency of 1 nm/point, and a photomultiplier tube voltage of <390 V at 185 nm. No post-collection smoothing was applied to the data. Buffer spectra were subtracted from sample spectra. The raw data were converted to mean residue ellipticity using the mean residue weight calculated from the composition and the concentration determined by extinction coefficient at 295 nm. Spectral deconvolutions by the method of Yang et al. (36Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) employed the program PROSEC (DOS version) supplied by Aviv. Spectral deconvolution by the method of Bohm et al.(37Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) employed CDNN (version 2.0c). Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium were carried out at 23 °C using An-60 Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima XLI ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). For sedimentation equilibrium, we loaded A23 in IPED or IPED with 0.5m KCl into six-hole, charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and centrifuged them to equilibrium (20 h at each speed). We monitored absorption at 280 nm, collected data sets every hour, calculated the root mean square deviation of each data set from the final using the Matchv7 software (Jeff Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Facility, Storrs, CT), and considered equilibrium attained when there was no change in root mean square deviation in consecutive data sets. We used the program Reedit9 (Jeff Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Facility) to truncate and save the data for individual samples into separate data sets. Determination of the effective reduced molecular weight of A23 from all data sets by the method of Johnsonet al. (38Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys.

A=C eςr22−rm22Equation 2 where A is 280 nm absorbance, C is a fitting constant, r is radial position,r m is the radius of the meniscus, and ς is the effective reduced molecular weight. From these fits we calculated the molecular mass of A23 using a partial specific volume of 0.7164 cm3/g. For sedimentation velocity, we loaded A23 into two-sector, charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for approximately 4 h. We monitored sedimentation of A23 by fringe displacement and/or absorption at 280 or 295 nm, and collected data sets every 2 min. Sedimentation velocity of A23 was carried out in three different conditions as follows: IPED; 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6; or IPED with 0.5 m KCl.

Overexpression of receptor-associated protein (RAP) in mice that lack both LRP and LDLR (MX1cre<sup>+</sup>LRP<sup>flox/flox</sup>LDLR<sup>−/−</sup>) in their livers elicited a marked hypertriglyceridemia in addition to the pre-existing hypercholesterolemia in these animals, resulting in a shift in the distribution of plasma lipids from LDL-sized lipoproteins to large VLDL-sized particles. This dramatic increase in plasma lipids was not due to a RAP-mediated inhibition of a unknown hepatic high affinity binding site involved in lipoprotein metabolism, because no RAP binding could be detected in livers of MX1cre<sup>+</sup>LRP<sup>flox/flox</sup>LDLR<sup>−/−</sup> mice using both membrane binding studies and ligand blotting experiments. Remarkably, RAP overexpression also resulted in a 7-fold increase (from 13.6 to 95.6 ng/ml) of circulating, but largely inactive, lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In contrast, plasma hepatic lipase levels and activity were unaffected. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that RAP binds to LPL with high affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> = 5 nm) but does not affect its catalytic activity, <i>in vitro</i> or<i>in vivo.</i> Our findings suggest that an extrahepatic RAP-sensitive process that is independent of the LDLR or LRP is involved in metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. There, RAP may affect the functional maturation of LPL, thus causing the accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the circulation."

The antiviral cytokine IFN-γ alters the catalytic specificity of proteasomes by inducing the synthesis of an alternative set of three proteolytically active proteasome subunits. We have analyzed the mechanism of IFN-γ induction for the IFN-γ-induced subunit multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1 (MECL1). The human MECL1 promoter contains two interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs), generally known to bind members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. The importance of these elements for IFN-γ induction of MECL1 was addressed by transfecting an endothelial cell line with MECL1 promoter constructs. By deletions and mutations of the ISRE sequences, we demonstrated that both ISREs were needed for full IFN-γ induction of the reporter gene. The second (downstream) ISRE was essential for both IFN-γ-induced and basal transcriptional activity of the promoter. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, anti-IRF-1 antibodies supershifted an IFN-γ-induced protein binding specifically to both ISRE sequences, whereas IRF-2 bound the second ISRE before induction. Co-transfection of IRF-1 resulted in induced MECL1 promoter activity in the absence of IFN-γ. These data indicate that the IFN-γ induction of human MECL1 is mediated by IFN-γ-induced IRF-1.

The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the ISRE sequences for constitutive and IFN-γ-induced expression of the human proteasome subunit MECL1 and to investigate the transcription factor mediating the IFN-γ induction. The human endothelial cell line ECV304 (ATCC) was grown in medium 199 with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies, Inc.). The human B cell lines Reh (acute lymphoblastic lymphoma; pre-B cell) and IM9 (multiple myeloma; IgG secreting) (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. The genomic region encompassing the MECL1 gene (also called PSMB10) has previously been cloned and sequenced by our group (25Larsen F. Solheim J. Kristensen T. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession no.X71874). Using a subclone containing the MECL1 promoter as template, promoter fragments were amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) with the forward primers 2051, 2162, 2180, 2219, and 2235, respectively, and the reverse primer 2334rev (Fig. 1). The PCR products were cloned into theSmaI site of the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 Basic (Promega), and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs with mutated ISREs (28Blanar M.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Flavell R.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Reid L.E. Brasnett A.H. Gilbert C.S.

The resulting PCR products were either cloned directly into pGL3 Basic or used as reverse primers in new PCRs to incorporate the mutations into larger constructs.

ECV304 cells (60–90% confluent) were transfected in 35-mm wells using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.1 μg of DNA (1 μg of vector construct and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK vector (Promega) as internal standard). In co-transfection experiments, 0.33 μg of each vector construct was used. Empty pcDNAI vector was added to a total amount of 1 μg of DNA when none or just one IRF expression vector was used. The cells were transfected as recommended, using 5 h of incubation of cells with DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes in serum-free medium and replacement of the transfection mixture with fresh complete medium 22 h after the start of transfection. The cells were harvested 7 h later. The effects of IRF-1 and/or IRF-2 on MECL1 expression were studied in transfection experiments using the respective cDNA in pcDNAI, kindly provided by Prof. T. Maniatis. For investigating the time course of induction, IFN-γ was added to the cell medium at a final concentration of 200 units/ml at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h prior to cell lysis. When indicated in other transfections, the cells were always stimulated with 200 units/ml IFN-γ for 24 h before harvesting. The cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and Renilla(sea pansy) luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activities were determined as recommended for the Dual-Luciferase system using a Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold) luminometer with manual mixing of reagents or an automatic MicroLumatPlus luminometer (EG&G Berthold). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity of the same sample, and the mean was calculated from the parallels. From the mean values of each independent run, the overall mean and its standard error (S.E.) were calculated. ECV304 cells were stimulated with 200 units/ml IFN-γ for different time periods (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h) prior to lysis. mRNA was isolated directly from the cells using magnetic oligo(dT) Dynabeads (Dynal) and the buffers recommended by the manufacturers. Cells were grown to confluence in 9-cm plates and lysed directly in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Cell extract from each plate was run through a 23 gauge syringe to shear the DNA and mixed with 300 μg beads. Isolated mRNA was run on a denaturing agarose gel and blotted. The filter was probed with MECL1 cDNA (27Foss G.S. Larsen F. Solheim J. Prydz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and β-actin. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear proteins were extracted from unstimulated cells and from cells stimulated with 200 units/ml IFN-γ for 24 h. When investigating the time course of induction, IFN-γ was added to the cell medium at a final concentration of 200 units/ml at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h prior to cell lysis. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, 15 min before addition of IFN-γ. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the ECV304 cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets containing 1–5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 0 °C, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 μg/ml phosphoramidon). The cells were incubated for 5–15 min on ice. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 0 °C, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors as for Buffer A) and incubated for 20–30 min on ice with regular mixing. The nuclear lysates were cleared by centrifugation, frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides from the MECL1 promoter, oligo A, containing ISRE1, and oligo E, containing ISRE2 (see Table I), were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on polyacrylamide gels. EMSA reactions were performed in volumes of 20 μl with a final EMSA buffer of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 0 °C, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Nuclear extracts (15–20 μg of protein) were incubated in EMSA buffer with 1 μl of labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm; 5–10 fmol) for 15 min at room temperature. In competition and supershift reactions, 1 μl of competitors (2 pmol) (Table I) or 1 μl of antibodies (1 μg, or 1:10 dilution of antisera in phosphate-buffered saline) were incubated with the extract in EMSA buffer for 15 min at room temperature before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. Polyclonal antibodies against Stat1, IRF-1, IRF-2, IFN-stimulated gene factor-3γ, IFN consensus sequence-binding protein, and IFN consensus sequence-binding protein in adult T-cell leukemia cell lines or activated T cells were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit antisera against IRF-3 and IRF-7 were kindly provided by Dr. Takahashi Fujita (The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science) and Dr. Luwen Zhang (University of North Carolina), respectively. The reactions were run on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mmTris-borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 80 min at 100 V. The gels were vacuum dried, and the signals detected by phosphor screen autoradiography. Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) from unstimulated and IFN-γ-stimulated cells were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted. The membranes were incubated with anti-IRF-1 and anti-IRF-2 antibodies diluted 1:2000. Signals were detected by enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Solheim J. Prydz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the promoter of the murine MECL1 gene homologueLmp10/Psmb10 (26Cruz M. Elenich L.A. Smolarek T.A. Menon A.G. Monaco J.J. Genomics. 1997; 45: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Hayashi M. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2760-2770PubMed Google Scholar) show high sequence similarity in a 250-base pair region upstream of the translational start site, above which the murine sequence contains a transposable element (31Hayashi M. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2760-2770PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore limited our analysis of the human promoter to this region of homology, and started at position 2051 of the genomic fragment (25Larsen F. Solheim J. Kristensen T. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A 284-base pair promoter fragment was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. In order to determine the IFN-γ responsiveness of this construct, called 2051, we transfected ECV304 cells, in which MECL1 is known to be IFN-γ inducible (27Foss G.S. Larsen F. Solheim J. Prydz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The time course of IFN-γ induction was examined by stimulation for different time periods. The promoter segment proved to contain the elements necessary for IFN-γ induction of the reporter gene (Fig.2). A lag period of around 3 h was observed before the IFN-γ stimulation led to a rise in luciferase activity. Five-fold induction was reached after 7 h of stimulation by IFN-γ (Fig. 2). Stimulation periods between 8 and 24 h and between 24 and 60 h resulted in small fluctuations of luciferase activity above the level of 5-fold induction (results not shown). To compare the time course of the IFN-γ induction of the reporter construct to the induction of MECL1 mRNA, ECV304 cells were stimulated for different time periods, and their mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. The amount of MECL1 mRNA increases after 3 h of stimulation (Fig. 2 B), similar to the lag period observed for induction of the reporter construct (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the time course of promoter induction parallels that of the MECL1 mRNA induction, suggesting that elements in the promoter segment chosen for analysis can account for the induction of MECL1 mRNA. The increase of MECL1 mRNA seen from 8 to 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 2 B) was not accompanied by an increase of the expression of the reporter, possibly because the luciferase mRNA and/or protein had a shorter half-life and then did not accumulate. The presence of a lag period suggested that the induction was not due to the phosphorylation-activated transcription factor Stat1 directly, but rather mediated by a factor downstream of Stat1 in the IFN-γ signaling pathway, such as IRF-1. In the promoter region selected for study, there are two ISRE sequences with the consensus binding site for members of the IRF family (23Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These elements are conserved in the murine Psmb10 promoter and have been shown by deletions to be involved in IFN-γ induction of murine MECL1 (31Hayashi M. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2760-2770PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the two ISRE sequences in regulation of human MECL1, 5′ deletion constructs were made based on the positions of the ISREs (Fig.3). The constructs were named 2162, 2180, 2219, and 2235 after their starting point in the sequence (see Fig. 1). The potential of the promoter to function in the opposite direction was tested by including a construct with the 2051 fragment in reverse orientation (2051rev). The luciferase activity of the 2051 construct was set to 100% (Fig. 3). The IFN-γ-induced activity of the reverse promoter, 2051rev, was higher than the 2051 construct, suggesting that the involved promoter elements can up-regulate transcription in both directions. The fragment starting at the first ISRE (2162) had 77% IFN-γ inducibility relative to the 2051 construct. This reduction might reflect an upstream element contributing to the induction, or the sequence upstream of ISRE1 may be important for optimal binding to the element. Upon deletion of the ISRE1 element (2180), the induction was reduced to 47% of maximum, clearly indicating a role for ISRE1 in the IFN-γ induction. In the next construct (2219), where the segment between the ISREs was deleted, 38% of the induction was still maintained. Interestingly, when the ISRE2 element was deleted (2235), the luciferase activity in IFN-γ-stimulated cells dropped to the background level. The basal level of transcription in unstimulated cells transfected with the 2051 construct was 17% of the IFN-γ-induced level, confirming the 5–6-fold induction seen after 24 h of IFN-γ stimulation (see Fig. 2). The constitutive level of luciferase activity was unaffected by deletions until deletion of ISRE2 (construct 2235), when the constitutive activity, like the IFN-γ-induced activity, fell to the level of vector alone. The results obtained with the deletion constructs of the MECL1 promoter suggested a role for ISRE2 both in IFN-γ-induced and basal transcriptional activity, whereas ISRE1 seemed to enhance the level of IFN-γ induction and not the level of constitutive transcription. To confirm these results, we examined in transfection experiments the role of the two ISREs by mutating bases essential for IRF binding (23Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), while keeping the length of the constructs intact. In constructs 2051 and 2162, the first element, the second element, and both were mutated, and in construct 2219, ISRE2 was mutated (Fig.4). When ISRE1 was mutated, the induction was reduced to 38% in 2051 m1 and 35% in 2162 m1 (Fig. 4), close to the level of induction for the construct 2219 devoid of promoter sequence upstream of ISRE2 (28% in Fig. 4; 38% in Fig. 3), confirming the importance of ISRE1 for IFN-γ induction. Comparing the 2162 construct with 2162 m1, ISRE1 seemed to confer a 2-fold induction upon stimulation with IFN-γ. Moreover, the similar transcriptional activities of the 2051 m1 and 2162 m1 constructs suggested that a possible third element upstream of ISRE1, conceivably accounting for the difference in activity between the 2051 and 2162 constructs (see Figs. 3 and 4), would depend on ISRE1 function for its contribution. For the basal transcriptional activity of the constructs, mutation of ISRE1 had only minor effects. Construct 2219, containing ISRE2 only, showed 2-fold induction upon IFN-γ stimulation (Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast to mutation of ISRE1, mutation of ISRE2 essentially abolished all transcription, both IFN-γ-induced and constitutive, regardless of the length of the construct. Similarly, constructs in which both ISRE1 and ISRE2 were mutated showed no transcriptional activity above the level of vector alone. Therefore, whereas ISRE1 seemed to be necessary for maximal IFN-γ induction, ISRE2 appeared to have a dual role, mediating both basal and IFN-γ-induced transcription. The transfection experiments showed that the two ISREs in the MECL1 promoter were instrumental for the IFN-γ induction of MECL1 in the endothelial cell line. The transcription factors binding these elements are therefore likely to mediate the induction of MECL1. To characterize these proteins, oligonucleotide probes containing ISRE1 and ISRE2 were made (see Table I) and incubated with nuclear extracts from unstimulated and IFN-γ-stimulated ECV304 cells (Fig.5). In extracts from IFN-γ-stimulated ECV304 cells, the ISRE1 probe (labeled oligo A) gave one strong band and two weaker bands (Fig. 5,upper panel, left). The specificity of the binding was examined by including various cold competitor oligonucleotides in excess (see Table I). All the complexes formed with probe A were competed out by the corresponding cold oligo A and were not competed out by the mutated oligonucleotide (oligo B), indicating that all the bound proteins needed the unmutated sequence to bind the probe (see Table I for the sequences). A shorter oligonucleotide containing ISRE1, oligo C, competed out the two lower complexes, the lowermost not completely. Again, mutation resulted in no competition (oligo D). Interestingly, oligo E containing ISRE2 competed out the strong lower complex and competed better than its short form, oligo G. The same complex was competed out by the consensus ISRE (32Parrington J. Rogers N.C. Gewert D.R. Pine R. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Eur. J.

Therefore, the protein component of the lower complex seemed to bind specifically to the ISRE sequence and to require several bases upstream of the consensus sequence for efficient binding. The upper complex appeared to be specific for the long ISRE1 oligo and may represent proteins binding outside the ISRE sequence, although they seemed to depend on an intact ISRE sequence for binding. The ISRE2 probe (labeled oligo E) gave two protein complexes with the nuclear extract from IFN-γ-stimulated ECV304 cells (Fig. 5,upper panel, right). The competition pattern was similar to that seen for ISRE1. Both complexes were competed out by the cold oligo E, but not with the mutated version (oligo F). The upper complex was not competed out by the shorter ISRE2 oligo G and therefore seemed to be specific for the longer ISRE2 oligonucleotide. Both ISRE1 (oligo A) and consensus ISRE (oligo I) competed for the lower complex, which thereby appeared to be specific for the ISRE sequence. Neither probe gave any shift in the absence of protein extract (Fig. 5, upper panel, left and right). Interestingly, in nuclear extracts from unstimulated ECV304 cells (Fig.5, middle panel), the shifted complexes were similar to the complexes of the IFN-γ-stimulated cells. However, the signal of the lower complex of both probes (middle panel, left andright) was weaker than observed for stimulated cells (middle panel, left and right), indicating that this nuclear protein was induced by IFN-γ. Again, the competition patterns showed the lower complex of both probes to be ISRE-specific. Thus, the results of the competition analyses suggested that members of the ISRE-binding IRF family specifically bound the two ISRE probes both in the presence and absence of IFN-γ stimulation. To examine the identity of the proteins bound to the elements, we incubated the extracts with antibodies to different proteins associated with the IFN-γ signaling pathway (Fig. 5, lower panel). We tested the following transcription factors: Stat1, the first transcription factor of the IFN-γ signaling pathway (21Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar); IRF-1, the ISRE-binding transcription factor downstream of Stat1 in the IFN-γ-pathway (34Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M.

Pitha P.M.

Fas binding to FasL activates a cascade of proteases known as caspases that subsequently induce activation-induced cell death (apoptosis). Fas-mediated apoptosis is used not only as an effector mechanisms by T cells to induce apoptosis of Fas expressing cells but is also implicated in clonal downsizing of the immune cell population. Fas-deficient MRL-lpr/lpr mice and FasL-deficientgld mice develop a lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease, indicating that Fas plays a critical role in immune homeostasis (5Nagata S. Golstein P.

The mechanism of TCR·CD3-induced expression of Fas is not fully understood but is thought to mediate through TCR·CD3-triggered signaling pathways.

The activity of AP-1 is regulated both at the level of jun/fos gene transcription and post-translational modifications of the Jun/Fos heterodimer.

GABP is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunit (36LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1372-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P.

The 52-kDa α subunit shows significant homology to the DNA binding domains of transcription factors of the Ets family and facilitates weak binding to DNA (38Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The 42-kDa β subunit of GABP contains four repeats of a sequence present in several transmembrane proteins, including DrosophilaNotch and ankyrin. The N-terminal repeats of the GABP β subunit do not bind DNA but can interact with and stabilize the binding of the α subunit (39Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a dyad symmetry element in the distal enhancer of the IL-2 promoter, which is transactivated by GABP (35Hoffmeyer A. Avots A. Flory E. Weber C.K. Serfling E. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10112-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GABP is predominantly phosphorylated and activated by JNK and weakly activated by ERK. Blocking JNK pathway by the expression of dominant-negative (DN) SEK and SAPK impairs expression of IL-2, whereas blocking both JNK and ERK pathways completely abrogates IL-2 gene expression (35Hoffmeyer A.

To characterize Fas promoter activation in T cells, we investigated the signaling pathways and transcription factors required for TCR·CD3-stimulated Fas gene expression in human Jurkat T cell line. We report here that a transcriptional regulatory element containing two ERE binding sites and an AP-1 binding site was located between the nucleotide positions from −866 to −682. Mutation of the GABP- and AP-1-binding sites markedly impaired enhancer function in TCR·CD3-, PMA-, and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat cells, indicating that GABP and AP-1 play a critical role in regulating Fas gene expression in the TCR·CD3-activated T cells. Jurkat cells and hybridoma cell line producing antibody against CD3, OKT3, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Anti-c-Fos, anti-c-Jun, and anti-JunD antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-GABPα and anti-GABPβ antisera were prepared as described previously (35Hoffmeyer A.

Jurkat cells (1 × 106/sample) were transfected with various plasmids (2 μg/sample) by using DMRIE-C (2 μl/sample) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pCMV/SPORT (0.5 μg/sample) carrying the gene of β-galactosidase was co-transfected as internal control. In some experiments, protein concentrations in cell lysates were measured to confirm that an equal number of cells had been harvested. Following transfection, cells were immediately stimulated with plastic-coated anti-CD3 mAb, OKT3 (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 4 °C overnight), PMA (50 ng/ml), and/or ionomycin (0.5 μm). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was quantitated by using luciferase substrate kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and reading in a Packard luminometer (Packard Instrument Company, Inc., Meriden, CT). Jurkat cells (1 × 107/ml) were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and/or ionomycin (1 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min or with 4 μg/ml of anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) for 2 min followed by cross-linking with goat anti-mouse IgG (16 μg/ml) for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared following a standard protocol as described previously (34Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp R.R. Bruder J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Google Scholar) Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the labeled probes were separated by NucTRap probe purification columns. The sequences of AP-1 and NF-κB probes are CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA and AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC, respectively. Labeled oligonucleotide (20,000–50,000 cpm) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 2 μg of protein of nuclear extract. The DNA binding buffer used in all experiments except in Fig. 8 Bcontains 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). The buffer used in Fig. 8 Bcontains less poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (10 μg/ml) and more dithiothreitol (5 mm). For supershift or competition EMSA, nuclear extract (2–5 μg/reaction) was preincubated with 1 μg of antibodies against AP-1 or 5–200X unlabeled oligonucleotide at 4 °C for 30 min, and then hot probes were added. The reaction was separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Dried gel was exposed to X-Omat film or analyzed in a STORM 860 Image System (Molecular Dynamics). Human Fas promoter containing 1007 bp upstream of the translation initiation site was PCR-amplified with a forward oligonucleotide GGCGGAGGTACCAGTAATGATGTCATTATCCAAAC (theKpnI cleavage site is in boldface type) and a reverse oligonucleotide GTTCCGAAGCTTGGTTGTTGAGCAATCCTCCGAAGT (the HindIII cleavage site is in boldface type). The genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donor was used as template. PCR reaction was conducted with 2.5 units of proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase/reaction for 30 cycles with the following parameters: 94 °C denature for 1 min, 48 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C extension for 2 min. PCR product was extracted with phenol and then digested by HindIII andKpnI. The resultant fragment was extracted and ligated to pGL3/Basic that had been digested with KpnI andHindIII. The ligation reaction was used to transform competent DH5α. Plasmid DNA was purified using QIAGEN Midi Kit and sequenced before transfection. We further generated two constructs with truncated Fas promoter, pGL3/Fas-866, pGL3/Fas-682, and pGL3/Fas-425, which contains the 866, 682, and 425 bp upstream of the translation initiation ATG site. Three forward oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-TGGCCAGGAAATAATGAGTAACGAAGGACAGGAAGTAATTGT-3′, 5′-GCCATTCCAGAAACGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGGAACGCCCCGGGACAC-3′, and a universal reverse oligonucleotide with the sequence GTTCCGAAGCTTGGTTGTTGAGCAATCCTCCGAAGT (theHindIII cleavage site is in boldface type) were synthesized and used in PCR reaction for construction of pGL3/Fas-866, pGL3/Fas-682, and pGL3/Fas-425, respectively. pGL3/Fas-1007 plasmid DNA was used as the template. PCR reaction was performed according to the following parameters: 94 °C denature for 1 min, 48 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C extension for 2 min, 30 cycles. PCR product was extracted by phenol, digested with HindIII, and then ligated to pGL3/Basic plasmid that had been digested with SmaI andHindIII. The truncation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Three forward oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-TGGCCAGGCCATAATGAGTAACGAAGGACA CCAAGTAATTGT-3′, 5′-TGGCCAGGAAATAATGTAGAACGAAGGACAGGAAGTAATTGT-3′, TGGCCAGGCCATAATGTAGAACGAAGGACA CCAAGTAATTGT-3′ (mutated ERE and AP-1 sites are bold-faced), and a universal reverse oligonucleotide with the sequence GTTCCGAAGCTTGGTTGTTGAGCAATCCTCCGAAGT (the HindIII cleavage site is in boldface type) were synthesized and used in PCR reaction for the construction of pGL3/Fas-866/M1, pGL3/Fas-866/M2, and pGL3/Fas-866/M3, respectively. PCR amplification and cloning were conducted as described for the construction of plasmids pGL3/Fas-682 and pGL3/Fas-425. The resultant plasmid pGL3/Fas-866 contains a 866-bp promoter of Fas, whereas pGL3/Fas-866/M1 contains the same length of promoter but with mutation at two ERE sites; pGL3/Fas-866 has mutation at the AP-1 binding site, and pGL3/Fas-866/M3 has mutations at both AP-1 and two ERE sites. Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGL3/2xGABP was constructed by inserting a synthesized double-stranded DNA with a cleaved KpnI site at one end and aNheI site at another end into pGL3/promoter plasmid. The sequences of two complementary strands are 5′-cTGGCCAGGAAATAATGAGTAACGAAGGACAGGAAGTAAGTGGCCAGGAAATAATGAGTAACGAAGGACAGGAAGTAAg-3′ and 5′-ctagcTTACTTCCTGTCCTTCGTTACTCATTATTTCCTGGCCATTACTTCCTGTCCTTCGTTACTCATTATTTCCTGGCCAGgtac-3′. pGL3/2xGABP/M1 carries mutation at all ERE sites, whereas pGL3/2xGABP/M2 has mutation at two AP-1 sites. The annealed double-stranded DNA was directly ligated into pGL3/promoter plasmid that had been digested with NheI and KpnI. The ligation reaction was used to transform competent DH5αEscherichia coli. Plasmid DNA was purified and sequenced. To generate pGL3/4xGABP, a two-copy GABP insert containing a cleavedNheI site at one end and a cleaved BglII site at another site was inserted into the pGL3/2xGABP that had been digested with NheI and BglII. Based on the available sequence of the Fas promoter (42Wada N. Matsumura M. Ohba Y. Kobayashi N. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 3057-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we PCR-amplified a 1007-bp fragment upstream of the translation initiation ATG site and subsequently inserted this fragment upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (pGL3/Basic). The resultant plasmid, designated as pGL3/Fas-1007, was used to generate three reporter plasmids, pGL3/Fas-866, pGL3/Fas-682, and pGL3/Fas-425, which contain 866, 682, and 425 bp upstream of the ATG codon of the Fas gene, respectively (Fig.1 A). Jurkat cells transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter gene driven by different lengths of the Fas promoter were stimulated for 10 h with various stimuli, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was quantitated. As shown Fig. 1 B, anti-CD3 mAb, PMA, and PMA/ionomycin induced the 1007- and 866-bp Fas promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression 4–8-fold. However, anti-CD3 mAb, PMA, and PMA/ionomycin induced the 682- and 425-bp Fas promoter driven-luciferase reporter gene expression about 2-fold. These results suggest that the transcriptional regulatory elements responding to the stimulation of the TCR·CD3 complex, PMA, and PMA/ionomycin are largely located predominantly between the nucleotide positions −866 bp and −682 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation site. Several inhibitors of the TCR·CD3-mediated signaling pathways were used to determine which pathway was required for anti-CD3 mAb-induced Fas promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2, cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of the NF-AT pathway, and wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, did not inhibit anti-CD3 stimulated luciferase activity, suggesting that anti-CD3-stimulated Fas expression is not mediated by the transcription factor NF-AT or by the PI 3-kinase pathway. PD98059 (50 μm), a specific inhibitor of ERK pathway, and SB202190 (2 μm), a specific inhibitor of the p38 kinase pathway, did not affect anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated luciferase expression. H7, an inhibitor of PKC, modestly inhibited luciferase activity by 62.6%, as calculated after the subtraction of luciferase activity in unstimulated Jurkat cells. These data, in combination with recent finding that H7 inhibits anti-CD3 and PMA-induced Fas mRNA expression (45Wang R. Zhang L. Yin D. Mufson R.A. Shi Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2201-2207PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that activation of the Fas promoter via the T cell receptor complex is largely mediated through the PKC activation pathway. Activated JNK and ERK kinases phosphorylate and activate several downstream substrates, such as c-Fos, c-Jun, and GABP. Recent studies by Rapp and his colleagues (35Hoffmeyer A. Avots A. Flory E. Weber C.K. Serfling E. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10112-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Avots A. Foffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4289-4381Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrate that GABP is able to bind the distal enhancer region of the IL-2 gene and activate gene transcription. Sequence analysis of the Fas enhancer revealed a putative GABP binding site (−863 to −820) consisting of two ERE repeats with sequences identical to those of the GABP binding site in the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, a putative AP-1 binding site with the sequence TGAGTAA is located between two EREs. We assessed whether stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 mAb as well as PMA and/or ionomycin was able to activate GABP and/or AP-1 to bind the 32P-labeled Fas/GABP probe by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the nuclear extract prepared from unstimulated Jurkat cells generated four gel shift complexes with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides spanning the region from nucleotide positions −863 to −820 of the Fas promoter. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 antibody, PMA, or PMA plus ionomycin but not ionomycin alone increased the binding activity on each complex. We next examined the effect of mutations of the GABP and AP-1 binding sites (−820 to −863) on the binding complexes. As shown in Fig.4, mutation of both ERE sites (M1) markedly decreased the formation of the C1-C3 complexes, whereas mutation of the putative AP-1 site (M2) essentially had no effect on the formation of the C1-C4 complexes. Deletion of either ERE-A or ERE-B site abolished the formation of the C4 complex and significantly reduced the formation of the C2 and C3 complexes. It appears that the ERE-B oligonucleotide had slightly higher affinity for GABP to form the C1 complex than the ERE-A oligonucleotide. In addition, no detectable complex was formed with the F/AP-1 oligonucleotide. These results suggest that both ERE sites can bind GABP, whereas the putative AP-1 site, although its sequence falls into the definition of the consensus AP-1 binding site TGA(G/C)T(C/A)A (47Jones N.C. Rigby P. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 267Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), cannot bind AP-1 at detectable levels under the experimental conditions we used here. To confirm the specificity of GABP in the complexes formed with the32P-labeled Fas/GABP oligonucleotide, competition EMSA was conducted using the oligonucleotides listed in Fig. 4 A to compete with the 32P-labeled Fas/GABP (Fig.5 A), ERE-A (Fig.5 B), and ERE-B (Fig. 5 C) oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the M1 oligonucleotide, which has mutations in both ERE sites, did not affect the formation of the C1-C3 complexes but did inhibit the formation of the C4 complex. The M2 oligonucleotide, which has mutations in the putative AP-1 binding site, reduced the formation of all the C1-C4 complexes, whereas both unlabeled ERE-A and ERE-B oligonucleotides reduced the formation of the C1-C3 complexes but had no effect on the formation of the C4 complex. The F/AP-1 oligonucleotide, which contains the AP-1 binding site, did not affect the formation of any of the complexes. The consensus NF-κB site, included as negative control, also did not affect the formation of any of the complexes. Consistently, the Fas/GABP, M2, ERE-A, and ERE-B oligonucleotides were able to compete with the ERE-A (Fig.5 B) and ERE-B (Fig. 5 C) oligonucleotides to bind GABP, whereas M1, F/AP-1, and the consensus NF-κB probes had no effect on GABP binding to the ERE-A and ERE-B probes. To determine the composition of the C1-C4 complexes, we conducted supershift EMSA with antibodies against the α and β subunits of GABP to determine whether the gel shift complexes contained GABP. In these supershift experiments, the antibodies were preincubated with the nuclear extracts. Under this circumstance,"

Presenilins are endoproteolytically processed to N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, which together form a stable 1:1 complex. We have mapped the cleavage site in the PS2 protein by direct sequencing of its C-terminal fragment isolated from mouse liver. Three different N-terminal residues were identified starting at Val-299, Thr-301, and Leu-307 that correspond closely to the previously described N termini of the C-terminal fragment of human PS1. Mutational analysis of the PS2 cleavage site indicates that the principal endoproteolytic cleavage occurs at residues Met-298/Val-299 and that the N terminus is subsequently modified by secondary proteolytic cleavages. We have generated cleavage defective PS2 constructs, which accumulate exclusively as full-length polypeptides in transfected Neuro2a cells. Functional analysis of such cleavage defective PS2 carrying the FAD mutation Asn-141 → Ile showed that its Aβ42 producing activity was strongly reduced compared with cleavage-competent FAD PS2. In contrast, cleavage defective PS2 was active in rescuing the egg-laying defect of a sel-12 mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans. We conclude that PS2 endoproteolytic cleavage is not an absolute requirement for its activities but may rather selectively enhance or stabilize its functions.

All FAD-linked PS mutations affect single residues of the polypeptide and often lead to rather conservative amino acid substitutions. This appears also to be true for the PS1 Δexon 9 mutant, where the FAD effect was shown to be due to the point mutation Ser-290 → Cys and not to the deletion of exon 9 and the resulting absence of endoproteolytic cleavage (5Steiner H.

We have mapped and characterized the endoproteolytic cleavage site in PS2 by direct sequencing of CTFs from mouse liver and by mutational analysis of human PS2. As for PS1, we found three CTF species of PS2 differing at their N-termini. Mutational analysis, however, suggests that endoproteolysis occurs only at the most upstream position (Met-298). Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of proteolytic cleavage greatly diminishes the Aβ42 production in FAD PS2-expressing cells, which indicates that the proteolytically derived presenilin fragments are the physiologically relevant species for the FAD pathology. Amino acids 1–80 of human PS2 (N terminus) and 270–387 of murine PS2 (large hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7) were expressed in Escherichia coli as (NANP)19 fusion proteins and used for immunization. PST20 is a monoclonal antibody specific for the hydrophilic N-terminal region of human and mouse PS2, while monoclonal antibody PST18 reacts with the PS2 hydrophilic loop region, having preference for murine PS2. The rabbit antiserum 53217 is directed against the hydrophilic loop of PS2 (23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhardt D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grunberg J. Haass C. Jacobsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20655-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the human PS2 was isolated by PCR amplification and inserted in the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M.

For fast mutagenesis of the endoproteolytic cleavage site, a PS2 cassette construct was used; the sequence encoding amino acids Ser-296 to Gln-312 was deleted, and codons for Ser-295/Gly-313 were changed to an AccIII site (TCCGGA). The N terminus of PS2 was amplified by primers 5′-AGGCGGTACCGAGGATCCGCCACCATGCTCACATTCATGGCCTCTGACAGCGAG (sense) and 5′-TATATATCCGGAGTATATCAGGGCAGG (anti) and restricted byBamHI/AccIII digest. The C terminus was amplified by primers 5′-TATATATCCGGAGCCCTCCAGCTCCCC (sense) and 5′-GGTATCTCTAGAGAGTCGACGTGGTACCTCATTATCAGATGTAGAGCTGATGGGAGGCCAGGGTGTC (anti) and AccIII/XbaI-digested. Both fragments were ligated into BamHI/XbaI-restricted pcDNA3.1, and deletion mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing of the complete insert. Double-stranded oligonucleotides that encoded the PS2 amino acids 296–312 containing the intended mutations were ligated into AccIII-cleaved vector, and the expected sequence of the cleavage site was again confirmed by sequencing. In the final sequence of these cassette mutations, residue Gln-312 was always changed to an alanine. Selected mutations that strongly reduced the proteolytic cleavage of these PS2 constructs were subsequently confirmed in the original PS2 sequence by specific point mutations using standard PCR mutagenesis protocols. Transfection of mouse Neuro2a cells and selection of PS2-expressing clones in G-418-containing medium has been described (24Brockhaus M. Grunberg J. Rohrig S. Loetscher H. Wittenburg N. Baumeister R. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Expression and proteolytic cleavage of PS2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody PST20 as horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Where indicated, pools of G-418-selected colonies instead of individual clones were used for analysis. Secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 in conditioned medium was measured by a specific immunoassay as described previously (24Brockhaus M. Grunberg J. Rohrig S. Loetscher H. Wittenburg N. Baumeister R. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fresh tissue samples from mouse brain, liver and kidney were homogenized in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at 0.2 g/ml using a mechanical disruption device (FastRNA GREEN Kit, Bio101, Inc. Vista, CA). 0.4 ml of the homogenate was adjusted to 0.5% SDS and then diluted 1: 5 with 1.25× radioimmune precipitation buffer, not containing SDS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 171 mmNaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.625% sodium deoxycholate, 1.25% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 15 min, the clear supernatant was added to 25 μl of PST18-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (4.3 mg of antibody/ml of packed beads) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotating wheel. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA. 0.1% SDS). Bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing 8 m urea, separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. PS2 CTFs were visualized with rabbit polyclonal antibody 53217 and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL technology (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For isolation of the PS2 C-terminal fragment, 26 mouse livers were collected and homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride using a glass-Teflon homogenizer (6 ml/g tissue). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet washed with the same volume of homogenization buffer. The two supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the heavy membrane fraction. The light membrane fraction was then collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The high speed membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of homogenization buffer and solubilized by adding 1.25% (w/v) n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside. After 5-fold dilution with phosphate-buffered saline, the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The extract was applied to an affinity column (0.4 ml bed volume) containing the monoclonal antibody PST18 immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 0.25%n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 0.25% n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside. The fractions containing the PS2 C-terminal fragment as analyzed by Western blotting were pooled; 10-fold diluted with phosphate buffered saline, 0.25% n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside; and re-applied to a fresh PST18 column. After washing the column as above, the C-terminal fragment was eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS. concentrated by ultrafiltration, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The membrane was stained with 0.1% Amido Black in 45% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 10 min, and the bands corresponding to the PS2 C-terminal fragment (as visualized with the polyclonal anti-PS2 hydrophilic loop antibody 53217 on a separate immunoblot) were excised and N-terminally sequenced by Edmann degradation in a ABI 490cLC sequencer. Expression constructs were prepared, and transgenic lines were established as described previously (13Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The rescue of thesel-12(ar171) defect by human PS2 wild type and cleavage site mutants was quantified by scoring the egg-laying behavior of transgenic animals (13Baumeister R. Leimer U.

In order to study the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS2, we analyzed a number of cell lines and tissues for high PS2 expression to facilitate purification and protein chemical characterization of the cleavage site(s). Substantial amounts of PS2 were found in mouse liver, as determined by Western blotting, with a major C-terminal fragment migrating as a doublet at around 20/22 kDa and a minor fragment at around 18 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Samples derived from mouse brain or mouse kidney showed a single 20-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 1 A). The PS2 CTFs were subsequently isolated from a pool of 26 mouse livers by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibody PST18, which recognizes an epitope on the large hydrophilic loop of murine PS2. The eluate from the PST18 column was further separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining with Amido Black, the bands corresponding to the 20/22-kDa fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences covering 10–12 amino acids were determined and indicated cleavage between Met-298/Val-299, Trp-300/Thr-301, and Lys-306/Leu-307 (Fig. 1 B). The initial sequencing yields of these three CTFs from mouse liver were similar,i.e. 1.8, 2.2, and 2.3 pmol, respectively, The larger 22-kDa CTF presumably carries a secondary modification, which is most pronounced in liver tissue. Multiple phosphorylation sites in PS2 have been reported previously (25Walter J. Capell A. Grunberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Prior R. Podlisny M.B. Fraser P. Hyslop P.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 673-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 18-kDa band corresponds by its size to the caspase-cleavage derived fragment starting at Ser-330, which we have described previously (23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhardt D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grunberg J. Haass C. Jacobsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20655-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Alignment of PS1 and PS2 sequences around the mapped cleavage sites indicates a similar fragmentation pattern of the two proteins, implying that the processing of both PS1 and PS2 is mediated by a similar or identical protease (Fig. 1 B). However, the regions around the cleavage sites do not reveal any obvious sequence motifs, which would be indicative for a particular protease class. To confirm and characterize the endoproteolytic cleavage sites of mouse PS2, we performed a mutational analysis of the corresponding sequence in the human PS2 homologue. The peptide sequence of the cleavage domain is completely conserved, and the PS2 of both species is efficiently processed in transfected cells of either mouse or human origin. In a first experiment, we constructed two mutants; we deleted sequences encompassing the mapped N termini Val-299/Thr-301 and introduced a point mutation at position Lys-306 (mutant Δ296–301 plus Lys-306 → Glu) or deleted the residues surrounding the downstream N terminus (mutant Δ306–308). We studied the processing of these and all other constructs in stably transfected Neuro2a cells (Fig.2). We used stably transfected cells since transient high level expression of PS2 resulted preferentially in caspase processing of the full-length precursor (23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhardt D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grunberg J. Haass C. Jacobsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20655-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While the Δ306–308 mutation did not change the processing pattern compared with wild type PS2, the Δ296–301/Glu-306 mutant accumulated exclusively as full-length protein in transfected clones. This observation suggested that the preferred cleavage sites are located between positions 299 and 301 or, at least, that residues in this domain were essential for proteolytic cleavage, whereas amino acids Lys-306/Leu-307/Asp-308 were not strictly required. In the next series of experiments, we attempted to prevent any proteolytic cleavage of PS2 by combinations of point mutations. For this purpose, we employed a cassette mutagenesis approach (see “Experimental Procedures”). The goal of our mutations was (i) to find the minimal alteration of the PS2 sequence that prevented cleavage and (ii) to locate the exact cleavage site(s) within the investigated amino acid stretch. We assumed that a protein needs to be in an extended conformation to be cleaved by a proteinase and, therefore, the predicted helical structure for the investigated sequence must unfold. In all mutants Lys-306 was exchanged by a negatively charged or hydrophilic residue in order to prevent cleavage between Lys and Leu by a proteinase that recognizes a lysine in the S1 pocket. Changes in the region of Met-298–Thr-301 were designed such that the respective new side chains would not fit tightly in the recognition pockets of a proteinase optimized to cleave the wild type sequence, due to steric, charge, or polar incompatibilities. Other mutations were introduced to probe the roles of Gly-303 and Pro-309, which could be essential in stabilizing or destabilizing secondary structure and therefore could affect the efficiency of proteolytic processing. The PS2 mutations, named DB1–DB10, are listed in Fig.3 A. Proteolytic cleavage of the mutants was evaluated by immunoblot analysis in stably transfected clone populations of Neuro2a cells. A control construct, into which an oligonucleotide encoding the wild type PS2 sequence (“PS2”) of the cleavage site was inserted, was processed to an NTF of the expected size, proving the validity of this experimental approach. For all mutants the amount of proteolytically processed NTF was strongly reduced whereas full-length protein accumulated to significant amounts, proving that the cleavage domain was very sensitive to the different sets of mutations that had been introduced (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, insertion of an oligonucleotide encoding the corresponding sequence of human PS1 also resulted in a processed protein (lane PS1), which again suggests that both presenilins are cleaved by the same protease or, at least, by proteases of very similar specificity. In a subsequent experiment, we set out to obtain a more precise understanding of the PS2 cleavage site by a more restricted mutagenesis of residues Met-298, Val-299, Lys-306, and Leu-307 (Fig.4 A). Processing was again assayed in clone populations of Neuro2a cells selected for G-418 resistance (Fig. 4). Of the 6 mutants, only DB24/2 was processed to a significant extent; the other 5 constructs appeared to be completely resistant to endoproteolytic processing. DB24/2 was the only mutant where residues 298/299 remained unchanged. In contrast, mutant DB23/2 with residues 298/299 replaced by Asp/Ala but positions 306 and 307 left unchanged, accumulated exclusively as full-length protein. These results suggest that the primary cleavage occurs at or close to positions 298/299 and that the generation of the fragment starting at Leu-307 is a secondary event, possibly through a trypsin-like or a aminopeptidase activity. Our data further indicate that both residues Met-298 and Val-299 are important for endoproteolysis since substitutions of Asp or Ala at either position led to its complete suppression. A role for both residues in the processing step is also supported by the results from the previous cassette mutagenesis. Although the mutants DB2/DB3/DB10 and DB4/DB5/DB6 were wild type at one of the residues at positions Met-298 or Val-299, they were all completely resistant to endoproteolytic cleavage. Even DB31/2m with Ala in positions 298 and 299 was not processed, although neither charge nor polarity of the side chains were changed and steric hindrances with the protease can be excluded. We asked whether inactivation of the cleavage site would affect the enhanced Aβ42 production of human FAD PS2 (PS2.1, Asn-141 → Ile). Clones of Neuro2a cells stably transfected with PS2 cleavage site mutants were assayed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides secreted into culture supernatants. The FAD mutation PS2.1 led to a >10fold increase in the ratio of Aβ42 to total Aβ peptide secreted (Fig.5 A). Inactivation of the cleavage site in mutant PS2.1 del.296–301/Glu-306) largely reversed this increase, as did the point mutations in PS2.1 DB22/2m. Mutant PS2.1 DB24/2, which was substantially processed, showed a marked increase in the relative amount of Aβ42 versus Aβ40 when compared with the cleavage-deficient mutants. The Aβ peptide measurements were obtained from 3 to 6 independent clones for each construct, and similar observations have been obtained from the G-418-resistant clone populations of constructs DB1–DB10. 2H. Jacobsen and M. Brockhaus, unpublished observation. In Fig.5 B, the absolute concentrations of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 are shown for the various constructs and clones that are summarized in Fig. 5 A. While the clonal variations in the absolute amounts of secreted Aβ peptides are quite high as has been noted previously (24Brockhaus M. Grunberg J. Rohrig S. Loetscher H. Wittenburg N. Baumeister R. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), they are in agreement with our interpretation that changes in the Aβ42:Aβ total ration for the different constructs are primarily due to changes in the amounts of secreted Aβ42. These results show that the full-manifestation of the FAD phenotype of PS2 requires its prior proteolytic processing and, thus, indicate"

We examined the effect of DHEA on the expression of the carcinogen-activating enzyme cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) in MCF-7 human breast epithelial carcinoma cells. DHEA inhibited the increase in CYP1A1 enzyme activity that occurs when MCF-7 cells are exposed to the PAH dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, DHEA did not directly inhibit enzyme activity as it had no effect when added to the cells after induction by DMBA or TCDD. We observed that the increase of CYP1A1 mRNA in MCF-7 cells caused by DMBA or TCDD was inhibited by DHEA in a concentration-dependent manner. However, DHEA did not inhibit CYP1A1 promoter-driven transcription, indicating that it did not affect the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which regulates transcription of the CYP1A1 gene. Actinomycin D chase experiments showed that DHEA caused a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in CYP1A1 mRNA levels, indicating that DHEA inhibits CYP1A1 expression by decreasing CYP1A1 mRNA stability. These data demonstrate that DHEA inhibits PAH-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression and enzyme activityin vitro by a post-transcriptional mechanism. This regulation of the expression of carcinogen-activating enzymes may be responsible for the chemopreventive activity of DHEA and may be one of its physiologic functions in vivo.

DHEA and/or DHEA-S have been associated with a number of beneficial effects in humans (4Ebeling P. Koivisto V.A.

DMBA is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), a class of carcinogen that requires activation to genotoxic metabolites that bind DNA. DHEA has been shown to inhibit DMBA activation in vitro (20Schwartz A.G. Perantoni A. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 2482-2487PubMed Google Scholar) and DMBA-DNA binding in vivo (21Prasanna H.R. Hart R.W. Magee P.N. Drug Chem. Toxicol. 1989; 12: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The activation of PAH is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 1A and 1B families (22Shou M. Gonzalez F.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2366-2374PubMed Google Scholar), which require NADPH as a cofactor. Because DHEA is a potent uncompetitive inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in vitro (24Schwartz A.G. Pashko L.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 22: 210-217Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that generates NADPH), the inhibition of DMBA-induced carcinogenesis by DHEA has been ascribed to decreased activation by CYP enzymes because of a lack of NADPH. However, inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and depletion of NADPH pools in vivo have not been demonstrated (12Perkins S.N. Hursting S.D. Haines D.C. James S.J. Miller B.J. Phang J.M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Casazza J.P. Schaffer W.T. Veech R. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Cleary M.P.

Indeed, inhibition of cellular glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenasein vitro occurs only at very high DHEA concentrations (27Di Monaco M. Pizzini A. Gatto V. Leonardi L. Gallo M. Brignardello E.

Furthermore, other enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme also produce NADPH (25Casazza J.P. Schaffer W.T. Veech R. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of DHEA's chemopreventive activity toward DMBA is unknown. In the current work we examine an alternative hypothesis to account for the inhibition of DMBA-induced carcinogenesis by DHEA. DMBA, in common with other PAHs, induces the expression of the carcinogen-activating enzyme CYP1A1 (29Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). We report that DHEA, but not DHEA-S, inhibits the expression of CYP1A1 in vitro by affecting the stability of CYP1A1 mRNA, thereby preventing the induction of CYP1A1 enzyme activity by carcinogens such as DMBA. MCF-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RPMI 1640, glutamine, fetal bovine serum, trypsin/EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline, and Tris borate buffer were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). Actinomycin D, α-naphthoflavone (α-NF), DHEA, DHEA-S, DMBA, EDTA, ethoxyresorufin, resorufin, Tris-HCl, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were from Sigma. [32P]dATP was from NEN Life Science Products. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was from the Midwest Research Institute (Kansas City, MO).

Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RT-PCR and the β-galactosidase-containing reporter vector were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Trizol reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Stock solutions of all chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO (except where indicated) and stored at −20 °C. Final Me2SO concentration in both control and treated cultures was 0.1%. MCF-7 human breast epithelial cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum and subcultured weekly using 0.25% trypsin/0.05% EDTA. All experiments were carried out on confluent cultures in growth medium, unless otherwise noted. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 1 μm DMBA or 1 nm TCDD in the presence of Me2SO (vehicle control), DHEA, or DHEA-S for 24 h. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, which is a specific assay of the bioactivation capacity of CYP1A, was determined in intact MCF-7 cells grown in 24-well plates as described previously (30Ciolino H.P. Wang T.T. Yeh G.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2754-2760PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the direct effect of DHEA/DHEA-S on CYP1A enzyme activity, MCF-7 cells were incubated with 1 μm DMBA or 1 nm TCDD for 24 h to induce enzyme expression. The cells were then washed extensively and incubated with Me2SO (vehicle control), DHEA, DHEA-S, or 5 μm α-NF as a positive control for 3 h, and EROD activity was determined. Also, the effect of DHEA on EROD activity in microsomes isolated from TCDD-treated MCF-7 cells was measured as described (31Ciolino H.P. Daschner P.J. Yeh G.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5707-5712PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of total RNA, cDNA synthesis, semiquantitative RT-PCR for CYP1A1 and GAPDH mRNA, and analysis of results were performed as described previously (32Ciolino H.P. Daschner P.J. Yeh G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using an Omniscript RT-PCR kit as instructed. A cycle number that fell within the exponential range of response for both CYP1A1 (27 cycles for the determination of basal CYP1A1 mRNA and CYP1A1 mRNA stability; 24 cycles otherwise) and GAPDH (17 cycles) was used. CYP1A1promoter-controlled CAT transcription was determined as described previously (32Ciolino H.P. Daschner P.J. Yeh G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using StatView statistical analysis software (SAS Institute). Differences between group mean values were determined by a one-factor analysis of variance followed by Fisher protected least-significant difference post hoc analysis for pairwise comparison of means. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with 1 μm DMBA for 24 h caused an increase of CYP1A1 activity from undetectable levels in untreated cells to a specific activity of 1.52 ± 0.16 pmol/min/100,000 cells as measured in intact cells using the EROD assay. In cells co-incubated with DMBA and DHEA there was a concentration-dependent decrease in EROD activity, with a concentration of approximately 100 nm at which 50% inhibition (IC50) occurred (Fig.1 A). The sulfur-conjugated form of DHEA-S had no effect on DMBA-induced EROD activity (Fig.1 A). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with the potent AHR ligand TCDD caused an induction of EROD activity to 15.06 ± 0.89 pmol/min/100,000 cells. This induction was also inhibited by DHEA, but not by DHEA-S, with an IC50 of approximately 1 μm (Fig. 1 B). MCF-7 cells were incubated with DMBA or TCDD to induce CYP1A1 enzyme activity and postincubated with DHEA to determine whether the effect of DHEA on CYP1A1 activity results from a direct inhibitory action on the enzyme. As shown in Table I, DHEA had no effect on cellular CYP1A1 activity when added after induction by DMBA or TCDD, whereas the direct, non-competitive CYP1A1 enzyme inhibitor α-NF caused a significant inhibition of enzyme activity. DHEA was also unable to inhibit CYP1A1 enzyme activity in the microsomal fraction isolated from TCDD-treated cells, whereas α-NF completely abolished CYP1A1 activity (data not shown).Table ILack of effect of DHEA on CYP1A1 enzyme activity following inductionInducerCompetitorActivitypmol/min/100,000 cellsDMBANone (Me2SO)1.28 ± 0.04+ α-Naphthoflavone0.27 ± 0.04+ DHEA1.17 ± 0.06TCDDNone (Me2 SO)14.59 ± 0.88+ α-Naphthoflavone6.38 ± 0.33+ DHEA14.82 ± 0.41MCF-7 cells were incubated with DMBA or TCDD for 24 h.

The cells were then washed, and the competitors were added. EROD activity was measured 3 h later. MCF-7 cells were treated with or without DMBA and DHEA, and the amount of CYP1A1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.2, exposure of the cells to DMBA for 6 h resulted in a 5-fold increase in CYP1A1 mRNA compared with untreated cells. In the presence of DHEA, this induction was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner to an approximately 2-fold increase in cells co-treated with 1 μm DHEA (Fig.2). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TCDD resulted in an 11-fold increase in CYP1A1 mRNA compared with untreated controls (Fig.3). DHEA inhibited this down to a 4-fold increase in cells co-treated with TCDD and 1 μm DHEA (Fig. 3). DHEA-S did not affect the increase in CYP1A1 mRNA in cells treated with either DMBA or TCDD even at a relatively high concentration of 5 μm (Fig.4). Treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of DHEA for 24 h in the absence of other treatments also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the basal expression of CYP1A1 mRNA (Fig.5).Figure 3Inhibition of TCDD-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression by DHEA .

As shown in Fig. 6, there was a 4-fold increase in CAT transcription in transfected cells treated with DMBA and a 7-fold increase in cells treated with TCDD compared with Me2SO-treated controls. Co-incubation with increasing concentrations of DHEA had no affect on transcription. Resveratrol, a dietary polyphenolic compound that is a potent inhibitor of AHR activity and CYP1A1 transcription (32Ciolino H.P. Daschner P.J. Yeh G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), completely inhibited CAT transcription. The effect of DHEA on the stability of CYP1A1 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. Following treatment with DMBA to induce CYP1A1 expression, MCF-7 cells were treated with actinomycin D at 5 μg/ml, a concentration at whichCYP1A1 transcription is completely inhibited (32Ciolino H.P.

As shown in Fig. 7, CYP1A1 mRNA levels were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner in DHEA-treated cells compared with controls. The presence of DHEA caused an increase in the rate of degradation of CYP1A1 mRNA compared with controls (Fig. 8). The half-life of CYP1A1 mRNA decreased from approximately 7 h in controls to less than 2 h in DHEA-treated cells.Figure 8Effect of DHEA on the stability of the CYP1A1 mRNA time course. MCF-7 cells were incubated for 12 h with 1 μm DMBA.

CYP1A1 and GAPDH (G-3-PDH) mRNA were determined by RT-PCR. n = 3 ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Among the best characterized molecular responses to PAHs is the induction of the gene CYP1A1, which encodes the carcinogen-activating enzyme CYP1A1 (34Whitlock Jr., J.P. Chichester C.H. Bedgood R.M. Okino S.T. Ko H.P. Ma Q. Dong L. Li H. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 1107-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inhibition of carcinogen-activating enzymes, either by inhibiting enzyme activity or expression, is an important strategy in cancer chemoprevention (35Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52 (suppl.): 2085-2091Google Scholar). In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the established chemopreventive activity of DHEA toward aryl hydrocarbon-induced carcinogenesis may be due, in part, to its effects on the induction of CYP1A1 by PAHs. We used MCF-7 human breast epithelial carcinoma cells as a model system in these experiments because they are derived from the target tissue of DMBA, which is primarily a mammary carcinogen, and because CYP1A1 expression has been extensively characterized in this cell line (36Dohr O. Vogel C. Abel J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Moore M. Wang X. Lu Y.F. Wormke M. Craig A. Gerlach J.H. Burghardt R. Barhoumi R. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11751-11759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHEA causes a concentration-dependent decrease in DMBA- or TCDD-induced CYP1A1 enzyme activity (Fig. 1, A andB). DHEA was more effective at inhibiting DMBA-induced enzyme activity than TCDD-induced activity, possibly because of the much higher levels of induction caused by TCDD. With either ligand, the IC50 of DHEA was well below its physiologic concentrations (1Kalimi M. Shafagoj Y. Loria R. Padgett D. Regelson W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), suggesting that DHEA could possibly exert a similar inhibitory effect in vivo. Although decreased carcinogen-activating enzyme activity has been previously suggested to explain the chemopreventive activity of DHEA (38Schwartz A.G. Pashko L.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 774: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration of such an effect. On the other hand, sulfated DHEA had no effect on CYP1A1 enzyme activity. DHEA-S is the primary circulating form of the hormone but is inactive with regard to several biologic parameters (39Waxman D.J. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150 (suppl.): 129-147Google Scholar,40Pashko L.L. Schwartz A.G. Abou-Gharbia M. Swern D. Carcinogenesis. 1981; 2: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The inability of DHEA-S to inhibit enzyme activity, even after a 24 h incubation as represented in Fig. 1, suggests that MCF-7 cells do not possess the sulfatases necessary to convert it to active DHEA. Inhibitors of CYP1A1 enzyme activity may act by directly inhibiting enzyme activity. However, as shown in Table I, DHEA had no direct effect on CYP1A1 enzyme activity. Because CYP1A1 activity was reduced without direct enzyme inhibition, we investigated the effect of DHEA onCYP1A1 expression. DHEA inhibited the increase in CYP1A1 mRNA caused by DMBA (Fig. 2) or TCDD (Fig. 3). Consistent with the EROD data, DHEA was more effective at lower concentrations (<1 μm) in preventing the increase in CYP1A1 mRNA caused by DMBA than the increase caused by TCDD. In agreement with the enzyme data, DHEA-S had no effect on CYP1A1 mRNA induction caused by either ligand (Fig. 4). Thus, the inhibitory effect of DHEA on CYP1A1 enzyme activity is the result of inhibition of CYP1A1expression. CYP1A1 expression is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level by the AHR, which, when activated by ligands such as DMBA or TCDD, acts as a transcription factor by binding to theCYP1A1 promoter and up-regulating transcription. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of transfected cells with DMBA or TCDD caused a 4- or 7-fold increase, respectively, in CYP1A1 promoter-controlled transcription. Unlike the AHR inhibitor resveratrol (31Ciolino H.P. Daschner P.J. Yeh G.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5707-5712PubMed Google Scholar), DHEA did not inhibit DMBA- or TCDD-induced transcription even at high concentrations (Fig. 6). Furthermore, DHEA inhibited even the basal level of CYP1A1 mRNA levels in the absence of treatment with AHR ligands (Fig. 5), suggesting the DHEA operates by a mechanism other than by inhibiting AHR activity. This was confirmed by ligand binding and gel shift assays, which showed that DHEA had no effect on the binding of TCDD to cytosolic AHR and no effect on the DMBA- or TCDD-activated binding of the AHR to the CYP1A1 promoter (data not shown). These data indicate that DHEA does not carry out its inhibitory activity with regard to CYP1A1 expression by affecting the ligand-induced transcription of CYP1A1. Although there are numerous studies that demonstrate thatCYP1A1 expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level, one study indicated that post-transcriptional mechanisms, i.e. mRNA stability, may play a role in determining the level of CYP1A1 mRNA (33Chen Y.H. Riby J. Srivastava P. Bartholomew J. Denison M. Bjeldanes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22548-22555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because our data indicate that DHEA decreases CYP1A1 mRNA but does not affectCYP1A1 transcription, we examined the effect of DHEA on CYP1A1 mRNA degradation by carrying out actinomycin D chase experiments. These experiments indicate that DHEA significantly shortens the half-life of CYP1A1 mRNA (Figs. 7 and 8). This increased mRNA degradation seems to be selective because GAPDH mRNA was unaffected by DHEA. The inhibition of CYP1A1expression by DHEA therefore appears to occur at a post-transcriptional level through modulation of CYP1A1 mRNA stability. Although mRNA stability plays a major role in the determination of gene expression, the regulation of mRNA stability is poorly understood, and the mechanism by which DHEA affects mRNA stability remains to be studied. The modulation of CYP1A1 mRNA stability by a chemopreventive compound is novel and may represent an important mechanism of chemoprevention. The current data are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that DHEA inhibits the expression of CYP1A1. This provides a possible explanation for the potent chemopreventive activity of DHEA with regard to the initiation of chemically induced carcinogenesis. In this model system, this inhibition occurs at physiologically relevant concentrations. Thus, DHEA may serve to modulate the response to xenobiotics in vivo. This may be a heretofore unrecognized physiologic function of DHEA. We thank Dr. Susan N. Perkins for careful review of the manuscript."

Bowser R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Saha V. Chaplin T. Gregorini A. Ayton P. Young B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This new class of zinc finger proteins contains a unique combination of cysteine and histidine residues that form two zinc-binding clusters composed of Cys4-His-Cys3. This family of proteins contains several classic transcription factors such as the Drosophilatrithorax protein brahma and the PHD proteins HOX1.A and HAT3.1 (3Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Other members of this class of zinc fingers such as theDrosophila polycomb gene group appear to play a role in chromatin reorganization (3Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Apart from the common zinc finger motif, these proteins diverge greatly, containing chromodomains, bromodomains, and even other DNA-binding motifs. Although the PHD/LAP finger has been shown to bind zinc and DNA (4Mazo A. Huang D. Mozer B. Dawid I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5Schindler U. Beckman H. Cashmore A. Plant J. 1993; 4: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), it also acts as an interface for protein-protein interactions linking family members that bind DNA to family members that alter chromatin structure (6Peterson C. Dingwall A. Scott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 7Franke A. DeCamillis M. Zinc D. Cheng N. Brock H.W. Paro R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In most cases, characterized PHD/LAP family members function to regulate gene expression (2Saha V. Chaplin T. Gregorini A. Ayton P. Young B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9737-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In addition to the PHD/LAP zinc finger motif, FAC1 also contains two putative nuclear localization signals, a putative nuclear export signal, two putative retinoblastoma susceptibility binding motifs, and an acidic domain (1Zhu P. Bowser R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These domains are often present in proteins that regulate gene expression. FAC1 expression patterns also suggest a role in regulating gene expression specifically during neuronal development and degeneration. In adult cortex, FAC1 is expressed at low levels and exhibits punctate nuclear staining excluding the nucleolus (8Bowser R. Giambrone A. Davies P. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, during cortical development or neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, FAC1 is expressed at high levels and is localized throughout the nucleus, cell body, and neurites (8Bowser R. Giambrone A. Davies P. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Mu X. Springer J.E. Bowser R. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The significance of altering FAC1 subcellular distribution is observed during cortical development. In less differentiated neurons located in the outer cortical layers, FAC1 is present in the cell body and extending neurites (8Bowser R. Giambrone A. Davies P. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the more mature inner cortical layers where neurons have established synaptic connections, FAC1 is present in the nucleus and appears to localize to specific regions within the nucleus, similar to the pattern seen in adult cortex. The presence of FAC1 in the nucleus is consistent with a role for FAC1 in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, the ability of FAC1 to alter gene expression may be regulated by removing FAC1 from the nucleus in response to specific stimuli. We hypothesize that FAC1 functions to regulate gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FAC1 binds a unique DNA sequence. This sequence has been identified and shown to be specifically recognized by both recombinant and cellular FAC1 proteins. The identified FAC1-binding element (FBE) is present in a number of endogenous promoters, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a gene product implicated in neuronal development and neurodegeneration during Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, when the FBE is included in a heterologous, transcriptionally active promoter, FAC1 represses transcription. These data indicate that FAC1 functions as a transcriptional regulator and that its target genes are likely important players in neuronal development and neurodegenerative diseases. To produce a degenerate double-stranded nucleotide, a template was synthesized containing 15 degenerate nucleotides flanked on each side by an 18-base constant region (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) (10Xiang M. Zhou L. Macke J.P. Yoshioka T. Hendry S.H. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4762-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The template sequence was 5′-GGATGGATCCTGCAGTAC(N15)AGCTGAGCGAATTCGGTC-3′. Two 18-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized for amplification from this template: a 5′-primer (5′-GGATGGATCCTGCAGTAC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-GACCGAATTCGCTCAGCT-3′). The complementary strand (3′-primer) was also used to prime the synthesis of the second strand of the template using Taq DNA polymerase (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Human FAC1cDNA was directionally cloned into pGEX5X-1 via theEcoRI-SalI cloning sites using PCR amplification. GST-FAC1 protein was purified by the specific interaction between GST and glutathione immobilized on Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At this point, the protein was used as a FAC1 affinity column (for the PCR-assisted binding site selection assay); or the purified protein was eluted from the Sepharose column by addition of 10 mm glutathione in EMSA buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) followed by dialysis in EMSA buffer to remove the glutathione and was used for EMSA. For purified fusion protein, ∼50 ng of protein was incubated with 0.5 ng of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in 20 μl of EMSA buffer for 20 min at room temperature (11Ausubel F.M.

When using cell extracts, 20–30 μg of protein was preincubated with salmon sperm DNA as a nonspecific competitor (1 μg of competitor/10 μg of protein) in EMSA buffer prior to addition of labeled probe to reduce nonspecific DNA-protein interactions. For competition reactions, unlabeled competitive molecules were preincubated with the protein for 5 min on ice prior to addition of labeled probe.

After 1.5 h, the polyacrylamide gel was removed from the apparatus, dried, and exposed to autoradiography film. Exposure time varied depending on the abundance of FAC1 protein present in the extract. Each EMSA was repeated at least three times to demonstrate reproducibility, and a representative autoradiograph was chosen for the figures. Protein extracts were prepared by detergent lysis on ice (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (14Logan T. Jordan K. Evans D. Hall D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 1-12Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was saved as the “cytosolic extract,” and the pellet containing the nuclei was further extracted with high salt buffer (0.42 mNaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 10 min. Residual insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was collected and termed the “nuclear extract.” Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoblotting, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by electrophoresis and blocked in 5% nonfat milk and Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl). Monoclonal anti-FAC1 antibody FA-2, which recognizes primate and rodent FAC1 proteins, was used at a 1:10 dilution in 0.5% milk overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min. An isotype-specific secondary antibody was used to detect FA-2 (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:500 dilution), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The secondary antibody was washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline (three times for 20 min). The antibody was then visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products) NIH3T3 fibroblasts and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% bovine serum. MSN-2 cells were cultured in 15% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640 medium. PC12 cells were cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum in RPMI 1640 medium on collagen I-coated plates. PT67 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. For all cells, the medium was changed every 3 days, and the cells were split 1:5 once they came in contact with each other. Cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/ml. Transient transfections were initiated on tissue culture dishes that were 20–50% confluent (12Jordan K.L. Evans D.L. Steelman S. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12320-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transfection DNA was resuspended in a 250 mmCaCl2 solution that was added dropwise to a 2× HEPES-buffered saline solution (Promega). The resulting mixture was allowed to precipitate for 20 min prior to addition to cells. 4 h after addition of DNA, the NIH3T3 cells were glycerol-shocked for 2 min with 10% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. Plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. The transfection medium was changed 24 h after transfection of PT67 cells, which was found to produce the highest transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Photinusluciferase production was assayed by scraping cells in luciferase assay lysis buffer, vortexing, removing the cellular debris by centrifugation, and collecting the supernatant. 20 μl of supernatant solution was added to 75 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega) and measured in a luminometer (Berthold Lumomat LB9501). Luminescence values were normalized to protein concentration as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Each transfection was performed a total of six times. Three times with no reporter was used to control for transfection efficiency, and three times with a second reporter (pRL-TK; dual reporter luciferase assay, Promega) containing theRenilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Whether the transfection efficiency control was included or not, we saw the same relative values of Photinus luciferase activity in response to the presence of FAC1. This suggested that the transfection efficiencies were the same. The values shown are an average of all six transfection experiments. The primary amino acid sequence of FAC1 contains a PHD/LAP zinc finger and a region rich in basic amino acids adjacent to a highly acidic amino-terminal domain. Since DNA-binding proteins often contain regions with this amino acid consistency, we hypothesized that FAC1 functions as a site-specific DNA-binding protein and proposed to identify the consensus FBE using the PCR-assisted binding site selection assay (10Xiang M.

Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 12.11.1-12.11.8Google Scholar). The first 398 amino acids of FAC1 were chosen for use in this assay because the zinc finger, basic region, and acidic region are present in this protein fragment. A FAC1-(1–398) affinity column was made by producing a fusion between FAC1-(1–398) and GST, which binds glutathione conjugated to Sepharose beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Double-stranded oligonucleotides with 15 degenerate sites flanked by 18 base pairs of known sequence were incubated with immobilized GST-FAC1-(1–398). Unbound DNA was washed away, and bound DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 18-base pair flanking sequence. This enriched pool of oligonucleotides was incubated with column-immobilized GST-FAC1-(1–398), and the process was repeated four times. After the final DNA extraction, the population of oligonucleotides enriched for the FBE was amplified by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP for use as a probe in an EMSA with GST-FAC1-(1–398). The DNA sequence in complex with FAC1 migrated more slowly on the nondenaturing gel than DNA alone and was excised, amplified by PCR, and used again as a probe in a second EMSA. The DNA contained in the shifted complex from the second EMSA was excised, amplified by PCR, and cloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). Twenty-four clones were isolated, sequenced, and compared for a FAC1-binding consensus sequence (Fig.1). Pairwise comparison of the sequences revealed that the consensus sequence was likely CACAACAC, as one-third of the clones contained this site with no more than a single base change. No more than three nonconsecutive single base changes were contained in the majority of the clones. Several of the identified sites were tested for FAC1 binding (data not shown), but none bound FAC1 as well as the identified consensus sequence (Fig. 1), which is referred to as the FBE. Comparison of the identified FBE sequences suggests that certain residues are more important for binding. Specifically, the central AACA sequence is present most often in the identified sites. When this sequence is compared with a DNA-binding site data base (15Locker J. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Essential Data Series: Transcription Factors. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom1996: 12-55Google Scholar), the core sequence is found in the binding sites of several unrelated transcription factors. The E-box element, which is bound by the myogenic factors E2A and myogenin (16Jacobs Y. Vierra C. Nelson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7321-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Voronova A. Lee F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 91: 5952-5956Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Edmondson D.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21Kaufmann E. Hoch M. Jackle H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) both have an AACA sequence within their consensus binding sites. Also, the transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (TIF-2)-binding site (MRAACA), which is important for thyroid gene regulation, also contains the core sequence (22Zollman S. Godt D. Prive G. Couderc J. Laski F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10717-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). All of these proteins belong to distinct classes of DNA-binding proteins and share no homology with FAC1, but their recognition of a similar sequence suggests that they may compete for binding to the FBE. To confirm that the FBE was bound by FAC1 in a specific manner, 24-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the FBE (Table I) for use as probes in competitive EMSA. Purified GST-FAC1-(1–398) was incubated with the labeled FBE by itself or with increasing concentrations of unlabeled specific competitor (30 and 100 ng of FBE) (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4). The observed complexes were due to the presence of FAC1, as GST alone did not produce any specific complexes (data not shown). The presence of multiple bands was due to breakdown of the fusion protein. To further demonstrate specificity, FAC1 was incubated with a nonspecific DNA competitor. Although 30 ng of unlabeled FBE was able to compete for binding with the probe (Fig. 2 A, compare lane 2with lanes 3 and 4), an unrelated sequence (Table I) failed to compete for binding even with 300 ng of competitor (compare lane 2 with lanes 5 and6). This demonstrates that FAC1 specifically recognizes the DNA sequence contained in the identified FBE.Table IOligonucleotides used for EMSA and cloningFBE-F1-aF, forward; R, reverse; MT, mutant.5′-GGGGATCCACAACACGGATCCGG-3′FBE-R5′-CCGGATCCGTGTTGTGGATCCCC-3′MT1-F5′-GGGATCCGGAACACAGATCTGG-3′MT1-R5′-CCAGATCTGTGTTCCGGATCCCC-3′MT2-F5′-GGGGATCCACGGCACAGATCTGG-3′MT2-R5′-CCAGATCTGTGCCGTGGATCCCC-3′MT3-F5′-GGGGATCCACAAGGCAGATCTGG-3′MT3-R5′-CCAGATCTGCCTTGTGGATCCCC-3′APP-FBE-F5′-AAAAAGACACAGACAAGGCAGAACACTTTAGAG-3′APP-FBE-R5′-CTCTAAAGTGTTCTGCCTTGTCTGTGTCTTTTT-3′UNRELATED-F5′-GATCATTCAGGTCATGACCTGA-3′UNRELATED-R5′-GATCTCAGGTCATGACCTGAAT-3′3×FBE-F5′-GATCGCACAACACGGCACAACACGGCACAACACGGATCCGTCGACC-3′3×FBE-R5′-TCGAGGTCGACGGATCCGTGTTGTGCCGTGTTGTGCCGTGTTGTGC-3′3×MTFBE-F5′-GATCGCGGAACACGGCGGAACACGGCGGAACACGGATCCGTCGACCGTAC-3′3×MTFBE-R5′-GGTCGACGGATCCGTGTTCCGCCGTGTTCCGCCGTGTTCCGC-3′Shown are the sequences of the oligonucleotide pairs annealed to form double-stranded DNA probes and competitor molecules for EMSA.

Open table in a new tab Shown are the sequences of the oligonucleotide pairs annealed to form double-stranded DNA probes and competitor molecules for EMSA.

The 3×FBE and 3×MTFBE oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pGL-2 expression vector using appropriate restrictions sites that are present in the sequence or produced as overhangs when oligonucleotides are annealed (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine which base pairs contributed to specific DNA recognition, double-stranded oligonucleotides with point mutations introduced pairwise throughout the FBE (Table I) were synthesized and used as unlabeled competitor in an EMSA (a representative gel is shown in Fig.2 B). None of the mutants competed for DNA binding as well as the wild-type FBE. However, mutant 2 (an AA → GG change at base pairs 4 and 5) required 100-fold more competitor to compete away 42% of the DNA-binding activity as compared with the wild-type competitor (Fig. 2,B, lanes 6–8; and C, open circles). This is interesting because the middle two adenine residues were present in 94% of the identified sites, further implicating their requirement for FAC1 recognition (Fig. 1). Mutant 1 did not efficiently compete for >50% DNA binding even at 300 ng of competitor (Fig. 2, B, lanes 3–5; andC, open diamonds). Mutant 3 required 10-fold more DNA than the wild type to compete for 50% of the DNA binding, which was about the same as the unrelated sequence (Fig. 2, B,lanes 9–11; and C, open triangles). These studies demonstrate that the identified site is bound specifically by FAC1 and that the nucleotides identified are essential for optimal DNA-protein complex formation. Next, we wanted to demonstrate that endogenous, full-length FAC1 also recognized the identified FBE. By Western analysis, we found that FAC1 was present at various levels in a number of cell lines tested (Fig.3 A). FAC1 expression was highest in nuclear extracts from the human neuroblastoma cell line MSN-2. It was also present in nuclear extracts from rodent pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and green monkey kidney COS cells (Fig.3 A). However, no expression was detected in either nuclear or cytosolic extracts from murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The abundance of FAC1 seen in nuclear extracts was reflected in the amount of DNA-protein complex formed in an EMSA (Fig. 3 B). MSN-2 nuclear extracts produced the most FBE-binding activity, whereas PC12 nuclear extracts had reduced amounts of FBE complex. NIH3T3 nuclear extracts produced no observable DNA-protein complex (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that the observed FBE-protein complex is in the same relative abundance as FAC1. Fig. 3 also demonstrates that rodent FAC1 migrated slightly faster in an EMSA, which is likely due to the slight difference in size and amino acid composition of rodent FAC1 (Fig.3 B). 2K. L. Jordan-Sciutto, J. M. Dragich, J. L. Rhodes, and R. Bowser, unpublished observations. To demonstrate that the observed FBE-protein complex has the same binding specificity as recombinant FAC1, nuclear extracts from all the cell lines expressing FAC1 were used in competition EMSAs. A single DNA-protein complex was observed in all the cell lines tested (Fig. 3,C and D). The wild-type FBE competed at 30 ng of unlabeled DNA in PC12, MSN-2, and COS cells (Fig. 3, C andD). Mutants 1–3 competed for binding in the observed complex only when 300 ng of competitor was added to PC12 nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 C). The FBE-binding protein from COS and MSN-2 extracts exhibited the same binding specificity as demonstrated for PC12 cell extracts (data not shown). This suggests that the cellular protein contained in the observed complex has the same binding specificity as recombinant FAC1. To further establish that the protein recognizing the FBE in these cell lines is indeed FAC1, we transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts (which do not express FAC1 by Western analysis or EMSA) with a human FAC1 expression vector. By immunoblotting, FAC1-transfected NIH3T3 cells expressed FAC1 in the nuclear fraction similar to MSN-2 cells (data not shown). Nuclear extracts from FAC1-transfected NIH3T3 cells produced a DNA-protein complex in an EMSA not seen in untransfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2and 3). The new complex observed in the FAC1-transfected NIH3T3 extracts was dependent upon FAC1 expression and is likely to contain FAC1. When analyzed on the same gel alongside MSN-2 nuclear extracts, the complex from FAC1-transfected NIH3T3 cell extracts migrated with the same characteristics as the complex observed in MSN-2 cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 3). This suggests that the complex characterized in MSN-2 cells behaves the same as the FBE complex from FAC1-transfected cells, providing indirect evidence that the FBE-protein complex contains FAC1. PT67 cells transfected with FAC1 exhibited far more DNA-binding activity than mock-transfected PT67 cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and3). Transfected FAC1 behaved the same as endogenous FAC1 in these cells as it was competed by the wild-type FBE, but not by an unrelated sequence (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and5). This further suggests that the binding activity observed in these cells is a direct result of FAC1 expression and that the FBE complex contains FAC1. Since our current antibodies do not recognize native FAC1 protein, we were unable to perform a supershift assay; however, these data highly suggest that the FBE-binding activity in the various cell lines is a direct result of FAC1-FBE interaction. To determine if FAC1 is able to alter transcription when bound to the identified FBE, we cloned three FBEs at 10-base pair intervals (3×FBE) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. 3×FBE was cloned proximal to the transcription initiation site (promoter) in the context of the SV40 promoter and enhancer elements to test if FAC1 can repress transcription of an active promoter through the FBE site (Fig.5 A, FBE-P). The site was also cloned distal to the transcription initiation site (enhancer region) to determine if FAC1 can repress transcription at a distance from the transcription initiation site (Fig. 5 A,FBE-E). Each of these reporter plasmids was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with and without a FAC1 expression vector. When FAC1 was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with an FBE-containing reporter plasmid, there was a dramatic decrease in transcriptional activity from both promoter and enhancer constructs (Fig. 5 B). When FBE sites in the promoter or enhancer region were changed to correspond to mutant 1 (Table I) sequences (MT-P and MT-E, respectively), there was only a 3-fold reduction in activity as opposed to the 30-fold reduction seen with wild-type FBE sites (Fig.5 B). This is consistent with the 10-fold reduction in binding affinity for this site as shown by EMSA (Fig. 2, Band C). Taken together, these data suggest that FAC1 acts as a potent repressor of the SV40 promoter in NIH3T3 cells and that this repression occurs through FAC1 interaction with the FBE. FAC1 represents a novel member of the PHD/LAP zinc finger family that is developmentally regulated in human brain and that changes localization between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. To functionally characterize FAC1, we have identified the DNA sequence recognized by the amino terminus of FAC1. The identified sequence (CACAACAC) is not recognized as the consensus site for any other characterized transcription factor. However, the core sequence (AACA) is present in the consensus site for several unrelated DNA-binding proteins. This suggests that FAC1 may compete with other transcription factors for binding to its consensus site. Pairwise mutations of the 6 central base pairs reduced the ability of FAC1 to recognize the FBE, confirming that the identified site is indeed the FAC1-binding element. Using nuclear extracts from both neuronal and non-neuronal FAC1-expressing cell lines, we have demonstrated that FAC1 produced in mammalian cells forms a specific complex with the FBE. Therefore, the identified site is preferentially recognized by FAC1 over other proteins present in the nucleus. Since the majority of the FAC1 amino acid sequence has minimal homology to other known proteins, its DNA-binding motif will likely be novel. The presence of the PHD/LAP zinc finger, a motif seen in many proteins known to regulate gene expression, implicates FAC1 in regulation of gene expression. Several members of the PHD/LAP zinc finger family contain domains necessary for interaction with and reorganization of heterochromatin (2Saha V. Chaplin T. Gregorini A. Ayton P. Young B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9737-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), suggesting an ability to alter gene expression by physically altering the chromatin structure. The PHD/LAP zinc finger domain has been suggested to act as a protein-protein interaction domain. We propose that this family of proteins, which diverges significantly outside of the common zinc finger motif, forms large multiprotein complexes that modulate gene expression. Genes modulated by this complex would depend on family members that contain DNA-binding domains to direct complex formation to specific regions of chromatin. Specific PHD/LAP family members would be responsible for rearranging chromatin structure or interacting with the basal transcription machinery, ultimately altering target gene expression. The ability of FAC1 to specifically bind DNA and its unique expression pattern in development, specifically in the central nervous system, suggest that it may be responsible for recruiting the chromatin-reorganizing complex to promoters specific for neuronal differentiation. FAC1 transcriptional regulation through the identified DNA-binding site was demonstrated by cotransfection of FAC1 and reporter plasmids containing the FBE in NIH3T3 cells. Multiple FBEs upstream of a reporter gene renders the promoter FAC1-responsive. In response to FAC1, transcription from an FBE-containing promoter is repressed dramatically. This repression is seen whether the cognate binding site is proximal or distal to the transcription initiation site. These data suggest that FAC1 can regulate transcriptional activity over a distance from the transcription start site. We have identified the presence of multiple FBEs in the transcriptional regulatory regions of several genes implicated in neuronal development and degeneration. Two proteins implicated in Alzheimer's disease, APP and the presenilin-1 gene, contain several FBE sites in their distal enhancer regions (Fig.6) (23Salbaum J. Weidemann A. Lemaire H. Masters C. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). 3Mitsuda, N., Boteva, K., Gilbert, J., Roses, A., and Vitek, M. (1997) GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF029701. The dopamine D2 receptor and Cu2+,Zn2+-superoxide dismutase-1 genes also contain FBE sites in their regulatory regions (Fig. 6) (25Minowa T. Minowa M. Mouradian M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8389-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,26Kim H. Kim Y. Nam J. Lee H. Rho H. Jung G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 4The GenBankTM EBI accession number for the promoter sequence of the dopamine D2 receptor used in this study is U04330 and for the Cu2+,Zn2+-superoxide dismutase-1 promoter it isZ29336. This site is not present in all promoters. FBE promoter selectivity is demonstrated by its presence only in the dopamine D2 receptor regulatory region, but not other dopamine receptor family members. Since these elements are usually found 1–3 kilobase pairs from the transcription initiation site, they are likely enhancer elements. This suggests that FAC1 may potentially regulate expression of subsets of genes that are important for neuronal development, survival, and degeneration. FAC1 DNA-binding activity is phosphorylation-dependent (27Jordan-Sciutto K. Dragich J. Bowser R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that FAC1 transcriptional regulatory activity is modulated by cellular kinases and phosphatases. When FAC1 is phosphorylated and in the nucleus, it binds DNA and down-regulates expression of target genes. However, in response to neuronal injury, FAC1 localizes to the cytoplasm, where it is no longer in contact with DNA. Removal of FAC1 from the nucleus would alleviate its target promoters of its regulatory effects. Since FAC1 is also present in the cytoplasm of neurons during development, it is possible that alleviation of FAC1 regulatory activity results in changes in expression of genes needed for neurite elongation and neuronal differentiation. There is evidence that the APP gene product contributes to neurite elongation, cell survival, and neurodegeneration (28Pierce J.E.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Graham D.I. Smith D.H. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Goodman Y. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 128: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 30Roberson M.R. Harrell L.E. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 25: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). APP is required for neurite guidance during development (28Pierce J.E.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Graham D.I. Smith D.H. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When correctly processed, soluble APP protects neurons from death (29Goodman Y. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 128: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). However, during Alzheimer's disease, APP is alternatively processed to the β-amyloid peptide that forms an insoluble, extracellular aggregate (30Roberson M.R. Harrell L.E. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 25: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). β-Amyloid deposition leads to the formation of amyloid plaques and neuronal degeneration. FAC1 is localized to the dystrophic neurites and neuritic components within β-amyloid-containing plaques (24Schoonover S. Davies P. Bowser R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In these degenerating neurons, FAC1 is no longer in the nucleus and therefore no longer alters expression of target genes potentially including APP. Our data suggest the following model. Translocation of FAC1 to the cytoplasm will alleviate FAC1 repression from promoters containing FBEs, which may include the APP promoter, causing local changes in APP expression. If APP expression is increased and incorrectly processed to β-amyloid, further amyloid deposition would occur. The identification of FAC1 as a site-specific DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription provides a starting point to study the involvement of this novel protein in neuronal development and disease. Much work remains to define the pathways leading to changes in FAC1 localization and whether protein redistribution results in changes in gene expression. Since several of the promoters that contain FAC1-binding sites are implicated in development and Alzheimer's disease, it will be interesting to study the effect FAC1 has on their expression in the context of the other transcriptional regulators, especially during neurodegeneration. We will continue to characterize the role of FAC1 in transcriptional regulation by looking at its effect on endogenous promoters and by determining the specific amino acids required for DNA-binding activity and transcriptional regulation.
