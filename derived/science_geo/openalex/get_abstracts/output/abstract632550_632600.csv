https://openalex.org/W2942610007,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells."
https://openalex.org/W2943220296,"While the roles of parenchymal microglia in brain homeostasis and disease are fairly clear, other brain-resident myeloid cells remain less well understood. By dissecting border regions and combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-dimensional cytometry, bulk RNA-sequencing, fate-mapping and microscopy, we reveal the diversity of non-parenchymal brain macrophages. Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) residing in the dura mater, subdural meninges and choroid plexus consisted of distinct subsets with tissue-specific transcriptional signatures, and their cellular composition changed during postnatal development. BAMs exhibited a mixed ontogeny, and subsets displayed distinct self-renewal capacity following depletion and repopulation. Single-cell and fate-mapping analysis both suggested that there is a unique microglial subset residing on the apical surface of the choroid plexus epithelium. Finally, gene network analysis and conditional deletion revealed IRF8 as a master regulator that drives the maturation and diversity of brain macrophages. Our results provide a framework for understanding host-macrophage interactions in both the healthy and diseased brain."

We present Scanorama, an algorithm that identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of datasets and accurately integrates heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq data. We applied Scanorama to integrate and remove batch effects across 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments representing 9 different technologies. Scanorama is sensitive to subtle temporal changes within the same cell lineage, successfully integrating functionally similar cells across time series data of CD14+ monocytes at different stages of differentiation into macrophages. Finally, we show that Scanorama is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques and can integrate a collection of 1,095,538 cells in just ~9 h. Scanorama integrates single-cell RNA-seq datasets from different tissues, different labs, different experiments or different technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2943223175,"Microbiomes from every environment contain a myriad of uncultivated archaeal and bacterial viruses, but studying these viruses is hampered by the lack of a universal, scalable taxonomic framework. We present vConTACT v.2.0, a network-based application utilizing whole genome gene-sharing profiles for virus taxonomy that integrates distance-based hierarchical clustering and confidence scores for all taxonomic predictions. We report near-identical (96%) replication of existing genus-level viral taxonomy assignments from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses for National Center for Biotechnology Information virus RefSeq. Application of vConTACT v.2.0 to 1,364 previously unclassified viruses deposited in virus RefSeq as reference genomes produced automatic, high-confidence genus assignments for 820 of the 1,364. We applied vConTACT v.2.0 to analyze 15,280 Global Ocean Virome genome fragments and were able to provide taxonomic assignments for 31% of these data, which shows that our algorithm is scalable to very large metagenomic datasets. Our taxonomy tool can be automated and applied to metagenomes from any environment for virus classification. Classification of archaeal and bacterial viruses can be automated with an algorithm that identifies relationships on the basis of shared gene content."

https://openalex.org/W2942816224,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain balanced self-renewal and differentiation, but how these functions are precisely regulated is not fully understood. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) messenger RNA methylation has emerged as an important mode of epitranscriptional gene expression regulation affecting many biological processes. We show that deletion of the m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 from the adult haematopoietic system led to an accumulation of HSCs in the bone marrow and a marked reduction of reconstitution potential due to a blockage of HSC differentiation. Interestingly, deleting Mettl3 from myeloid cells using Lysm-cre did not impact myeloid cell number or function. RNA sequencing revealed 2,073 genes with significant m6A modifications in HSCs. Myc was identified as a direct target of m6A in HSCs. Mettl3-deficient HSCs failed to upregulate MYC expression following stimulation to differentiate and enforced expression of Myc rescued differentiation defects of Mettl3-deficient HSCs. Our results reveal a key role of m6A in governing HSC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2942868704,"Owing to recent medical and technological advances in neonatal care, infants born extremely premature have increased survival rates1,2. After birth, these infants are at high risk of hypoxic episodes because of lung immaturity, hypotension and lack of cerebral-flow regulation, and can develop a severe condition called encephalopathy of prematurity3. Over 80% of infants born before post-conception week 25 have moderate-to-severe long-term neurodevelopmental impairments4. The susceptible cell types in the cerebral cortex and the molecular mechanisms underlying associated gray-matter defects in premature infants remain unknown. Here we used human three-dimensional brain-region-specific organoids to study the effect of oxygen deprivation on corticogenesis. We identified specific defects in intermediate progenitors, a cortical cell type associated with the expansion of the human cerebral cortex, and showed that these are related to the unfolded protein response and changes. Moreover, we verified these findings in human primary cortical tissue and demonstrated that a small-molecule modulator of the unfolded protein response pathway can prevent the reduction in intermediate progenitors following hypoxia. We anticipate that this human cellular platform will be valuable for studying the environmental and genetic factors underlying injury in the developing human brain."

https://openalex.org/W2944793553,"The signaling nucleotide cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is the only known essential second messenger in bacteria. Recently, c-di-AMP has been identified as being essential for controlling potassium uptake in the model organism Bacillus subtilis and several other bacteria. A B. subtilis strain lacking c-di-AMP is not viable at high potassium concentrations, unless the bacteria acquire suppressor mutations. In this study, we isolated such suppressor mutants and found mutations that reduced the activities of the potassium transporters KtrCD and KimA. Although c-di-AMP–mediated control of KtrCD has previously been demonstrated, it is unknown how c-di-AMP affects KimA activity. Using the DRaCALA screening assay, we tested for any interactions of KimA and other potential target proteins in B. subtilis with c-di-AMP. This assay identified KimA, as well as the K+/H+ antiporter KhtT, the potassium exporter CpaA (YjbQ), the osmoprotectant transporter subunit OpuCA, the primary Mg2+ importer MgtE, and DarB (YkuL), a protein of unknown function, as bona fide c-di-AMP–binding proteins. Further, binding of c-di-AMP to KimA inhibited potassium uptake. Our results indicate that c-di-AMP controls KimA-mediated potassium transport at both kimA gene expression and KimA activity levels. Moreover, the discovery that potassium exporters are c-di-AMP targets indicates that this second messenger controls potassium homeostasis in B. subtilis at a global level by binding to riboswitches and to different classes of transport proteins involved in potassium uptake and export.

This makes c-di-AMP the only known second messenger that controls a single biological process by binding both to a protein and to the corresponding mRNA.

However, only very few target molecules of the dinucleotide are known for this model organism. In a first screen for c-di-AMP targets in B. subtilis, only one protein could be identified: the PII-like signal transduction protein DarA showed high and specific affinity for c-di-AMP, although its function has remained enigmatic (21Gundlach J.

Much less is known about the potassium export systems of B. subtilis. The KhtSTU complex and the YugO proteins are suggested to be potassium exporters (26Prindle A. Liu J. Asally M. Ly S.

In addition, the YjbQ protein is similar to the S. aureus potassium exporter CpaA, which was also shown to bind c-di-AMP via its RCK_C domain (28Chin K.H. Liang J.M. Yang J.G. Shih M.S. Tu Z.L.

B. subtilis encodes five proteins containing an RCK_C domain and 16 proteins with CBS domains (29Zhu B. Stülke J. SubtiWiki in 2018: From genes and proteins to functional network annotation of the model organism Bacillus subtilis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29788229): D743-D74810.1093/nar/gkx908Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), many of which are potential potassium and osmolyte transporters, respectively. To get a more comprehensive understanding of c-di-AMP–mediated signaling in this bacterium, we have tested the potential binding of the second messenger to these proteins, as well as to the newly discovered potassium importer KimA. Our results support the idea that c-di-AMP is responsible for the global control of potassium homeostasis, by controlling both its uptake and its export. A B. subtilis strain lacking all three diadenylate cyclases is unable to grow at potassium concentrations of 5 mm or higher. However, the acquisition of suppressor mutations at 5 mm potassium that affect the cation exporter NhaK and result in enhanced potassium secretion prevents the toxic effect of potassium (4Gundlach J. Herzberg C. Kaever V. Gunka K. Hoffmann T. Weiss M. Gibhardt J. Thürmer A. Hertel D. Daniel R. Bremer E. Commichau F.M. Stülke J. Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 (28420751): eaal301110.1126/scisignal.aal3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, those suppressor mutants were not viable at a potassium concentration of 20 mm. To identify the growth-limiting problem, we sought to isolate suppressor mutants that tolerate this potassium concentration. For this purpose, we plated the c-di-AMP–free strain GP2222 (4Gundlach J. Herzberg C. Kaever V. Gunka K. Hoffmann T. Weiss M. Gibhardt J. Thürmer A. Hertel D. Daniel R. Bremer E. Commichau F.M. Stülke J. Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 (28420751): eaal301110.1126/scisignal.aal3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) on MSSM (modified sodium spizizen minimal) medium containing 20 mm KCl. After 4 days at 37 °C, two colonies could be isolated. Both strains (GP2737 and GP2738) were subjected to whole genome sequencing to identify the responsible mutations. Both strains carried point mutations affecting the potassium transporter KimA (Trp-520 replaced by Gly) and KtrCD’s regulatory subunit KtrC (Ala-73 replaced by Val). Moreover, both strains carried a point mutation in FlhA, which is part of the flagellar type III export apparatus. Finally, one of the mutants (GP2737) carried a frameshift mutation in odhA, which results in loss of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity as indicated by the reddish color of the colonies (25Gundlach J. Herzberg C. Hertel D. Thürmer A. Daniel R. Link H. Stülke J. Adaptation of Bacillus subtilis to life at extreme potassium limitation.mBio. 2017; 8 (28679749): e00817-e00861Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To study the role of the mutations affecting the potassium uptake systems, we first attempted to delete the kimA and ktrC genes in the c-di-AMP–free strain GP2222. Although a control experiment (deletion of the nhaK gene) was successful, the deletion of kimA or ktrC was not possible. This observation suggests that the point mutations did not completely prevent the KimA and KtrC activities. The mutation in KtrC affects a highly conserved residue in the RCK_N domain. Similarly, the Trp-520 residue is conserved in the KimA proteins of B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The conservation of the substituted amino acids suggests that the mutant proteins have reduced activity. Because no detailed information on the activity of KimA is available, we decided to analyze the activity of the mutant protein in a heterologous complementation assay using Escherichia coli LB2003 (30Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Requirement of a large K+-uptake capacity and of extracytoplasmic protease activity for protamine resistance of Escherichia coli.Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167 (9042752): 126-13610.1007/s002030050425Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This strain is deficient in the three major endogenous potassium uptake systems Trk, Kup, and Kdp and is therefore not able to grow at low potassium concentrations without complementation using a gene encoding a potassium transporter. For the IPTG-inducible expression of the WT and mutant KimA variants, we used plasmids pGP2913 and pGP2993, respectively. Accordingly, E. coli LB2003 was transformed with these plasmids or the empty vector control pWH844 (31Schirmer F. Ehrt S. Hillen W. Expression, inducer spectrum, domain structure, and function of MopR, the regulator of phenol degradation in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus NCIB8250.J.

Although 50 mm KCl was required for growth of the strain carrying the empty vector, expression of WT KimA (Ref. 4Gundlach J. Herzberg C. Kaever V. Gunka K. Hoffmann T. Weiss M. Gibhardt J. Thürmer A.

Here we present zapalog, a small-molecule dimerizer that undergoes photolysis when exposed to blue light. Zapalog dimerizes any two proteins tagged with the FKBP and DHFR domains until exposure to light causes its photolysis. Dimerization can be repeatedly restored with uncleaved zapalog. We implement this method to investigate mitochondrial motility and positioning in cultured neurons. Using zapalog, we tether mitochondria to constitutively active kinesin motors, forcing them down the axon towards microtubule (+) ends until their instantaneous release via blue light, which results in full restoration of their endogenous motility. We find that one-third of stationary mitochondria cannot be pulled away from their position and that these firmly anchored mitochondria preferentially localize to VGLUT1-positive presynapses. Furthermore, inhibition of actin polymerization with latrunculin A reduces this firmly anchored pool. On release from exogenous motors, mitochondria are preferentially recaptured at presynapses."

So far, only a limited number of relatively small scale studies comprising few cell lines and/or drugs have been performed. To obtain a broader view on miRNAs and their association with drug response, we investigated the expression levels of 411 miRNAs in relation to drug sensitivity in 36 breast cancer cell lines. For this purpose IC50 values of a drug screen involving 34 drugs were associated with miRNA expression data of the same breast cancer cell lines. Since molecular subtype of the breast cancer cell lines is considered a confounding factor in drug association studies, multivariate analysis taking subtype into account was performed on significant miRNA-drug associations which retained 13 associations. These associations consisted of 11 different miRNAs and eight different drugs (among which Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Veliparib). The taxanes, Paclitaxel and Docetaxel, were the only drugs having miRNAs in common: hsa-miR-187-5p and hsa-miR-106a-3p indicative of drug resistance while Paclitaxel sensitivity alone associated with hsa-miR-556-5p. Tivantinib was associated with hsa-let-7d-5p and hsa-miR-18a-5p for sensitivity and hsa-miR-637 for resistance. Drug sensitivity was associated with hsa-let-7a-5p for Bortezomib, hsa-miR-135a-3p for JNJ-707 and hsa-miR-185-3p for Panobinostat. Drug resistance was associated with hsa-miR-182-5p for Veliparib and hsa-miR-629-5p for Tipifarnib. Pathway analysis for significant miRNAs was performed to reveal biological roles, aiding to find a potential mechanistic link for the observed associations with drug response. By doing so hsa-miR-187-5p was linked to the cell cycle G2-M checkpoint in line with this checkpoint being the target of taxanes. In conclusion, our study shows that miRNAs could potentially serve as biomarkers for intrinsic drug resistance and that pathway analyses can provide additional information in this context."

This study aims to investigate the self-reported hepatitis B vaccination status among HCWs in China.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health_care workers' vaccination statuses in 120 hospitals in China by collecting demographic and vaccination data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to assess factors associated with hepatitis B vaccination coverage.Eighty-six percent (2,666/3,104) of respondents reported having received at least one dose of the hepatitis B vaccination and 60% (1,853/3,104) reported having completed ≥3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccination. Factors associated with completing ≥3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccination included workplaces offering free hepatitis B vaccination with vaccination management, age, medical occupation, hospital level, acceptable hepatitis B knowledge and having received training on hepatitis B. HCWs in workplaces offering a free hepatitis B vaccine with vaccination management were 1.4 times more likely (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8) to complete their hepatitis B vaccination compared to HCWs in workplaces that did not offer a free hepatitis B vaccine. Either the possession of acceptable hepatitis B knowledge or an age of 30-39 years increased the odds of complete hepatitis B vaccination by 1.3-fold (95% CIs: 1.1-1.5 and 1.1-1.7, respectively) over their referent category. The receipt of training on hepatitis B was also associated with a higher percentage of completing the hepatitis B vaccination (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8). The main self-reported reason for incomplete hepatitis B vaccination was ""forgot to complete follow-up doses"" among 43% (234/547) of respondents. Among those who never received any hepatitis B vaccination, only 30% (131/438) intended to be vaccinated. Obtaining immunity from work (40%) and hospitals that did not provide hepatitis B vaccination activities (40%) were the top reasons mentioned for refusing hepatitis B vaccination.The complete hepatitis B vaccination rate among HCWs in China is low, and the desire of HCWs for vaccination is indifferent; therefore, education campaigns are needed. In addition, a free national hepatitis B vaccination policy for HCWs that includes vaccination management should be prioritized to improve hepatitis B coverage among HCWs who are at-risk for HBV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2944777530,"Radiomic analysis has recently demonstrated versatile uses in improving diagnostic and prognostic prediction accuracy for lung cancer. However, since lung tumors are subject to substantial motion due to respiration, the stability of radiomic features over the respiratory cycle of the patient needs to be investigated to better evaluate the robustness of the inter-patient feature variability for clinical applications, and its impact in such applications needs to be assessed. A full panel of 841 radiomic features, including tumor intensity, shape, texture, and wavelet features, were extracted from individual phases of a four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography on 20 early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The stability of each radiomic feature was assessed across different phase images of the same patient using the coefficient of variation (COV). The relationship between individual COVs and tumor motion magnitude was inspected. Population COVs, the mean COVs of all 20 patients, were used to evaluate feature motion stability and categorize the radiomic features into 4 different groups. The two extremes, the Very Small group (COV≤5%) and the Large group (COV>20%), each accounted for about a quarter of the features. Shape features were the most stable, with COV≤10% for all features. A clinical study was subsequently conducted using 140 early-stage NSCLC patients. Radiomic features were employed to predict the overall survival with a 500-round bootstrapping. Identical multiple regression model development process was applied, and the model performance was compared between models with and without a feature pre-selection step based on 4D COV to pre-exclude unstable features. Among the systematically tested cutoff values, feature pre-selection with 4D COV≤5% achieved the optimal model performance. The resulting 3-feature radiomic model significantly outperformed its counterpart with no 4D COV pre-selection, with P = 2.16x10-27 in the one-tailed t-test comparing the prediction performances of the two models."
https://openalex.org/W2944175483,"β-Catenin signaling is triggered by WNT proteins and is an important pathway that negatively regulates adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms controlling the expression of WNT proteins during adipogenesis remain incompletely understood. Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) is a histone demethylase that removes trimethyl (me3) marks from lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) and serves as a general transcriptional corepressor. Here, using the murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation model and an array of biochemical approaches, including ChIP, immunoprecipitation, RT-qPCR, and immunoblotting assays, we show that Kdm5a is a target gene of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), an important early transcription factor required for adipogenesis. We found that C/EBPβ binds to the Kdm5a gene promoter and transactivates its expression. We also found that siRNA-mediated KDM5A down-regulation inhibits 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. The KDM5A knockdown significantly up-regulates the negative regulator of adipogenesis Wnt6, having increased levels of the H3K4me3 mark on its promoter. We further observed that WNT6 knockdown significantly rescues adipogenesis inhibited by the KDM5A knockdown. Moreover, we noted that C/EBPβ negatively regulates Wnt6 expression by binding to the Wnt6 gene promoter and repressing Wnt6 transcription. Further experiments indicated that KDM5A interacts with C/EBPβ and that their interaction cooperatively inhibits Wnt6 transcription. Of note, C/EBPβ knockdown impaired the recruitment of KDM5A to the Wnt6 promoter, which had higher H3K4me3 levels.

In the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, Wnt proteins mediate downstream effects by stabilizing β-catenin, leading to the accumulation of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm. The accumulated β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and coactivates the T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor family of transcription factors to regulate Wnt/β-catenin target genes for cell fate regulation. It is well-known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling, by preventing the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ, is one of the major regulators of adipogenesis (20Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N.

Endogenous expression of Wnt6, Wn10a, and Wnt10b decreases during adipogenesis. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by overexpressing Wnt proteins, such as Wnt6, Wn10a, or Wnt10b, inhibits the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ and blocks adipogenesis in a β-catenin–dependent manner (21Longo K.A.

On the contrary, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by expressing Axin1 or dominant-negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) promotes adipogenesis (23Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C.

Although Wnt proteins are critical factors triggering the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and thereby inhibiting adipogenesis, the mechanism controlling the expression of the Wnt proteins during this process remains incompletely understood. The epigenetic mechanism, especially histone modification, has been found to be an important modulator in regulating the expression of genes and cell differentiation. Histone acetylation and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4, 9, and 27 (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3) are among the major epigenetic histone signatures (24Shi Y. Histone lysine demethylases: emerging roles in development, physiology and disease.Nat. Rev.

Histone acetylation on lysine residues is generally correlated well with gene activation. However, histone methylation on lysine can be associated with either gene activation or inhibition, depending on which lysine is methylated. H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are enriched on repressed genes, whereas H3K4me3 is implicated in transcriptional activation. Histone methylation has been demonstrated to be eliminated by histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) (27Dimitrova E. Turberfield A.H. Klose R.J. Histone demethylases in chromatin biology and beyond.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (26564907): 1620-163910.15252/embr.201541113Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

Therefore, KDM5A plays an important role in a variety of cellular biological processes. Previously, our laboratory has identified a series of potential target genes of C/EBPβ by using a promoter-wide ChIP coupled with microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) analysis at the early stage of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation (11Guo L. Li X. Huang J.X. Huang H.Y. Zhang Y.Y. Qian S.W. Zhu H. Zhang Y.D. Liu Y. Liu Y. Wang K.K. Tang Q.Q. Histone demethylase Kdm4b functions as a co-factor of C/EBPβ to promote mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22722334): 1917-192710.1038/cdd.2012.75Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among these candidate genes is KDM5A. In the present study, we confirm that KDM5A is transactivated by C/EBPβ. Further, we show that KDM5A interacts with C/EBPβ and is recruited to the Wnt6 promoter to decrease the H3K4me3 mark on its promoter and to repress Wnt6 transcription, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and facilitating 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. These results provide new insights into the role of KDM5A in adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism. C/EBPβ has been shown to play a pivotal role at the early stage of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation (9Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Activation and centromeric localization of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins during the mitotic clonal expansion of adipocyte differentiation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13 (10485846): 2231-224110.1101/gad.13.17.2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Guo L.

In our previous work, a ChIP-on-chip at an early stage of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation was performed (11Guo L. Li X. Huang J.X. Huang H.Y. Zhang Y.Y. Qian S.W. Zhu H. Zhang Y.D. Liu Y. Liu Y. Wang K.K. Tang Q.Q. Histone demethylase Kdm4b functions as a co-factor of C/EBPβ to promote mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22722334): 1917-192710.1038/cdd.2012.75Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which identified a putative C/EBPβ binding site on the proximal promoter of KDM5A (Table 1), a JmjC domain–containing histone demethylase. This suggests that KDM5A could be a transcriptional target of C/EBPβ. The expression of KDM5A during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation was investigated first. After adipogenic induction, KDM5A expression was induced, which positively correlates with the expression pattern of C/EBPβ (Fig. 1, A and B). To study whether C/EBPβ plays a role in the induction of KDM5A, siRNA-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ was applied. C/EBPβ was knocked down in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and then the cells were induced to differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, knockdown of C/EBPβ blocked adipogenesis because its knockdown led to a significant decrease in lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells on day 6 post-induction, as evidenced by Oil Red O (ORO) staining. Meanwhile, down-regulation of C/EBPβ significantly impaired the expression of KDM5A at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, E and F). Therefore, these data above demonstrate an important role of C/EBPβ in the induction of KDM5A during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.Table 1Summary of the Kdm5a gene that was identified to be potentially targeted by C/EBPβ in our previously reported ChIP-on-chip dataChrStEnd-FoldFDR (%)LengthRefSeqGeneStrandTSS61203290511203297552.711.71704NM_145997Kdm5a+120329717 Open table in a new tab Our previous ChIP-on-chip data and the results in Fig. 1 strongly suggest that C/EBPβ could regulate KDM5A expression at the transcriptional level. ChIP plus real-time quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) confirmed the significant binding of C/EBPβ to the proximal promoter of KDM5A in differentiating cells after induction (day 2) but not in quiescent cells before induction (day 0), as shown in Fig. 2A. On the basis of the results from the ChIP-on-chip analysis (Table 1), we analyzed the KDM5A proximal promoter and found a C/EBP binding site about −223 to −214 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of KDM5A (Fig. 2B). Using a luciferase assay, we found that C/EBPβ could transactivate KDM5A in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2C). When the predicted C/EBP-binding site was mutated, this transactivation was significantly blunted (Fig. 2D), suggesting a critical role of this C/EBP binding site in the function of C/EBPβ. To further validate the role of C/EBPβ in KDM5A induction, C/EBPβ was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and then the cells were induced to differentiation. Overexpression of C/EBPβ up-regulated both the mRNA level and the protein level of KDM5A on day 2 post-induction (Fig. 2, E and F). Together, these results demonstrate that KDM5A is a bona fide target of C/EBPβ during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Because C/EBPβ is an important transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation, the transactivation of KDM5A by C/EBPβ suggests that KDM5A may also play a part in the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of KDM5A was then performed to examine the role of KDM5A in adipogenesis. KDM5A was knocked down in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and then the cells were induced to differentiation. Knockdown of KDM5A led to a significant decrease in lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells on day 6 post-induction, as evidenced by ORO staining (Fig. 3A). Moreover, both the mRNA level and the protein level of C/EBPα and PPARγ, the two key pro-adipogenic transcription factors, were decreased by the knockdown of KDM5A (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with its H3K4me3 demethylase activity, knockdown of KDM5A led to a global increase of H3K4me3 (Fig. 3C). The fatty acid–binding protein 4 (Fabp4) gene encodes a fatty acid–binding protein found in adipocytes. It is a transcriptional target gene of C/EBPα and PPARγ and is known to be an important adipocyte marker gene (8Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Adipogenesis: from stem cell to adipocyte.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22463691): 715-73610.1146/annurev-biochem-052110-115718Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the Fabp4 gene was dramatically induced during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, but this induction was significantly suppressed by the knockdown of KDM5A. Collectively, these data above demonstrate that KDM5A could play an important role in facilitating the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. PPARγ is a master transcriptional factor that determines adipogenesis, and our results showed that knockdown of KDM5A inhibited adipogenesis with decreased expression of PPARγ (Fig. 3, B and C). We ask whether overexpression of PPARγ could overcome the KDM5A knockdown–mediated suppression of adipogenesis. KDM5A was knocked down in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, with or without the overexpression of PPARγ, and then the cells were induced to differentiation. As expected, overexpression of PPARγ rescued adipogenesis, which was inhibited by KDM5A knockdown (Fig. S1). Adipocyte differentiation is controlled by the interplay of a series of positive and negative effectors. Pref-1, Klf2/3, GATA2/3, TRB3, and Wnt proteins are among the well-characterized negative regulators of adipogenesis (21Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Kang S. Gerin I. Chiang S.H. Lucas P.C. Opp M.R.

The timely decline of these negative regulators is required for the successful progression of adipocyte differentiation. However, the mechanisms governing the down-regulation of these negative effectors are not completely understood. Because KDM5A is a member of the family of JmjC domain–containing histone demethylases and is able to demethylate H3K4me3, which is a transcriptional activation mark on the gene promoters, we ask whether KDM5A could repress the transcription of the negative regulators during adipogenesis. After adipogenic induction in 3T3-L1 cells (day 2 versus day 0), the mRNA levels of those major negative regulators were dramatically declined (Fig. 4A). When KDM5A was knocked down, the down-regulation of Wnt6 was significantly impeded, whereas the decline of the other negative regulators was only slightly affected (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W2944464956,"Much work has been dedicated to identifying members of the microbial gut community that have potential to augment the growth rate of agricultural animals including chickens. Here, we assessed any correlations between the fecal microbiome, a proxy for the gut microbiome, and feed efficiency or weight gain at the pedigree chicken level, the highest tier of the production process. Because selective breeding is conducted at the pedigree level, our aim was to determine if microbiome profiles could be used to predict feed conversion or weight gain in order to improve selective breeding. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, we profiled the microbiomes of high and low weight gain (WG) birds and good and poor feed efficient (FE) birds in two pedigree lineages of broiler chickens. We also aimed to understand the dynamics of the microbiome with respect to maturation. A time series experiment was conducted, where fecal samples of chickens were collected at 6 points of the rearing process and the microbiome of these samples profiled. We identified OTUs differences at different taxonomic levels in the fecal community between high and low performing birds within each genetic line, indicating a specificity of the microbial community profiles correlated to performance factors. Using machine-learning methods, we built a classification model that could predict feed conversion performance from the fecal microbial community. With respect to maturation, we found that the fecal microbiome is dynamic in early life but stabilizes after 3 weeks of age independent of lineage. Our results indicate that the fecal microbiome profile can be used to predict feed conversion, but not weight gain in these pedigree lines. From the time series experiments, it appears that these predictions can be evaluated as early as 20 days of age. Our data also indicates that there is a genetic factor for the microbiome profile."
https://openalex.org/W2944129466,"Perioperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is one of the common arrhythmias in the setting of non-cardiac surgeries for malignancy. As POAF may cause subsequent adverse events, it is important to confirm its characteristics and risk factors.The prospective cohort study of surveillance for perioperative atrial fibrillation recurrence (PREDICT AF RECURRENCE) is an ongoing prospective, single-center, observational study that aims to illustrate the clinical impact of POAF in major non-cardiac surgery for malignancy. Patients who planned to undergo non-cardiac surgery for definitive/suspected malignancy were registered. Those with a history of AF and atrial flutter were excluded. Any 30-day complications included acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, bleeding, thrombosis, any infection, and acute kidney injury. The primary endpoint was an incidence of POAF.The present study included 799 patients (age, 68 ± 11; male, 62%). Of these, 80 patients (10.0%) developed POAF. Notably, 66 patients (83%) had no symptoms. Any 30-day complications occurred in 180 patients (23%) (with POAF: 34 (43%); without POAF: 146 (20%); p < 0.001). POAF in 17 patients (50%) was preceded by the development of complications. No patient developed cardiogenic shock and/or acute heart failure. The association between 30-day complications and POAF development were analyzed using the multivariate adjusted model (odds ratio: 2.84; 95% confidence interval: 1.74-4.62; p < 0.001).Ten percent of patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery for malignancy developed POAF, which was strongly associated with perioperative complications. As a majority were asymptomatic, careful observation using electrocardiography monitoring is important to avoid oversights.UMIN ID: UMIN000016146."
https://openalex.org/W2943936304,"To examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and early sexual initiation.We analyzed retrospective data of (n = 241) Black women recruited from public STD clinics in Baltimore, MD. Multinomial logistic and linear regression models estimated associations between ACEs and early sexual initiation; contextual variables at initiation were examined as mediators.Twelve percent of our sample reported very early sexual initiation (11-12 years) and 29% reported early sexual initiation (13-14 years). Each additional ACE reported was associated with greater risk of very early sexual initiation (RRR = 1.49; 95%CI:1.23,1.80). Specifically, emotional abuse (RRR = 3.71; 95%CI:1.55,8.89), physical abuse (RRR = 9.45; 95%CI:3.56,25.12), sexual abuse (RRR = 8.60; 95%CI:3.29,22.51), witnessing maternal abuse (RRR = 5.56; 95%CI:2.13,14.52), and household substance misuse (RRR = 3.21; 95%CI:1.38,7.47) at or before the age of 18 were associated with very early sexual initiation. As for context of initiation, age at sexual initiation was younger if the man at initiation was a non-partner (ß = -0.88; 95%CI:-1.36,-0.40), was ≥3 years older (ß = -1.30; 95%CI:-1.82,-0.77), had pressured or forced sexual intitiation (ß = -1.09; 95%CI:-1.58,-0.59), and was under the influence of drugs/alcohol (ß = -0.97; 95%CI:-1.62,-0.32). Contextual variables at first sex, including being pressured or forced, and the man being ≥3 years older fully mediated the association between ACEs and early sexual initiation.This study highlights the critical need to develop interventions that reduce the impact of ACEs on women's health and delay age at sexual initiation. Health education efforts are needed for clinicians and parents to identify and prevent childhood abuse and to identify and report sexual coercion and abuse for girls and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2944316841,"A number of studies have shown widespread public concern over housing animals in ways that restrict their ability to move freely. Dairy cows housed in tie stall barns are tethered continuously or for part of the day, but no study has assessed public support for this type of housing system. We report two experiments assessing public perceptions of tie stall housing for dairy cattle using a hypothetical referenda format. In Experiment 1, 65% of participants (n = 430) said they would support a ban on tie stalls. The probability of supporting a ban increased as the duration of time that cows were tethered increased. In Experiment 2, information about possible economic consequences was included. Relatively fewer (55%) participants (n = 372) indicated they would support a ban. Supporters of a ban were willing to pay an average dairy product price premium of 68% to see the ban enacted. Indirect measures of support indicated socially desirable responding was greater in Experiment 2 where the economic impacts of voting behavior were made explicit. In both studies, women and liberals were more likely to support a ban. The majority of participants in Experiment 1 (51%) and Experiment 2 (57%) said they had never heard or read anything about tie stalls before participating in our survey. We conclude that current knowledge of the use of tie stalls is low, but if this situation were to change there may be considerable public concern about the use of this housing method."
https://openalex.org/W2943868984,"Background The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score has recently been introduced to the emergency department (ED) and wards, and it predicted a higher number of deaths among patients with sepsis compared with baseline risk. However, studies about the application of the qSOFA score are limited in prehospital settings. Thus, this study aimed to assess the performance of prehospital qSOFA score in predicting the risk of mortality among patients with infection. Methods This single center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in a Japanese tertiary care teaching hospital between April 2016 and March 2017. We enrolled all consecutive adult patients transported to the hospital by ambulance and admitted to the ED due to a suspected infection. We calculated the prehospital qSOFA score using the first vital sign obtained at the scene by emergency medical service (EMS) providers. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between prehospital qSOFA positivity and in-hospital mortality. Results Among the 925 patients admitted to the ED due to a suspected infection, 51.1% (473/925) were prehospital qSOFA-positive and 48.9% (452/925) were prehospital qSOFA-negative. The in-hospital mortality rates were 14.0% (66/473) in prehospital qSOFA-positive patients and 6.0% (27/452) in prehospital qSOFA-negative patients. The Cox proportional hazard regression model revealed a strong association between prehospital qSOFA score and in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.41, 95% confidence interval: 1.51–3.98; p <0.01). Conclusions Among the patients with suspected infection who were admitted at the ED, a strong association was observed between the prehospital qSOFA score and in-hospital mortality. In order to use this score in clinical practice, future study is necessary to evaluate how infection is suspected in the prehospital arena."
https://openalex.org/W2944122228,"Objective Prognosis of myocardial infarction tends to be worse when serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is high. miRNAs are also known to be involved in different pathogeneses of heart diseases such as myocardial infarction. However, how CRP is involved in myocardial infarction has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that serum CRP changes the miRNA profile during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the myocardium. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed global miRNA expression profiling of myocardium using IRI and CRP infusion rat model. Methods After ligation of the coronary artery of rat hearts, human serum CRP was intravenously injected, and reperfusion was performed (I/R+CRP group, n = 6). Control group consisted of the sham group (n = 3), IV CRP infusion group (CRP only, n = 3), and the I/R-only group (I/R only, n = 5). We evaluated 423 miRNA expression in non-ischemic areas and areas at risk (AAR) of each group using NanoString nCounter miRNA expression assay. Results MiR-124 was downregulated in non-ischemic myocardium in CRP-only group. In AAR, 7 miRNAs were commonly upregulated in both I/R-only and I/R+CRP groups. And additional 6 miRNAs were upregulated in the I/R+CRP group (miR-33, miR-409-3p, miR-384-3p, miR-3562, miR-101a, and miR-340-5p). Similarly, in the non-ischemic areas, 6 miRNAs were commonly upregulated in both I/R-only and I/R+CRP groups, and additional 5 miRNAs changed in the I/R+CRP group (upregulation of miR-3559-5p, miR-499, and miR-21 and downregulation of miR-500 and miR-532-3p). Conclusion We showed that when serum CRP level is high, IRI results in multiple miRNA profile changes not only in ischemic areas but also in non-ischemic myocardium. Our results may provide a strong basis for studying the role of CRP and miRNAs in ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2944076101,"Human platelet lysate (hPL) has been considered as the preferred supplement for the xeno-free stem cell culture for many years. However, the biological effect of hPL on the proliferation and differentiation of dental stem cells combined with the use of medical grade synthetic biomaterial is still under investigation. Thus, the optimal scaffold composition, cell type and specific growth conditions, yet need to be formulated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regenerative potential of dental stem cells seeded on synthetic scaffolds and maintained in osteogenic media supplemented with either hPL or xeno-derived fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two types of dental stem cells were isolated from human impacted third molars and intact teeth; stem cells of apical papilla (SCAP) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Cells were expanded in cell culture media supplemented with either hPL or FBS. Consequently, proliferative capacity, immunophenotypic characteristics and multilineage differentiation potential of the derived cells were evaluated on monolayer culture (2D) and on synthetic scaffolds fabricated from poly ’lactic-co-glycolic’ acid (PLGA) (3D). The functionality of the induced cells was examined by measuring the concentration of osteogenic markers ALP, OCN and OPN at different time points. Our results indicate that the isolated dental stem cells showed similar mesenchymal characteristics when cultured on hPL or FBS-containing culture media. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and H&E staining revealed the proper adherence of the derived cells on the 3D scaffold cultures. Moreover, the increase in the concentration of osteogenic markers proved that hPL was able to produce functional osteoblasts in both culture conditions (2D and 3D), in a way similar to FBS culture. These results reveal that hPL provides a suitable substitute to the animal-derived serum, for the growth and functionality of both SCAP and PDLSCs. Thus the use of hPL, in combination with PLGA scaffolds, can be useful in future clinical trials for dental regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2944673404,"Introduction Factors associated with persistently high Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence levels in several districts of India are not well understood. This study was undertaken to determine the association of socio-demographic characteristics, economic factors, awareness about HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), and condom use with consistently high HIV prevalence in the Indian districts and to ascertain whether these associations differed across various regions of India. Methods This study was carried out including all 640 districts of India. Secondary analysis of data obtained from the Census of India-2011, HIV Sentinel Surveillance in India and District Level Household Survey-III was done. Population profile, socio-economic characteristics, levels of HIV/STI/condom awareness and condom use, were compared between the districts with and without consistently high HIV prevalence. Due to the presence of collinearity among predictor variables, we used principal component analysis and the principal component scores were included as covariates for further analysis. Considering the districts at level 1 and the regions at level 2, multi-level analysis was done by generalised linear mixed models. Variance partition coefficient and median odds ratio were also calculated. Results Sixty-three districts with consistently high HIV prevalence were found clustered in the South and the North-east regions of India. Population size, density and urbanisation were found to be positively associated with consistently high HIV prevalence in these districts. Higher levels of literacy, better socio-economic status, higher proportion of population in reproductive age group and late marriages were positively associated with consistently high HIV prevalence in all regions of India except in the Southern region. Higher levels of knowledge about the role of condoms in HIV prevention and condom use were associated with low HIV prevalence at the district level. Conclusions Considerable heterogeneity among factors associated with consistently high HIV prevalence at the district level in different regions of India necessitates special region-specific strategies for HIV control. Increasing awareness about HIV alone is not sufficient for controlling the HIV epidemic and there is a need to raise knowledge levels about preventive measures against HIV and promote the use of condoms amongst population."
https://openalex.org/W2943919393,"Regular exercise is recommended to improve the cardiovascular risk profile. However, there is growing evidence that extreme volumes and intensity of long-term exertion may increase the risk of acute cardiac events. The aim of this study is to investigate the after-effects of regular, strenuous physical training on the cardiovascular neural regulation in a group of amateur triathletes compared to age-matched sedentary controls. We enrolled 11 non-elite triathletes (4 women, age 24±4 years), who had refrained from exercise for 72 hours, and 11 age-matched healthy non-athletes (3 women, age 25±2 years). Comprehensive echocardiographic and cardiopulmonary exercise tests were performed at baseline. Electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, respiratory activity, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were continuously recorded in a supine position (REST) and during an incremental 15° step-wise head-up tilt test up to 75° (TILT). Blood samples were collected for determination of stress mediators. Autoregressive spectral analysis provided the indices of the cardiac sympathetic (LFRR) and vagal (HFRR) activity, the vascular sympathetic control (LFSAP), and the cardiac sympatho-vagal modulation (LF/HF). Compared to controls, triathletes were characterized by greater LFRR, LF/HF ratio, LFSAP, MSNA, and lower HFRR at REST and during TILT, i.e. greater overall cardiovascular sympathetic modulation together with lower cardiac vagal activity. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations were also higher in triathletes. In conclusion, triathletes were characterized by signs of sustained cardiovascular sympathetic overactivity. This might represent a risk factor for future cardiovascular events, given the known association between chronic excessive sympathetic activity and increased cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W2943937662,"The selection of viral strains with resistance-associated substitutions at hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A and NS5B genes is considered one of the limiting factors for achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) to combination of direct-acting antivirals daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SOF). Since 2015, this interferon-free regimen has been available in Brazilian clinical routine for treating mono- and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients chronically infected with genotypes 1 and 3. Our aim was to assess SVR rate for Brazilian patients chronically infected with genotypes 1 and 3 after DCV/SOF therapy and the frequency of baseline RASs in HCV NS5A and NS5B genes. Serum samples were collected from 107 monoinfected patients and 25 HCV/HIV co-infected patients before antiviral therapy with DCV/SOF. Genetic diversity of NS5A and NS5B genes was assessed by direct nucleotide sequencing. Overall, SVR rate was 95.4% (126/132), and treatment failure occurred in five monoinfected and one HCV/HIV co-infected patient. NS5A RASs frequency was higher for HCV/HIV patients (28%) than monoinfected patients (16.8%). No difference was evidenced between mono- and HCV/HIV-coinfected groups (15% vs. 16%) regarding NS5B gene. Genotype (GT) 1b strains had significantly more baseline substitutions in NS5A (31.6%) than GT 1a and 3a. At least one primary NS5A RAS described in literature at loci 28, 30, 31 or 93 was identified in HCV GTs 1 strains for both groups. As for NS5B, RASs at positions 159 and 316 was observed only in GT 1b strains. This study highlighted that SVR rate in clinical routine in Brazil was similar to randomized clinical trials (89-98%). Our research provided genetic data about the circulation of resistant variants in Brazil. Despite its presence, most of identified baseline mutations did not negatively impact treatment outcome. Genetic diversity of circulating strains suggested that most of the Brazilian HCV chronic carriers are susceptible to new therapeutic regimens including recently approved DAAs."
https://openalex.org/W2943868295,"Phospholipids, major constituents of bilayer cell membranes, are present in large amounts in pulmonary surfactant and play key roles in cell signaling. Here, we aim at finding clinically useful disease markers in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using comprehensive phospholipid profiling in blood and modeling of changes between sampling time points. Serum samples from 33 patients hospitalized with CAP were collected at admission, three hours after the start of intravenous antibiotics, Day 1 (at 12-24 h), Day 2 (at 36-48 h), and several weeks after recovery. A profile of 75 phospholipid species including quantification of the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) was determined using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To control for possible enzymatic degradation of LPCs, serum autotaxin levels were examined. Twenty-two of the 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CAP received a laboratory-verified CAP diagnosis by microbial culture or microbial DNA detection by qPCR. All major phospholipid species, especially the LPCs, were pronouncedly decreased in the acute stage of illness. Total and individual LPC concentrations increased shortly after the initiation of antibiotic treatment, concentrations were at their lowest 3h after the initiation, and increased after Day 1. The total LPC concentration increased by a change ratio of 1.6-1.7 between acute illness and Day 2, and by a ratio of 3.7 between acute illness and full disease resolution. Autotaxin levels were low in acute illness and showed little changes over time, contradicting a hypothesis of enzymatic degradation causing the low levels of LPCs. In this sample of patients with CAP, the results demonstrate that LPC concentration changes in serum of patients with CAP closely mirrored the early transition from acute illness to recovery after the initiation of antibiotics. LPCs should be further explored as potential disease stage biomarkers in CAP and for their potential physiological role during recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2943899634,"Background The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) is widely used to assess global cognitive function in patients with dementia. It contains nine cognitive domains, namely long-term memory, short-term memory, attention, mental manipulation, orientation, abstraction and judgment, language, visual construction, and list-generating fluency. However, test-retest reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC) of the CASI are largely unknown in patients with dementia, which limits its utility and the explanation of a score change. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine test-retest reliability and calculate MDC of the CASI in patients with dementia. Methods Fifty-two patients with dementia completed the CASI twice with a two-week interval. The frequencies of the scores in the Clinical Dementia Rating (0.5, 1, and ≥ 2) were 38.5, 36.5, and 25.0, respectively. Test-retest reliability was examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the total score and nine domains of the CASI. The MDC was calculated based on standard error of measurement. Results The ICC value of the CASI total score was 0.97 while the ICC value for the nine domains were 0.65–0.92. The MDC values (MDC%) were 11.6 (12.9%), 2.8 (23.2%), 4.5 (41.2%), 3.4 (42.1%), 4.9 (49.2%), 5.3 (29.2%), 3.4 (28.8%), 2.2 (22.3%), 3.2 (32.1%), and 3.1 (30.7%) for CASI total score, long-term memory, short-term memory, attention, mental manipulation, orientation, abstraction and judgment, language, visual construction, and list-generating fluency, respectively. Conclusion Our results revealed that the CASI has sufficient test-retest reliability. The MDC values are useful in determining a real change (i.e., improvement or deterioration) between two assessments of an individual patient. However, four domains (i.e., short-term memory, attention, mental manipulation, and list-generating fluency) demonstrated lower ICC values and substantial random measurement errors. Clinicians and researchers should be cautious while using these four domains to explain score changes between repeated assessments of patients with dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2943934770,"Feature subspace learning plays a significant role in pattern recognition, and many efforts have been made to generate increasingly discriminative learning models. Recently, several discriminative feature learning methods based on a representation model have been proposed, which have not only attracted considerable attention but also achieved success in practical applications. Nevertheless, these methods for constructing the learning model simply depend on the class labels of the training instances and fail to consider the essential subspace structural information hidden in them. In this paper, we propose a robust feature subspace learning approach based on a low-rank representation. In our approach, the low-rank representation coefficients are considered as weights to construct the constraint item for feature learning, which can introduce a subspace structural similarity constraint in the proposed learning model for facilitating data adaptation and robustness. Moreover, by placing the subspace learning and low-rank representation into a unified framework, they can benefit each other during the iteration process to realize an overall optimum. To achieve extra discrimination, linear regression is also incorporated into our model to enforce the projection features around and close to their label-based centers. Furthermore, an iterative numerical scheme is designed to solve our proposed objective function and ensure convergence. Extensive experimental results obtained using several public image datasets demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of our novel approach compared with those of the existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W2944701255,"Most studies of social cognition have focused on dyadic relationships, and rather few have looked at how we engage with individuals in the wider social world into which we are embedded. Here we use principle component analysis (PCA) and path analysis to explore how different aspects of human sociality interact. We demonstrate two distinct clusters in both sexes relating to (i) romantic relationships and (ii) wider social engagement, such as that with the local community. These two domains of relationship were associated with different dispositional traits: individual variation in impulsivity in the former, and in empathy and avoidant attachment in the latter. Although these clusters were broadly similar across both sexes, clearer differentiation is evident in males. In females only, support network size was positively related to the anxious dimension of attachment and, unlike in males, was not related to feelings of inclusion in the local community. This suggests that support networks may play different roles in the two sexes, indicating a productive line of future research. These findings have important practical applications: loneliness interventions that target the specific type of relationship that is felt to be lacking and the associated dispositional traits are likely to be more effective than more generic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2944119845,"Parrotia subaequalis is an endangered Tertiary relict tree from eastern China. Despite its important ecological and horticultural value, no transcriptomic data and limited molecular markers are currently available in this species. In this study, we first performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of two individuals representing the northernmost (TX) and southernmost (SJD) population of P. subaequalis on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. We gathered a total of 69,135 unigenes for P. subaequalis (TX) and 84,009 unigenes for P. subaequalis (SJD). From two unigenes datasets, 497 candidate polymorphic novel expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) were identified using CandiSSR. Among these repeats, di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant repeat type (62.78%) followed by tri-, tetra- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. We then randomly selected 54 primer pairs for polymorphism validation, of which 27 (50%) were successfully amplified and showed polymorphisms in 96 individuals from six natural populations of P. subaequalis. The average number of alleles per locus and the polymorphism information content values were 3.70 and 0.343; the average observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.378 and 0.394. A relatively high level of genetic diversity (HT = 0.393) and genetic differentiation level (FST = 0.171) were surveyed, indicating P. subaequalis maintained high levels of species diversity in the long-term evolutionary history. Additionally, a high level of cross-transferability (92.59%) was displayed in five congeneric Hamamelidaceae species. Therefore, these new transcriptomic data and novel polymorphic EST-SSR markers will pinpoint genetic resources and facilitate future studies on population genetics and molecular breeding of P. subaequalis and other Hamamelidaceae species."
https://openalex.org/W2944284517,"Reactivation of interspersed repetitive sequences due to loss of methylation is associated with genomic instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. LINE-1 hypomethylation is a surrogate marker for global methylation loss and is potentially a new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in tumors. However, the correlation of LINE-1 hypomethylation with clinicopathological parameters and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in patients with liver tumors is not yet well defined, particularly in Caucasians who show quite low rates of HCV/HBV infection and a higher incidence of liver steatosis. Therefore, quantitative DNA methylation analysis of LINE-1, RASSF1A, and CCND2 using pyrosequencing was performed in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC, n = 40), hepatocellular adenoma (HCA, n = 10), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH, n = 5), and corresponding peritumoral liver tissues as well as healthy liver tissues (n = 5) from Caucasian patients. Methylation results were correlated with histopathological findings and clinical data. We found loss of LINE-1 DNA methylation only in HCC. It correlated significantly with poor survival (log rank test, p = 0.007). An inverse correlation was found for LINE-1 and RASSF1A DNA methylation levels (r2 = -0.47, p = 0.002). LINE-1 hypomethylation correlated with concurrent RASSF1/CCND2 hypermethylation (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.02). Both LINE-1 hypomethylation and RASSF1A/CCND2 hypermethylation were not found in benign hepatocellular tumors (HCA and FNH). Our results show that LINE-1 hypomethylation and RASSF1A/CCND2 hypermethylation are epigenetic aberrations specific for the process of malignant liver transformation. In addition, LINE-1 hypomethylation might serve as a future predictive biomarker to identify HCC patients with unfavorable overall survival."

Objective The aim of this study was to examine the association between potato consumption and the risk of overall and cause specific mortality in the large prospective National Institutes of Health–AARP (NIH-AARP) Study. Design The NIH-AARP study recruited 566,407 persons, aged 50–72 years in 1995–1996. We excluded subjects that reported a history of chronic disease at baseline. Potato consumption data from a validated food frequency questionnaire completed at baseline was used in Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for overall and cause specific mortality. Final models were adjusted for potential risk factors for mortality. Results Among 410,701 participants included in this analysis, 76,921 persons died during the 15.6 years of follow-up. Eating baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, French fries or potato salad seven or more times per week was associated with higher risk of overall mortality, in models adjusted only for age and sex (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.13, 1.21). These results were attenuated in fully adjusted models (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.97, 1.06). Potato consumption was not associated with risk of mortality caused by cancer (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.97, 1.11), heart disease (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.93, 1.09), respiratory disease (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.16, 95%CI = 0.99, 1.37), or diabetes (HR C4 vs C1 = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.71, 1.19). We tested for an association with different preparation methods and found limited evidence for differences by preparation method. The only statistically significant association was that for French fry consumption with cancer-related mortality (HR C4 vs C1 = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.59), a finding for which uncontrolled confounding could not be ruled out. Conclusion We find little evidence that potato consumption is associated with all-cause or cause-specific mortality."

Methods A total of 461 M.tb isolates received at the Botswana National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory between March 2012 and October 2013 were included in this study. Drug susceptibility testing was conducted using the BD BACTEC MGIT 960 System. M.tb strains were genotyped using spoligotyping and spoligotype patterns were compared with existing patterns in the SITVIT Web database. A subset of drug resistant isolates which formed spoligo clusters (n = 65) was additionally genotyped with 12-loci MIRU. Factors associated with drug resistance and clustering were evaluated using logistic regression. Results Of the 461 isolates genotyped, 458 showed 108 distinct spoligotype patterns. The predominant M.tb lineages were Lineage 4 (81.9%), Lineage 2 (9%) and Lineage 1 (7.2%). The predominant spoligotype families within Lineage 4 were LAM (33%), S (14%), T (16%), X (16%). Three hundred and ninety-two (86%) isolates could be grouped into 44 clusters (2–46 isolates per cluster); giving a clustering rate of 76%. We identified 173 (37.8%) drug resistant isolates, 48 (10.5%) of these were multi-drug resistant. MIRU typing of the drug resistant isolates allowed grouping of 46 isolates into 14 clusters, giving a clustering rate of 49.2%. There was no association between age, sex, treatment category, region and clustering. Conclusions This study highlights the complexity of the TB epidemic in Botswana with multiple strains contributing to disease and provides baseline data on the population structure of M.tb strains in Botswana."
https://openalex.org/W2944577893,"Human driven changes such as increases in oceanic CO2, global warming, petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals may negatively affect the ability of marine calcifiers to build their skeletons/shells, especially in polar regions. We examine spatio-temporal variability of skeletal Mg-calcite in shallow water Antarctic marine invertebrates using bryozoan and spirorbids as models in a recruitment experiment of settlement tiles in East Antarctica. Mineralogies were determined for 754 specimens belonging to six bryozoan species (four cheilostome and two cyclostome species) and two spirorbid species from around Casey Station. Intra- and interspecific variability in wt% MgCO3 in calcite among most species was the largest source of variation overall. Therefore, the skeletal Mg-calcite in these taxa seem to be mainly biologically controlled. However, significant spatial variability was also found in wt% MgCO3 in calcite, possibly reflecting local environment variation from sources such as freshwater input and contaminated sediments. Species with high-Mg calcite skeletons (e.g. Beania erecta) could be particularly sensitive to multiple stressors under predictions for near-future global ocean chemistry changes such as increasing temperature, ocean acidification and pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2942673887,"Misfolded protein toxicity and failure of protein quality control underlie neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we identified Lethal(3)malignant brain tumor-like protein 1 (L3MBTL1) as a key regulator of protein quality control, the loss of which protected against the proteotoxicity of mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase or C9orf72 dipeptide repeat proteins. L3MBTL1 acts by regulating p53-dependent quality control systems that degrade misfolded proteins. SET domain-containing protein 8, an L3MBTL1-associated p53-binding protein, also regulated clearance of misfolded proteins and was increased by proteotoxicity-associated stresses in mammalian cells. Both L3MBTL1 and SET domain-containing protein 8 were upregulated in the central nervous systems of mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia. The role of L3MBTL1 in protein quality control is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammalian neurons. These results reveal a protein quality-control pathway that operates in both normal stress response and proteotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Lu et al. report a pathway that reprograms protein quality control under stress. Identified in a Caenorhabditis elegans screen and characterized in mammalian systems, L3MBTL1 and its partner SETD8 modulate proteotoxicity and are deregulated in patients with ALS/FTD."
https://openalex.org/W2944005640,"The open access availability of publications by Catalonia's CERCA research centres was analysed to determine the extent to which authors use open access journals, repositories, social networks and other websites to disseminate their research results. A sample of 3,730 journal articles published by authors from CERCA research centres between 2011 and 2015 and available on Web of Science (out of a total output of 44,423) was analysed to identify how many were available in open access, full-text format. The results revealed that 75,8% of the total (2,828 articles) had at least one version available in open access, but just 52% (1,940 articles) had at least one version available in either journals (whether pure or hybrid open access journals or those with embargo periods) or repositories, a finding that highlights the powerful role played by academic social networks in the sharp increase in open access availability. Of the 2,828 articles for which at least one open access version was found, a total of 9,868 copies were located. With respect to versions, the publisher's final version, i.e. the type formatted for publication by journal publishers, was found in 75,3% of cases. The number of articles published in open access journals (567) was very close to the number of articles published in hybrid journals or journals with embargo periods (624). Only 40,4% of the articles in the sample were located in repositories, being the subject repositories the heaviest used. Fifty percent of the articles (1,881 publications) were posted on academic social networks, the most popular of which were ResearchGate and Academia. According to thematic areas, all six areas (science, life sciences, medical and health sciences, engineering and architecture and humanities) exceeded 70% of articles in open access."

Efficient inhibitors of signaling have previously been developed but their applicability as cancer drugs is limited by the short in vivo half-life. In this study, we show that a fusion protein, consisting of the prolactin receptor antagonist PrlRA and an albumin binding domain for half-life extension can be expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and efficiently refolded and purified to homogeneity. The fusion protein was found to have strong affinity for the two intended targets: the prolactin receptor (KD = 2.3±0.2 nM) and mouse serum albumin (KD = 0.38±0.01 nM). Further investigation showed that it could efficiently prevent prolactin mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 at 100 nM concentration and above, similar to the PrlRA itself, suggesting a potential as drug for cancer therapy in the future. Complexion with HSA weakened the affinity for the receptor to 21±3 nM, however the ability to prevent phosphorylation of STAT5 was still prominent. Injection into rats showed a 100-fold higher concentration in blood after 24 h compared to PrlRA itself."

The time spent watching television and / or videogames and sociodemographic factors was determined. Anthropometric markers and body composition were recorded. Associations were established through logistic regression models.The prevalence of overweight was 13.0% (95% CI 12.4-13.8) and obesity was 3.0% (95% CI 2.8-3.3). The prevalences of overweight and obesity were higher in adolescent women [16.6% (95% CI 15.8-17.5) and 3.4% (95% CI 3.1-3.7), respectively]. Overweight and obesity were associated with being female [OR 1.94 (95%CI 1.77-2.12) and OR 1.29 (95%CI 1.09-1.53), respectively], high socioeconomic level [OR 1.22 (95%CI 1.10-1.36) and OR 1.47 (95%CI 1.19-1.81), respectively], reside in urban area [OR 1.13 (95%CI 1.03-1.24) and OR 1.47 (95%CI 1.21-1.79), respectively]. Being indigenous was associated with being overweight [OR 1.25 (95%CI 1.10-1.42)], while being Afro-Colombian was associated with obesity [OR 1.33 (95%CI 1.05-1.69)]. Watching television and / or video games for two or more hours a day [OR1.17 (95%CI 1.06-1.30)] was associated with being overweight; whereas watching television every day of the week was associated with obesity [OR 1.66 (95%CI 1.13-2.43)].The population studied has a significant prevalence of overweight and obesity, being overweight is associated with being a woman, a high socioeconomic status, residing in an urban area, having an indigenous ethnicity, watching television for three days during the week and looking at more than two hours of television in a day; Obesity is associated with being a woman, a medium-high and high socioeconomic status, residing in an urban area, Afro-Colombian ethnicity, watching television at least once in the last week and watching television every day during the last week."
https://openalex.org/W2943945431,"Germination of seeds during the transportation or after prolonged storage naturally and inevitably decreases because of ageing, but germination potential can be partially restored with seed priming treatments. A novel attempt was made to investigate the effects of combined treatments and to optimize the conditions for naturally aged seeds of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and Russian wild rye (Psathyrostachys juncea (Fisch.) Nevski) using an orthogonal activity level experimental design [factor A: Azospirillum brasilense concentration, factor B: three seed priming treatments (H2O, MgSO4 and H2O2) and factor C: different priming times]. Multivariate regression model analysis was applied to determine the interactive effects of pairwise factors (A and C) and to optimize experimental conditions. The results showed that the mixed treatments positively affected seed germination and seedling growth. The three seed priming treatments were the dominant factors for germination promotion, whereas the bacterial concentration had the largest effect on seedling growth and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), especially root elongation. The malondialdehyde content was reduced, the activities of SOD, peroxidase and catalase were triggered, and ascorbate peroxidase activity was also affected by the co-treatment. The combined results of all determined attributes showed that A. brasilense bio-priming with H2O2 priming constituted the optimal combination. The optimal bacterial concentration of A. brasilense and the time of seed priming were 52.3 × 106 colony forming units (CFU) mL-1 and 17.0 h, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2943978163,"Increasing exercise reinforcement, or decreasing sedentary reinforcement, may reduce sedentary activity and promote habitual exercise. Repeated exposures to a reinforcer may increase its reinforcing value (i.e., incentive sensitization). It is not yet known whether incentive sensitization occurs for exercise or factors associated with incentive sensitization for exercise reinforcement. The purpose was to determine whether exercise exposures increase exercise reinforcement relative to a sedentary alternative and whether this sensitization of exercise reinforcement would alter physical or sedentary behavior. This work also determined whether exercise dose, intensity, and preference and tolerance for exercise intensity were associated with incentive sensitization of exercise.104 sedentary men and women were randomized to exercise training groups with 89 completing the study. Groups included exercise exposures of 150 (n = 35) or 300 kcal/session (n = 34), 3 sessions/week for 6 weeks, or a non-exercise control group (n = 35). Assessments for exercise and sedentary behavior reinforcement (primary dependent variables) and activity and tolerance for exercise intensity were performed at baseline (week 0), post training (week 6), and post washout (week 10).The control group reduced (P = 0.022) relative reinforcing value of exercise, such that the 150 kcal group had a greater relative reinforcing value of exercise after the exercise treatment 150 kcal: 0.69 ± 0.07 to 0.74 ± 0.07; 300 kcal: 0.72 ± 0.07 to 0.63 ± 0.08, control: 0.72 ± 0.07 to 0.57 ± 0.08 mean ± SE. Increases in tolerance for exercise intensity discomfort were associated with increases in relative reinforcing value of exercise. Sedentary behavior reinforcement decreased in both exercise groups (150 kcal: 5.4 ± 4.3 to 1.8 ± 1.3; 300 kcal: 5.4 ± 4.3 to 3.1 ± 2.4, P<0.05), but remained unchanged in the control group (5.1 ± 4.0 to 6.1 ± 4.9, P>0.05). Sedentary activity decreased baseline to post-training in the 300 kcal group (546.5 ± 10.7 to 503.8 ± 11.8 minutes, P<0.01).Small amounts of regular exercise may reduce the reinforcing value sedentary behavior. The process of incentive sensitization of exercise may include reducing the reinforcing value of competing sedentary activities. Developing tolerance to exercise discomfort of exercise may be critical to increasing exercise reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2944083249,"The ability to selectively respond to one’s own name is important for social and language development, and is disrupted in atypically developing populations (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). Research with typically developing samples using event-related potentials (ERPs) has demonstrated that the subject’s own name (SON) is differentiated from other stimuli at both early sensory and later cognitive stages of auditory processing. While neural indices of response to name have been researched extensively in adults, no such studies have been conducted with typically developing preschool children or children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study investigated ERP response to name in a sample of typically developing (TD) preschoolers (n = 19; mean age = 4.3 years) as well as a small, exploratory comparison group of preschoolers with ASD (n = 13; mean age = 4.4 years). TD preschoolers exhibited significantly greater negativity to SON over frontal regions than to an unfamiliar nonsense name, consistent with the adult SON negativity component. This component was present whether the name was spoken by a parent or an unfamiliar adult, suggesting that it reflects SON-specific processing rather than broad self-relevant information processing. Comparing preschoolers with ASD to the TD children revealed a significant SON negativity component across both groups. The amplitude of the SON negativity response was significantly correlated with social variables in the ASD group, though these correlations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of the SON component in preschool children with and without ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2944147358,"Movement of insect pests between spatially subdivided populations can allow them to recolonize areas where local extinction has occurred, increasing pest persistence. Populations of woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum [Hausmann]; Hemiptera: Aphididae), a worldwide pest of apple (Malus domestica [Borkhausen]), occur both below- and aboveground. These spatially subdivided subpopulations encounter different abiotic conditions, natural enemies, and control tactics. Restricting movement between them might be an effective management tactic to decrease woolly apple aphid persistence and abundance. We examined this possibility in the field, using sticky barriers to restrict upward woolly apple aphid movement to tree canopies, and in the greenhouse, using mulches and sand amendments to restrict downward movement to roots. In the field, blocking aphid movement up tree trunks did not decrease the number of colonies in tree canopies. Instead, sticky-banded apple trees had higher aphid colony counts late in the study. Earwigs, which are woolly apple aphid predators, were excluded from tree canopies by sticky bands. In the greenhouse, fewer root galls (indicative of aphid feeding) occurred on trees in sandy potting media and on those with mulch (wood chips or paper slurry). Our results suggest that upward movement is less important than other factors that affect aboveground aerial woolly apple aphid population dynamics. In addition, apple orchards planted in sandier soils or with mulches may be partially protected from woolly apple aphid root feeding."

The contribution of physical activity to the increased prevalence of insulin resistance and related disturbances amongst South Asians is unknown.We recruited 902 South Asian and European men and women, aged 35-85 years from the ongoing LOLIPOP study. Clinical characterisation comprised standardised questionnaire and measurement of height, weight, waist and hip circumference and blood pressure. Fasting bloods were taken for assessment of glucose, insulin, lipids and HbA1c. Physical activity was quantified using a validated accelerometer, Actigraph GT3X+, worn for 7 days. Univariate and multivariate approaches were used to investigate the relationship between ethnicity, physical activity, insulin resistance and related metabolic disturbances.Total physical activity was ~31% (P = 0.01) lower amongst South Asians compared to Europeans (Mean MET.minutes [SD]: 1505.2 [52] vs. 2050.9 [86.6], P<0.001). After adjusting for age and sex, total physical activity had a negative association with HOMA-IR (B [SE]: -0.18 [0.08], P = 0.04) and fasting glucose levels (B[SE]: -0.11 [0.04], P = 0.02). There was no association between physical activity and other glycemic and lipid parameters. Total physical activity per week contributed towards the differences in insulin resistance and associated metabolic disturbances between South Asians and Europeans.Lower levels of physical activity may contribute to the increased insulin resistance in South Asians compared to Europeans. Our results suggest that lifestyle modification through increased physical activity may help to improve glucose metabolism and reduce the burden of excess T2D and related complications amongst South Asians."
https://openalex.org/W2943897492,"Mutations that confer herbicide resistance are a primary concern for herbicide-based chemical control of invasive plants and are often under-characterized structurally and functionally. As the outcome of selection pressure, resistance mutations usually result from repeated long-term applications of herbicides with the same mode of action and are discovered through extensive field trials. Here we used acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) of Kochia scoparia (KsAHAS) as an example to demonstrate that, given the sequence of a target protein, the impact of genetic mutations on ligand binding could be evaluated and resistance mutations could be identified using a biophysics-based computational approach. Briefly, the 3D structures of wild-type (WT) and mutated KsAHAS-herbicide complexes were constructed by homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The resistance profile of two AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, tribenuron methyl and thifensulfuron methyl, was obtained by estimating their binding affinity with 29 KsAHAS (1 WT and 28 mutated) using 6 molecular mechanical (MM) and 18 hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods in combination with three structure sampling strategies. By comparing predicted resistance with experimentally determined resistance in the 29 biotypes of K. scoparia field populations, we identified the best method (i.e., MM-PBSA with single structure) out of all tested methods for the herbicide-KsAHAS system, which exhibited the highest accuracy (up to 100%) in discerning mutations conferring resistance or susceptibility to the two AHAS inhibitors. Our results suggest that the in silico approach has the potential to be widely adopted for assessing mutation-endowed herbicide resistance on a case-by-case basis."

The method proposed is based on Kou's jump diffusion model while the market parameters refer to the market drift, the market volatility, the jump intensity on market price, and the rate of jump occurrence in a consistent manner throughout the entire paper. The model captures the asymmetric nature of the price fluctuation during up trend markets and down trend markets. The results are compared to conventional options to observe the impact of jump effects. The results from simulation show that the asymmetric jump diffusion model can estimate the fair prices of European call options and annuity better than the Black-Scholes model and the symmetric jump diffusion model proposed by Kou and Merton."
https://openalex.org/W2942583851,"Protein-coding genes in organellar genomes have been widely used to resolve relationships of chlorophyte algae. The mode of evolution of these protein-coding genes affects relationship estimations, yet selection effects on genes commonly used as markers in phylogenetic analyses are insufficiently well understood. To gain more understanding about the effects of green algal organelle protein-coding genes on phylogenies, more information is needed about the mode of gene evolution. We used phylogenetic frameworks to examine evolutionary relationships of 58 protein-coding genes present in the organellar genomes of chlorophyte and streptophyte algae at multiple levels: organelle, biological function, and individual gene, and calculated pairwise dN/dS ratios of algal organellar protein-coding genes to investigate mode of evolution. Results indicate that mitochondrial genes have evolved at a higher rate than have chloroplast genes. Low dN/dS ratios indicating relatively high level of conservation indicate that nad2, nad5, atpA, atpE, psbC, and psbD might be particularly good candidates for use as markers in chlorophyte phylogenies. Chlorophycean atp6, nad2, atpF, clpP, rps2, rps3, rps4, and rps7 protein-coding sequences exhibited selective mutations, suggesting that changes in proteins encoded by these genes might have increased fitness in Chlorophyceae."

After expression of BCL61-350 in E. coli, the BCL61-350 protein was purified with Ni column. Then the BCL61-350 protein, mixing with QuickAntibody-Mouse5W adjuvant, was injected into Balb/c mice. After immunization and cell fusion, a stable cell line named 1E6A4, which can secrete anti-BCL6 antibody, was obtained. The isotype of 1E6A4 mAb was determined as IgG2a, and the affinity constant reached 5.12×1010 L/mol. Furthermore, the specificity of the mAb was determined with ELISA, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results indicated that the 1E6A4 mAb was able to detect BCL6 specifically and sensitively.BCL61-350 antigen has been successfully generated with an effective and feasible method, and a highly specific antibody named 1E6A4 against BCL6 has been screened and characterized in this study, which was valuable in clinical diagnosis."

A structure and mechanism of formation were suggested based on our findings. At that time, we did not have sufficient quantities of purified synthetic lipid for NMR and had to rely on analysis of semipurified synthetic lipid from low-yield reactions only. To obtain more definitive evidence, we next attempted to generate the proposed dioxolane structure using total synthesis approaches. However, this was not successful. Instead, herein, this was achieved through enzymatic oxidation of preformed EETs to form two candidate molecules. However, NMR analysis of these found that dioxolane lipids did not match the platelet isomer. As an alternative strategy, we next focused on modifying and scaling up the chemical oxidation approach to yield a lipid that is consistent with the platelet isomer in terms of MS/MS and reverse-phase retention time. We refer to this herein as the “synthetic” lipid (which contains one primary lipid and small amounts of two additional isomers). Once isolated, 1NMR and COSY analyses were undertaken. The nature of functional groups was revealed, along with position and geometry for both epoxides and one double bond. These data are presented in full herein. In summary, based on our data, the “platelet” lipid is proposed as a further stable metabolite of COX-1, generated likely via ring opening of the dioxolane ring followed by rearrangement and further oxygen insertion. The new structure is presented here as 8,9–11,12-DiEp-13-HEDE (DiEpHEDE), a diepoxy-monohydroxyeicosadienoic acid, which is generated by COX-1 in human platelets. First, we attempted to generate the proposed structure of DXA3, through oxidation of EETs using a recombinant LOX. In this way, two diastereomers were generated by oxidation of 8S,9R-EET and 8R,9S-EET using recombinant 8R-LOX (8Gilbert N.C. Neau D.B. Newcomer M.E. Expression of an 8R-lipoxygenase from the coral Plexaura homomalla.Methods Enzymol. 2018; 605 (29909831): 33-4910.1016/bs.mie.2018.02.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), forming specifically the cis-endoperoxide product 8S,9S,11R (from 8S,9R-EET) and trans-endoperoxide product 8R,9R,11R (from the enantiomer 8R,9S-EET). 1H NMR confirmed the structures of these lipids, as shown for the cis 8S,9S,11R, and both showed expected conjugated diene UV spectra (Figure 1., Figure 2.). These were then compared using reverse-phase LC-MS/MS with the COX-1–derived lipid. However, they eluted later, and although their MS/MS spectra had some common fragment ions (labeled in red), they contained additional large ions that were absent in MS/MS spectra from the COX-1–derived lipid. In particular, these hydroxy-endoperoxides generated large daughter ions at m/z 185 quite distinct from the fragmentation properties of the platelet product (Fig. 2). Thus, these dioxolanes were inconsistent with the platelet lipid, and additional candidates were sought as described below.Figure 2.Comparison of the COX-1–derived lipid with 8-hydroxy-9,11-dioxolanes indicates these are different lipids. A–C, reverse-phase LC-MS/MS indicates that the lipids elute at different retention times. Lipids (COX-1 product or 8-hydroxy-9,11-dioxolanes) were separated using reverse-phase LC-MS/MS as described under “Experimental procedures” and compared for retention time. Lipids were detected either as m/z 351.2 → 165.1 (COX-1 lipid) or 351.2 → 271.1 (dioxolanes). D–F, comparison of MS/MS spectra from the COX-1–derived lipid versus in vitro generated dioxolanes along with confirmation of conjugated diene structures for dioxolanes. MS/MS spectra were acquired at the peak of elution for the lipids shown in A–C above. Ions shown in red for E and F are common to the COX-1 product.

This lipid, which has the same MS/MS and reverse-phase retention time as the platelet isomer, was sufficient for MS/MS analysis, but the amounts produced were not enough to provide good NMR data. Herein, we modified this method based on observing that the synthetic lipid forms even during the oxidation of arachidonic acid while making 11-HpETE. In this way, the scaling up was simplified to a single process. Despite the fact that yields were quite low using this method (<0.05%), we managed to isolate the synthetic lipid in amounts (around 400 μg) that were enough for further analysis. Although large numbers of oxidized lipids are present in this crude reaction mixture, only one matched the platelet lipid’s MS/MS spectrum and retention time (labeled Peak B in Fig. 3). A full description of the purification is presented under “Experimental procedures.” It should be noted that all biologically active eicosanoids would be expected to form at low yield in a complex and uncontrolled free radical oxidation system such as this. If we consider a lipid such as PGE2, we expect that it would be present in such a reaction but at similarly low yield to what we found here, in addition to literally hundreds of other oxidation products. The lipid matching the platelet lipid based on MS/MS and retention time was targeted for further purification and characterization in this report as follows and is identified as the synthetic lipid previously characterized in our earlier study (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B.

Specifically, oxidized lipids were separated using normal-phase chromatography, with several products visible at 206 nm (Fig. 3A, labeled A–D). Fractions were collected and analyzed using high-resolution Orbitrap MS/MS and compared with platelet lipid (purified from activated platelets using reverse-phase LC). Peak B was found to have the same Orbitrap MS/MS spectrum and was further purified using reverse-phase HPLC and is thus identified as the synthetic lipid (Fig. 3, B and C). Synthetic lipid was next compared with the platelet lipid using a longer UPLC-MS/MS method for further structural confirmation. First, a Q1MS scan of the synthetic lipid shows a prominent peak around 47 min, indicating the most abundant component (Fig. 4A). Small peaks eluting immediately before and after are noted, as we previously published for the synthetic lipid generated using 11-HpETE oxidation, and are likely diastereomers (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B.

Next, both synthetic and platelet lipids were monitored using parent m/z 351.2 fragmenting to daughter ion m/z 165. Again, Peak B/synthetic lipid comprises one predominant isomer with two smaller peaks eluting immediately before and after, whereas the platelet lipid is a single peak (Fig. 4B). These three isomers in the synthetic lipid preparation have identical MS/MS spectra and likely represent quantitatively minor diastereomers of the platelet lipid as reported previously (data not shown) (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B.

Importantly, low-resolution MS/MS spectra acquired at the apex of the peak at 47.5 min using a tandem quadrupole instrument are virtually identical (Fig. 4, C and D). The synthetic and platelet lipids were next compared using straight-phase HPLC. Here, the synthetic lipid shows a slightly later retention time than the platelet isomer (Fig. 4E). This indicates that the lipids are likely different stereoisomers of the same compound. Peak B, as purified from Fig. 3B, was then taken forward for NMR analysis to inform us about the potential structure of the platelet lipid. Structure elucidation of synthetic lipid as 8,9–11,12-DiEp-13-HEDE was achieved via 1H NMR and COSY. For structure numeration and assignment, refer to Figs. 5, A and B, and 6A and Table 1. Preliminary determination began with the identification of H13, which was assigned based on the 1H NMR of a similar compound obtained by Brash and co-workers (9Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Identification of two cyclooxygenase active site residues, leucine 384 and glycine 526, that control carbon ring cyclization in prostaglandin biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Upon identification of the H13 proton, assignment of the epoxide and olefinic protons was possible based on 1H-1H correlations acquired from the COSY spectrum shown in Fig. 6B and Table 1. Correlations are observed from H13 to the H14 olefinic proton and to the epoxide proton H12, allowing assignment of these protons. H14 is correlated with the most downfield olefinic proton, which was assigned as H15, and the olefin 1H-1H coupling of 11 Hz confirms that this double bond has the Z configuration (Fig. 5A). This allows the assignment of the peaks between H14 and H15 as the two other olefinic protons. However, protons H5 and H6 are unassigned because their signals appear as multiplets (Fig. 5A). Given the structure of the AA substrate used to generate the synthetic lipid, we propose cis geometry for the double bond at 5,6.Figure 6.1H NMR data of the synthetic lipid continued.

H13 shows correlation to H12 (integrating at ∼3.0) at 2.83 ppm, which leaves the single proton at 2.99 ppm to be H11 or H9 (Fig. 6B and Table 1). Correlation from the H10 protons to two epoxide protons suggests the final structure as the methylene-bridged diepoxide shown (Fig. 6, B and C, and Table 1). In summary, we propose that both epoxy rings are located in positions 8,9 and 11,12 where the double bonds of AA were originally sited. Although assignment of the 1H NMR and the COSY in CD3OD allowed us to obtain a general structure, we were interested in gathering additional structural information about the relative stereochemistry of some functional groups in our molecule as was done previously (10Murphy R.C. New developments in mass spectrometry.in: Gaskell S. Tandem Mass Spectrometry of Lipids: Molecular Analysis of Complex Lipids. Royal Society of Chemistry, London, UK2015Google Scholar). Initial attempts to assign relative stereochemistry between the hydroxyl and 11,12-epoxide via measurement of J couplings were unsuccessful due to the overlap of epoxide protons. Although the synthetic lipid was completely insoluble in benzene, a 90:10 mixture of benzene-d6:methanol-d4 was found to yield a proton spectrum in which these epoxide protons were completely separated (Figs. 5B and 6A). Here, we acquired a proton spectrum that resolved the assignment and J couplings for these epoxide protons. As shown in Fig. 5B, protons in positions 8 and 9 as well as 11 and 12 contained a small coupling constant in the range of 2.1–2.3 Hz, which is consistent with trans configuration of epoxy rings (9Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Identification of two cyclooxygenase active site residues, leucine 384 and glycine 526, that control carbon ring cyclization in prostaglandin biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14594816): 4404-441410.1074/jbc.M307431200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, on the basis of the 2-Hz coupling constants, the NMR analysis defines both the 8,9- and 11,12-epoxide groups as trans-epoxy, but their absolute stereochemistry has not been established. To summarize our NMR data, the synthetic lipid is shown to be 8,9–11,12-diepoxy-13-hydroxyeicosadienoic acid using NMR and MS/MS. Furthermore, NMR proves the position of the double bond at 14,15 with cis geometry. NMR also proves that the relative configuration of the hydroxyl group at 13 and the adjacent carbon atom of the epoxy ring at 11,12 is trans. Overlapping multiplets for H5 and H6 prevented unambiguous assignment of this double bond configuration. However, based on the structure of AA, we propose that the double bond located at 5,6 has cis geometry. Both epoxy rings are confirmed as trans configuration. We cannot determine the absolute configuration of the hydroxyl group and both epoxy rings from our NMR data. However, the epoxides will be either S,S or R,R, whereas the hydroxyl will be the same configuration as the epoxy ring at position 11,12. Thus, the list of likely structures for the synthetic lipid includes 8R,9R-trans-11R,12R-trans-DiEp-13R-HEDE, 8S,9S-trans-11R, 12R-trans-DiEp-13R-HEDE, 8R,9R-trans-11S,12S-trans-DiEp-13S-HEDE, and 8S,9S-trans-11S,12S-trans-DiEp-13S-HEDE with both double bonds predicted as cis. With the amount of lipid we were able to generate using our current synthetic approach, NMR studies are unable to distinguish the absolute configuration further than this. The proposed structure is shown as Fig. 6C and is also informed by the data in Schneider et al. (9Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Identification of two cyclooxygenase active site residues, leucine 384 and glycine 526, that control carbon ring cyclization in prostaglandin biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Overall, our new data showing an identical MS/MS spectrum and reverse-phase retention time to the synthetic lipid generated here confirm the platelet lipid to be 8,9–11,12-DiEp-13-HEDE, whereas the different chiral LC retention time indicated that the synthetic and platelet lipids are different isomers. We next considered which candidate isomers are most likely for the platelet lipid. Given the presence of cis double bonds in AA and that COX enzymes generate 13R-hydroperoxyl/hydroxyl isomers during turnover, we predict that the platelet lipid forms in line with these structural features. Given this, we propose that there are 16 potential isomers for the platelet lipid. This is based on the potential for cis- or trans-epoxides and resulting stereochemical configurations possible (Fig. 6D). Unfortunately, a total synthetic approach to generate all 16 would take several years and is beyond the scope of this current study. We note that Schneider et al. (9Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Identification of two cyclooxygenase active site residues, leucine 384 and glycine 526, that control carbon ring cyclization in prostaglandin biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Next, based on our findings, the MS/MS fragmentation route previously presented for the platelet lipid based on extensive high-resolution MS/MS of native and deuterated analogs and MS3 was re-evaluated. Most daughter ions mapped to similar fragmentation routes, and all major ions could be assigned to this the structure, including m/z 195, which could not previously be accounted for (Schemes S1–S5). Possible mechanisms involved in the formation of m/z 255, 207, and 163 are presented in Scheme S1 as well as mechanisms for m/z 333 and 289 (Scheme S2), m/z 183 and 139 (Scheme S3), m/z 195 and 177 (Scheme S4), and m/z 315 and 271 (Scheme S5). All of the proposed reaction pathways taking place in the gas phase after collisional activation have been described previously for epoxy fatty acids, and proposed fragment ions are consistent with the high-resolution mass spectrometric measurements and deuterium-labeled analog published previously (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B.

We previously found that a semipurified platelet-derived DiEpHEDE isomer can activate neutrophil integrin expression (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B. Human platelets utilize cycloxygenase-1 to generate dioxolane A3, a neutrophil-activating eicosanoid.J.

To investigate whether synthetic 8,9–11,12-DiEp-13-HEDE retained the same property as the platelet isomer, we repeated the experiment on three separate donor isolates as shown using the synthetic lipid (Fig. 7, A and B). In our earlier study, we also found that DiEpHEDE can stimulate priming of neutrophils at far lower amounts of 10 nm. Herein, we repeated this several times, but it was not consistent in all donor isolations, only being observed in around 50%. This suggests reduced potency of the synthetic lipid and is also consistent with it being a different isomer. We recently identified a new lipid generated by COX-1 in human platelets that can activate neutrophils and proposed the structure as 8-hydroxy-9,11-dioxolane eicosatetraenoic acid based on extensive biochemical and chemical evidence but without NMR (4Hinz C. Aldrovandi M. Uhlson C. Marnett L.J. Longhurst H.J. Warner T.D. Alam S. Slatter D.A. Lauder S.N. Allen-Redpath K. Collins P.W. Murphy R.C. Thomas C.P. O'Donnell V.B.

We now present 1H and COSY NMR data, which revise the structure to 8,9–11,12-DiEp-13-HEDE, a metabolite that we suggest forms in platelets through opening of an initially formed dioxolane ring followed by epoxidation, oxygen insertion, and reduction as explained in detail below (Fig. 6D). Based both on the biology of COX-1 and structure of the substrate AA, we propose that the primary synthetic lipid is one of four potential isomers, whereas the platelet lipid is one of 16, noting that the platelet isomer is not present in the synthetic lipid preparation. This is evidenced by the two lipids having different retention times on chiral-phase chromatography (Fig. 4E). Herein, we tested the ability of the synthetic lipid to either activate (directly) or prime neutrophils in response to the bacterial peptide fMLP for Mac-1 activation. In the case of priming, the lipid is add"
