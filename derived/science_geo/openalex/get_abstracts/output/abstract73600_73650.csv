https://openalex.org/W1985031615,"A new device has been developed for measuring and displaying multiple spectrophotometric properties of biological cells at rates exceeding 500 cells per second. Preliminary observations of human cells from different sites in the body were made at wavelengths of 2537 and 4100 angstroms to estimate cellular nucleic acid per unit volume of individual cells of large populations of cells. Display patterns were obtained which were consistent, and characteristically different for certain of the cell populations studied."

https://openalex.org/W2129303189,"Rats were killed 1 hour after having been fed by stomach tube with amino acid mixtures that were either nutritionally complete or lacked tryptophan. Microsomes isolated from the livers of animals fed the incomplete mixture showed a reduced capacity to incorporate 14C-leucine in vitro, and polysomes prepared from the same livers showed an increased proportion of monosomes and disomes. Prior treatment with actinomycin D did not prevent these differences in response to the two amino acid mixtures, an indication that synthesis of messenger RNA may not be involved in the cell mechanism which recognizes differences in amino acid pattern."

https://openalex.org/W1987654848,"Rapidly labeled RNA from four-cell embryos and blastulae of sea urchins was analyzed by sedimentation and for ability to form DNA-RNA hybrids. The RNA was derived from polyribosomes and from the ""gel interphase,"" an extraction compartment resulting from treatment of whole embryos with phenol and known to be enriched with nuclei. The RNA from both sources displayed a high degree of structural complementarity to DNA. This DNA-like RNA of the polyribosomes sedimented in discrete classes, rather than in the sedimentation continuum demonstrable for the labeled RNA of the gel interphase. Thus messenger RNA appears to emerge in the cytoplasm in discrete size classes."

https://openalex.org/W2020505721,"STRIATED muscles give a characteristic system of low-angle X-ray reflexions. These reflexions can be seen using preparations maintained in a normal physiological condition and still able to contract1,2. A number of axial reflexions can be observed in addition to the equatorial reflexions which arise from the hexagonal lattices of overlapping actin and myosin filaments1,3. Part of the axial pattern comes from the actin filaments and closely resembles the patterns given by oriented samples of purified actin4–6; in muscle, the most prominent feature here is a strong off-meridional reflexion at 59 Å. At smaller angles a number of reflexions corresponding to an axial period of approximately 435 Å are observed, and Worthington7, whose measurements are more accurate than the original ones1, has given good reasons for believing that they come from the myosin filaments. According to the sliding-filament model, passive changes in the length of the muscle are not accompanied by any changes in the lengths of either type of filaments, and so the original observation1 that all the axial reflexions are unchanged by passive stretch is precisely what we should expect."

https://openalex.org/W2066433778,"The ion permeability of the nuclear membrane envelope of salivary gland cells (of the midge Chironomus thummi) undergoes changes during development. Following the early fourth instar stage, permeability falls to about one-fifth of its base value over a period of 3 to 5 days of development of the animal, and then rises again over the next 2 to 4 days. The falling phase of the change can be reproduced within 1 hour by injections of the growth hormone ecdyson."

https://openalex.org/W2021319799,"Small doses of nicotine (0.005 to 0.01 milligram per kilogram of body weight) given intravenously to sleeping cats with indwelling brain electrodes produce (i) initial electroen-cephalographic activation which was accompanied by behavioral arousal; (ii) a few minutes later, slow-wave sleep; and (iii) within 15 to 30 minutes, fast-wave sleep. Although peripheral afferent stimulation, release of epinephrine, and arginine vasopressin contribute to the initial arousal effects, the primary action of nicotine appears to be on the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2024048375,"Two groups of rats were trained in a Skinner box to approach the food cup when a discriminative stimulus (click or blinking light) was presented. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the brains of these two groups of rats and injected into two groups of untrained rats. The untrained two groups then manifested a significant tendency (as compared with one another) to react differently to the two stimuli. On the average, the response appeared to be specific to the stimulus employed during training."

https://openalex.org/W2059608698,"An autosomal recessive mutant characterized by ""melanotic stink glands"" has been found in the tenebrionid flour beetle, Tribolium confusum. The contents of the reservoirs of both pairs of odoriferous glands become modified in two ways as the beetles age. (i) The quinones (2-ethyl- and 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) present in the secretion are reduced to 1/20 of that normally found in the wild type. (ii) The contents may be modified into a high-molecular-weight polymeric substance, which becomes visible through the exoskeleton and, upon dissection, appears as a black solid lump. The medium in densely populated cultures of the mutant becomes moldy while that containing normal beetles remains particulate. This difference suggests that one of the functions of the secretions of the odoriferous glands is to prevent the growth of fungi or bacteria in the nutrient flour."

https://openalex.org/W1983543994,"DURING late foetal development, the mammalian liver accumulates fat. After birth, changes in fat content seem to differ according to species, and different accounts do not agree. In the guinea-pig, Imrie and Graham1 demonstrated peak amounts of liver fat at the end of prenatal life and gradual decrease of fat after birth. In the rabbit, Stieve and Kaps2 confirmed this by histological methods. In contrast, Malet et al.3 stated, on histochemical grounds, that there was little lipid in the newborn mouse, and an increase around the 18th hour of life."

https://openalex.org/W1974353575,"CLINICALLY it is a well-known phenomenon that whereas infusion of oxytocin increases the myometrial contractility, no such effect is noted on the skeletal muscle system. This is true even when as much as 3,000–4,000 mU of oxytocin is infused per min. It may be that this difference is the result of selective permeability properties of the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2092036934,"IN previous work using paper electrophoresis1 it was shown that the rat blood serum xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) activity migrates with the globulin fractions, and it has been suggested that the enzyme is bound to lipo-proteins. The increase of XD activity on rat blood serum of animals poisoned with colchicine2 and of carbon tetrachloride3 seems linked to a derangement of the lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1992353432,"THE induction of the inflammatory process has been ascribed to the local release of cellular agents such as histamine, serotonin, or other excitants. Such excitants have been considered as inflammatory agents or, more recently, as mediators of inflammation. A diametrically different perspective of this situation, or the concept of anti-anti-inflammation, is presented here. This concept is based on the hypothesis that the body is in a balanced state between inflammation and anti-inflammation as opposed to the state of absence of inflammation. An increase in local concentration of the excitant could therefore induce an anti-anti-inflammatory condition. Furthermore, a decrease in an anti-inflammatory agent could have as great importance in inducing inflammation as the increase in an anti-anti-inflammatory agent."
https://openalex.org/W1995398154,"Acrylamide gel electrophoresis has been used to make comparisons of the distribution of soluble protein and the activity of esterase in skin and melanoma extracts of the swordtail, the platyfish, and their hybrids.

Their origin and function are unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2075886161,"IN their investigations of the fat composition and in vitro oxygen consumption of marrow from fed and fasted rabbits, Evans et al.1 observed a respiratory quotient of 0.85 for marrow cell suspensions incubated in the absence of glucose but in the presence of all the fatty material of whole marrow. The authors were unable to detect any uptake of fatty acid by the marrow cells and concluded that saturated fats were probably not degraded in the marrow for the production of local energy. In the work recorded here we have re-examined the question of in vitro uptake and oxidation of fatty acid by bone marrow cells. Our results indicate that fatty acid is taken up and oxidized by washed bone marrow cells suspended in a medium containing 5 per cent albumin as a carrier for fatty acid. Furthermore, we have found that glucose exerts a considerable influence on the rate of uptake and oxidation of fatty acid."
