https://openalex.org/W2148570600,"Nociceptor sensory neurons are specialized to detect potentially damaging stimuli, protecting the organism by initiating the sensation of pain and eliciting defensive behaviours. Bacterial infections produce pain by unknown molecular mechanisms, although they are presumed to be secondary to immune activation. Here we demonstrate that bacteria directly activate nociceptors, and that the immune response mediated through TLR2, MyD88, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils and monocytes is not necessary for Staphylococcus aureus-induced pain in mice. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice is correlated with live bacterial load rather than tissue swelling or immune activation. Bacteria induce calcium flux and action potentials in nociceptor neurons, in part via bacterial N-formylated peptides and the pore-forming toxin α-haemolysin, through distinct mechanisms. Specific ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons, which include nociceptors, abrogated pain during bacterial infection, but concurrently increased local immune infiltration and lymphadenopathy of the draining lymph node. Thus, bacterial pathogens produce pain by directly activating sensory neurons that modulate inflammation, an unsuspected role for the nervous system in host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2164121350,"A novel H7N9 influenza A virus first detected in March 2013 has since caused more than 130 human infections in China, resulting in 40 deaths. Preliminary analyses suggest that the virus is a reassortant of H7, N9 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses, and carries some amino acids associated with mammalian receptor binding, raising concerns of a new pandemic. However, neither the source populations of the H7N9 outbreak lineage nor the conditions for its genesis are fully known. Using a combination of active surveillance, screening of virus archives, and evolutionary analyses, here we show that H7 viruses probably transferred from domestic duck to chicken populations in China on at least two independent occasions. We show that the H7 viruses subsequently reassorted with enzootic H9N2 viruses to generate the H7N9 outbreak lineage, and a related previously unrecognized H7N7 lineage. The H7N9 outbreak lineage has spread over a large geographic region and is prevalent in chickens at live poultry markets, which are thought to be the immediate source of human infections. Whether the H7N9 outbreak lineage has, or will, become enzootic in China and neighbouring regions requires further investigation. The discovery here of a related H7N7 influenza virus in chickens that has the ability to infect mammals experimentally, suggests that H7 viruses may pose threats beyond the current outbreak. The continuing prevalence of H7 viruses in poultry could lead to the generation of highly pathogenic variants and further sporadic human infections, with a continued risk of the virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility."

https://openalex.org/W2088995367,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulate at a higher rate than mutations in nuclear DNA, and although somatic mtDNA mutations are known to be involved in mammalian ageing, the role of germline mutations in this process is unclear: here germline-transmitted mtDNA mutations are shown to be associated with ageing and brain malformations, and maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations may thus influence both development and ageing. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulate at a higher rate than mutations in nuclear DNA. But whereas somatic mtDNA mutations are firmly associated with mammalian ageing, the extent to which such mutations contribute to ageing when inherited via the mother is not clear. Here it is shown that germline-transmitted mtDNA mutations can induce ageing phenotypes in offspring, aggravate ageing induced by somatic mitochondrial mutations and cause brain malformations in the presence of somatic mtDNA mutations. These findings suggest that inherited human mtDNA sequence variants may have a key influence on the rate of human ageing. Ageing is due to an accumulation of various types of damage1,2, and mitochondrial dysfunction has long been considered to be important in this process3,4,5,6,7,8. There is substantial sequence variation in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)9, and the high mutation rate is counteracted by different mechanisms that decrease maternal transmission of mutated mtDNA10,11,12,13. Despite these protective mechanisms14, it is becoming increasingly clear that low-level mtDNA heteroplasmy is quite common and often inherited in humans15,16. We designed a series of mouse mutants to investigate the extent to which inherited mtDNA mutations can contribute to ageing. Here we report that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations can induce mild ageing phenotypes in mice with a wild-type nuclear genome. Furthermore, maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations lead to anticipation of reduced fertility in mice that are heterozygous for the mtDNA mutator allele (PolgAwt/mut) and aggravate premature ageing phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice (PolgAmut/mut). Unexpectedly, a combination of maternally transmitted and somatic mtDNA mutations also leads to stochastic brain malformations. Our findings show that a pre-existing mutation load will not only allow somatic mutagenesis to create a critically high total mtDNA mutation load sooner but will also increase clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations17 to enhance the normally occurring mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in ageing tissues18,19. Our findings suggest that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations may have a similar role in aggravating aspects of normal human ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2128653639,"The RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease (RAG) initiates the V(D)J recombination reaction that assembles immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chain variable region exons from germline gene segments to generate primary antibody repertoires. IgH V(D)J assembly occurs in progenitor (pro-) B cells followed by that of IgL in precursor (pre-) B cells. Expression of IgH μ and IgL (Igκ or Igλ) chains generates IgM, which is expressed on immature B cells as the B-cell antigen-binding receptor (BCR). Rag expression can continue in immature B cells, allowing continued Igκ V(D)J recombination that replaces the initial VκJκ exon with one that generates a new specificity. This 'receptor editing' process, which can also lead to Igλ V(D)J recombination and expression, provides a mechanism whereby antigen encounter at the Rag-expressing immature B-cell stage helps shape pre-immune BCR repertoires. As the major site of postnatal B-cell development, the bone marrow is the principal location of primary immunoglobulin repertoire diversification in mice. Here we report that early B-cell development also occurs within the mouse intestinal lamina propria (LP), where the associated V(D)J recombination/receptor editing processes modulate primary LP immunoglobulin repertoires. At weanling age in normally housed mice, the LP contains a population of Rag-expressing B-lineage cells that harbour intermediates indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination and which contain cells with pro-B, pre-B and editing phenotypes. Consistent with LP-specific receptor editing, Rag-expressing LP B-lineage cells have similar VH repertoires, but significantly different Vκ repertoires, compared to those of Rag2-expressing bone marrow counterparts. Moreover, colonization of germ-free mice leads to an increased ratio of Igλ-expressing versus Igκ-expressing B cells specifically in the LP. We conclude that B-cell development occurs in the intestinal mucosa, where it is regulated by extracellular signals from commensal microbes that influence gut immunoglobulin repertoires."

https://openalex.org/W2026463310,"The degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by 26 S proteasomes requires ATP hydrolysis. To investigate if the six proteasomal ATPases function independently or in a cyclic manner, as proposed recently, we used yeast mutants that prevent ATP binding to Rpt3, Rpt5, or Rpt6. Although proteasomes contain six ATPase subunits, each of these single mutations caused a 66% reduction in basal ATP hydrolysis, and each blocked completely the 2-3-fold stimulation of ATPase activity induced by ubiquitinated substrates. Therefore, the ATPase subunits must function in a ordered manner, in which each is required for the stimulation of ATPase activity by substrates. Although ATP is essential for multiple steps in proteasome function, when the rate of ATP hydrolysis was reduced incrementally, the degradation of Ub5-DHFR (where Ub is ubiquitin and DHFR is dihydrofolate reductase) decreased exactly in parallel. This direct proportionality implies that a specific number of ATPs is consumed in degrading a ubiquitinated protein. When the ubiquitinated DHFR was more tightly folded (upon addition of the ligand folate), the rate of ATP hydrolysis was unchanged, but the time to degrade a Ub5-DHFR molecule (∼13 s) and the energy expenditure (50-80 ATPs/Ub5-DHFR) both increased by 2-fold. With a mutation in the ATPase C terminus that reduced gate opening into the 20 S proteasome, the energy costs and time required for conjugate degradation also increased. Thus, different ubiquitin conjugates activate similarly the ATPase subunit cycle that drives proteolysis, but polypeptide structure determines the time required for degradation and thus the energy cost."
https://openalex.org/W2069804676,"Several species of δ proteobacteria are capable of reducing insoluble metal oxides as well as other extracellular electron acceptors. These bacteria play a critical role in the cycling of minerals in subsurface environments, sediments, and groundwater. In some species of bacteria such as Geobacter sulfurreducens, the transport of electrons is proposed to be facilitated by filamentous fibers that are referred to as bacterial nanowires. These nanowires are polymeric assemblies of proteins belonging to the type IVa family of pilin proteins and are mainly comprised of one subunit protein, PilA. Here, we report the high resolution solution NMR structure of the PilA protein from G. sulfurreducens determined in detergent micelles. The protein is >85% α-helical and exhibits similar architecture to the N-terminal regions of other non-conductive type IVa pilins. The detergent micelle interacts with the first 21 amino acids of the protein, indicating that this region likely associates with the bacterial inner membrane prior to fiber formation. A model of the G. sulfurreducens pilus fiber is proposed based on docking of this structure into the fiber model of the type IVa pilin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This model provides insight into the organization of aromatic amino acids that are important for electrical conduction."
https://openalex.org/W1991171202,"Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering requires very high photon densities to detect the relatively weak signals of interest, but here it is demonstrated that inducing stimulated X-ray emission from crystalline silicon can increase the signal level by several orders of magnitude and reduces sample damage. Techniques such as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering are powerful probes of the fundamental electronic and vibrational excitations of materials, but very high photon densities are required to extract the relatively weak signals of interest, so high that sample damage can result. Martin Beye and colleagues now show how using X-ray free-electron lasers can, in principle, get around this problem by inducing stimulated X-ray emission from the sample. Using silicon as an example, they show that such lasers can induce stimulated X-ray emission from a solid sample, providing a superior probe for low-energy excitations and their dispersion in matter. Stimulated X-ray emission has previously been demonstrated in gas, but its realization in a solid system should open up a host of new experimental possibilities. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray emission spectroscopy can be used to probe the energy and dispersion of the elementary low-energy excitations that govern functionality in matter: vibronic, charge, spin and orbital excitations1,2,3,4,5,6,7. A key drawback of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has been the need for high photon densities to compensate for fluorescence yields of less than a per cent for soft X-rays8. Sample damage from the dominant non-radiative decays thus limits the materials to which such techniques can be applied and the spectral resolution that can be obtained. A means of improving the yield is therefore highly desirable. Here we demonstrate stimulated X-ray emission for crystalline silicon at photon densities that are easily achievable with free-electron lasers9. The stimulated radiative decay of core excited species at the expense of non-radiative processes reduces sample damage and permits narrow-bandwidth detection in the directed beam of stimulated radiation. We deduce how stimulated X-ray emission can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude to provide, with high yield and reduced sample damage, a superior probe for low-energy excitations and their dispersion in matter. This is the first step to bringing nonlinear X-ray physics in the condensed phase from theory10,11,12,13,14,15,16 to application."
https://openalex.org/W2165144161,"Excessive uptake of fatty acids and glucose by adipose tissue triggers adipocyte dysfunction and infiltration of immune cells. Altered metabolic homeostasis in adipose tissue promotes insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Inflammatory and metabolic processes are mediated by certain proteolytic enzymes that share a common cellular target, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). This study showed that human and rat obesity correlated in vivo with increased expression of PAR2 in adipose tissue, primarily in stromal vascular cells (SVCs) including macrophages. PAR2 was expressed more than other PARs on human macrophages and was increased by dietary fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, and myristic). A novel PAR2 antagonist, GB88 (5-isoxazoyl-Cha-Ile-spiroindene-1,4-piperidine), given orally at 10 mg/kg/d (wk 8–16) reduced body weight by ~10% in obese rats fed a high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet for 16 wk, and strongly attenuated adiposity, adipose tissue inflammation, infiltrated macrophages and mast cells, insulin resistance, and cardiac fibrosis and remodeling; while reversing liver and pancreatic dysfunction and normalizing secretion of PAR2-directed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 β cells. In summary, PAR2 is a new biomarker for obesity, and its expression is stimulated by dietary fatty acids; PAR2 is a substantial contributor to inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction; and a PAR2 antagonist inhibits diet-induced obesity and inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular dysfunction.—Lim, J., Iyer A., Liu, L., Suen J.

https://openalex.org/W1989317109,"The genetic consequences of living on the edge of distributional ranges have been the subject of a largely unresolved debate. Populations occurring along persistent low latitude ranges (rear-edge) are expected to retain high and unique genetic diversity. In contrast, currently less favourable environmental conditions limiting population size at such range-edges may have caused genetic erosion that prevails over past historical effects, with potential consequences on reducing future adaptive capacity. The present study provides an empirical test of whether population declines towards a peripheral range might be reflected on decreasing diversity and increasing population isolation and differentiation. We compare population genetic differentiation and diversity with trends in abundance along a latitudinal gradient towards the peripheral distribution range of Saccorhiza polyschides, a large brown seaweed that is the main structural species of kelp forests in SW Europe. Signatures of recent bottleneck events were also evaluated to determine whether the recently recorded distributional shifts had a negative influence on effective population size. Our findings show decreasing population density and increasing spatial fragmentation and local extinctions towards the southern edge. Genetic data revealed two well supported groups with a central contact zone. As predicted, higher differentiation and signs of bottlenecks were found at the southern edge region. However, a decrease in genetic diversity associated with this pattern was not verified. Surprisingly, genetic diversity increased towards the edge despite bottlenecks and much lower densities, suggesting that extinctions and recolonizations have not strongly reduced diversity or that diversity might have been even higher there in the past, a process of shifting genetic baselines."

For the first time, SG transcriptomes of Ixodes ricinus, an important disease vector for humans and animals, were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. SGs were collected from different tick life stages fed on various animal species, including cofeeding of nymphs and adults on the same host. Four cDNA samples were sequenced, discriminating tick SG transcriptomes of early- and late-feeding nymphs or adults. In total, 441,381,454 pyrosequencing reads and 67,703,183 Illumina reads were assembled into 272,220 contigs, of which 34,560 extensively annotated coding sequences are disclosed; 8686 coding sequences were submitted to GenBank. Overall, 13% of contigs were classified as secreted proteins that showed significant differences in the transcript representation among the 4 SG samples, including high numbers of sample-specific transcripts. Detailed phylogenetic reconstructions of two relatively abundant SG-secreted protein families demonstrated how this study improves our understanding of the molecular evolution of hematophagy in arthropods.

We expressed a membrane-bound fragment of human CSMD1 composed of the 15 C-terminal CCP domains and demonstrated that it inhibits deposition of C3b by the classical pathway on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells by 70% at 6% serum and of C9 (component of membrane attack complex) by 90% at 1.25% serum. Furthermore, this fragment of CSMD1 served as a cofactor to factor I-mediated degradation of C3b. In all functional assays performed, well-characterized complement inhibitors were used as positive controls, whereas Coxsackie adenovirus receptor, a protein with no effect on complement, was a negative control. Moreover, attenuation of expression in human T47 breast cancer cells that express endogenous CSMD1 significantly increased C3b deposition on these cells by 45% at 8% serum compared with that for the controls. Furthermore, by expressing a soluble 17–21 CCP fragment of CSMD1, we found that CSMD1 inhibits complement by promoting factor I-mediated C4b/C3b degradation and inhibition of MAC assembly at the level of C7.

https://openalex.org/W2102803338,"Lysosomal enzymes function optimally at low pH; as accumulation of waste material contributes to cell aging and disease, dysregulation of lysosomal pH may represent an early step in several pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) for ATP alkalinizes lysosomes in cultured human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells and impairs lysosomal function. P2X7R stimulation did not kill RPE cells but alkalinized lysosomes by 0.3 U. Receptor stimulation also elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+; Ca2+ influx was necessary but not sufficient for lysosomal alkalinization. P2X7R stimulation decreased access to the active site of cathepsin D. Interestingly, lysosomal alkalinization was accompanied by a rise in lipid oxidation that was prevented by P2X7R antagonism. Likewise, the autofluorescence of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments increased by lysosomal alkalinization was restored 73% by a P2X7R antagonist. Together, this suggests that endogenous autostimulation of the P2X7R may oxidize lipids and impede clearance. The P2X7R was expressed on apical and basolateral membranes of mouse RPE; mRNA expression of P2X7R and extracellular ATP marker NTPDase1 was raised in RPE tissue from the ABCA4–/– mouse model of Stargardt's retinal degeneration. In summary, P2X7R stimulation raises lysosomal pH and impedes lysosomal function, suggesting a possible role for overstimulation in diseases of accumulation.—Guha, S., Baltazar G. C., Coffey, E.

https://openalex.org/W2012835916,"Background The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Methods The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t–test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Results Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors."

CSCs/CICs of ovarian cancer have been isolated by side population (SP) analysis, ALDEFLUOR assay and using cell surface markers. However, these approaches are not definitive markers for CSCs/CICs, and it is necessary to refine recent methods for identifying more highly purified CSCs/CICs. In this study, we analyzed SP cells and aldehyde dehydrogenese bright (ALDHBr) cells from ovarian cancer cells. Both SP cells and ALDHBr cells exhibited higher tumor-initiating ability and higher expression level of a stem cell marker, sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), than those of main population (MP) cells and ALDHLow cells, respectively. We analyzed an SP and ALDHBr overlapping population (SP/ALDHBr), and the SP/ALDHBr population exhibited higher tumor-initiating ability than that of SP cells or ALDHBr cells, enabling initiation of tumor with as few as 102 cells. Furthermore, SP/ADLHBr population showed higher sphere-forming ability, cisplatin resistance, adipocyte differentiation ability and expression of SOX2 than those of SP/ALDHLow, MP/ALDHBr and MP/ALDHLow cells. Gene knockdown of SOX2 suppressed the tumor-initiation of ovarian cancer cells. An SP/ALDHBr population was detected in several gynecological cancer cells with ratios of 0.1% for HEC—1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma cells to 1% for MCAS ovary mucinous adenocarcinoma cells. Taken together, use of the SP and ALDHBr overlapping population is a promising approach to isolate highly purified CSCs/CICs and SOX2 might be a novel functional marker for ovarian CSCs/CICs."

The 8,5'-cyclopurine-2'-deoxynucleosides are quite stable lesions and are valid and reliable markers of oxidative DNA damage. However, it remains unclear how these lesions compromise DNA replication in mammalian cells. Previous in vitro biochemical assays have suggested a role for human polymerase (Pol) η in the insertion step of translesion synthesis (TLS) across the (5'S) diastereomers of cdA and cdG. Using in vitro steady-state kinetic assay, herein we showed that human Pol ι and a two-subunit yeast Pol ζ complex (REV3/REV7) could function efficiently in the insertion and extension steps, respectively, of TLS across S-cdA and S-cdG; human Pol κ and Pol η could also extend past these lesions, albeit much less efficiently. Results from a quantitative TLS assay showed that, in human cells, S-cdA and S-cdG inhibited strongly DNA replication and induced substantial frequencies of mutations at the lesion sites. Additionally, Pol η, Pol ι, and Pol ζ, but not Pol κ, had important roles in promoting replication through S-cdA and S-cdG in human cells. Based on these results, we propose a model for TLS across S-cdA and S-cdG in human cells, where Pol η and/or Pol ι carries out nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion, whereas Pol ζ executes the extension step."
https://openalex.org/W2005195196,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent two of the greatest health threats in African prisons. In 2010, collaboration between the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, the Zambia Prisons Service, and the National TB Program established a TB and HIV screening program in six Zambian prisons. We report data on the prevalence of TB and HIV in one of the largest facilities: Lusaka Central Prison. Methods Between November 2010 and April 2011, we assessed the prevalence of TB and HIV amongst inmates entering, residing, and exiting the prison, as well as in the surrounding community. The screening protocol included complete history and physical exam, digital radiography, opt-out HIV counseling and testing, sputum smear and culture. A TB case was defined as either bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed. Results A total of 2323 participants completed screening. A majority (88%) were male, median age 31 years and body mass index 21.9. TB symptoms were found in 1430 (62%). TB was diagnosed in 176 (7.6%) individuals and 52 people were already on TB treatment at time of screening. TB was bacteriologically confirmed in 88 cases (3.8%) and clinically diagnosed in 88 cases (3.8%). Confirmed TB at entry and exit interventions were 4.6% and 5.3% respectively. Smear was positive in only 25% (n = 22) of bacteriologically confirmed cases. HIV prevalence among inmates currently residing in prison was 27.4%. Conclusion Ineffective TB and HIV screening programs deter successful disease control strategies in prison facilities and their surrounding communities. We found rates of TB and HIV in Lusaka Central Prison that are substantially higher than the Zambian average, with a trend towards concentration and potential transmission of both diseases within the facility and to the general population.

MAGP1 (the protein product of the microfibrillar-associated protein 2 (Mfap2) gene) and MAGP2 (the protein product of the Mfap5 gene and also known as MP-25) are a two-member family of small microfibril-associated proteins ∼31 kDa and 25 kDa in size, respectively (6.Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both proteins are found only in vertebrates, and phylogenetic studies suggest that MAGP2 arose from MAGP1 through gene duplication early in vertebrate evolution (8.Segade F. Functional evolution of the microfibril-associated glycoproteins.Gene. 2009; 439: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two MAGPs share a functional C-terminal matrix-binding domain that is characterized by conserved cysteine residues (9.Segade F. Trask B.C. Broekelmann T.J. Pierce R.A. Mecham R.P.

Also unique to MAGP2 is an RGD integrin-binding motif located at the N terminus. Amino acid sequences in the N-terminal regions of MAGP1 and MAGP2 are dissimilar, but both are enriched in acidic amino acids. MAGP1 contains two consensus sequences for O- but not N-glycosylation (12.Trask B.C. Broekelmann T. Ritty T.M. Trask T.M. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Post-translational modifications of microfibril associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1).Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas MAGP2 contains five conserved, predicted O-linked glycosylation sequences. Functional studies with MAGP1 show that the acidic N terminus contains a growth factor interaction motif capable of binding active TGFβ and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) (13.Weinbaum J.S.

Although MAGP2 has been localized to both elastin-associated microfibrils and elastin-free microfibrils in a number of tissues, the protein exhibits patterns of tissue localization and developmental expression that are more restricted than those of MAGP1 (7.Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L.

MAGP1-deficient animals also have a pronounced deficiency in circulating and tissue monocytes. Here we report the generation and initial characterization of mice with null alleles of the MAGP2 gene (Mfap5) and both MAGP1 and MAGP2 (Mfap2−/−;Mfap5−/−) (DKO) genes. We find that Mfap5−/− (2KO) phenotypes are non-overlapping with mice lacking MAGP1 (1KO). However, the absence of both MAGPs causes changes in large vessel architecture. Biochemical studies show that MAGP2 protein binds active TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and BMP2. Taken together, these data show that MAGP2 has unique, MAGP1-independent functions in hematopoiesis and that MAGPs have redundant functions in large vessels. Homologous recombination was used to insert a gene-targeting cassette containing the coding sequence for neomycin resistance into the exon 9 region of the Mfap5 gene in murine ES cells. G418-resistant ES cell colonies were screened by Southern blot analysis, and ES cell clones, positive for recombination, were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Chimeric mice were bred for germ line transmission. Genotype analysis was performed on genomic DNA isolated from tail tissue using primers listed in supplemental Table 1. Generation of mice deficient in both MAGP1 and MAGP2 was achieved by breeding MAGP2 mutant mice with previously generated animals deficient in MAGP1 (13.Weinbaum J.S. Broekelmann T.J. Pierce R.A.

Mice used for these studies were maintained on a mixed-strain background, and wild-type controls were generated from the same parental stock as MAGP-deficient animals. Animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility, and the Washington University Animal Studies Committee approved all procedures. Genomic DNA isolated from adult mouse tail tissue was used with primers listed in supplemental Table 1 to confirm the location and orientation of the targeting construct within the Mfap5 gene locus. For all sequencing reactions, bands were extracted from agarose gel, and PCR products were isolated using a QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Amplicons were then ligated into the pGEM-T vector using the rapid DNA ligation kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and introduced into DH5α Escherichia coli (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The growth medium was inoculated with ampicillin-resistant, color-selected colonies, and plasmid products were isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kits according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory (Washington University, Saint Louis, MO) performed DNA sequencing. All DNA alignments were performed using DNASTAR Lasergene 9 software. Total RNA was isolated from adult mouse lung, kidney, and heart using TRIzol reagent, and reverse transcription cDNA amplification was performed using 1 μg of RNA and SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system with oligo(dT) according to the specifications of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Complement DNA was amplified using primers listed in supplemental Table 1. Ethidium bromide gels for nonsense-mediated decay studies were imaged with the ChemiDoc MP system and Image Lab version 4.0 software using identical exposure and filter settings (Bio-Rad). For sequencing, PCR band excision and sequencing were performed according to methods detailed previously. RNA probe generation and in situ hybridization for Mfap5, Mfap2, and collagen1α1 (Col1a1) was performed as described previously using mRNA isolated from adult mouse heart and primers listed in supplemental Table 1 (21.Ehrman L.A.

For Western blot analysis of serially extracted mouse tissue lysates, adult mouse lung was homogenized in 990 μl of PBS (pH7.4) and 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. P8340, Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and extracted 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g or 20 min at 4 °C. The liquid portion of the sample was removed for Western blotting, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 m NaCl and protease inhibitors and extracted for 24 h. The process was repeated using 8 m urea, PBS, and 20 mm DTT (seen in Fig. 5C,D), and 8 m urea + DTT. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures. Samples were run on 7.5% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Ponceau S stain was applied for 5 min and removed using 0.1 m NaOH. All blocking steps were performed with blocking buffer containing 5% casein, 0.1% coldwater fish skin gelatin, and 0.01% Tween 20 in TBS. Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C at a dilution of 1:10,000 for MAGP2 (in 5% BSA) or 1:1000 for MAGP1 (in 5% BSA). Secondary antibodies were applied at 1:4000 in casein block and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. ECL reagents were used for detection of horseradish peroxidase, and chemiluminescence was read using the ChemiDoc MP system and Image Lab version 4.0 software (GE Healthcare). Immunohistochemistry for paraffin sections was performed using the ultrasensitive ABC peroxidase rabbit IgG staining kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, with the following modifications for MAGP2 detection. After peroxidase quenching, the sections were washed in 0.1% BSA in TBS. Hyaluronidase digestion solution (1 mg/ml hyaluronidase in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH5.5) containing 0.85% NaCl) was applied, and the sections were incubated in a humid chamber for 30 min at 37 °C. The sections were washed in BSA/TBS three times for 5 min. A guanidine/DTT solution was applied to the sections for 15 min. The sections were washed with BSA/TBS three times for 5 min before incubation with iodoacetamide solution for 15 min. The sections underwent a final BSA/TBS wash before application of ultra-sensitive staining kit block solution. Primary anti-MAGP2 antibody was diluted 1:8000 in blocking solution and applied to the sections overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody solution was made using 2.25 μl/ml of secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase reactivity was visualized using the metal enhanced DAB substrate kit (Fisher). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axioskop using identical exposure and filter settings. Image processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 software. Monoclonal antibodies used for flow cytometry were as follows: phycoerythrin-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD3e (BD Biosciences), FITC rat anti-mouse CD335 (NKp46, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), FITC rat anti-mouse Ly-6G (eBioscience), phycoerythrin rat anti-mouse CD115 (eBioscience), allophycocyanin rat F4/80 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Phycoerythrin hamster IgG1, FITC rat IgG2a, FITC rat IgG2b, phycoerythrin rat IgG2a control, and allophycocyanin rat IgG2b isotype controls were utilized according to the suggestions of the manufacturer. Mice were killed by CO2 narcosis, and the chest and abdominal cavity were exposed to reveal the heart, dorsal aorta, and spleen. Whole blood was collected from the dorsal aorta in a heparinized syringe. Red cells were lysed with NH4Cl buffer for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with FACs buffer (1× PBS and 2% FBS). After blocking with mouse Fc Block (BD Biosciences) for 20 min, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with antigen-specific or isotype control antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with FACs buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed twice, and stored overnight. Spleens were removed, and splenocytes were isolated after passage through a 70-μm nylon mesh filter. Lysis, blocking, incubation, and fixation were identical to the white blood cell treatment above. Cells were sorted on a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences) with Cell-Quest software (BD Biosciences). The percentage of positive cells for each cell type was determined by gating on isotype control, nonspecific labeling (percentage of positive cells within gate < 5% for control), followed by subtraction of background percentage from antibody-specific results. A minimum of 105 live cell events were recorded for each analysis. Experiments were performed with at least five animals of each genotype (n ≥ 5), and experiments were repeated at least two times with mice 2 and 6 months of age. Microcomputed tomography analysis of left tibias from 6-month-old mice was performed as described previously (19.Craft C.S. Broekelmann T.J. Zou W. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Mecham R.P. Oophorectomy-induced bone loss is attenuated in MAGP1-deficient mice.J. Cell. Biochem. 2012; 113: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with the exception that the tibias were not frozen. The tibias were embedded in 2% agarose and scanned using a Scanco μCT 40 (Scanco Medical AG, Zurich, Switzerland). For trabecular bone measurements, the growth plate was excluded and 30 × 16-μm sections were contoured. For cortical bone, the sections were analyzed just above the tibiofibular junction, and three sections per tibia were analyzed. Contouring and analysis were performed by the Washington University Musculoskeletal Research Facility using Scanco MicroCT software. Identical contouring and analysis parameters were used for all tibias. The tibias from at least five male mice of each genotype (n ≥ 5) were used for analysis. Six-month-old male mice were weighed and then anesthetized using 1.5% isoflurane, keeping the body temperature constant. A solid-state catheter was inserted into the right common carotid artery, isoflurane was reduced to 0.5%, and blood pressure measurements were recorded (25.Faury G. Pezet M. Knutsen R.H. Boyle W.A.

The coding sequence for mouse MAGP2 protein, excluding the N-terminal signal sequence, was cloned into pET23b as a tagless construct. This plasmid was transformed into Rosetta 2(DE3) E. coli cells for protein expression. MAGP2 proteins were purified from inclusion bodies, followed by oxidative refolding as described previously (27.Swiecki M. Scheaffer S.M. Allaire M. Fremont D.H. Colonna M. Brett T.J.

Recombinant His6-tagged MAGP1, used for Western blotting, was expressed and isolated as described previously for this protein (13.Weinbaum J.S. Broekelmann T.J. Pierce R.A. Werneck C.C. Segade F.

Full-length mature-form MAGP2, without the endogenous signal sequence, was cloned into the pHL-Avitag3 vector (28.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) containing an optimized signal sequence at the N terminus as well as a BirA biotin ligase recognition sequence and hexahistidine (His6) tag at the C terminus. Protein was expressed by large-scale transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells cultured in serum-free Freestyle 293 medium (Life Tech.). Culture supernatants were collected 72 h post-transfection, and protein was purified to homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Site-specific biotinylation of the C-terminal tags were carried out using E. coli BirA biotin ligase. All surface plasmon resonance binding was performed on a Reichert SR7000 surface plasmon resonance system. To bind MAGP2 protein to the carboxymethyl dextran (CM-5) chip, the chip was preactivated with a mixture of 200 mm 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, and then 100 μl MAGP2 was diluted in 5 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and injected with a flow rate of 10 μl/min at a concentration of 20 μm. This resulted in ∼1300 resonance units of MAGP2 protein coupled to the chip. Excess reactive sites on the chip were then quenched with a 70-μl injection of 0.5 m ethanolamine (pH 8). To measure MAGP2 binding to active TGFβ1, carrier-free active human TGFβ1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted in surface plasmon resonance running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4)) and injected for 100 s at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The dissociation was monitored for 300 s. The chip was recycled with 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.3) before subsequent injections. The concentrations of TGFβ1 injected were 100, 50, 50, 25, 25, and 12.5 nm. Background subtraction and calculation of the dissociation constant for individual curves was calculated using Scrubber2 software (Center for Biolmolecular Interaction Analysis, University of Utah). The Octet system for Biolayer interferometry (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) was also used to assess MAGP2 binding to active TGFβ1 as well as TGFβ2 and BMP2. Streptavidin-coated biosensors from ForteBio were used to capture biotinylated MAGP2 onto the surface of the sensor. After reaching base line, sensors were moved to the association step containing 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, and 7.8 nm active mouse TGFβ1, TGFβ2, or BMP2 for 300 s and then dissociated for 300 s. A buffer-only reference was subtracted from all curves. The running buffer consisted of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.01% azide, 0.05% Tween, and 0.005% Triton X-100. Affinities were estimated from global kinetic analysis. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Data are reported as a mean ± S.D. Homologous recombination was used to disrupt the MAGP2 gene (Mfap5) by replacing exon 9 with a neomycin resistance cassette (Neo), causing a downstream frameshift. Our attempts to target exon 1 and the upstream promoter sequence were unsuccessful. Exon 9 encodes the matrix-binding domain. If expressed, the mutant protein lacking this domain would be incapable of binding to fibrillin and, hence, would be a functional null. PCR primers flanking each exon from 2–10, as well as within the Neo cassette itself, were used to walk along the targeted Mfap5 gene and confirm localization of the Neo cassette to exon 9. Genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated from WT and Mfap5−/− mice yielded identical amplicons using primers flanking exons 2–8 of the Mfap5 gene (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table 1). An exon 9 amplico"

A rapid, simple, non-invasive method has therefore been devised using a standard fluorescence plate reader, and used to measure the consumption of pyruvate and glucose, and release of lactate by single bovine embryos at all stages of preimplantation development in culture; amino acid profiles have been determined using HPLC. Early embryos with an ‘intermediate’ level (6.14±0.27 pmol/embryo/h) of pyruvate uptake were associated with the highest rate (68.3%) of blastocyst development indicating that a mid “optimum” range of pyruvate consumption correlates with high viability in this bovine model."
https://openalex.org/W1969908419,"Here we sought to identify transcription factors that induce ADAMTS5, a crucial proteinase for osteoarthritis development. Exhaustive comparison of the genomic sequences of human, macaque, and mouse ADAMTS5 genes revealed that the proximal 1.4 kb of the 5'-end-flanking regions containing several consensus motifs was highly conserved. Among putative transcription factors for these motifs, NF-κB family member RelA/p65 most strongly stimulated the promoter activity. In the ADAMTS5 gene, there were three NF-κB binding motifs, in which deletion, mutagenesis, and tandem repeat analyses of the luciferase assay identified the core responsive elements of RelA/p65 to be -896/-887 and -424/-415 bp with specific bindings. The endogenous Adamts5 expression in ATDC5 cells was increased by RelA/p65 overexpression and decreased by knockdown through its siRNA. The expression was also inhibited by the Rela deletion through Cre transfection in primary articular chondrocytes from Rela(fl/fl) mice. In the ex vivo culture of femoral head cartilage from mesenchymal cell-specific Rela knock-out (Prx1-Cre;Rela(fl/fl)) mice, aggrecanolysis was significantly lower than that in the Rela(fl/fl) cartilage. Finally, in the experimental mouse osteoarthritis model, ADAMTS5 and RelA were co-localized in chondrocytes of degraded articular cartilage. We conclude that RelA/p65 is a potent transcriptional activator of ADAMTS5 in chondrocytes during osteoarthritis development."
https://openalex.org/W2079930274,"The contribution of remodeling-based bone formation coupled to osteoclast activity versus modeling-based bone formation that occurs independently of resorption, to the anabolic effect of PTH remains unclear. We addressed this question using transgenic mice with activated PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes that exhibit increased bone mass and remodeling, recognized skeletal effects of PTH elevation. Direct inhibition of bone formation was accomplished genetically by overexpressing the Wnt antagonist Sost/sclerostin; and resorption-dependent bone formation was inhibited pharmacologically with the bisphosphonate alendronate. We found that bone formation induced by osteocytic PTH receptor signaling on the periosteal surface depends on Wnt signaling but not on resorption. In contrast, bone formation on the endocortical surface results from a combination of Wnt-driven increased osteoblast number and resorption-dependent osteoblast activity. Moreover, elevated osteoclasts and intracortical/calvarial porosity is exacerbated by overexpressing Sost and reversed by blocking resorption. Furthermore, increased cancellous bone is abolished by Wnt inhibition but further increased by blocking resorption. Thus, resorption induced by PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes is critical for full anabolism in cortical bone, but tempers bone gain in cancellous bone. Dissecting underlying mechanisms of PTH receptor signaling would allow targeting actions in different bone compartments, enhancing the therapeutic potential of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1969909007,"Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and post-translationally targeted to the organelle by PEX5, the peroxisomal shuttling receptor. The pathway followed by PEX5 during this process is known with reasonable detail. After recognizing cargo proteins in the cytosol, the receptor interacts with the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery, where it gets inserted; PEX5 is then monoubiquitinated, extracted back to the cytosol and, finally, deubiquitinated. However, despite this information, the exact step of this pathway where cargo proteins are translocated across the organelle membrane is still ill-defined. In this work, we used an in vitro import system to characterize the translocation mechanism of a matrix protein possessing a type 1 targeting signal. Our results suggest that translocation of proteins across the organelle membrane occurs downstream of a reversible docking step and upstream of the first cytosolic ATP-dependent step (i.e. before ubiquitination of PEX5), concomitantly with the insertion of the receptor into the docking/translocation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2142038460,"This study was undertaken to characterize the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) response to varied dietary protein intake, energy deficit (ED), and consumption of a mixed meal. A randomized, controlled trial of 39 adults consuming protein at 0.8 (recommended dietary allowance [RDA]), 1.6 (2×-RDA), or 2.4 (3×-RDA) g · kg(-1) · d(-1) for 31 d. A 10-d weight maintenance (WM) period was followed by 21 d of 40% ED. Ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis and associated gene expression were assessed in the postabsorptive (fasted) and postprandial (fed; 480 kcal, 20 g protein) states after WM and ED by using muscle biopsies, fluorescence-based assays, immunoblot analysis, and real-time qRT-PCR. In the assessment of UPS responses to varied protein intakes, ED, and feeding, the RDA, WM, and fasted measures served as appropriate controls. ED resulted in the up-regulation of UPS-associated gene expression, as mRNA expression of the atrogenes muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF1) and atrogin-1 were 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher (P<0.05) for ED than for WM. However, mixed-meal consumption attenuated UPS-mediated proteolysis, independent of energy status or dietary protein, as the activities of the 26S proteasome subunits β1, β2, and β5 were lower (P<0.05) for fed than for fasted. Muscle protein ubiquitylation was also 45% lower (P<0.05) for fed than for fasted, regardless of dietary protein and energy manipulations. Independent of habitual protein intake and despite increased MuRF1 and atrogin-1 mRNA expression during ED, consuming a protein-containing mixed meal attenuates Ub-mediated proteolysis."

Importantly, it is also associated with the perception of pain and noxious stimuli. Here, we attempt to discern the molecular organization and location of the N and C termini of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ion channel by measuring FRET between genetically attached enhanced yellow and cyan fluorescent protein to the N or C terminus of the channel protein, expressed in transfected HEK 293 cells or Xenopus laevis oocytes. The static measurements of the domain organization were mapped into an available cryo-electron microscopy density of the channel with good agreement. These measurements also provide novel insights into the organization of terminal domains and their proximity to the plasma membrane."

Affinity-tagged versions of the A2A receptor were expressed in HEK293 cells to identify interacting partners residing in the ER by a proteomics approach based on tandem affinity purification. The receptor-protein complexes were purified in quantities sufficient for analysis by mass spectrometry. We identified molecular chaperones (heat-shock proteins HSP90α and HSP70-1A) that interact with and retain partially folded A2A receptor prior to ER exit. Complex formation between the A2A receptor and HSP90α (but not HSP90β) and HSP70-1A was confirmed by co-affinity precipitation. HSP90 inhibitors also enhanced surface expression of the receptor in PC12 cells, which endogenously express the A2A receptor. Finally, proteins of the HSP relay machinery (e.g. HOP/HSC70-HSP90 organizing protein and P23/HSP90 co-chaperone) were recovered in complexes with the A2A receptor. These observations are consistent with the proposed chaperone/coat protein complex II exchange model. This posits that cytosolic HSP proteins are sequentially recruited to folding intermediates of the A2A receptor.

In the past 15 years, it has been appreciated that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorCHIPC terminus of HSP70-interacting proteinCGS216803-(4-(2-(6-amino-9-((2R,3R,4S,5S)-5-(ethycarbamoyl)3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-yl)amino)ethyl)phenyl)propanoic acidCOPIIcoat protein complex IIDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside17-DMAG17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycinERendoplasmic reticulumHSPheat-shock proteinMBPmaltose-binding proteinMBP-A2A-C-taila fusion protein comprising MBP and the C terminus of the A2A receptorTAPtandem affinity purificationXACxanthine amine congenerZM2413854-(2-(7-amino-2-(2-furyl)-(1,2,4)-triazolo-(2,3-a)-(1,3,5)-triazin-5-ylamino)ethyl)phenol)TEVtobacco etch virus. bind many additional proteins; these are being referred to as GPCR-interacting proteins or accessory proteins for lack of a better description. In contrast to many other GPCRs and, in particular, to the other members of the adenosine receptor family (1.Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Adenosine receptors. G protein-mediated signalling and the role of accessory proteins.Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the A2A receptor has an unusually long intracellular C-terminal tail (122 amino acids of the human A2A receptor compared with only 34 residues in the C terminus of the human A1 receptor). The juxtamembrane segment immediately adjacent to the seventh transmembrane helix is required for proper folding of the receptor. The rest of the C terminus (∼100 amino acids) is dispensable for ligand binding (2.Piersen C.E. True C.D. Wells J.N. A carboxyl-terminally truncated mutant and nonglycosylated A2A adenosine receptors retain ligand-binding.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar) and for G protein coupling (3.Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C.

Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The A2A receptor does not carry a cysteine residue at the end of the C-terminal helix 8, which, in the vast majority of rhodopsin-like GPCRs, is the site of palmitoylation (4.Keuerleber S. Gsandtner I. Freissmuth M. From cradle to twilight. The carboxyl terminus directs the fate of the A2A-adenosine receptor.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This suggests that the C terminus of the A2A receptor is not constrained by a lipid anchor and is hence more flexible (5.Keuerleber S. Thurner P. Gruber C.W. Zezula J. Freissmuth M.

These two features, relative length and flexibility, may combine to afford the interaction of the A2A receptor with many additional accessory proteins other than G proteins, arrestins, and G protein receptor kinases. In recent years, several interaction partners were identified in yeast two-hybrid interaction screens, using the C terminus of the A2A receptor as bait, and the list is rapidly growing (6.Gsandtner I.

Although the list of these A2A receptor-interacting partners appears to be long, it is far from complete; from its birth in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until it reaches its site of degradation in the lysosome, the A2A receptor is expected to meet many companion proteins. Several observations suggest that the A2A receptor incurs a folding problem. In PC12 cells, where the receptor is endogenously expressed, a large fraction of the receptor is retained within the cell under basal conditions (14.Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Anoxia redistributes adenosine A2A receptors in PC12 cells and increases receptor-mediated formation of cAMP.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 365: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); expression levels in PC12 cells can be increased by blocking the proteasomal degradation in the ER (9.Milojevic T. Reiterer V. Stefan E. Korkhov V.M. Dorostkar M.M. Ducza E. Ogris E. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. The ubiquitin-specific protease Usp4 regulates the cell surface level of the A2A receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, heterologously expressed receptors accumulate in a complex with calnexin in ER-derived multilamellar bodies (15.Korkhov V.M. Milan-Lobo L. Zuber B. Farhan H. Schmid J.A. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. Peptide-based interactions with calnexin target misassembled membrane proteins into endoplasmic reticulum-derived multilamellar bodies.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of USP4 results in deubiquitination of ER-resident A2A receptors, relaxes ER quality control, and promotes trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface, whereas down-regulation of USP4 has the opposite effect (9.Milojevic T. Reiterer V. Stefan E. Korkhov V.M. Dorostkar M.M. Ducza E. Ogris E. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. The ubiquitin-specific protease Usp4 regulates the cell surface level of the A2A receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). USP4 engages the C terminus of the A2A receptor; ER-resident chaperones, however, only contact the lumenal portions of the receptor. Accordingly, there must be components that sense the folding state and possibly assist the folding of the receptor on the cytosolic side. Based on these considerations, we recently proposed a chaperone/coat protein complex II (COPII)-exchange model. This model posits that one or several chaperones engage the C terminus of the partially folded A2A receptor; they are released if the receptor attains a stable fold, which renders the C terminus accessible to components of the COPII coat. If folding of the receptor stalls, it is relayed to the ER-associated degradation machinery. This model explains how premature recruitment of the COPII coat and, hence, export of partially folded receptors can be obviated by sequential binding of proteins to the C terminus (4.Keuerleber S. Gsandtner I. Freissmuth M. From cradle to twilight. The carboxyl terminus directs the fate of the A2A-adenosine receptor.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we searched for evidence in support of this model by employing a strategy relying on tandem affinity purification (TAP) of the receptor. We identified an abundant complex comprising heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) and the A2A receptor-chaperone protein complex, confirmed its identity by co-affinity and co-immunoprecipitation, and verified its relevance by the use of inhibitors. We also provide evidence for the existence of a chaperone relay; inhibition of HSP90 trapped the receptor in a complex with heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and additional co-chaperones. The cDNA encoding the human A2A receptor was amplified with the Finnzyme PhusionTM high fidelity polymerase system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using primers that introduced FseI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the pCeMM-GS-N-TAP plasmid (16.Gloeckner C.J. Boldt K. Schumacher A. Roepman R. Ueffing M. A novel tandem affinity purification strategy for the efficient isolation and characterisation of native protein complexes.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 4228-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) using restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA)/Fermentas-Thermo Scientific) and T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas-Thermo Scientific). The resulting construct is referred to as the G2S-N-A2A receptor. The G2S-N-A2A receptor construct was digested with EcoRI and NotI endonucleases and ligated into a pCDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). The C-TAP construct was generated in a similar manner using FseI/EcoRI restriction sites and subcloning into the pCeMM GS-C-TAP (17.Bürckstümmer T. Bennett K.L. Preradovic A. Schütze G. Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Bauch A. An efficient tandem affinity purification procedure for interaction proteomics in mammalian cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Both plasmids contained two protein G moieties, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site and a streptavidin-binding protein. GS-N-TAP-YFP (hereafter referred to as the G2S-N-A2A-YFP receptor) construct was cloned in a similar manner using an A2A-YFP (C-terminal) plasmid as a PCR template. As an alternative affinity tag, a combination of a tandem Strep-Tactin tag II and a FLAG tag (SF-TAP) replaced the protein G/streptavidin-binding protein sequence, resulting in the SF-N-TAP receptor construct (hereafter referred to as the FSt2-N-A2A receptor); the A2A receptor cDNA was amplified to contain NheI and ApaI restriction sites and cloned into pCDNA/SF-NTAP plasmid for expression (16.Gloeckner C.J. Boldt K. Schumacher A. Roepman R. Ueffing M. A novel tandem affinity purification strategy for the efficient isolation and characterisation of native protein complexes.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 4228-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This yielded the construct with N-terminal fusion of a single FLAG epitope and a StrepII (Strep-Tactin) affinity moiety. All receptor constructs are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A. Each expression plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing prior to transfection. Stably transfected cell lines were generated using the expression plasmids outlined above as described previously (3.Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Removal of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A-adenosine receptor blunts constitutive activity. Differential effect on cAMP accumulation and MAP kinase stimulation.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected and stably transfected cell lines expressing the tagged A2A receptors were kept in culture media containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria)) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) at 37 °C. The amount of CO2 was 5%. PC12 cells were propagated as described previously (18.Kudlacek O. Just H. Korkhov V.M. Vartian N. Klinger M. Pankevych H. Yang Q. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. The human D2 dopamine receptor synergizes with the A2A adenosine receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in PC12 cells.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing the FS2-N-A2A receptor were transfected with 30 nm Silencer® Select predesigned siRNAs (s6993 and s6994 for HSP90α; s21074 and s21075 for P23; s195025 and s195026 for CHIP) or Silencer® Select negative control siRNA (Ambion, Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX reagent. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting with antibodies against HSP90α, P23, CHIP (Abcam), or the A2A receptor (Merck-Millipore). The levels of G protein β-subunits were quantified as a loading control with antiserum 7, which recognizes residues 8–23 in the G protein β1- and β2-subunits (19.Hohenegger M. Mitterauer T. Voss T.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from parallel transfections were assayed for whole cell radioligand binding (see below). Cell membranes were prepared according to Klinger et al. (3.Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Removal of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A-adenosine receptor blunts constitutive activity. Differential effect on cAMP accumulation and MAP kinase stimulation.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were grown in poly-d-lysine (Merck-Millipore)-coated 6-well plates. The adenine nucleotide pool was metabolically labeled by incubating confluent monolayers for 16 h with [3H]adenine (1 μCi/well, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (3.Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Removal of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A-adenosine receptor blunts constitutive activity.

After the preincubation, fresh medium was added that contained 100 μm Ro-20-1724 (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor; Calbiochem-Merck Millipore) and adenosine deaminase (2 units/ml; Roche Applied Science) to remove any endogenously produced adenosine. After 4 h, cAMP formation via receptor was stimulated by the A2A-selective agonist CGS21680 (1 nm to 10 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) or directly by 30 μm forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 37 °C. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Membranes (25–100 μg/assay) from PC12 cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing the tagged A2A adenosine receptors were incubated in a final volume of 0.2 ml containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 μg/ml adenosine desaminase, and logarithmically spaced concentrations (0.5–25 nm) of [3H]ZM241385 (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). After 60 min at 23 °C, the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (Whatman-GE Healthcare). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 5–10 μm xanthine amine congener (XAC; Sigma-Aldrich) and represented about 10% of total binding at 2 nm [3H]ZM241385. Specific binding represents the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Incubations were considered to represent binding to intact cells only if >90% of the cells became adherent upon replating after a mock incubation. Binding to intact cells was monitored as described (7.Charalambous C. Gsandtner I. Keuerleber S. Milan-Lobo L. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Zezula J.

In brief, HEK293 cells stably expressing the NTAP-A2A receptor (1.6 × 105 cells) were incubated in medium (DMEM containing 0.5% FCS and 5 μg/ml adenosine deaminase) at a final concentration of 2 nm [3H]ZM241385 for 15 min at 23 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined by the addition of CGS21680 (100 μm) or XAC (10 μm). The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (Whatman-GE Healthcare). Assays were done in quadruplicate. Intracellular, binding-competent receptors were also quantified in PC12 cells (3.5 × 105 cells/assay) and HEK293 cells stably expressing N-tagged A2A receptor (2 × 105 cells/assay) that had been pretreated for 24 h in the presence of the HSP90 inhibitors radicicol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; Sigma-Aldrich). Surface receptors were quantified by measuring the difference before and after an acid strip (50 mm glycine, 125 mm NaCl, pH 3.0) (21.Klinger M. Farhan H. Just H. Drobny H. Himmler G. Loibner H. Mudde G.C. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. Antibodies directed against Lewis-Y antigen inhibit signaling of Lewis-Y modified ErbB receptors.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Total receptor numbers were also determined by measuring the radioactivity released after dissolving the samples in 1 m NaOH (22.Vanderheyden P.M. Fierens F.L. De Backer J.P. Fraeyman N. Vauquelin G. Distinction between surmountable and insurmountable selective AT1 receptor antagonists by use of CHO-K1 cells expressing human angiotensin II AT1 receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Parallel incubations were done in the presence of 10 μm XAC to define nonspecific binding. The number of viable cells was determined manually using a microscope counting chamber. HEK293 cells stably expressing the G2S-N-A2A-YFP receptor were seeded on PDL-covered glass coverslips into 6-well tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere for ≥4 h. Thereafter, the coverslips were transferred into a microscopy chamber and overlaid with Krebs-HEPES buffer. Receptor distribution was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200). Receptors were solubilized with the non-ionic detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM; Thermo Scientific) in solubilization buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The optimum concentration of DDM was found to be 0.1–0.5% using a ratio of detergent to membrane protein of 4:1–8:1 (w/w). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min on a rotating wheel, followed by gentle homogenization with a hypodermic needle (0.4 × 20 mm; Henry Schein (Gillingham, UK)). Insoluble and solubilized material was separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Prior to TAP purification, the DDM concentration was diluted to 0.1–0.2%. The solubilized G2S-N-tagged receptor was purified as described earlier (17.Bürckstümmer T. Bennett K.L. Preradovic A. Schütze G. Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Bauch A.

Briefly, the tagged receptor was incubated with IgG-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C to afford enrichment via the protein G moiety in the TAP tag. The protein complexes were eluted from the beads by cleavage (on column) using TEV protease (Promega) for 1 h at 16 °C. The eluted protein complex was then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated beads (Thermo Scientific), which selectively bind the SBP binding peptide of the TAP tag, for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the purified complex was eluted from the beads by incubation with 2 mm biotin in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 6 m urea (both Sigma-Aldrich) and used for in-solution digest and MS analysis. Solubilization of FSt2-N-A2A was performed in the same manner. TAP was performed as described earlier (16.Gloeckner C.J. Boldt K. Schumacher A. Roepman R. Ueffing M. A novel tandem affinity purification strategy for the efficient isolation and characterisation of native protein complexes.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 4228-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Alternatively, single step affinity purifications using either affinity tags were carried out to reduce the amount of starting material needed. All solubilization and purification procedures were simultaneously performed with untransfected HEK293 cells to account for false negative MS results. Purification was monitored by blotting for the receptor using Streptavidin HRP-conjugated binding protein (Thermo Scientific), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), or an anti-A2A receptor-specific antibody (Merck-Millipore). The bound detection agent was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with Pico or Femto reagent (Thermo Scientific). The chemiluminescence was captured with the FluoChem HD2 CCD camera (Biozym; Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) and quantified with ImageJ software using the gel analysis feature. The FLAG-BAPTM fusion protein (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reference standard. Eluted TAP proteins were digested in solution. Samples were denatured in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 6 m urea for 10 min at 65 °C, followed by reduction (using 200 mm DTT; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 23 °C and alkylation (using 400 mm iodoacetamide; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 23 °C. Proteins were desalted and concentrated prior digest by centrifugation in YM3 spin columns (Merck-Millipore) for 45 min at 4 °C. Proteins were digested with an excess of trypsin (MS grade; Sigma-Aldrich) for 16–18 h at 37 °C. Digest was quenched by adding 10% formic acid and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. A Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC system (Dionex-Thermo Scientific) was used for reversed phase separation on a Dionex Acclaim PepMap C18 100-Å column (150 mm × 75 μm; particle size = 3 μm) prior to MS. The HPLC system was operated in preconcentration mode using 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid as a loading solvent. An aliquot of the sample (1–5 μl) was injected onto the HPLC column. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% aqueous formic acid) and solvent B (80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.08% aqueous formic acid). Tryptic peptides were eluted using a gradient elution program of 4–60% B in 100 min, 60–90% B in 1 min, and finally a 5-min hold at 90% B, followed by a return to 4% B for a 10 min equilibration. The flow rate was 300 nl/min. The eluate from the RP-HPLC column was directly introduced into the nanospray source. Mass spectrometry was done on a hybrid quadrupole/linear ion trap 4000 QTRAP MS/MS system (ABSciex; Framingham, MA). The 4000 QTRAP equipped with a nanospray source was operated in positive ionization mode. All analyses were performed using information-dependent acquisition and the linear ion trap acquisition modes. Analyst version 1.5 software was used for data analysis. The acquisition protocol used to provide mass spectral data for database searching involved the following procedure. Mass profiling of the HPLC eluant was performed using enhanced multiple scan, and ions over the background threshold were subjected to examination using the enhanced resolution scan to confirm charge states of the multiply charged molecular ions.

In a previous study, we showed beneficial effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration in the heart function of mice with chronic T. cruzi infection. Presently, we investigated the mechanisms by which this cytokine exerts its beneficial effects. Mice chronically infected with T. cruzi were treated with human recombinant G-CSF (3 courses of 200 μg/kg/d for 5 d). Inflammation and fibrosis were reduced in the hearts of G-CSF-treated mice, compared with the hearts of vehicle-treated mice, which correlated with decreased syndecan-4, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and galectin-3 expressions. Marked reductions in interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α and increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β were found after G-CSF administration. Because the therapy did not induce a Th1 to Th2 immune response deviation, we investigated the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells. A significant increase in CD3(+)Foxp3(+) cells was observed in the hearts of G-CSF-treated mice. In addition, a reduction of parasitism was observed after G-CSF treatment. Our results indicate a role of Treg cells in the immunosuppression induced by G-CSF treatment and reinforces its potential therapeutic use for patients with Chagas disease."

In contrast to the quinolone- and acridone-producing A. marmelos QNS, C. microcarpa QNS produces 4-hydroxy-N-methylquinolone as the “single product” by the one-step condensation of N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. However, C. microcarpa ACS shows broad substrate specificities and produces not only acridone and quinolone but also chalcone, benzophenone, and phloroglucinol from 4-coumaroyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and hexanoyl-CoA, respectively. Furthermore, the x-ray crystal structures of C. microcarpa QNS and ACS, solved at 2.47- and 2.35-Å resolutions, respectively, revealed wide active site entrances in both enzymes. The wide active site entrances thus provide sufficient space to facilitate the binding of the bulky N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA within the catalytic centers. However, the active site cavity volume of C. microcarpa ACS (760 Å3) is almost as large as that of M. sativa CHS (750 Å3), and ACS produces acridone by employing an active site cavity and catalytic machinery similar to those of CHS. In contrast, the cavity of C. microcarpa QNS (290 Å3) is significantly smaller, which makes this enzyme produce the diketide quinolone.

Among the growing number of reported type III PKSs, two kinds of type III PKSs specifically involved in the biosynthesis of the anthranilate-derived alkaloids have been obtained from Rutaceae plants. One is acridone synthase (ACS) from Ruta graveolens, which catalyzes the iterative condensations of N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to produce the tetraketide 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone (Fig. 1A) (10.Lukacin R.

The other type III PKS is the recently reported quinolone synthase (QNS) from Aegle marmelos, which produces the diketide 4-hydroxy-N-methylquinolone by the one-step condensation of N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA with one molecule of malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1A) (12.Resmi M.S. Verma P. Gokhale R.S. Soniya E.V. Identification and characterization of a type III polyketide synthase involved in quinolone alkaloid biosynthesis from Aegle marmelos correa.J. Biol.

The two type III PKS enzymes thus catalyze the C–N bond-forming reactions, in addition to the C–C bond formation, to generate the anthranilate-derived alkaloid scaffolds. Notably, A. marmelos QNS does not produce the diketide quinolone specifically but also generates the tetraketide acridone from N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA in an in vitro enzyme reaction (Fig. 1A). Thus, A. marmelos QNS could be regarded as another acridone-producing ACS, which simply yields the diketide quinolone as a by-product. This is analogous to the tetraketide chalcone-forming CHS, which also produces triketide and tetraketide lactone by-products in vitro (Fig. 1B). However, we previously demonstrated that benzalacetone synthase (BAS) from Rheum palmatum, which normally produces the diketide benzalacetone by the one-step condensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA, also accepts N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA as a starter substrate to produce the quinolone by condensation with malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1B) (16.Abe I.

We now report the first QNS that produces 4-hydroxy-N-methylquinolone from N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA, as well as another acridone-producing ACS, from the leaves of the natural anti-inflammatory Rutaceae plant Citrus microcarpa. Remarkably, in contrast to the previously reported quinolone- and acridone-forming A. marmelos QNS, C. microcarpa QNS produces the diketide quinolone as the “single product” by the one-step condensation of N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). However, the newly obtained C. microcarpa ACS shows quite promiscuous substrate specificities and produces not only the anthranilate-derived acridone and quinolone but also accepts various starter substrates to generate distinct molecular scaffolds, including chalcone, benzophenone, and phloroglucinol (Fig. 1) (1.Austin M.B.

To clarify the mechanistic details of the enzyme reactions, we also solved the x-ray crystal structures of C. microcarpa QNS and ACS, at 2.47- and 2.35-Å resolutions, respectively. A comparison of the crystal structures revealed the unique active site architectures of these two enzymes and provided the first structural basis for the production of the anthranilate-derived quinolone and acridone alkaloids by type III PKSs.

After washing the resin with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole (buffer B), the recombinant protein was subsequently eluted with buffer B containing 300 mm imidazole. The protein solution was then diluted 5-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mm DTT (buffer C), and applied to a Resource-Q column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl, and the protein was subsequently eluted using a linear gradient of 50–300 mm NaCl.

Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (1.8 mCi/mmol) as the substrate. The experiments were performed in triplicate, using five concentrations (51.2, 25.6, 12.8, 6.4, and 3.2 μm) of starter-CoA and 4 μg of purified enzyme, in a final volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were extracted twice with 100 μl of ethyl acetate and separated by TLC (Merck 1.11798 silica gel 60 F254; ethyl acetate/hexane/AcOH = 63:27:5, v/v/v). Radioactivities were quantified by autoradiography, using a BAS-2000II bioimaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Lineweaver-Burk plots of data were employed to derive the apparent Km and kcat values (average of triplicates ± S.D.) using the EnzFitter software (BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK). Initial crystallization attempts and optimization of the crystallization conditions for both enzymes were performed at 20 °C, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. First, 0.5 μl of either the purified recombinant QNS or ACS protein and an equal volume of reservoir solution were mixed and equilibrated against 50 μl of reservoir solution, using a 96-condition crystallization screen originally designed by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. Crystals of QNS appeared the next day in a crystallization solution consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 18% PEG3350. Crystals of ACS were observed a few days later in a crystallization solution consisting of 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1,400 mm ammonium sulfate, and 2 mm CoASH. Further attempts to crystallize C. microcarpa QNS and ACS were performed, using Additive Screen (Hampton Research), at various pH values, 18% PEG3350, 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), and 1,400 mm ammonium sulfate as a precipitant, respectively. Diffraction quality crystals of C. microcarpa QNS were finally obtained in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 18% PEG3350, and 4% (v/v) 1-propanol, and those of C. microcarpa ACS were finally obtained in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1,400 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm NiCl2, and 2 mm CoASH using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C.

In this study, we investigated the effects of 2-ME on cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in human urothelial carcinoma (UC) cell lines. We used two high-grade human bladder UC cell lines (NTUB1 and T24). After treatment with 2-ME, the cell viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), with annexin V-FITC staining and propidium iodide (PI) labeling. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Flow cytometry with PI labeling was used for the cell cycle analyses. The protein levels of caspase activations, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, phospho-histone H2A.X, phospho-Bad, and cell cycle regulatory molecules were measured by Western blot. The effects of the drug combinations were analyzed using the computer software, CalcuSyn. We demonstrated that 2-ME effectively induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human UC cells after 24 h exposure. DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and caspase-3, 7, 8, 9 activations can be observed with 2-ME-induced apoptosis. The decreased phospho-Bad (Ser136 and Ser155) and mitotic arrest of the cell cycle in the process of apoptosis after 2-ME treatment was remarkable. In response to mitotic arrest, the mitotic forms of cdc25C, phospho-cdc2, cyclin B1, and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) were activated. In combination with arsenic trioxide (As2O3), 2-ME elicited synergistic cytotoxicity (combination index <1) in UC cells. We concluded that 2-ME significantly induces apoptosis through decreased phospho-Bad and arrests bladder UC cells at the mitotic phase. The synergistic antitumor effect with As2O3 provides a novel implication in clinical treatment of UC."

https://openalex.org/W2008449670,"Recent studies have shown that Sup35p prion fibrils probably have a parallel in-register β-structure. However, the part(s) of the N-domain critical for fibril formation and maintenance of the [PSI(+)] phenotype remains unclear. Here we designed a set of five SUP35 mutant alleles (sup35(KK)) with lysine substitutions in each of five N-domain repeats, and investigated their effect on infectivity and ability of corresponding proteins to aggregate and coaggregate with wild type Sup35p in the [PSI(+)] strain. Alleles sup35-M1 (Y46K/Q47K) and sup35-M2 (Q61K/Q62K) led to prion loss, whereas sup35-M3 (Q70K/Q71K), sup35-M4 (Q80K/Q81K), and sup35-M5 (Q89K/Q90K) were able to maintain the [PSI(+)] prion. This suggests that the critical part of the parallel in-register β-structure for the studied [PSI(+)] prion variant lies in the first 63-69 residues. Our study also reveals an unexpected interplay between the wild type Sup35p and proteins expressed from the sup35(KK) alleles during prionization. Both Sup35-M1p and Sup35-M2p coaggregated with Sup35p, but only sup35-M2 led to prion loss in a dominant manner. We suggest that in the fibrils, Sup35p can bind to Sup35-M1p in the same conformation, whereas Sup35-M2p only allowed the Sup35p conformation that leads to the non-heritable fold. Mutations sup35-M4 and sup35-M5 influence the structure of the prion forming region to a lesser extent, and can lead to the formation of new prion variants."
https://openalex.org/W1969954695,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a required cofactor for the synthesis of NO by NOS. Bioavailability of BH4 is a critical factor in regulating the balance between NO and superoxide production by endothelial NOS (eNOS coupling). Crystal structures of the mouse inducible NOS oxygenase domain reveal a homologous BH4-binding site located in the dimer interface and a conserved tryptophan residue that engages in hydrogen bonding or aromatic stacking interactions with the BH4 ring. The role of this residue in eNOS coupling remains unexplored. We overexpressed human eNOS W447A and W447F mutants in novel cell lines with tetracycline-regulated expression of human GTP cyclohydrolase I, the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 synthesis, to determine the importance of BH4 and Trp-447 in eNOS uncoupling. NO production was abolished in eNOS-W447A cells and diminished in cells expressing W447F, despite high BH4 levels. eNOS-derived superoxide production was significantly elevated in W447A and W447F versus wild-type eNOS, and this was sufficient to oxidize BH4 to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin. In uncoupled, BH4-deficient cells, the deleterious effects of W447A mutation were greatly exacerbated, resulting in further attenuation of NO and greatly increased superoxide production. eNOS dimerization was attenuated in W447A eNOS cells and further reduced in BH4-deficient cells, as demonstrated using a novel split Renilla luciferase biosensor. Reduction of cellular BH4 levels resulted in a switch from an eNOS dimer to an eNOS monomer. These data reveal a key role for Trp-447 in determining NO versus superoxide production by eNOS, by effects on BH4-dependent catalysis, and by modulating eNOS dimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W2010523686,"Ubiquitination is an important mechanism for the regulation of diverse cellular functions, including proteolysis and DNA repair. The human MutS family protein hMSH4 functions in meiotic recombinational DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. It was previously observed that hMSH4 interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1), a partner of the VHL ubiquitin E3 ligase as well as a subunit of the prefoldin complex. In this study we address how ubiquitination regulates the homeostasis of hMSH4 in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T. We demonstrate that VBP1 targets hMSH4 for degradation and identify a new VBP1 binding partner, p97, an AAA+ ATPase involved in protein degradation and DNA damage response. VBP1, VHL, and p97 coexist in the hMSH4 immunocomplex and regulate the polyubiquitination of hMSH4. Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrate that VBP1 acts together with p97 to regulate hMSH4 degradation. Overall, this study has revealed a molecular mechanism by which VBP1 controls the levels of hMSH4 by ubiquitination in mitotic cells. Such a mechanism may be important for controlling the role of hMSH4 in regulating homologous recombination and nonhomologous DNA end joining-mediated DSB repair in human cells.—Xu, Y., Her, C., VBP1 facilitates proteasome and autophagy-mediated degradation of MutS homologue hMSH4.

However, the role of leptin in lung biology and pathology, including the mechanism of leptin gene expression in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, including lung cancer, remains elusive. Here, using conditional deletion of tumor suppressor gene Pten in the lung epithelium in vivo in transgenic mice and human PTEN-null lung epithelial cells, we identify the leptin-driven feed-forward signaling loop in the lung epithelial cells. Leptin-mediated leptin/leptin-receptor gene expression likely amplifies leptin signaling that may contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of lung diseases, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Loss of Pten in the lung epithelial cells in vivo activated adipokine signaling and induced leptin synthesis as ascertained by genome-wide mRNA profiling and pathway analysis.

Physiol. 2010; 108: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Increased LEP expression and secretion following lung injury promotes fibroproliferation, contributing to pulmonary fibrosis (11.Jain M. Budinger G.R. Lo A. Urich D. Rivera S.E. Ghosh A.K.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L1150-L1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulmonary LEP is also increased in asymptomatic smokers and in mice exposed to cigarette smoke where it modulates innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment (4.Vernooy J.H.

In contrast, resistance to the effects of LEP attenuates lung disease pathology, whereas reduction in LEP levels is a strong predictive factor in the improvement of lung function (13.Bellmeyer A. Martino J.M. Chandel N.S. Scott Budinger G.R. Dean D.A. Mutlu G.M. Leptin resistance protects mice from hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Facts. 2012; 5: 806-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that LEP is causally linked to the pathogenesis of many lung diseases associated with injury as well as lung cancer. ALI/ARDS and COPD cause considerable morbidity and mortality (15.Malli F. Papaioannou A.I. Gourgoulianis K.I. Daniil Z. The role of leptin in the respiratory system: an overview.Respir. Res. 2010; 11: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and close to 160,000 people die of lung cancer every year in the United States alone, imposing a major healthcare burden (16.MacCallum N.S. Evans T.W. Epidemiology of acute lung injury.Curr. Opin. Crit. Care. 2005; 11: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although clinical interventions do improve alveolar functions marginally in some patients, deterioration of lung function cannot be prevented in these diseases, leading to respiratory failure and death (17.Matthay M.A. Zimmerman G.A. Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome: four decades of inquiry into pathogenesis and rational management.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Despite advancements in understanding the pathophysiology of ALI, ARDS, COPD, asthma, and lung cancer, how LEP is induced and contributes to the severity and progression of these lung diseases remains poorly understood (18.Calfee C.S. Matthay M.A. Eisner M.D. Benowitz N. Call M. Pittet J.F. Cohen M.J. Active and passive cigarette smoking and acute lung injury after severe blunt trauma.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2011; 183: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LEP and adiponectin (encoded by the ADIPOQ gene) and their respective receptors are expressed by human lung bronchiolar and type II epithelial cells (6.Vernooy J.H. Ubags N.D. Brusselle G.G.

Ther. 2013; 26: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Airway LEP concentrations are high in COPD patients, whereas increased LEP is associated with greater airway inflammation and disease severity in asthma patients; however, these data remain conflicting (6.Vernooy J.H. Ubags N.D. Brusselle G.G. Tavernier J. Suratt B.T. Joos G.F. Wouters E.F. Bracke K.R. Leptin as regulator of pulmonary immune responses: Involvement in respiratory diseases.Pulm. Pharmacol.

LEP signals are pro-angiogenic, pro-inflammatory, and mitogenic and are mediated via multiple cross-regulatory pathways involving oncogenes, cytokines, and growth factors, driving growth of solid tumors (19.Sierra-Honigmann M.R.

LEP activates JAK2/STAT3, MAPK/ERK1/2, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (2.Morris D.L. Rui L. Recent advances in understanding leptin signaling and leptin resistance.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E1247-E1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21.Sweeney G. Leptin signalling.Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As a pro-angiogenic factor, LEP up-regulates VEGF and its receptor VEGF receptor 2 via activation of the IL-1 signaling pathway (1.Procaccini C. Jirillo E. Matarese G. Leptin as an immunomodulator.Mol. Aspects Med. 2012; 33: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22.Zhou W. Guo S. Gonzalez-Perez R.R.

However, despite the importance of well established LEP signaling pathways outside the adipose tissue and their roles in disease pathology, the mechanisms of regulation and induction of Leptin (LEP) gene expression largely remains limited to adipocytes. Although the LEP gene proximal promoter was defined (24.de la Brousse F.C. Shan B. Chen J.L. Identification of the promoter of the mouse obese gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Given the emerging role of LEP in the structural and functional maintenance of the normal and injured lung as well as in the progression of lung cancer (5.Ribeiro R. Araujo A. Lopes C. Medeiros R. Immunoinflammatory mechanisms in lung cancer development: is leptin a mediator?.J. Thoracic Oncol. 2007; 2: 105-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6.Vernooy J.H.

Ther. 2013; 26: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is imperative that a transcriptional regulatory mechanism, especially induction of LEP gene expression in lung epithelial cells, be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of Pten in the lung epithelium in vivo in transgenic mice and in PTEN-null human lung epithelial cells induced LEP signaling in lung epithelial cells. LEP-mediated transcription of LEP and LEPR was mediated by binding of transcription factors NRF-1 and C/EBP-δ to the proximal and STAT3 to the distal LEP gene promoter in lung epithelial cells. Increased LEP expression in PtenΔ/Δ respiratory epithelial cells elicited an autocrine feed-forward loop via up-regulation of LEPR on the lung epithelial cells. LEP/LEPR signaling loop was driven by activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MEK/ERK, and JAK/STAT3 pathways. These three signaling pathways activated expression of both LEP and LEPR, setting up a positive feed-forward LEP/LEPR signaling loop in the lung epithelium. Taken together, aberrant amplification of the LEP-mediated LEP signaling loop potentially deregulates the modulatory role of LEP, likely exacerbating the severity of lung diseases, including cancer, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Compound transgenic mice harboring the Pten gene with loxP-flanked exon-V (Ptenflox/flox), SP-C-rtTAtg/−, and TetO-Cretg/− were generated and genotyped as described previously (31.Davé V. Wert S.E. Tanner T. Thitoff A.R. Loudy D.E. Whitsett J.A. Conditional deletion of Pten causes bronchiolar hyperplasia.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Likewise, doxycycline treatment induced tumors in CCSP-rtTA/TetO-Cretg/−/LSL-KrasG12D/PtenΔ/Δ mice between 10 and 12 weeks of age. Mice expressing rtTA, or bearing TetO-Cretg/− alone, were the normal controls. Animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of South Florida. Mice were housed in humidity- and temperature-controlled rooms on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. There was no serologic or histologic evidence of either pulmonary pathogens or infections in sentinel mouse colonies. Gestation was dated E0.5 by vaginal plug. Mice were killed by injection of anesthetic to obtain lung tissue at ∼12 weeks when tachypnea associated with lethargy was observed. Lung cRNA was hybridized to the murine genome MOE430 chips (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 was used to scan and quantitate the gene chips under default settings. Normalization was performed using the robust multichip average model (32.Dranoff G.

Data were analyzed using Genespring 7.2 (Silicon Genetics). A volcano plot was used to identify significance (negative log of p values from Welch's approximate t test on y axis) and magnitude of change (log2 of fold change on the x axis) in the expression of a set of genes between PtenΔ/Δ mice and control littermates (34.Dinu I.

The Fisher exact test was used to calculate the probability of each gene ontology category that was over-represented in the selected list, using the entire MOE430 mouse genome as a reference data set. Differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, two-tailed Student's t test; fold change, >1.5) were compared, and correlations of transcript changes among three microarray experiments were measured. The differentially regulated genes were enriched into different functional clusters using the DAVID Bioinformatic resources 6.7 and quantitatively measured by statistical methods, including χ2, Fisher's exact test, binomial probability, and hypergeometric distribution. Pathway analysis was performed on the enriched clusters using DAVID pathway viewer, GeneGo, and Ingenuity software suites, and top scoring pathways were considered for biologic interpretation.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, Tampa FL), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% mixture of penicillin G, streptomycin, and plasmocin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. A series of LEP promoter-luciferase constructs were used in transient transfection assays using the PEI method (39.Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. A versatile vector for gene and oligonucleotide transfer into cells in culture and in vivo: polyethyleneimine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-well plates at 30–50% confluence were transfected with a fixed amount of LEP promoter-luciferase plasmid and various amounts of CMV-based cDNA expressing transactivator plasmids. Total DNA was normalized with corresponding CMV-empty vectors, and transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity using 100 ng/well of pCMV β-galactosidase. Two days after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using 50 μl of the supernatant. The light units were assayed by luminometry (MLX, Microtiter Luminometer, DYNEX). Data obtained represent the average of three transfection experiments, each carried out in triplicate and depicted as means ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. Primer sequences for LEP promoter-luciferase constructs were as follows: BGL-HU-LEP-B1-R, cggaacagatcttgcaaccgctggcgctg; 800MluHuLEP-F3, gcgagcacgcgttgacaaaaacgtggctacatctggg; 620MluHuLep-F4, gcgagcacgcgtgaggcttggaactcgattctccg; 399MluHuLep-F5, gcgagcacgcgtcggagcccctcacagcca; 150MluHuLep-F6, gcgagcacgcgtcggcacgtcgctaccctgag; 89MluHuLep-F7, gcgagcacgcgtcggggcagttgcgcaagt; and 52MluHuLep-F8, gcgagcacgcgtagttgtgatcgggccgctataagag. Total RNA was isolated from 60 to 80% confluent H1650 cells grown in RPMI 1640 medium using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) and purified using the RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was converted into cDNA using the SuperScript® III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and used for real time PCR assays. cDNA samples were mixed with 10 μl of 2× Fast SYBR Green real time PCR master mix containing gene-specific primers. The reaction mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of PCRs with the following settings: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The PCR was monitored by the ABI StepOnePlusTM real time PCR system (ABI PRISM 7700; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the results were analyzed with the ABI StepOnePlusTM real time PCR version 2.0 software (ABI PRISM 7700). Sequences for primers used were as follows: Lep-R, caccaaaaccctcatcaagaca, and Lep-F, gatagaggcccaggcatttttta; LEPR-F, tagagaaggccagcacgtgaa, and LEPR-R, acaccactctctctctttttgattga; GAPDH-F, tgttgccatcaatgacccctt, and GAPDH-R, ctccacgacgtactcagcg; and NRF-1-F, ccgaggacacctcttacgatg, and NRF-1-R, tacatgaggccgtttccgttt. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific to human NRF-1 (Hu-SH-29, 29-mer shRNA constructs in retroviral GFP vector) were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). A noneffective 29-mer scrambled shRNA cassette in pGFP-V-RS was used as control. NRF-1 shRNA and scrambled control (3 μg/ml) were transfected into H1650 cells, and RNA was isolated from cells after 48 h. The efficiency of shRNA-based interference of NRF-1 was monitored via real time PCR analysis and gene-specific NRF-1 primers. The CEBP-δ and NRF-1 mutant plasmids were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Lightening site-directed mutagenesis kit, Agilent Technologies). Briefly, Lep150 was used as a template with oligonucleotides containing mutations in the CEBP-δ and NRF-1 sites (listed below) to generate PCR products. An annealing temperature of 51 °C was employed for 18 cycles with an extension time of 3 min at 68 °C. This was followed by DpnI digestion of the parental DNA and transformation in XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells using β-mercaptoethanol provided in the kit. This was followed by routine plating and colony culture procedures. The mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Sequences for primers used are as follows: CEBP-δ (−60/−53): forward primer, 5′-ggcagttcagtacgttgtgatcg-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-acaacgtactgaactgcccg-3′; NRF-1 (−81/−78): forward primer, 5′-tagaaatacaccggggcctg-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-caggccccggtgtatttcta-3′. ChIP lysates were made using the ChIP-IT Express Magnetic Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kits (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). H1650 cells that were 90% confluent were treated with formaldehyde solution, and the chromatin was isolated, digested, and immunoprecipitated as per the manufacturer's instructions. The sheared chromatin was incubated with antibody directed against NRF-1, C/EBP-δ, and STAT-3, and the antibody-bound protein-DNA complexes were precipitated using magnetic protein G-coupled beads. The captured chromatin was eluted and then uncross-linked, and the DNA was recovered. ChIP DNA was subjected to RT-PCR using specific primers flanking the DNA-binding sites for NRF-1, C/EBP-δ, and STAT3. Sequences for primers used are as follows: NRF-1/CEBP-D-ChIP-R, cggaacagatcttgcaaccgctggcgctg, and NRF-1/CEBP-D-ChIP-F, gcgagcacgcgtcggcacgtcgctaccctgag; STAT3-ChIP-R, tcctctctttgtactctctctctttatttctcagc, and STAT3-ChIP-F, ccagatgcagtggctcatgcttgta; GAPDH-ChIP-R, tactagcggttttacgggcg, and GAPDH-ChIP-F, tcgaacaggaggagcagagagcga.

https://openalex.org/W1990375047,"Versican G1 domain-containing fragments (VG1Fs) have been identified in extracts from the dermis in which hyaluronan (HA)-versican-fibrillin complexes are found. However, the molecular assembly of VG1Fs in the HA-versican-microfibril macrocomplex has not yet been elucidated. Here, we clarify the role of VG1Fs in the extracellular macrocomplex, specifically in mediating the recruitment of HA to microfibrils. Sequential extraction studies suggested that the VG1Fs were not associated with dermal elements through HA binding properties alone. Overlay analyses of dermal tissue sections using the recombinant versican G1 domain, rVN, showed that rVN deposited onto the elastic fiber network. In solid-phase binding assays, rVN bound to isolated nondegraded microfibrils. rVN specifically bound to authentic versican core protein produced by dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, rVN bound to VG1Fs extracted from the dermis and to nondenatured versican but not to fibrillin-1. Homotypic binding of rVN was also seen. Consistent with these binding properties, macroaggregates containing VG1Fs were detected in high molecular weight fractions of sieved dermal extracts and visualized by electron microscopy, which revealed localization to microfibrils at the microscopic level. Importantly, exogenous rVN enhanced HA recruitment both to isolated microfibrils and to microfibrils in tissue sections in a dose-dependent manner. From these data, we propose that cleaved VG1Fs can be recaptured by microfibrils through VG1F homotypical interactions to enhance HA recruitment to microfibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2020320544,"MEKK2 (MAP/ERK kinase kinase-2) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the MEKK/STE11 family of MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP(3)Ks). MEKK2 integrates stress and mitogenic signals to the activation of NF-κB, JNK1/2, p38, and ERK5 pathways. We have found that MEKK2 is regulated through a phosphorylation-dependent association with 14-3-3, a group of adapters that modulate dimerization and association between proteins. We found that MEKK2 was phosphorylated at Thr-283, which resulted in decreased activation loop phosphorylation at Ser-519 and consequently reduced activity. Mechanistically, we found that MEKK2 associated with inactive MEKK2 in the absence of 14-3-3 binding, which led to trans-autophosphorylation of Ser-519. Enforced binding with 14-3-3 reduced Ser-519 trans-autophosphorylation. Expression of T283A MEKK2 within a MEKK2(-/-) background enhanced stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity while elevating IL-6 expression, but also reduced ERK activation with a corresponding reduced proliferation rate. These results indicate that Thr-283 phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism for MEKK2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2135321245,"Post-replicational telomere end processing involves both extension by telomerase and resection to produce 3′-GT-overhangs that extend beyond the complementary 5′-CA-rich strand. Resection must be carefully controlled to maintain telomere length. At short de novo telomeres generated artificially by HO endonuclease in the G2 phase, we show that dna2-defective strains are impaired in both telomere elongation and sequential 5′-CA resection. At native telomeres in dna2 mutants, GT-overhangs do clearly elongate during late S phase but are shorter than in wild type, suggesting a role for Dna2 in 5′-CA resection but also indicating significant redundancy with other nucleases. Surprisingly, elimination of Mre11 nuclease or Exo1, which are complementary to Dna2 in resection of internal double strand breaks, does not lead to further shortening of GT-overhangs in dna2 mutants. A second step in end processing involves filling in of the CA-strand to maintain appropriate telomere length. We show that Dna2 is required for normal telomeric CA-strand fill-in. Yeast dna2 mutants, like mutants in DNA ligase 1 (cdc9), accumulate low molecular weight, nascent lagging strand DNA replication intermediates at telomeres. Based on this and other results, we propose that FEN1 is not sufficient and that either Dna2 or Exo1 is required to supplement FEN1 in maturing lagging strands at telomeres.

Significance: FEN1, Dna2, or Exo1 is necessary to mature lagging strands at telomeres. Yeast telomeres end in ∼300 bp of short repeated sequences that are GT-rich in the 3′-terminating strand and CA-rich in the 5′-terminating strand (1.Shampay J. Szostak J.W. Blackburn E.H. DNA sequences of telomeres retained in yeast.Nature. 1984; 310: 154-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Walmsley R.W. Chan C.S. Tye B.K. Petes T.D. Unusual DNA sequences associated with the ends of yeast chromosomes.Nature. 1984; 310: 157-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast telomeres replicate in late S/G2 from late-firing subtelomeric origins of replication (autonomously replicating sequence). Because the replication fork most frequently proceeds outward toward the end of the chromosome, the nascent telomere GT-strand is synthesized by the leading strand polymerase, and the CA-strand is synthesized by the lagging strand polymerase. In yeast, as in many organisms, the telomeres are not fully duplex but have single-stranded GT-overhangs. Yeast GT-overhangs are about 12–14 nucleotides long in G1 and double in length during S phase (3.Larrivée M. LeBel C. Wellinger R.J. The generation of proper constitutive G-tails on yeast telomeres is dependent on the MRX complex.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4.Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Saccharomyces telomeres acquire single-strand TG1–3 tails late in S phase.Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Overhangs occur on both leading and lagging strands (5.Wellinger R.J. Zakian V.A.

Wright W.E. Human telomeres have different overhang sizes at leading versus lagging strands.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but it is not known if they are generated in the same way on both ends. Synthesis of the CA-strand by the lagging strand polymerase is predicted to leave a short unreplicated segment. This could either be due to RNA primer removal or to the uncoupling of the leading and lagging strands, i.e. absence of the replisome (8.Zhao Y. Sfeir A.J. Zou Y. Buseman C.M. Chow T.T. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Telomere extension occurs at most chromosome ends and is uncoupled from fill-in in human cancer cells.Cell. 2009; 138: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), resulting in a single-stranded 3′-GT-overhang. Nucleolytic resection of the CA-strand might also contribute to the lagging strand 5′-GT-overhang. The end replicated by the leading strand assembly, however, is expected to have a blunt end and would require 5′- to 3′-nucleolytic resection to create a 3′-GT-overhang, suggesting that the overhangs arise due to resection (9.Faure V. Coulon S. Hardy J. Géli V. Cdc13 and telomerase bind through different mechanisms at the lagging- and leading-strand telomeres.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 842-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of helicases and nucleases are known to participate in these processes, but the precise pathways are still unclear. The GT-overhangs are extended by telomerase, which, in effect, prevents erosion of the chromosome end (10.Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts.Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). How the number of repeats added by telomerase is regulated and how the complementary lagging strand is synthesized and matured, referred to as CA-strand fill-in, are not completely understood. Also poorly understood is how aberrant recombination and checkpoint activation is prevented. Understanding regulation of telomerase and the DNA damage checkpoint, respectively, requires understanding the roles of numerous proteins, including Mre11, Rad50, Tel1, Xrs2, Dna2, Est1, Est3, Cdc13, Stn1, Ten1, Pif1, Rap1, Rif1, Rif2, RPA, Ku70/Ku80, and the entire lagging strand replication machinery (11.Kironmai K.M.

Exo1 acts redundantly with Dna2 in long range resection. Interestingly, Mre11 nuclease also functions in resection and becomes essential for DSB repair in the absence of Dna2 and vice versa (46.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L.

FEN1 has also recently been detected by ChIP assays at an HO-induced DSB (in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) (49.Kuntz K. O'Connell M.J. Initiation of DNA damage responses through XPG-related nucleases.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and overexpression of FEN1 suppresses the x-ray sensitivity of dna2-1 mutants (50.Budd M.E.

Res. 2000; 459: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is striking that the same nucleases used in Okazaki fragment processing also function in DSB resection. Dna2 associates in bulk with telomeres during G1, dissociates from telomeres during S phase, moving to many other chromosomal sites, and then reassociates with telomeres at late S/G2 phase. Just as in S phase, Dna2 is also displaced from telomeres when cells undergo bleomycin-induced DSB DNA damage (42.Choe W. Budd M. Imamura O. Hoopes L. Campbell J.L.

This release may facilitate the recruitment of Dna2 for resection and activation of the Mec1 checkpoint kinase (51.Zou L.

We have previously shown that dna2-2 mutants are defective in telomerase-dependent telomere lengthening and that dna2-2 est1Δ and dna2-2 est2Δ mutants senesce dramatically more rapidly than est1Δ (subunit of telomerase) or est2Δ (telomerase) single mutants (42.Choe W.

In the double mutants, survivors arise more rapidly than in single telomerase mutants, and double-mutant survivors occur almost exclusively due to break-induced replication in the GT/CA tracts, rather than by Y′-dependent recombination (42.Choe W.

Biochemically, we demonstrated that Dna2 binds DNA-containing telomeric GT-rich repeats that form G quadruplexes (G4) and G4 secondary structures much more avidly than single-stranded DNA. Both yeast and human Dna2 unwind G4 structures and cleave the DNA at junctions between single-stranded DNA G4 structures (43.Lin W. Sampathi S. Dai H. Liu C. Zhou M. Hu J. Huang Q. Campbell J. Shin-Ya K. Zheng L. Chai W. Shen B.

Exo1 and Mre11 also play roles at telomeres. Exo1 creates long regions of single-stranded DNA at uncapped telomeres in cdc13 mutants and is involved in resection of a de novo telomere in G2-arrested cells (see Fig. 1). In this artificial telomere resection assay, Exo1 is redundant with Dna2 (55.Zubko M.K. Guillard S. Lydall D.

This could be due to a delay in CA-strand fill-in, because we demonstrate that nascent lagging strands accumulate as fragments shorter than 3 kb in dna2 mutants, consistent with its role in flap removal during Okazaki fragment processing, just as in DNA ligase or FEN1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2091231737,"Inter-regulation of adrenergic receptors (ARs) via cross-talk is a long appreciated but mechanistically unclear physiological phenomenon. Evidence from the AR literature and our own extensive studies on regulation of α2AARs by the scaffolding protein spinophilin have illuminated a potential novel mechanism for cross-talk from β to α2ARs. In the present study, we have characterized a mode of endogenous AR cross-talk in native adrenergic neurons whereby canonical βAR-mediated signaling modulates spinophilin-regulated α2AAR endocytosis through PKA. Our findings demonstrate that co-activation of β and α2AARs, either by application of endogenous agonist or by simultaneous stimulation with distinct selective agonists, results in acceleration of endogenous α2AAR endocytosis in native neurons. We show that receptor-independent PKA activation by forskolin is sufficient to accelerate α2AAR endocytosis and that α2AAR stimulation alone drives accelerated endocytosis in spinophilin-null neurons. Endocytic response acceleration by β/α2AAR co-activation is blocked by PKA inhibition and lost in spinophilin-null neurons, consistent with our previous finding that spinophilin is a substrate for phosphorylation by PKA that disrupts its interaction with α2AARs. Importantly, we show that α2AR agonist-mediated α2AAR/spinophilin interaction is blocked by βAR co-activation in a PKA-dependent fashion. We therefore propose a novel mechanism for cross-talk from β to α2ARs, whereby canonical βAR-mediated signaling coupled to PKA activation results in phosphorylation of spinophilin, disrupting its interaction with α2AARs and accelerating α2AAR endocytic responses. This mechanism of cross-talk has significant implications for endogenous adrenergic physiology and for therapeutic targeting of β and α2AARs."
https://openalex.org/W2106352022,"NarE is an arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase identified in Neisseria meningitidis that requires the presence of iron in a structured cluster for its enzymatic activities. In this study, we show that NarE can perform auto-ADP-ribosylation. This automodification occurred in a time- and NAD-concentration-dependent manner; was inhibited by novobiocin, an ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibitor; and did not occur when NarE was heat inactivated. No reduction in incorporation was evidenced in the presence of high concentrations of ATP, GTP, ADP-ribose, or nicotinamide, which inhibits NAD-glycohydrolase, impeding the formation of free ADP-ribose. Based on the electrophoretic profile of NarE on auto-ADP-ribosylation and on the results of mutagenesis and mass spectrometry analysis, the auto-ADP-ribosylation appeared to be restricted to the addition of a single ADP-ribose. Chemical stability experiments showed that the ADP-ribosyl linkage was sensitive to hydroxylamine, which breaks ADP-ribose-arginine bonds. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that the auto-ADP-ribosylation site occurred preferentially on the R7 residue, which is located in the region I of the ADP-ribosyltransferase family. After auto-ADP-ribosylation, NarE showed a reduction in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, while NAD-glycohydrolase activity was increased. Overall, our findings provide evidence for a novel intramolecular mechanism used by NarE to regulate its enzymatic activities.—Picchianti, M., Del Vecchio, M., Di Marcello, F., Biagini, M., Veggi, D., Norais N., Rappuoli, R., Pizza, M., Balducci, E., Auto ADP-ribosylation of NarE, a Neisseria meningitidis ADP-ribosyltransferase, regulates its catalytic activities.

https://openalex.org/W2094729816,"Insect voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are formed by a well-known pore-forming α-subunit encoded by para-like gene and ancillary subunits related to TipE from the mutation ""temperature-induced-paralysis locus E."" The role of these ancillary subunits in the modulation of biophysical and pharmacological properties of Na(+) currents are not enough documented. The unique neuronal ancillary subunit TipE-homologous protein 1 of Drosophila melanogaster (DmTEH1) strongly enhances the expression of insect Nav channels when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of two neuronal DmTEH1-homologs of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, PaTEH1A and PaTEH1B, encoded by a single bicistronic gene. In PaTEH1B, the second exon encoding the last 11-amino-acid residues of PaTEH1A is shifted to 3'UTR by the retention of a 96-bp intron-containing coding-message, thus generating a new C-terminal end. We investigated the gating and pharmacological properties of the Drosophila Nav channel variant (DmNav1-1) co-expressed with DmTEH1, PaTEH1A, PaTEH1B or a truncated mutant PaTEH1Δ(270-280) in Xenopus oocytes. PaTEH1B caused a 2.2-fold current density decrease, concomitant with an equivalent α-subunit incorporation decrease in the plasma membrane, compared to PaTEH1A and PaTEH1Δ(270-280). PaTEH1B positively shifted the voltage-dependences of activation and slow inactivation of DmNav1-1 channels to more positive potentials compared to PaTEH1A, suggesting that the C-terminal end of both proteins may influence the function of the voltage-sensor and the pore of Nav channel. Interestingly, our findings showed that the sensitivity of DmNav1-1 channels to lidocaine and to the pyrazoline-type insecticide metabolite DCJW depends on associated TEH1-like subunits. In conclusion, our work demonstrates for the first time that density, gating and pharmacological properties of Nav channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes can be modulated by an intron retention process in the transcription of the neuronal TEH1-like ancillary subunits of P. americana."
https://openalex.org/W2083213048,"Botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent protein toxins in nature. Despite the potential to block neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and cause human botulism, they are widely used in protein therapies. Among the seven botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, mechanisms of substrate recognition and specificity are known to a certain extent in the A, B, E, and F light chains, but not in the D light chain (LC/D). In this study, we addressed the unique substrate recognition mechanism of LC/D and showed that this serotype underwent hydrophobic interactions with VAMP-2 at its V1 motif. The LC/D B3, B4, and B5 binding sites specifically recognize the hydrophobic residues in the V1 motif of VAMP-2. Interestingly, we identified a novel dual recognition mechanism employed by LC/D in recognition of VAMP-2 sites at both the active site and distal binding sites, in which one site of VAMP-2 was recognized by two independent, but functionally similar LC/D sites that were complementary to each other. The dual recognition strategy increases the tolerance of LC/D to mutations and renders it a good candidate for engineering to improve its therapeutic properties. In conclusion, in this study, we identified a unique multistep substrate recognition mechanism by LC/D and provide insights for LC/D engineering and antitoxin development."
https://openalex.org/W2071431093,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis PhoP, a master regulator involved in complex lipid biosynthesis and expression of unknown virulence determinants, is composed of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal effector domain. The two experimentally characterized PhoP orthologs, from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, display vastly different regulatory capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the 20-residue-long N-terminal arm unique to M. tuberculosis PhoP plays an essential role in the expanded regulatory capabilities of this important regulator. Although the arm is not required for overall structural stability and/or phosphorylation of the PhoP N-domain, strikingly it is essential for phosphorylation-coupled transcription regulation of target genes. Consistent with this view, arm truncation of PhoP is accompanied by a conformational change of the effector domain, presenting a block in activation subsequent to phosphorylation. These results suggest that presence of the arm, unique to this regulator that shares an otherwise highly conserved domain structure with members of the protein family, contributes to the mechanism of inter-domain interactions. Thus, we propose that the N-terminal arm is an adaptable structural feature of M. tuberculosis PhoP, which evolved to fine-tune regulatory capabilities of the transcription factor in response to the changing physiology of the bacilli within its host."
https://openalex.org/W1991466642,"A decrease in water activity was thought to result in smaller enthalpy change values during PPi hydrolysis, indicating the importance of solvation for the reaction. However, the physiological significance of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we combined biochemistry and calorimetry to solve this problem using NaCl, a physiologically occurring water activity-reducing reagent. The pyrophosphatase activities of extremely halophilic Haloarcula japonica, which can grow at ∼4 M NaCl, and non-halophilic Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were maximal at 2.0 and 0.1 M NaCl, respectively. Thus, halophilic and non-halophilic pyrophosphatases exhibit distinct maximal activities at different NaCl concentration ranges. Upon calorimetry, the same exothermic enthalpy change of -35 kJ/mol was obtained for the halophile and non-halophiles at 1.5-4.0 and 0.1-2.0 M NaCl, respectively. These results show that solvation changes caused by up to 4.0 M NaCl (water activity of ∼0.84) do not affect the enthalpy change in PPi hydrolysis. It has been postulated that PPi is an ATP analog, having a so-called high energy phosphate bond, and that the hydrolysis of both compounds is enthalpically driven. Therefore, our results indicate that the hydrolysis of high energy phosphate compounds, which are responsible for biological energy conversion, is enthalpically driven within the physiological limits of NaCl."
https://openalex.org/W2055689395,"Thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) is an ubiquitous multi-functional regenerative peptide, related to many critical biological processes, with a dynamic and flexible conformation which may influence its functions and its subcellular distribution. For these reasons, the intracellular localization and trafficking of Tβ4 is still not completely defined and is still under investigation in in vivo as well as in vitro studies. In the current study we used HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line; cells growing in normal conditions with fetal bovine serum expressed high levels of Tβ4, restricted to the cytoplasm until 72 h. At 84 h, a diffuse Tβ4 cytoplasmic immunostaining shifted to a focal perinuclear and nuclear reactivity. In the absence of serum, nuclear reactivity was localized in small granules, evenly dispersed throughout the entire nuclear envelop, and was observed as earlier as at 48 h. Cytoplasmic immunostaining for Tβ4 in HepG2 cells under starvation appeared significantly lower at 48 h and decreased progressively at 72 and at 84 h. At these time points, the decrease in cytoplasmic staining was associated with a progressive increase in nuclear reactivity, suggesting a possible translocation of the peptide from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane. The normal immunocytochemical pattern was restored when culture cells submitted to starvation for 84 h received a new complete medium for 48 h. Mass spectrometry analysis, performed on the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of HepG2 growing with and without serum, showed that Tβ4 was detectable only in the cytosolic and not in the intranuclear fraction. These data suggest that Tβ4 is able to translocate from different cytoplasmic domains to the nuclear membrane and back, based on different stress conditions within the cell. The punctuate pattern of nuclear Tβ4 immunostaining associated with Tβ4 absence in the nucleoplasm suggest that this peptide might be localized in the nuclear pores, where it could regulate the pore permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2050137807,"The existing certificateless signcryption schemes were designed mainly based on the traditional public key cryptography, in which the security relies on the hard problems, such as factor decomposition and discrete logarithm. However, these problems will be easily solved by the quantum computing. So the existing certificateless signcryption schemes are vulnerable to the quantum attack. Multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC), which can resist the quantum attack, is one of the alternative solutions to guarantee the security of communications in the post-quantum age. Motivated by these concerns, we proposed a new construction of the certificateless multi-receiver signcryption scheme (CLMSC) based on MPKC. The new scheme inherits the security of MPKC, which can withstand the quantum attack. Multivariate quadratic polynomial operations, which have lower computation complexity than bilinear pairing operations, are employed in signcrypting a message for a certain number of receivers in our scheme. Security analysis shows that our scheme is a secure MPKC-based scheme. We proved its security under the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem and its unforgeability under the Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP) assumption in the random oracle model. The analysis results show that our scheme also has the security properties of non-repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, perfect backward secrecy and public verifiability. Compared with the existing schemes in terms of computation complexity and ciphertext length, our scheme is more efficient, which makes it suitable for terminals with low computation capacity like smart cards."
