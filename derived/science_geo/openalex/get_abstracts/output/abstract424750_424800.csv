In the case of cancer, tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation. Now, in a mouse model of melanoma, Peinado et al. report that exosomes derived from highly metastatic tumor cells can influence bone marrow cells, resulting in increased recruitment of provasculogenic bone marrow progenitors to sites of metastasis, increased primary tumor growth and metastatic spread. Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis. We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45−C-KITlow/+TIE2+ bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process."

https://openalex.org/W2082081720,"The extracellular, matrix-modifying enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) has recently been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, in particular to the stages of invasion and metastasis. In this report, we use cell lines expressing a catalytically inactive mutant form of LOX to show that catalytic activity is required for LOX-mediated effects on proliferation and invasion in both in vitro and in vivo models of CRC. Furthermore, we use rheology to measure the relative stiffness of modified collagen matrices and subcutaneous tumors, and show that LOX-induced collagen cross-linking results in stiffening of the matrix both in vitro and in vivo. We observe a strong association between matrix stiffness and activation of the FAK (focal adhesion kinase)/SRC-signaling pathway, with a stiffer environment resulting in increased FAK/SRC phosphorylation and a more proliferative and invasive phenotype. We are the first to show a direct relationship between LOX enzymatic activity and tissue stiffness, and to demonstrate a role for stiffness in driving CRC progression. Our findings provide significant evidence to suggest that therapeutic inhibition of LOX activity may provide a novel effective treatment option for patients with metastatic CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2076652911,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has a dual role in epithelial malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Attenuation of canonical TGF-β signaling enhances de novo tumor development, whereas TGF-β overexpression and signaling paradoxically promotes malignant progression. We recently observed that TGF-β-induced growth arrest response is attenuated, in association with aberrant activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor, which promotes malignant progression in HNSCC. However, what role cross-talk between components of the TGF-β and NF-κB pathways plays in altered activation of these pathways has not been established. Here, we show TGF-β receptor II and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) are predominantly expressed in a subset of HNSCC tumors with nuclear activation of NF-κB family member RELA (p65). Further, TGF-β1 treatment induced sequential phosphorylation of TAK1, IKK, IκBα and RELA in human HNSCC lines. TAK1 enhances TGF-β-induced NF-κB activation, as TAK1 siRNA knockdown decreased TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and RELA, degradation of IκBα, RELA nuclear translocation and DNA binding, and NF-κB-induced reporter and target gene transcription. Functionally, TAK1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Celastrol, a TAK1 inhibitor and anti-inflammatory compound used in traditional Chinese medicine, also decreased TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 and RELA, and suppressed basal, TGF-β1- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB reporter gene activity. Celastrol also inhibited cell proliferation, while increasing sub-G0 DNA fragmentation and Annexin V markers of apoptosis. Furthermore, TGF-β and RELA activation promoted SMAD7 expression. In turn, SMAD7 preferentially suppressed TGF-β-induced SMAD and NF-κB reporters when compared with constitutive or TNF-α-induced NF-κB reporter gene activation. Thus, cross-talk by TGF-β via TAK1 and NF-κB promotes the malignant phenotype of HNSCC. Moreover, NF-κB may contribute to the downstream attenuation of canonical TGF-β signaling through increased SMAD7 expression. Celastrol highlights the therapeutic potential of agents targeting TAK1 as a key node in this pro-oncogenic TGF-β-NF-κB signal pathway."

In mice with Nnt loss, higher levels of adrenocortical cell apoptosis and impaired glucocorticoid production were observed. NNT knockdown in a human adrenocortical cell line resulted in impaired redox potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Our results suggest that NNT may have a role in ROS detoxification in human adrenal glands."

HIV infection in the kidney induces NF-κB activation, leading to the production of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. In this study, we explored selective inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity by small molecule blocking NF-κB binding to the transcriptional cofactor BRD4, which is required for the assembly of the productive transcriptional complex comprising positive transcription elongation factor b and RNA polymerase II. We showed that our BET (Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain)-specific bromodomain inhibitor MS417, designed to block BRD4 binding to the acetylated NF-κB, effectively attenuates NF-κB transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes in kidney cells treated with TNFα or infected by HIV. MS417 ameliorates inflammation and kidney injury in HIV-1 transgenic mice, an animal model for HIVAN.

An urban epidemic.AIDS. 2007; 21: 2101-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear how HIV induces a variety of kidney diseases, inflammation is the major pathology seen in HIVAN. Tubulointerstitial inflammation, tubular dilatation with formation of microcysts, and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) are prominent findings in the kidney of HIVAN (5.D'Agati V.

Using gene expression analysis, Ross et al. (8.Ross M.J. Fan C. Ross M.D. Chu T.H. Shi Y. Kaufman L. Zhang W. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E.

The most prominent response of these cells to HIV-1 infection was the production of proinflammatory mediators, including chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. Many of these genes, as suggested by pathway analysis of the microarray data, are mediated by transcriptional activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). As a master transcription factor, NF-κB regulates expression of a host of cellular genes in immune response to infection (9.Huang B. Yang X.D. Zhou M.M. Ozato K. Chen L.F.

Xu S. The NF-κB activation pathways, emerging molecular targets for cancer prevention and therapy.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2010; 14: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Its proinflammatory activity contributes to the etiology and progression of many human diseases, including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and viral infection (11.Pasparakis M.

Shaping the nuclear action of NF-κB.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory response has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy (13.Rangan G. Wang Y. Harris D.

Role of ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 in epithelial apoptosis in renal disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NF-κB also interacts with HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in the kidney (18.Bruggeman L.A. Adler S.H. Klotman P.E. Nuclear factor-κB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in kidney. Implications for HIV-associated nephropathy.Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 2174-2181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of the proinflammatory activity of NF-κB may attenuate HIV-induced inflammation and kidney injury. Given its protective role in cell immune response to infection, however, a complete inhibition of NF-κB might lead to adverse effects. A selective and temporal inhibition of NF-κB activity would maximize its beneficial effects. It has been shown that NF-κB transcriptional activity is dependent upon its acetylation at lysine 310 and that Lys-310-acetylated NF-κB recruits the BET protein BRD4 in complex with positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb) (consisting of CDK9 and cyclin T1) and RNA polymerase II that together form a productive transcriptional machinery complex (9.Huang B. Yang X.D. Zhou M.M. Ozato K. Chen L.F. Brd4 coactivates transcriptional activation of NF-κB via specific binding to acetylated RelA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1375-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A recent study has reported that pharmacological treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages with a BET bromodomain inhibitor (BrDi) blocks the innate immune response gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (19.Nicodeme E. Jeffrey K.L. Schaefer U. Beinke S. Dewell S. Chung C.W. Chandwani R. Marazzi I. Wilson P. Coste H. White J. Kirilovsky J. Rice C.M. Lora J.M. Prinjha R.K. Lee K. Tarakhovsky A. Suppression of inflammation by a synthetic histone mimic.Nature. 2010; 468: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine how a BET-specific BrD inhibitor might influence NF-κB transcriptional activity in control of the expression of proinflammatory genes in HIV-infected kidney cells and whether and how BrDi might attenuate kidney injury in HIV-1 transgenic mice (Tg26), which is an established animal model for HIVAN. Our study shows that BET bromodomain inhibition could represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating patients with HIVAN. Expression and purification of the recombinant bromodomains from ASH1L, ATAD2, BAZ1B, BAZ2B, BPTF, BRD3, BRD4, BRD7, CBP, PCAF, PHIP-1, TAF1, TAF1L, and SMARCA4 in poly-His tag form were performed using a procedure described previously (20.Zeng L. Zhang Q. Gerona-Navarro G. Moshkina N. Zhou M.M.

Isotope-labeled protein samples of the BrDs were prepared from cells grown on a minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl with or without 13C6-glucose in either H2O or 75% 2H2O. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-IDA column (Invitrogen), followed by the removal of poly-His tag by thrombin cleavage. The NMR data collection, analysis, and structure determination of the BRD4-BD2·NF-κB-K310ac peptide complex were performed using the procedures previously reported (20.Zeng L. Zhang Q. Gerona-Navarro G. Moshkina N. Zhou M.M.

Briefly, NMR samples contained a protein·ligand complex of 0.5 mm in a 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, that contains 5 mm perdeuterated DTT and 0.5 mm EDTA in H2O/2H2O (9:1) or 2H2O. All NMR spectra were collected at 30 °C on NMR spectrometers of 800, 600, or 500 MHz. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of a protein of the complex were assigned by triple-resonance NMR spectra collected with a 13C/15N-labeled and 75% deuterated protein bound to an unlabeled ligand (21.Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Multidimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance of proteins.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The distance restraints were obtained in three-dimensional 13C or 15N NOESY spectra. Slowly exchanging amides, identified in two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra recorded after an H2O buffer was changed to a 2H2O buffer, were used with structures calculated with only NOE distance restraints to generate hydrogen bond restraints for final structure calculations. The intermolecular NOEs were detected in the 13C-edited (F1), 13C/15N-filtered (F3) three-dimensional NOESY spectrum. Protein structures were calculated with a distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol with X-PLOR (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Crystallography & NMR system. A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). Initial structure calculations were performed with manually assigned NOE-derived distance restraints. Hydrogen bond distance restraints, generated from the hydrogen/deuterium exchange data, were added at a later stage of structure calculations for residues with characteristic NOEs. The converged structures were used for iterative automated NOE assignment by ARIA for refinement (23.Nilges M. O'Donoghue S. Ambiguous NOEs and automated NOE assignment.Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Structure quality was assessed by Procheck-NMR (24.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR. Programs for checking the quality of protein structures solved by NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). The structure of the protein·ligand complex was determined using intermolecular NOE-derived distance restraints. Experiments were carried out on a GE MicroCal auto-ITC200 instrument at 15 °C while stirring at 1,000 rpm in the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) buffer, pH 7.4, consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm sodium chloride. Compound concentration was determined by NMR, and protein concentrations were determined by A280 measurements. The compound sample (40–50 μm) was placed in the cell, whereas the microsyringe (130 μl) was loaded with a solution of the correspondent protein sample (0.6 μm) in the ITC buffer. Injections were performed using protein in the syringe rather than the compound to overcome limitations of compound solubility. All titrations were conducted using 20 identical injections of 2 μl with a duration of 4 s/injection and a spacing of 150 s between injections. The heat of dilution was determined by independent titrations (protein into buffer) and was subtracted from the experimental data. The collected data were implicated in the MicroCalTM Origin software supplied with the instrument to yield enthalpies of binding (ΔH) and binding constants (KB). Thermodynamic parameters were calculated (ΔG = ΔH − TΔS = −RTlnKB, where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively). In all cases, a single binding site model was employed. The dissociation constant, Kd, for various BrD proteins to a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled MS417 (named as MS574, or compound 9; see Schemes 1 and 2 in supplemental Materials and Methods) was measured in direct binding experiments using fluorescence anisotropy as a readout. The fluorescence anisotropy assay was carried out in polypropylene 96-well plates (Costar) with 80 nm FITC-MS417 and varying concentrations of a BrD protein in a PBS buffer (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 80 μl. Measurements were obtained after a 1-h incubation of the fluorescent ligand and the protein at 25 °C with a Safire 2 microplate reader (Tecan). The dissociation constant was determined by using the following one-site model equation using Prism software, Fb=(Kd+PT+LT)-(Kd+PT+LT)2-4PTLT2LTEq. 1 where Fb represents the fraction of bound labeled ligand, Kd is the dissociation constant, PT is total protein concentration, and LT is total fluorescent ligand concentration. Competition experiments were performed with a BrD protein (0.25–1 μm) and the fluorescent probe (80 nm) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competing ligand. In a competition-binding assay, fluorescent ligand concentration was ≤2Kd, and protein concentration was set at which 50–80% of fluorescent ligand is bound. Dissociation constant of a competing ligand was calculated with the correction to the Cheng-Prussoff equation introduced by Nicolovska-Coleska et al. (25.Nikolovska-Coleska Z. Wang R. Fang X. Pan H. Tomita Y. Li P. Roller P.P. Krajewski K. Saito N.G. Stuckey J.A. Wang S. Development and optimization of a binding assay for the XIAP BIR3 domain using fluorescence polarization.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Assuming a one-site competitive binding model, the following equation was used to calculate Ki values from IC50 values recovered from fitting data using Prism, Ki=[I50][L50]Kd+[P0]Kd+1Eq. 2 where [I50] represents the concentration of free inhibitor at 50% inhibition, [L50] is the concentration of free labeled ligand at 50% inhibition, and [P0] is the concentration of free protein at 0% inhibition. Note that Kd for each protein-probe pair is the limit of resolvable Ki in a competition assay. Purified BRD4-BD1 protein (16 mg/ml) was mixed with MS417 at a 1:10 molar ratio of protein/ligand. The complex was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of the reservoir solution that contains 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals were soaked in the corresponding mother liquor supplemented with 20% ethylene glycerol as cryoprotectant before freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline X6A of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using the HKL-2000 suite (26.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). The BRD4-BD1 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (27.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. MOLREP. An automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4148) Google Scholar), and the structure refinement was done using the program Refmac (28.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

Primary human RTECs were obtained from Promocell and cultured according to the manufacturer's protocol. RTECs were incubated with either MS417 or DMSO (0.1%) as the control. Cells were also stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) to determine NF-κB activation. Cells were also infected with HIV or control vector as described below. For HIV infection, pNL4–3ΔG/P-EGFP, a gag/pol-deleted HIV-1 construct that contains EGFP in the gag open reading frame (HIV vector), and pHR′-IRES-EGFP (GFP control vector) were used to generate vesicular stomatitis virus-G-pseudotyped virus for infection of RTECs as described previously (8.Ross M.J. Fan C. Ross M.D. Chu T.H. Shi Y. Kaufman L. Zhang W. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. HIV-1 infection initiates an inflammatory cascade in human renal tubular epithelial cells.J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2006; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RTECs or kidney tissues were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, a protease inhibitor mixture (Fisher 78443), and acetylation inhibitors of 10 μm trichostatin A (Sigma T1952) and 5 mm nicotinamide (Sigma 72340). After protein concentration determination, protein lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using specific antibodies for acetylated p65 or total p65 (Cell Signaling 3045). β-Actin (Sigma) was used as the control. Western blot was also performed for HIV Nef (Abcam 42355) in RTECs and kidney tissues of mice. The PGL-2 reporter vector containing the promoter of NF-κB or ISRE (gifts from Dr. Huabao Xiong) was used. 293T cells were transfected with luciferase expression plasmids (1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed and cultured in serum-free medium containing TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cells were then lysed in luciferase assay buffer (Promega luciferase assay system). Luciferase was measured in a luminometer, and the data were analyzed after normalization for protein amount. The PCR array for the Inflammatory Cytokines & Receptors PCR Array (PAHS-011, Qiagen) was used to examine the expression of NF-κB target genes. Human RETCs were treated with MS417 at the indicated concentrations for 24 h, and total RNA was extracted. PCR arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. -Fold changes for each gene were calculated by the 2−ΔΔCT method compared with GADPH. Human RTECs were infected with HIV pseudotyped virus or control vector with GFP for 4 days and then treated with either DMSO or MS417 at 1.0 μm for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Affymetrix gene expression microarrays were performed at the Mount Sinai Microarray Core Facility. Data were analyzed by t test controlled with false discovery rate, n = 3. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. The unpaired t test was used to analyze data between two groups. Statistical significance was considered to be when p was <0.05. The raw intensity data were normalized across the chips by the log scale robust multiarray analysis (RMA) method (30.Irizarry R.A.

Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data.Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8472) Google Scholar), and the quality control of each chip data was performed by investigating overall intensity values for all probes and negative and positive controls. The probe sets with low intensity values or outliers due to poor RNA quality or hybridization were excluded for further analysis. Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM, version 2.1) (32.Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9768) Google Scholar) was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between groups (i.e. untreated versus BrD inhibitor-treated groups). SAM, a widely used microarray differential analysis tool, correlates gene expression data to a wide variety of clinical parameters and uses permutation to estimate the false discovery rate for multiple testing. The cut-off of the false discovery rate q value of 0.05 was applied to determine differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes were queried against a well curated and experimentally verified NF-κB target database (see the Boston University Biology Web site) to identify NF-κB targets whose transcriptional expression was altered by HIV infection or the BrD inhibitor. The enrichment significance of NF-κB targets was calculated by comparing the percentage of NF-κB targets in differentially expressed gene with that of NF-κB targets in the whole gene list using Fisher's exact test. To understand how other genes were regulated by NF-κB targets upon HIV infection and BrDi, the genes that were up-regulated by HIV and subsequently down-regulated by BrDi or vice versa were identified and then subjected to association network analysis with the NF-κB target by the Ingenuity System (available on the World Wide Web). The significant biological functions of these genes were also determined by DAVID (33.Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. DAVID. Database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human RTECs were infected with HIV or GFP control vector for 72 h. The cells were then starved for 6 h and treated with DMSO or MS417 at 1 μm for 24 h in serum-free medium. Genomic DNA was precipitated, and ChIP was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore). The following antibodies from Cell Signaling were used: anti-H3K9ac, anti-H3K18ac, anti-H3K4me3, and anti-H3K27me3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real-time PCR using the following primer sequences: CCL2-F, 5′-CCGGCCAAAGCTTGAGAGCTCC-3′; CCL2-R, 5′-GTCAGGCTCGCTGCCAGCTTAC-3′; CCL20-F, 5′-CCCCATGTGGCAACACGCCTT-3′; CCL20-R, 5′-GTACACAGAAGGCGTGTTGCCACAT-3′; CXCL5-F, 5′-CACCCTCCCCACCAGTTCCCA-3′; CXCL5-R, 5′-CTCATCTCTCCCCACTGACAGGAA-3′; TGM2-F, 5′-GCCGCCGTCCCTCCCTCGGG-3′; TGM2-R, 5′-AGCCCGCTTTGGGGCGG-3′. All experiments were repeated three times. -Fold changes to the control are shown. As a well established transgenic model of HIV-associated nephropathy, the HIV-1 transgenic mouse (Tg26) bears a replication-defective form of the HIV-1 provirus lacking 3 kilobases of sequence overlapping the gag and pol sequences. The transgene is under the control of the viral LTR promoter and is expressed in most tissues (34.Dickie P. Felser J. Eckhaus M. Bryant J. Silver J. Marinos N. Notkins A.L. HIV-associated nephropathy in transgenic mice expressing HIV-1 genes.Virology. 1991; 185: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The Tg26 line is maintained as a heterozygous line as homozygous mice die prior to the age of breeding. Heterozygous mice appeared normal at birth but then develop wasting, heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia between 4 and 8 months of age based on different penetration. Blood urea nitrogen is significantly elevated in these mice, and mice die probably from uremia (35.Kopp J.B. Klotman M.E. Adler S.H. Bruggeman L.A. Dickie P. Marinos N.J. Eckhaus M. Bryant J.L.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 1577-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Pathologically, kidneys from animals with renal failure demonstrate diffuse segmental and global glomerulosclerosis, microcystic tubular dilatation with a monocytic interstitial infiltrate, and minimal interstitial fibrosis remarkably similar to HIVAN (35.Kopp J.B.

However, these animals do not exhibit any other organ damage. For the in vivo animal model study, Tg26 mice and their corresponding littermates (n = 6/group, including three male and three female mice in each group) were fed with either control vehicle (DMSO) or MS417 by daily gavage at a concentration of 0.08 mg/kg. The mice were fed with this compound daily from the age of 4 weeks to 8 weeks. Unrestricted food and water were provided throughout the duration of the experiment.

IMAGe syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies. IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) is an undergrowth developmental disorder with life-threatening consequences1. An identity-by-descent analysis in a family with IMAGe syndrome2 identified a 17.2-Mb locus on chromosome 11p15 that segregated in the affected family members. Targeted exon array capture of the disease locus, followed by high-throughput genomic sequencing and validation by dideoxy sequencing, identified missense mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN1C (also known as P57KIP2) in two familial and four unrelated patients. A familial analysis showed an imprinted mode of inheritance in which only maternal transmission of the mutation resulted in IMAGe syndrome. CDKN1C inhibits cell-cycle progression3, and we found that targeted expression of IMAGe-associated CDKN1C mutations in Drosophila caused severe eye growth defects compared to wild-type CDKN1C, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. All IMAGe-associated mutations clustered in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN1C and resulted in loss of PCNA binding, distinguishing them from the mutations of CDKN1C that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome4."
https://openalex.org/W1972331061,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma(1), a highly vascularized tumor originating from lymphatic endothelial cells, and of at least two different B cell malignancies(2,3). A dimeric complex formed by the envelope glycoproteins H and L (gH-gL) is required for entry of herpesviruses into host cells(4). We show that the ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) is a cellular receptor for KSHV gH-gL. EphA2 co-precipitated with both gH-gL and KSHV virions. Infection of human epithelial cells with a GFP-expressing recombinant KSHV strain, as measured by FACS analysis, was increased upon overexpression of EphA2. Antibodies against EphA(2) and siRNAs directed against EphA2 inhibited infection of endothelial cells. Pretreatment of KSHV with soluble EphA2 resulted in inhibition of KSHV infection by up to 90%. This marked reduction of KSHV infection was seen with all the different epithelial and endothelial cells used in this study. Similarly, pretreating epithelial or endothelial cells with the soluble EphA2 ligand ephrinA4 impaired KSHV infection. Deletion of the gene encoding EphA2 essentially abolished KSHV infection of mouse endothelial cells. Binding of gH-gL to EphA2 triggered EphA2 phosphorylation and endocytosis, a major pathway of KSHV entry(5,6). Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ histochemistry revealed a close correlation between KSHV infection and EphA2 expression both in cultured cells derived from human Kaposi's sarcoma lesions or unaffected human lymphatic endothelium, and in situ in Kaposi's sarcoma specimens, respectively. Taken together, our results identify EphA2, a tyrosine kinase with known functions in neovascularization and oncogenesis, as an entry receptor for KSHV."
https://openalex.org/W2004389897,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been reported to protect cells from stress-induced cell death before and after its secretion; however, the conditions under which it is secreted are not known. Accordingly, we examined the mechanism of MANF release from cultured ventricular myocytes and HeLa cells, both of which secrete proteins via the constitutive pathway. Although the secretion of proteins via the constitutive pathway is not known to increase upon changes in intracellular calcium, MANF secretion was increased within 30 min of treating cells with compounds that deplete sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/ER calcium. In contrast, secretion of atrial natriuretic factor from ventricular myocytes was not increased by SR/ER calcium depletion, suggesting that not all secreted proteins exhibit the same characteristics as MANF. We postulated that SR/ER calcium depletion triggered MANF secretion by decreasing its retention. Consistent with this were co-immunoprecipitation and live cell, zero distance, photo affinity cross-linking, demonstrating that, in part, MANF was retained in the SR/ER via its calcium-dependent interaction with the SR/ER-resident protein, GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa). This unusual mechanism of regulating secretion from the constitutive secretory pathway provides a potentially missing link in the mechanism by which extracellular MANF protects cells from stresses that deplete SR/ER calcium. Consistent with this was our finding that administration of recombinant MANF to mice decreased tissue damage in an in vivo model of myocardial infarction, a condition during which ER calcium is known to be dysregulated, and MANF expression is induced."
https://openalex.org/W2058333064,"The usefulness of genetically encoded probes for optical monitoring of neuronal activity and brain circuits would be greatly advanced by the generation of multiple indicators with non-overlapping color spectra. Most existing indicators are derived from or spectrally convergent on GFP. We generated a bright, red, pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, pHTomato, that can be used in parallel with green probes to monitor neuronal activity. SypHTomato, made by fusing pHTomato to the vesicular membrane protein synaptophysin, reported activity-dependent exocytosis as efficiently as green reporters. When expressed with the GFP-based indicator GCaMP3 in the same neuron, sypHTomato enabled concomitant imaging of transmitter release and presynaptic Ca(2+) transients at single nerve terminals. Expressing sypHTomato and GCaMP3 in separate cells enabled the simultaneous determination of presynaptic vesicular turnover and postsynaptic sub- and supra-threshold responses from a connected pair of neurons. With these new tools, we observed a close size matching between pre- and postsynaptic compartments, as well as interesting target cell-dependent regulation of presynaptic vesicle pools. Lastly, by coupling expression of pHTomato- and GFP-based probes with distinct variants of channelrhodopsin, we provided proof-of-principle for an all-optical approach to multiplex control and tracking of distinct circuit pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2042912415,"A computational screen identifies a small-molecule activator of proapoptotic BAX that selectively binds to the BAX trigger site, inducing characteristic conformational changes, oligomerization and BAX-dependent cell death. BCL-2 family proteins are key regulators of the apoptotic pathway. Antiapoptotic members sequester the BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) death domains of proapoptotic members such as BAX to maintain cell survival. The antiapoptotic BH3-binding groove has been successfully targeted to reactivate apoptosis in cancer. We recently identified a geographically distinct BH3-binding groove that mediates direct BAX activation, suggesting a new strategy for inducing apoptosis by flipping BAX's 'on switch'. Here we applied computational screening to identify a BAX activator molecule that directly and selectively activates BAX. We demonstrate by NMR and biochemical analyses that the molecule engages the BAX trigger site and promotes the functional oligomerization of BAX. The molecule does not interact with the BH3-binding pocket of antiapoptotic proteins or proapoptotic BAK and induces cell death in a BAX-dependent fashion. To our knowledge, we report the first gain-of-function molecular modulator of a BCL-2 family protein and demonstrate a new paradigm for pharmacologic induction of apoptosis."

Here we introduce a new vaccine platform that uses hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to inactivate viruses for vaccine production. H(2)O(2) rapidly inactivates both RNA and DNA viruses with minimal damage to antigenic structure or immunogenicity and is a highly effective method when compared with conventional vaccine inactivation approaches such as formaldehyde or β-propiolactone. Mice immunized with H(2)O(2)-inactivated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) generated cytolytic, multifunctional virus-specific CD8(+) T cells that conferred protection against chronic LCMV infection. Likewise, mice vaccinated with H(2)O(2)-inactivated vaccinia virus or H(2)O(2)-inactivated West Nile virus showed high virus-specific neutralizing antibody titers and were fully protected against lethal challenge. Together, these studies demonstrate that H(2)O(2)-based vaccines are highly immunogenic, provide protection against a range of viral pathogens in mice and represent a promising new approach to future vaccine development."

A decade of molecular biology of retinoic acid receptors.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). To support retinoid-dependent processes in tissues, mammals have evolved two major transport systems to distribute and store vitamin A (3D'Ambrosio D.N. Clugston R.D. Blaner W.S. Vitamin A metabolism. An update.Nutrients. 2011; 3: 63-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).

Mice provided regular chow with ad libitum access to food and water were maintained at 24 °C in a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. For dietary vitamin A experiments, 8-week-old wild mice were provided either a vitamin A-sufficient (4,000 IU of vitamin A/kg) or a vitamin A-free diet for 20 weeks with diets prepared by Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ). All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committee and conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. RBP expression and purification from Escherichia coli was accomplished essentially as described previously (21Golczak M. Maeda A. Bereta G. Maeda T. Kiser P.D. Hunzelmann S. von Lintig J. Blaner W.S.

Briefly, human RBP (hRBP) cDNA was cloned into a pET3a expression vector and expressed in BL-21 DE3 cells according to a standard protocol. Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by osmotic shock. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and solubilized in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After overnight incubation, insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was used for the hRBP refolding procedure. hRBP was refolded by the dropwise addition of solubilized material into a mixture containing 150 μCi of [11,12-3H]ROL ([3H]ROL) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and non-radiolabeled ROL (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 mm. Refolded holo-hRBP was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a DE53 anion exchange chromatography column (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Holo-hRBP was eluted with linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Collected fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy to ensure a proper protein/retinoid ratio. Fractions containing at least 90% holo-hRBP were pooled together and concentrated in a Centricon centrifugal filter device (cut-off 10,000 Da) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to 5 mg/ml. [3H]ROL was quantified in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Holo-hRBP aliquots were stored at −80 °C until used. Holo-hRBP (100 μl containing 0.4 μCi of [3H]ROL and 5 nmol of non-radiolabeled ROL) was intraperitoneally injected into wild type and Lrat−/− mice. After injection, mice were sacrificed at different time points (1, 2, 3, and 6 h), and tissue and blood were harvested. Serum (100 μl) and either one eye or tissue (10 mg) from lung, kidney, or adipose tissue homogenized in 100 μl of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) was mixed with 5 ml of scintilliation mixture (Opti-Fluor, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and [3H]ROL content was quantified in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). At 8:00 a.m., a small blood sample was collected from the tail vein of each animal to determine the RBP level at the time point (t = 0) and kept on ice until serum separation. Immediately thereafter, mice were gavaged with 30 mg/kg body weight of either fenretinide (Toronto Research Chemicals), A1120 (Sigma), or ATRA (Sigma) dissolved in 200 μl of canola oil with the same volume of canola oil used as a vehicle control. Tail vein blood samples were collected at 4, 8, and 24 h after treatment. Mice then were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 100 mm NaCl, and blood was drawn directly from the heart after snipping the right atrium. Then mice were perfused with 10 ml of PBS and killed by cervical dislocation. Liver, kidney, lung, eyes, and gonadal adipose tissue were dissected out, weighed, and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80 °C until further use. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. When cells reached confluence, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS. Then cells were preincubated for 30 min in DMEM containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 20 μg/ml cyclohexamide (Sigma). ATRA (Sigma) dissolved in ethanol was added to the medium at a final concentration of 2 μm, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Then ROL was added at a final concentration of 2 μm, and cells were incubated for an additional 1 h. Ethanol only (0.1%, v/v) was used as the vehicle controls. Cells and medium were harvested and frozen separately at −80 °C until further analysis. All tissue samples were homogenized in M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, Marietta, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. For RBP determinations in liver, 20 μg of total protein was used. To determine RBP serum levels, 2 μl of serum was diluted with 40 μl of PBS containing Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 4 μl of this solution was used for immunoblot analysis. To quantify RBP protein levels in HepG2 cells, 10–20 μg of total protein cell lysate and 50 μl of cell-free medium were subjected to immunoblot analyses. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). For LRAT and CRBP1 determinations in liver, lung, and adipose tissue, 10–30 μg of total protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Membranes then were blocked with fat-free milk powder (5%, w/v) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (15 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.01% Tween 100 (TBS-T), washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. For RBP detection, a rabbit anti-human RBP serum (DakoCytomation, Denmark) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. For CRBP1 detection, a polyclonal rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was employed at a 1:2000 dilution. For LRAT detection, a non-commercial anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2000 (19Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N.

Either β-actin antiserum (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000 or Ponceau S staining solution (Boston BioProducts, Ashland, MA) served as a loading control for total protein visualization. Secondary antibodies employed were either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI) or anti-mouse IgG (Promega) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (GE Healthcare). Quantification of scanned immunoblot single bands was performed with ImageJ software. Total mRNA isolation was carried out with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and purity was measured with a Nano-drop spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Thermo Scientific). The Applied BioSystems retrotranscription kit (Applied BioSystems, Carlsbad, CA) was employed to reverse transcribe 1 μg of total RNA to cDNA. qRT-PCR was carried out with TaqMan probes (Applied BioSystems) for Cyp26a1 (Mm00514486_m1), Stra6 (Mm00486457_m1), Lrat (Mm00469972_m1), and RBP (Mn00803266_m1). β-Actin (Mm01205647_g1) and 18S rRNA (4319413E) probe sets were used as endogenous controls. All real-time experiments were done with an ABI Step-One Plus qRT-PCR instrument (Applied BioSystems). Non-polar retinoids were extracted from either 70–100 μl of serum or 30 mg of tissue under a dim red safety light as described previously (22Hessel S. Eichinger A. Isken A. Amengual J. Hunzelmann S.

The organic phase was removed, and the extraction was repeated with 500 μl of hexanes. Then the collected organic phases were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The residue was dissolved in 200 μl of HPLC solvent (hexane/ethyl acetate, 90:10, v/v). HPLC was performed with a normal phase Zobax Sil (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Isocratic chromatographic separation was achieved with 10% ethyl acetate/hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. For quantification of retinoids, the HPLC was scaled previously with the pattern compound ROL and RE (Sigma). Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences derived from either the two-way ANOVA or two-tailed Student's t test were analyzed by SPSS 14.0 for windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL), with the threshold of significance set at p < 0.05. Previous cell culture studies implicated LRAT in the uptake of vitamin A from holo-RBP (12Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H.

To analyze the role of LRAT for this process in vivo, we devised a method to measure cellular vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP in mice. It had been shown that human RBP can substitute for blood ROL transport in Rbp−/− mice (9Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V.

Thus, we produced recombinant human holo-RBP and injected it intraperitoneally into mice. Endogenous mouse and recombinant human RBPs showed slightly different eletrophoretic mobility when serum samples were fractionated in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A). 1 h after administration, hRBP was detectable in the circulation, demonstrating that it was absorbed and transported in the blood stream, but after 24 h, TTR-unbound hRBP was completely cleared from circulation by glomerular filtration (Fig. 1A). To follow the metabolic fate of ROL bound to RBP, we loaded recombinant human RBP with [3H]ROL. Both Lrat−/− and wild type mice were injected intraperitoneally with a [3H]ROL/hRBP solution corresponding to 0.4 μCi. We then measured levels of [3H]ROL in the serum and tissues of mice at different time points after injection. Both Lrat−/− and wild type mice showed a transient increase of [3H]ROL in the serum that decreased with time (Fig. 1B). Although analysis of the lung and eyes of wild type mice demonstrated a significant uptake of [3H]ROL over time (Fig. 1, C and D), the lungs and eyes of Lrat−/− mice showed no such uptake (Fig. 1, C and D). We also measured [3H]ROL uptake in white adipose tissue that lacks Lrat expression (8O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. Retinoid absorption and storage is impaired in mice lacking lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT).J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed that [3H]ROL was detectable in adipose tissue of both genotypes, reaching a maximum after 2 h; by 6 h, [3H]ROL had decreased in the fat of both genotypes (Fig. 1E). We also determined [3H]ROL in the kidneys of these animals. Again, [3H]ROL levels increased, reached a maximum at about 2 h, and then decreased with time in both genotypes (Fig. 1F). To determine the chemical form of [3H]ROL that accumulated in tissues, we extracted non-polar retinoids from the lungs and kidneys of both Lrat−/− and wild type mice. Retinoids were separated by HPLC, and the flow-through was collected every 2 min (Fig. 2A). Collected samples were dried and analyzed in a scintillation counter (Fig. 2, B and C). About 90% of [3H]ROL detected in the lung of wild type mice eluted in the RE fraction (Fig. 2B), indicating that most of the [3H]ROL absorbed by this tissue was esterified. No such accumulation of [3H]ROL in the RE fraction was noted in Lrat−/− mice. In wild type mice, some [3H]ROL was detected as RE in the kidneys as well (Fig. 2C), but most of the injected [3H]ROL (75% in wild type and 95% in Lrat−/− mice) remained unchanged as free non-esterified ROL, probably reflecting the clearance of TTR-unbound hRBP from the circulation by glomerular filtration. We found that wild type but not Lrat−/− mice accumulated [3H]ROL from hRBP in the lung and eyes. To exclude the possibility that these differences were caused by alterations in ROL serum levels and/or Stra6 mRNA levels, we compared age- and sex-matched mice. No significant changes in ROL blood levels were observed between these two genotypes (Fig. 2D). Moreover, Stra6 mRNA levels in the lung and the eyes were comparable (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, Lrat−/− mice displayed significantly elevated Stra6 mRNA levels in white adipose tissue (Fig. 2E). In cell culture studies, CRBP1 has been implicated in STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake (16Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Ter-Stepanian M. Zhong M. Cheng G. Yuan Q. Jin M. Travis G.H. Ong D. Sun H. Receptor-mediated cellular uptake mechanism that couples to intracellular storage.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Lrat−/− mice showed elevated CRBP1 protein in the liver, lung, and adipose tissue as compared with wild type control animals (Fig. 2F). Because [3H]ROL did not accumulate in the eyes and lungs of Lrat−/− mice and Stra6 was expressed in these tissues, we conclude that CRBP1 alone cannot significantly enhance STRA6-mediated ROL uptake in the absence of LRAT. Our analyses revealed that LRAT is critical for cellular ROL uptake from circulating holo-RBP by the lungs and eyes of mice. However, the coupling of STRA6 with LRAT may also contribute to the regulation of blood vitamin A homeostasis because both proteins are encoded by ATRA-regulated genes (13Bouillet P. Sapin V.

https://openalex.org/W2082392117,"Exotoxin Y (ExoY) is a type III secretion system effector found in ~ 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Although it is known that ExoY causes inter-endothelial gaps and vascular leak, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Using both a bacteria-delivered and a codon-optimized conditionally expressed ExoY, we report that this toxin is a dual soluble adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase that results in intracellular cAMP and cGMP accumulation. The enzymatic activity of ExoY caused phosphorylation of endothelial Tau serine 214, accumulation of insoluble Tau, inter-endothelial cell gap formation, and increased macromolecular permeability. To discern whether the cAMP or cGMP signal was responsible for Tau phosphorylation and barrier disruption, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were engineered for the conditional expression of either wild-type guanylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cGMP, or a mutated guanylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP. Sodium nitroprusside stimulation of the cGMP-generating cyclase resulted in transient Tau serine 214 phosphorylation and gap formation, whereas stimulation of the cAMP-generating cyclase induced a robust increase in Tau serine 214 phosphorylation, gap formation, and macromolecular permeability. These results indicate that the cAMP signal is the dominant stimulus for Tau phosphorylation. Hence, ExoY is a promiscuous cyclase and edema factor that uses cAMP and, to some extent, cGMP to induce the hyperphosphorylation and insolubility of endothelial Tau. Because hyperphosphorylated and insoluble Tau are hallmarks in neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease, acute Pseudomonas infections cause a pathophysiological sequela in endothelium previously recognized only in chronic neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2061020520,"Resistance to imatinib (IM) and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)s is an increasing problem in leukemias caused by expression of BCR-ABL1. As chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines expressing BCR-ABL1 utilize an alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway (ALT NHEJ) to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s, we asked whether this repair pathway is a novel therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease. Notably, the steady state levels of two ALT NHEJ proteins, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and DNA ligase IIIα, were increased in the BCR-ABL1-positive CML cell line K562 and, to a greater extent, in its imatinib-resistant (IMR) derivative. Incubation of these cell lines with a combination of DNA ligase and PARP inhibitors inhibited ALT NHEJ and selectively decreased survival with the effect being greater in the IMR derivative. Similar results were obtained with TKI-resistant derivatives of two hematopoietic cell lines that had been engineered to stably express BCR-ABL1. Together our results show that the sensitivity of cell lines expressing BCR-ABL1 to the combination of DNA ligase and PARP inhibitors correlates with the steady state levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIα, and ALT NHEJ activity. Importantly, analysis of clinical samples from CML patients confirmed that the expression levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIα correlated with the sensitivity to the DNA repair inhibitor combination. Thus, the expression levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIα serve as biomarkers to identify a subgroup of CML patients who may be candidates for therapies that target the ALT NHEJ pathway when treatment with TKIs has failed."
https://openalex.org/W2120164696,"Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of medically important Leishmania. The Leishmania protozoa reside in the sand fly gut, but the nature of the immune response to the presence of Leishmania is unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a major component of insect innate immune pathways regulating gut-microbe homeostasis. Here we show that the concentration of ROS increased in sand fly midguts after they fed on the insect pathogen Serratia marcescens but not after feeding on the Leishmania that uses the sand fly as a vector. Moreover, the Leishmania is sensitive to ROS either by oral administration of ROS to the infected fly or by silencing a gene that expresses a sand fly ROS-scavenging enzyme. Finally, the treatment of sand flies with an exogenous ROS scavenger (uric acid) altered the gut microbial homeostasis, led to an increased commensal gut microbiota, and reduced insect survival after oral infection with S. marcescens. Our study demonstrates a differential response of the sand fly ROS system to gut microbiota, an insect pathogen, and the Leishmania that utilize the sand fly as a vehicle for transmission between mammalian hosts."

Given that E2 increases astrocytic expression of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), which would prevent excitotoxic-induced neuronal death, we proposed that GPR30 mediates E2 action on GLT-1 expression. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the effects of G1, a selective agonist of GPR30, and GPR30 siRNA on astrocytic GLT-1 expression, as well as glutamate uptake in rat primary astrocytes, and explored potential signaling pathways linking GPR30 to GLT-1. G1 increased GLT-1 protein and mRNA levels, subject to regulation by both MAPK and PI3K signaling. Inhibition of TGF-α receptor suppressed the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 expression. Silencing GPR30 reduced the expression of both GLT-1 and TGF-α and abrogated the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 expression. Moreover, the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 protein expression was abolished by a protein kinase A inhibitor and an NF-κB inhibitor. G1 also enhanced cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), as well as both NF-κB p50 and NF-κB p65 binding to the GLT-1 promoter. Finally, to model dysfunction of glutamate transporters, manganese was used, and G1 was found to attenuate manganese-induced impairment in GLT-1 protein expression and glutamate uptake. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that activation of GPR30 increases GLT-1 expression via multiple pathways, suggesting that GPR30 is worthwhile as a potential target to be explored for developing therapeutics of excitotoxic neuronal injury.

GPR30, a G protein-coupled receptor, mediates the biological effects of E2, predominantly via membrane-associated activation of intracellular signaling pathways linked to growth factor receptors (8Carmeci C. Thompson D.A. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Weigel R.J. Identification of a gene (GPR30) with homology to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily associated with estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer.Genomics. 1997; 45: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Upon binding to GPR30, E2 transactivates EGF receptor (EGFR) followed by ERK1/2 activation (6Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Bland K.I. Frackelton Jr., A.R.

Although E2 is neuroprotective in various experimental and clinical studies (14DonCarlos L.L. Azcoitia I. Garcia-Segura L.M. Neuroprotective actions of selective estrogen receptor modulators.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2009; 34: S113-S122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), its long term clinical utility is hampered by elevated risk for breast and uterine cancers because of its action on genomic nuclear ERs. Thus, development of alternative therapeutics has been of intense interest. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, have shown neuroprotection in various experimental models (14DonCarlos L.L. Azcoitia I. Garcia-Segura L.M. Neuroprotective actions of selective estrogen receptor modulators.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2009; 34: S113-S122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One candidate is G1, which selectively activates GPR30, thus avoiding these risks; GPR30 has also been implicated in neuroprotection in several experimental models, promoting neuron survival upon global ischemia (15Lebesgue D.

Because GLT-1 plays an essential role in removing excess extracellular glutamate (28Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Kuncl R.W. Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Wang Y. Schielke J.P. Welty D.F. Knockout of glutamate transporters reveals a major role for astroglial transport in excitotoxicity and clearance of glutamate.Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar), impairment in GLT-1 function is associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease (29Sims K.D. Robinson M.B. Expression patterns and regulation of glutamate transporters in the developing and adult nervous system.Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 169-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhancing GLT-1 expression may offer a pertinent strategy for the treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration accompanying excitotoxic insults. Although the gene for GLT-1 has been identified, the promoter elements of GLT-1 (EAAT2 in human) have not been fully characterized, and the mechanisms regulating their expression remain to be established. EGFR agonists have been implicated in the regulation of GLT-1 expression (30Zelenaia O. Schlag B.D. Gochenauer G.E. Ganel R. Song W. Beesley J.S. Grinspan J.B. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B.

Sci. 2009; 110: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that E2 and selective estrogen receptor modulators promote neuronal survival via the GPR30-EGFR-GLT-1 pathway. Therefore, we studied the effect of G1 (a selective agonist of GPR30) on GLT-1 expression and explored the mechanism by which G1/GPR30 regulates GLT-1 expression in rat primary astrocytes. All cell culture reagents, media, and sera were purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]Glutamic acid was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. PD98059, LY294002, PP2, tyrphostin AG1478 (AG1478), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, H89, G15, and G1 were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). E2, DNase, dibutyryl cAMP (dbc-AMP), protease inhibitor mixture, poly-d-ornithine, and MnCl2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-GLT-1 IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Millipore (Bedford, MA). The RNA isolation kit was purchased from Qiagen. Luciferase reporter assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). E2, G1, and G15 (1–10 mm) in 95% ethanol or Me2SO according to the manufacturer's instructions were prepared and diluted to final working concentrations in Opti-MEM immediately prior to use. To prepare primary astrocytes, following careful removal of meninges, the cerebral hemispheres of 1-day-old newborn rats (Sprague-Dawley) were dissociated using Dispase II (Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals; neutral protease, Dispase Grade II). Twenty-four hours after the initial plating, the media were changed to preserve the adhering astrocytes and to remove neurons and oligodendrocytes. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 weeks in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. These cultures showed >95% positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte-specific marker. All of the experiments were performed 3 weeks after isolation. Uptake of [3H]glutamic acid was measured as described previously (22Lee E.S. Sidoryk M. Jiang H. Yin Z. Aschner M. Estrogen and tamoxifen reverse manganese-induced glutamate transporter impairment in astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Mutkus L. Aschner J.L.

In brief, medium was removed, and the cells were washed rapidly twice with Opti-MEM before treatment with compounds in Opti-MEM for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with prewarmed uptake buffer (122 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-(+)-glucose, pH 7.4). Uptake was initiated by aspirating the medium and adding prewarmed uptake buffer containing 0.25 μCi/ml l-[3H]glutamate (specific activity, 49.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 100 nm (35Liang Z. Valla J. Sefidvash-Hockley S. Rogers J. Li R. Effects of estrogen treatment on glutamate uptake in cultured human astrocytes derived from cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients.J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Uptake reaction was continued for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by three washes with ice-cold PBS, immediately followed by cell lysis in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH. An aliquot of 750 μl was neutralized in 75 μl of 10 n HCl, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counter (LS 6500; Beckman Coulter) and corrected for protein levels to yield nmol glutamate/mg protein/min. Astrocytes were treated with the designated compounds for the indicated periods, followed by two washes with cold Hank's buffered salt solution. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl in 1 ml of lysis buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (22Lee E.S. Sidoryk M. Jiang H. Yin Z. Aschner M. Estrogen and tamoxifen reverse manganese-induced glutamate transporter impairment in astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lysate protein content was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay, and samples of 30 μg of protein were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies (GLT-1, 1:1000, Millipore or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; β-actin, 1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000), ERK1/2 (1:1000), phospho-Akt (Ser308; 1:1000), Akt (1:1000), phospho-EGFR (Tyr; 1:500), EGFR (1:1000), phospho-CREB (1:500), and CREB (1:1000), followed by secondary antibodies (1:3000, anti-guinea pig, anti-rabbit, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugates; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (Pierce). A monomeric band of GLT-1 (70 kDa) was used to quantify the data. The intensities of all protein bands were normalized with the housekeeping gene, β-actin. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Two μg of total RNA was transcribed with poly(dT) oligonucleotides and reverse transcriptase. PCR targeting GLT-1 and TGF-α was performed with Supermix (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 30 μl. Sequences of the primers were: 5′-CCT CAT GAG GAT GCT GAA GA-3′ (GLT-1 forward) and 5′-TCC AGG AAG GCA TCC AGG CTG-3′ (GLT-1 reverse); 5′-ACG GTC ACT GCT GTC ATT G-3′ (GLAST forward) and 5′-TGT GAC GAG ACT GGA GAT GA-3′ (GLAST reverse); 5′-TGG AGA ACA GCA CGT CC-3′ (TGF-α forward) and 5′-GCG CTG GGC TTC TCG TG-3′ (TGF-α reverse); and 5′-TCC CTC AAG ATT GTC AGC AA-3′ (GAPDH forward) and 5′-AGA TCC ACA ACG GAT ACA TT-3′ (GAPDH reverse). After 30 cycles of amplification (denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55–64 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) (iCycler; Bio-Rad), the samples were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. GAPDH was used as internal standard. The CFX96 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used to amplify GLT-1 and GLAST. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, containing a 1 μg of cDNA template of each sample, 0.4 μm of the appropriate primers and RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences/Qiagen). The PCR protocol consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. Each sample was normalized relative to GAPDH. The data were analyzed using a web-based PCR array data analysis (SABiosciences/Qiagen). After treatment, the astrocytes were washed twice with TBS and fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with TGT (TBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) overnight at 4 °C in TGT containing rabbit polyclonal anti-GLT-1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rinsed in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TGT containing anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein conjugates (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In separate experiments, primary or secondary antibodies were omitted to control for possible cross-reactivity. The cultures were covered with Vector Shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and observed under a Nikon confocal microscope (A1R laser scanning confocal). Templates for siRNA synthesis were designed on the basis of the GPR30 sequences in which the total length was 21 bases and the relative GC content of the template was 55%. The sequences of GPR30 used were antisense 5′-CCU GGA CGA GCA GUA UUA CTT-3′ and sense 5′-GUA AUA CUG CUC GUC CAG GTT-3′. These target sequences were previously reported (31Yang Y. Gozen O. Watkins A. Lorenzini I. Lepore A. Gao Y. Vidensky S. Brennan J. Poulsen D. Won Park J. Li Jeon N. Robinson M.B. Rothstein J.D. Presynaptic regulation of astroglial excitatory neurotransmitter transporter GLT1.Neuron. 2009; 61: 880-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were transfected for 3 days, followed by 8 h of treatment with G1 (2 μm) and measurement of mRNA expression. Astrocytes cultured in 500 μl of growth medium in 24-well plates for 2–3 days were transfected overnight with 0.5 μg of pGL3 basic reporter vector, containing EAAT2Pro-954 (kindly provided by Dr. Fisher, Virginia Commonwealth University) and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in MEM containing 5% FBS. Dominant-negative cAMP response element-binding protein (A-CREB) expression vector was from Dr. Charles Vinson (National Cancer Institute) and luciferase reporter vectors for NF-κB and CRE were from Clontech. The cells were then treated with the designated compounds in opti-MEM containing 5% FBS for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured with the Bright-Glo luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to the protein content as determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). In all experiments, normalization was verified by co-transfecting with firefly reporter pGL4.75 plasmids (Promega) carrying the Renilla luciferase reporter gene. The GLT-1 (EAAT2) promoter (−954 to +44 bp) subcloned into pGL3 basic plasmid vector (36Su Z.Z. Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.C. Sarkar D. Chao W. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1955-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was used. NF-κB triple mutant (−583/−272/−251) was a gift from Dr. Sitcheran (Texas A & M Health Sciences Center). To generate a mutation at the −308 CREB binding sequence, the sequence 5′-GCC CGG CGC GGG TGA TGT CAG CTC TCG ACG AAA-3′ was changed to 5′-GCC CGG CGC GGG TAA TGA CAG CTC TCG ACG AAA-3′ by PCR-based mutagenesis using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The wild-type CACGCG (NheI) site was changed to CCCGGG (Sma1) using 5′-GCT CTT ACG CGT GGC AGC CCG GGC TCG AGA TC-3′ to identify mutant clones. Clones were sequenced to confirm mutations. ChIP analysis was performed with the EZ-ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with formaldehyde (10 min at room temperature) and sonicated to lengths of 100–500 bp; 100 μl of supernatant was mixed with 900 μl of ChIP dilution buffer (Millipore). After preclearing, 1% of the reaction was saved for PCR amplification as input data. The remainder was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the CREB antibody (Cell Signaling), p50 (Cell Signaling), p65 (Santa Cruz), or control rabbit IgG (Millipore). After isolation and washing of antibody-containing complexes, DNA was extracted. PCRs were performed using the following primers: for CREB, forward: 5′-GGG ACA ACA GAA GAG GGA CA-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGG GAT TGC AAG GTT TAG CC-3′ (−563 to −403); for NF-κB, forward: 5′-CTG TGG GAC TCC CCA TCC CAG-3′ and reverse: 5′-TGG CAG GAT CCC AGG GTC TAA-3′. Products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The mean and S.E. were determined for each set of data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test was used to determine significance. Astrocytes express both GPR30 protein and mRNA (37Kuo J. Hamid N. Bondar G. Prossnitz E.R.

https://openalex.org/W2128621188,"Stimulating conversion of white fat to metabolically active adipocytes (beige fat) constitutes a promising strategy against weight gain and its deleterious associated-disorders. We provide direct evidence that prolactin (PRL), best known for its actions on the mammary gland, plays a pivotal role in energy balance through the control of adipocyte differentiation and fate. Here we show that lack of prolactin receptor (PRLR) causes resistance to high-fat-diet-induced obesity due to enhanced energy expenditure and increased metabolic rate. Mutant mice displayed reduced fat mass associated with appearance of massive brown-like adipocyte foci in perirenal and subcutaneous but not in gonadal fat depots under a high-fat diet. Positron emission tomography imaging further demonstrated the occurrence of these thermogenic brown fat depots in adult mice, providing additional support for recruitable brown-like adipocytes (beigeing) in white fat depots. Consistent with the activation of brown adipose tissue, PRLR inactivation increases expression of master genes controlling brown adipocyte fate (PRDM16) and mitochondrial function (PGC1α, UCP1). Altered pRb/Foxc2 expression suggests that this PRL-regulated pathway may contribute to beige cell commitment. Together, these results provide direct genetic evidence that PRLR affects energy balance and metabolic adaptation in rodents via effects on brown adipose tissue differentiation and function.—Auffret, J., Viengchareun, S., Carré, N., Denis, R.

https://openalex.org/W2038463001,"The enoylreductase (ER) is the final common enzyme from modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to be structurally characterized. The 3.0 Å-resolution structure of the didomain comprising the ketoreductase (KR) and ER from the second module of the spinosyn PKS reveals that ER shares an ∼600-Å(2) interface with KR distinct from that of the related mammalian fatty acid synthase (FAS). In contrast to the ER domains of the mammalian FAS, the ER domains of the second module of the spinosyn PKS do not make contact across the two-fold axis of the synthase. This monomeric organization may have been necessary in the evolution of multimodular PKSs to enable acyl carrier proteins to access each of their cognate enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2020765241,"Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a potent toxin that can cause toxic shock syndrome and act as a lethal and incapacitating agent when used as a bioweapon. There are currently no vaccines or immunotherapeutics available against this toxin. Using phage display technology, human antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) were selected against SEB, and proteins were produced in Escherichia coli cells and characterized for their binding affinity and their toxin neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo. Highly protective Fabs were converted into full-length IgGs and produced in mammalian cells. Additionally, the production of anti-SEB antibodies was explored in the Nicotiana benthamiana plant expression system. Affinity maturation was performed to produce optimized lead anti-SEB antibody candidates with subnanomolar affinities. IgGs produced in N. benthamiana showed characteristics comparable with those of counterparts produced in mammalian cells. IgGs were tested for their therapeutic efficacy in the mouse toxic shock model using different challenge doses of SEB and a treatment with 200 μg of IgGs 1 h after SEB challenge. The lead candidates displayed full protection from lethal challenge over a wide range of SEB challenge doses. Furthermore, mice that were treated with anti-SEB IgG had significantly lower IFNγ and IL-2 levels in serum compared with mock-treated mice. In summary, these anti-SEB monoclonal antibodies represent excellent therapeutic candidates for further preclinical and clinical development."

Of two arginine residues paired on one face of HD5, Arg-28 is critical for both viruses, while Arg-9 is only important for AdV. Two arginine residues on the opposite face of the molecule (Arg-13 and Arg-32) and unpaired Arg-25 are less important for both. In addition, hydrophobicity at residue 29 is a major determinant of anti-adenoviral activity, and a chemical modification that prevents HD5 self-association was strongly attenuating. Although HD5 binds to the capsid of AdV, the molecular basis for this interaction is undefined. Capsid binding by HD5 is not purely charge-dependent, as substitution of lysine for Arg-9 and Arg-28 was deleterious. Analysis of HD5 analogs that retained varying levels of potency demonstrated that anti-adenoviral activity is directly correlated with HD5 binding to the virus, confirming that the viral capsid rather than the cell is the relevant target. Also, AdV aggregation induced by HD5 binding is not sufficient for neutralization. Rather, these studies confirm that the major mechanism of HD5-mediated neutralization of AdV depends upon specific binding to the viral capsid through interactions mediated in part by critical arginine residues, hydrophobicity at residue 29, and multimerization of HD5, which increases initial binding of virus to the cell but prevents subsequent viral uncoating and genome delivery to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2085664561,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor of children and young adults in which finding effective new targeted therapies is imperative. Here, we report an in-depth preclinical study of the investigational cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) inhibitor MLN4924 in ES, as we have recently demonstrated the implication of a CRL component in the ES pathogenesis. First, our results support a high sensitivity of ES cells to MLN4924 growth inhibition both in vitro (14 ES cell lines tested, median IC50=81 nM) and in tumor xenografts (tumor regression achieved with 60 mg/kg BID, subcutaneously, n=9). Second, we report a dual mechanism of action of MLN4924 in ES cells: while a wide range of MLN4924 concentrations (∼30–300 nM) trigger a G2 arrest that can only be rescued by WEE1 kinase inhibition or depletion, saturating doses of the drug (>300 nM) cause a delay in S-phase progression concomitant with unbalanced CDK2-Cyclin E and CDK2-Cyclin A relative levels (accumulation of the first and depletion of the latter). The aberrant presence of CDC6 in the nucleus at late S-phase cell cycle stage confirmed the loss of CDK2-Cyclin A-specific functions. Remarkably, other mechanisms explored (P27 accumulation and DNA damage signaling pathways) were found unable to explain MLN4924 effects, strengthening the specificity of our findings and suggesting the absence of functionality of some CRL substrates accumulated in response to MLN4924. This study renders a rationale for clinical trials and contributes molecular mechanisms for a better understanding of this promising antitumoral agent."

The contribution of soluble activities to intravascular nucleotide homeostasis remains controversial. By using thin-layer chromatographic assays, we revealed transphosphorylation of [γ-22P]ATP and AMP by human and murine sera, which was progressively inhibited by specific adenylate kinase (AK) inhibitor Ap5A. This phosphotransfer reaction was diminished markedly in serum from knockout mice lacking the major AK isoform, AK1, and in human serum immunodepleted of AK1. We also showed that ~75% ADP in cell-free serum is metabolized via reversible AK1 reaction 2ADP ↔ ATP + AMP. The generated ATP and AMP are then metabolized through the coupled nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase and 5'-nucleotidase/CD73 reactions, respectively. Constitutive presence of another nucleotide-converting enzyme, nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1, known as CD39), was ascertained by the relative deficiency of serum from CD39-null mice to dephosphorylate [3H]ADP and [γ-32P]ATP, and also by diminished [3H]ADP hydrolysis by human serum pretreated with NTPDase1 inhibitors, POM-1 and ARL-67156. In summary, we have identified hitherto unrecognized soluble forms of AK1 and NTPDase1/CD39 that contribute in the active cycling between the principal platelet-recruiting agent ADP and other circulating nucleotides.—Yegutkin, G.

Erk-dependent phosphorylation of UBF directly influences RNA Pol I elongation rates by inducing an UBF-dependent rearrangement of the chromatin environment. This effect could serve as a mechanism to coordinate transcription and the assembly of pre-ribosomal complexes on nascent rRNA by modulating the Pol I elongation rate. Further insights into how these processes might be coordinated came from Nomura and co-workers (18Schneider D.A. French S.L. Osheim Y.N. Bailey A.O. Vu L. Dodd J. Yates J.R. Beyer A.L. Nomura M.

A connection between transcription elongation and rRNA processing was further confirmed by using a yeast strain with a mutated RNA Pol I enzyme with reduced elongation rates (3Schneider D.A.

Reduced elongation rates led to severe defects in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly, suggesting an intimate link between elongation rates and rRNA maturation. Thus, ribosome biogenesis appears to be controlled by feedback mechanisms, which ensure that proper assembly occurs on all synthesis levels, from transcription initiation to ribosome export. The expression of the rRNA genes is regulated at different levels of the rRNA metabolic pathway at the stage of transcription initiation (for review, see Ref. 19Grummt I. Life on a planet of its own.

The 160-kDa Mybbp1a protein had originally been described as an interacting partner of the proto-oncogene c-Myb and since then it has been shown to interact with and to modulate the activity of several regulators of Pol II-dependent transcription. In certain myeloid cell types, the protein is post-translationally processed to generate an N-terminal fragment of 67 kDa (p67MBP) (23Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A.

The data shown here demonstrate two new functions for Mybbp1a in the nucleolus. It associates with the RNA Pol I machinery and is able to repress its transcriptional activity. To generate a FLAG-tagged RPA116 expression construct, the coding sequence of mouse RPA116 was amplified from the cDNA clone pBS-RPA 116 6-2 (kindly provided by I. Grummt (30Seither P. Grummt I.

GFP-RPA43 was obtained from Addgene (Addgene plasmid 17659). The mouse lymphoblast cell line MB III (ATCC® number CCL-32™) was cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (Earles, with Glutamax) with non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate (110 mg/liter), and 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). To create a MB III cell line stably expressing FLAG-RPA116, cells were transfected with pEGZ-fRPA116, selected with Zeocin (Invitrogen), cloned by serial dilution, and then further maintained with 100 μg/ml Zeocin. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To monitor proliferation rates, HeLa cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and diluted in PBS. Subsequently cells were stained with trypan blue, and living cells were counted. To prepare nuclear extracts, MB III and FLAG-RPA116-MB III cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in three packed cell volumes of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysis was followed by microscopy. Nuclei were washed in buffer A, resuspended in 3 packed cell volumes of Buffer B (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) containing 2% (v/v) distamycin A hydrochloride (Sigma, D6135), and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 40 min. After centrifugation the nuclear fraction was collected and dialyzed against AM100 (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). HEK293T nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection with FLAG-Mybbp1a or empty vector control as described above. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection with FLAG-Mybbp1a or vector control. Cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), washed with PBS, centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 5× packed cell volumes of Buffer C (10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 8 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2× packed cell volumes of Buffer C. The cells were lysed with the help of a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B), and cell lysis was followed by light microscopy. After two centrifugation steps at 1000 × g and 4000 × g each for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) per 109 cells. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min the extract was sonicated 2 × 20 s in a volume of 200 μl (alternatively 3 × 20 s in a volume of 250 μl) with the Bioruptor (H, Diagenode) and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose in the presence of 0.02% Nonidet P-40 or 0.25% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and DTT (1 mm). FLAG-RPA116-containing complexes were additionally washed with AM300 buffer (300 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted with 0.25 mg/ml FLAG peptide. If needed proteins were concentrated with Strata Clean resin (Stratagene) or by TCA precipitation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and either analyzed by Western blotting or silver or Coomassie staining, cut out of the gel, and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 500 μl of MB III whole cell extract was applied on a 12-ml 10–45% glycerol gradient (AM100) and centrifuged at 35,000 × g (Sw 41 Ti rotor) in a Optima-LE 80K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C for 12 h (no break). Subsequently 500-μl fractions were collected, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with or without 10 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h before Superose 6 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) fractionation. 500-μl fractions were collected, and proteins were concentrated with the Strata Clean resin (Stratagene) and analyzed by Western blotting.

https://openalex.org/W2084327854,"One of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, p38, has been found to play a crucial role in various inflammatory responses. In this study, we analyzed the roles of p38α in multiple sclerosis, using an animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). p38α(+/-) mice (p38α(-/-) showed embryonic lethality) showed less severe neurological signs than WT mice. Adoptive transfer of lymph node cells (LNC) from sensitized WT mice with MOG(35-55) to naive WT-induced EAE was much more severe compared with the case using LNC from sensitized p38α(+/-) mice. Comprehensive analysis of cytokines from MOG(35-55)-challenged LNC by Western blot array revealed that production of IL-17 was significantly reduced by a single copy disruption of the p38α gene or a p38 inhibitor. Likewise, by a luciferase reporter assay, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay, and characterization of the relationship between p38 activity and IL-17 mRNA expression, we confirmed that p38 positively regulates transcription of the Il17 gene. Furthermore, oral administration of a highly specific p38α inhibitor (UR-5269) to WT mice at the onset of EAE markedly suppressed the progression of EAE compared with a vehicle group. These results suggest that p38α participates in the pathogenesis of EAE through IL-17 induction."

RUTBC2 thus seems to be a likely candidate for integrating signaling from Rap-regulated pathways to membrane trafficking. The Rab substrates of its putative GAP activity remain unknown. Rab9A GTPase is required for the recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network (10Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R.

In this study, we report that RUTBC2 is a specific effector of Rab9A in vitro and in cultured cells. Rab9A binds the N-terminal half of RUTBC2. The RUTBC2 TBC domain does not possess GAP activity on Rab9A but instead shows in vitro GAP activity toward the highly related Rab34 and Rab36 proteins. In cells, Rab36 is a bona fide substrate for RUTBC2. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was carried out as described previously (14Fuchs E. Haas A.K. Spooner R.A. Yoshimura S. Lord J.M. Barr F.A. Specific Rab GTPase-activating proteins define the Shiga toxin and epidermal growth factor uptake pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 56 mutant Rab proteins deficient for GTP hydrolysis (Gln to Ala) were cloned into pGBT9 bait vector (Clontech). RUTBC2 was amplified from cDNA libraries and was cloned into pACT2 prey vector (Clontech); growth on selective medium indicated an interaction between a Rab and RUTBC2. For mammalian expression, N-terminally 3×Myc-tagged RUTBC2 was obtained by amplification from a cDNA library and ligation into a modified version of pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) (14Fuchs E. Haas A.K.

This construct encodes the shortest of four isoforms found in GenBankTM and is missing the first 25 amino acids at the N terminus. GFP-RUTBC2 was constructed by amplification of this isoform with the addition of the missing N terminus by PCR and ligated into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). The predicted RUTBC2 GAP-inactive mutant (R829A) was created using QuikChange (Stratagene). For bacterial expression, RUTBC2-N (amino acids 1–449) and RUTBC2-C (amino acids 450–1032) were ligated into pET28a (Novagen) in-frame with the N-terminal His tag or into the AscI and PacI sites of a modified pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) in-frame with an N-terminal GST tag.

Phosphate-binding protein (PBP) from Escherichia coli was amplified by PCR from bacteria and cloned into modified pET15. His-PBP A197C was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Either His-RUTBC2-N or His-RUTBC2-C was transformed into Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen) and grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5. The culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for an additional 4 h at 22 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and lysed by two passes at 20,000 p.s.i. through an EmulsiFlex-C5 apparatus (Avestin). Cleared lysates (20,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C in a JA-20 rotor; Beckman Coulter) were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the required protein were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore). The sample was dialyzed to remove imidazole and then brought to 10% (v/v) glycerol. The sample was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. GST-RUTBC2, GST-RUTBC2-N, and GST-RUTBC2-C were each transformed into Rosetta2 (DE3) cells and grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6. The cells were induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for an additional 4.5 h at 30 °C.

Cleared lysates (19,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a JA-20 rotor; Beckman Coulter) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with 25 column volumes lysis buffer and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 20 mm glutathione.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and GST-Rab9B was purified by the same procedure. His-Rab9A and His-Rab2 were purified in the same manner as His-Rab6A (16Hayes G.L. Brown F.C. Haas A.K. Nottingham R.M. Barr F.A. Pfeffer S.R.

Real-time in vitro measurement of GTP hydrolysis.Methods. 2005; 37: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10), mouse monoclonal anti-Rab9A, mouse monoclonal anti-CI-MPR (2G11), and rabbit anti-CI-MPR were all previously described (23Ganley I.G. Espinosa E. Pfeffer S.R.

Rabbit anti-GFP antibody was from Invitrogen; mouse anti-GFP antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit anti-RUTBC2 was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Penta-His antibody was from Qiagen. Chicken anti-Myc antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies as well as protein-A-HRP were from Bio-Rad. Constructs encoding 3×Myc-RUTBC2 were translated in vitro using a TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. GST-tagged Rabs were loaded with GTPγS or GDP as described (15Aivazian D. Serrano R.L. Pfeffer S. TIP47 is a key effector for Rab9 localization.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and mixed with TnT lysate for 1.5 h at 25 °C in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm GTPγS). RUTBC2 constructs bound to GST-Rabs were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose, washed in binding buffer (with 400 mm NaCl), and then eluted by the addition of 25 mm glutathione and analyzed by immunoblot. For binding described for Fig. 2A, 1 μm His-Rab2 and His-Rab9A was preloaded with GTPγS and incubated with 2.5 μm GST or full-length GST-RUTBC2 for 90 min at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Glutathione-Sepharose was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and bound protein complexes were eluted by heating the samples in 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. For binding described for Fig. 2, B and F, the Rab concentration was 5 μm, and the GST or GST-RUTBC2 concentration was 2.5 μm. Binding assays described for Fig. 2D using purified proteins were as described (16Hayes G.L. Brown F.C. Haas A.K. Nottingham R.M. Barr F.A. Pfeffer S.R. Multiple Rab GTPase binding sites in GCC185 suggest a model for vesicle tethering at the trans Golgi.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For Fig. 2E, GST alone or GST-Rab9A Q66L (5 μm) was mixed with His-RUTBC2-N or His-RUTBC2-C (2.5 μm) and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). RUTBC2 constructs bound to GST and GST-Rab9A were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose, washed in binding buffer, eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. HeLa, HEK293T, SK-N-SH, and Vero cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For overexpression studies, all cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested either 24 h or 48 h after transfection as indicated. For siRNA treatment, HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The siRNA against RUTBC2 targeted the sequence 5′-GCAGAUUGGAGGAGAAACA-3′ and was purchased from Dharmacon. For immunoprecipitation, HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-Rab9A and 3×Myc-RUTBC2 constructs were harvested after 24 h and lysed in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 100 nm GTPγS) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 2.3 μm leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, and 150 nm aprotinin. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, protein concentrations were measured in the lysates. 1000 μg of extract was precleared with protein-A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 60 min. The precleared extracts were incubated with GFP-binding protein-conjugated Sepharose (38Rothbauer U. Zolghadr K. Muyldermans S. Schepers A. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. A versatile nanotrap for biochemical and functional studies with fluorescent fusion proteins.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 282-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) for 90 min at 4 °C. Immobilized proteins were washed with lysis buffer, eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Protein turnover and lysosomal enzyme secretion assays were performed as described (23Ganley I.G. Espinosa E. Pfeffer S.R. A syntaxin 10-SNARE complex distinguishes two distinct transport routes from endosomes to the trans Golgi in human cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation was as described previously (13Ganley I.G. Carroll K. Bittova L. Pfeffer S. Rab9 GTPase regulates late endosome size and requires effector interaction for its stability.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5420-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) except that SK-N-SH cells were swollen in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 5 min. The procedure followed by Pan et al. (21Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. TBC-domain GAPs for Rab GTPases accelerate GTP hydrolysis by a dual-finger mechanism.Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) was used, except that phosphate released during the reaction was bound by His-PBP A197C labeled at position 197 with MDCC (24Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Direct, real-time measurement of rapid inorganic phosphate release using a novel fluorescent probe and its application to actomyosin subfragment 1 ATPase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding a solution containing GAP and MgCl2 to one of MDCC-PBP and desalted, GTP-exchanged Rabs by a Precision 2000 liquid handling system (BioTek). All reactions contained 2 μm Rab GTPase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 85 nm MDCC-PBP, whereas the concentration of His-RUTBC2-C was varied. Phosphate production was monitored continuously in a TECAN Sapphire microplate reader using an excitation wavelength of 425 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm. HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected the following day with FuGENE 6 (Promega). 18 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS followed by two washes with ice-cold glutamate buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, and 150 mm monopotassium glutamate). Cytosol leak was performed by incubating the coverslips for 5 s in liquid N2 and thawing them at 20 °C for 1 min. Coverslips were then washed twice in ice-cold glutamate buffer and fixed for 15 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 200 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. After fixation, cells were washed twice in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. Coverslips were washed twice in PBS, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 min, incubated with chicken anti-Myc antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at 20 °C, washed, incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h, and then washed and mounted using Mowiol (Polysciences). Imaging was performed with a Leica TCS SP2 SE confocal scanner in conjunction with a Leica DM6000 B upright scope (with attached Leica HCX PL apochromatic 63×/NA 1.4 objective) and a Leica CTR 6000 confocal control box. This setup was controlled by Leica Control software (Leica Microsystems). Images were processed using ImageJ. The quantification of Rab36 puncta and fluorescence intensity as well as Rab9A and RUTBC2 co-localization was performed with CellProfiler. We are interested in understanding the cellular role of Rab9A GTPase. As a starting point to find regulators of Rab9A, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen consisting of all TBC domain-containing proteins in the human genome as prey against a comprehensive library of hydrolysis-deficient Rab GTPases as bait (14Fuchs E. Haas A.K. Spooner R.A. Yoshimura S. Lord J.M. Barr F.A. Specific Rab GTPase-activating proteins define the Shiga toxin and epidermal growth factor uptake pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Haas A.K. Fuchs E. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. A GTPase-activating protein controls Rab5 function in endocytic trafficking.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This screen revealed that a TBC domain-containing protein, RUTBC2, interacted with both Rab9A and Rab9B (Fig. 1B). RUTBC2 also interacted with Rab2A/B and Rab7li. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) HomoloGene database, there is only one RUTBC1/2 protein in C. elegans (tbc-8), Drosophila (CG1905), and zebrafish (LOC794373), whereas vertebrates have both RUTBC1 and RUTBC2 proteins (9Yang H. Sasaki T. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Identification of three novel proteins (SGSM1, 2, 3) which modulate small G protein (RAP and RAB)-mediated signaling pathway.Genomics. 2007; 90: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlike most other GAP proteins, the TBC catalytic domains of RUTBC1 and RUTBC2 contain a large insertion between the first two “fingerprint” A and B motifs (Fig. 1A, sequence). These motifs are unambiguously conserved in all TBC domains (1Barr F. Lambright D.G. Rab GEFs and GAPs.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and comprise the catalytic core of these enzymes. What is the role of the sequences that interrupt the catalytic core? In the structural model for Rab and Rab-GAP interaction, the analogous region of Gyp1 GAP is situated away from the Rab-GAP binding interface (21Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. TBC-domain GAPs for Rab GTPases accelerate GTP hydrolysis by a dual-finger mechanism.Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), thus these large insertions may have important binding interactions related to the functions of these proteins. Most of the dissimilarity between RUTBC1 and RUTBC2 in the TBC domain is found in this insertion; thus, these sequences are likely to contribute to the different functions of RUTBC1 and RUTBC2. To confirm the results of the screen and to test the nature of the interactions, we tested whether Rab9A could bind RUTBC2 in vitro. Full-length RUTBC2 was produced both in an in vitro transcription/translation system (with an N-terminal 3×Myc tag) as well as in E. coli (with an N-terminal GST tag). As shown in Fig. 2A, His-Rab9A bound well to GST-RUTBC2 and not GST, whereas another Rab that showed interaction in the two-hybrid screen, Rab2A, did not bind either GST or GST-RUTBC2. GST-RUTBC2 bound to His-Rab9A but not to His-Rab6A (Fig. 2B). Next, we asked whether RUTBC2 preferred either the GTP-bound or the GDP-bound form of Rab9A. Using the GST binding assay described above, in vitro translated RUTBC2 was bound much more efficiently by GST-Rab9A when loaded with GTPγS as compared with GDP (Fig. 2C). These results also suggest that RUTBC2 prefers to bind Rab9A despite Rab9B interaction observed in the two-hybrid screen. Thus, RUTBC2 is a bona fide effector of Rab9A. We next investigated the location of the Rab9A binding site in RUTBC2. Using purified proteins, full-length GST-RUTB"
https://openalex.org/W2008177080,"Morphogenesis, as illustrated by melanocyte migration and homing to the skin, requires cadherin adhesion, integrin-dependent migration and Kit-ligand growth factor signaling. However, it is not known how Kit ligand regulates integrin or cadherin-dependent intraepidermal melanocyte behavior. To answer this question, we developed specific 2-dimensional (2D) and 3D culture systems analyzing how soluble or immobilized Kit-ligand-regulated melanocyte migration on vitronectin and laminin, or within a monolayer of kidney epithelial cells. In a 2D system, soluble Kit ligand stimulated integrin-dependent melanoblast migration and chemotaxis and accelerated integrin turnover. In contrast, immobilized, but not soluble, Kit ligand, enhanced integrin-dependent melanocyte spreading on suboptimal laminin concentrations. In 3D, membrane-bound Kit ligand induced intra-epithelial melanocyte proliferation, survival, and tight adhesion to epithelial cells, while cleavable Kit ligand was less effective. In contrast, melanocyte motility was independent of membrane-bound Kit ligand, but increased in the presence of the cleavable Kit-ligand isoform. Trans-membrane-dimerization or basolateral-targeting mutants of Kit ligand altered intraepithelial melanocyte localization, survival, and adhesion to epithelial cells. These data and the identification of c-kit/Kit-ligand clusters at cell contacts suggest that membrane-bound Kit ligand captures cell surface-expressed c-kit, providing mechanical anchoring and survival signaling within intraepithelial niches, and thereby defining a new mechanism for melanocyte homeostasis and requirement for environmental niches.—Tabone-Eglinger, S., Wehrle-Haller, M., Aebischer, N., Jacquier, M.-C., Wehrle-Haller, B.

https://openalex.org/W2049743072,"Although the significance of cathepsin G (CTSG) in host defense has been intensively investigated, little is known about its potential roles in granulopoiesis or leukemogenesis. We report here that CTSG is directly targeted and suppressed by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Luciferase assays demonstrate that the CTSG promoter is strongly transactivated by AML1 and the AML1-dependent transactivation is suppressed by AML1-ETO. We also define a novel regulatory mechanism by which AML1-ETO-mediated transrepression requires both AML1-ETO and AML1 binding at adjacent sites, instead of the replacement of AML1 by AML1-ETO, and wild-type AML1 binding is a prerequisite for the repressive effect caused by AML1-ETO. Further evidence shows that CTSG, as a hematopoietic serine protease, can degrade AML1-ETO both in vitro and in vivo. Restoration of CTSG induces partial differentiation, growth inhibition and apoptosis in AML1-ETO-positive cells. In addition to t(8;21) AML, CTSG downregulation is observed in AML patients with other cytogenetic/genetic abnormalities that potentially interrupt normal AML1 function, that is, inv(16) and EVI1 overexpression. Thus, the targeting and suppression of CTSG by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AML may provide a mechanism for leukemia cells to escape from the intracellular surveillance system by preventing degradation of foreign proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1970884882,"Whether group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) is involved in vascular inflammation and neointima formation is largely unknown. Here, we report that iPLA2β expression increases in the vascular tunica media upon carotid artery ligation and that neointima formation is suppressed by genetic deletion of iPLA2β or by inhibiting its activity or expression via perivascular delivery of bromoenol lactone or of antisense oligonucleotides, respectively. To investigate whether smooth muscle-specific iPLA2β is involved in neointima formation, we generated transgenic mice in which iPLA2β is expressed specifically in smooth muscle cells and demonstrate that smooth muscle-specific expression of iPLA2β exacerbates ligation-induced neointima formation and enhanced both production of proinflammatory cytokines and vascular infiltration by macrophages. With cultured vascular smooth muscle cell, angiotensin II, arachidonic acid, and TNF-α markedly induce increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α mRNAs, all of which were suppressed by inhibiting iPLA2β activity or expression with bromoenol lactone, antisense oligonucleotides, and genetic deletion, respectively. Similar suppression also results from genetic deletion of 12/15-lipoxygenase or inhibiting its activity with nordihydroguaiaretic acid or luteolin. Expression of iPLA2β protein in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was found to depend on the phenotypic state and to rise upon incubation with TNF-α. Our studies thus illustrate that smooth muscle cell-specific iPLA2β participates in the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation and neointima formation and suggest that iPLA2β may represent a novel therapeutic target for preventing cardiovascular diseases.Background: The role of iPLA2β as a regulator of inflammatory signaling and neointima formation is unknown.Results: Smooth muscle-specific expression of iPLA2β exacerbates proinflammatory cytokine production, macrophage infiltration, and neointima formation.Conclusion: Smooth muscle-specific iPLA2β participates in the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation and neointima formation.Significance: iPLA2β may represent a novel therapeutic target for attenuating vascular inflammation and restenosis. Whether group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) is involved in vascular inflammation and neointima formation is largely unknown. Here, we report that iPLA2β expression increases in the vascular tunica media upon carotid artery ligation and that neointima formation is suppressed by genetic deletion of iPLA2β or by inhibiting its activity or expression via perivascular delivery of bromoenol lactone or of antisense oligonucleotides, respectively. To investigate whether smooth muscle-specific iPLA2β is involved in neointima formation, we generated transgenic mice in which iPLA2β is expressed specifically in smooth muscle cells and demonstrate that smooth muscle-specific expression of iPLA2β exacerbates ligation-induced neointima formation and enhanced both production of proinflammatory cytokines and vascular infiltration by macrophages. With cultured vascular smooth muscle cell, angiotensin II, arachidonic acid, and TNF-α markedly induce increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α mRNAs, all of which were suppressed by inhibiting iPLA2β activity or expression with bromoenol lactone, antisense oligonucleotides, and genetic deletion, respectively. Similar suppression also results from genetic deletion of 12/15-lipoxygenase or inhibiting its activity with nordihydroguaiaretic acid or luteolin. Expression of iPLA2β protein in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was found to depend on the phenotypic state and to rise upon incubation with TNF-α.

Conclusion: Smooth muscle-specific iPLA2β participates in the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation and neointima formation. Significance: iPLA2β may represent a novel therapeutic target for attenuating vascular inflammation and restenosis. Neointima formation is a common feature of restenosis after balloon angioplasty, transplantation of vessels and organs, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and atherosclerosis (1Schwartz S.M. deBlois D.

Neointima formation has been extensively studied because of its multiple clinical implications. The persistently high rates of restenosis after vascular interventions indicate that the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for neointima formation is incomplete, however, and the clinical significance of neointima formation calls for identification of new therapeutic targets. The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 3The abbreviations used are: VSMCvascular smooth muscle celliPLA2calcium-independent phospholipase A2AAarachidonic acidLPC1-radyl, 2-lyso-glycerophosphocholineBELbromoenol lactoneAng IIangiotensin IISM-iPLA2β-TgiPLA2β smooth muscle-specific transgenic miceSMαAsmooth muscle cell α-actinSMMHCsmooth muscle heavy chainMCP-1monocyte chemotactic protein-1NFκBnuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cellPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenLOlipoxygenaseCOXcyclooxygenaseCYPcytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenasePNPLAphospholipase domain-containing protein. is a major cellular component of the blood vessel wall, and its primary physiological functions are to maintain homeostasis of blood flow and blood pressure within normal ranges. In healthy mature blood vessels, the VSMC exhibits a quiescent contractile phenotype and expresses a unique repertoire of smooth muscle contractile proteins. Upon various injurious stimuli, the VSMC dedifferentiates, rapidly switches from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype, and migrates from the medial to the intimal layer of the vessel wall where it proliferates to form neointima (1Schwartz S.M. deBlois D.

In addition to migration and proliferation, VSMC with a synthetic phenotype can produce various proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo (7Schober A. Weber C.

Paradoxically, the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation in restenosis has been attributed largely to interactions among macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells (1Schwartz S.M. deBlois D.

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) comprise a family of enzymes that hydrolyze esterified fatty acid residues from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to produce a free fatty acid (e.g. arachidonic acid (AA)) and a lysophospholipid (e.g. 1-radyl, 2-lyso-glycerophosphocholine (LPC)) (10Dennis E.A. Diversity of group types, regulation, and function of phospholipase A2.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their cellular location and the Ca2+ requirement for enzymatic activity, PLA2s are classified into three subfamilies as follows: secretory PLA2, cytosolic PLA2, and calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). The iPLA2 enzymes recognized so far are located within cells, do not require Ca2+ for enzymatic activity, and are subject to irreversible inhibition by the suicide substrate bromoenol lactone (BEL) at concentrations that do not inhibit secretory PLA2 or cytosolic PLA2 enzymes (11Hazen S.L.

Mechanism-based discrimination between calcium-dependent and -independent phospholipases A2.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iPLA2 enzymes are also members of a larger family of lipases designated the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins (PNPLA), of which the human genome expresses nine members (PNPLA1–9) (12Kienesberger P.C. Oberer M. Lass A. Zechner R. Mammalian patatin domain containing proteins. A family with diverse lipolytic activities involved in multiple biological functions.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S63-S68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). PNPLA family members contain a protein domain discovered initially in patatin, which is a lipid hydrolase that is the most abundant protein of the potato tuber. Mammalian PNPLAs include lipid hydrolases with specificities for diverse substrates such as triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and retinol esters. PNPLA9 corresponds to group VIA PLA2 (iPLA2β), and its recognition predates that of the PNPLA family as a whole. Of the iPLA2 enzymes, iPLA2β was the first recognized, the most extensively studied, and the best characterized member. iPLA2β is ubiquitously expressed and is distributed mainly in cytoplasm under resting conditions, but upon cellular stimulation, it can translocate to membranous organelles where it hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate AA and LPC (13Ma Z.

Both AA and LPC have intrinsic second messenger functions in some settings, can also be metabolized into diverse bioactive lipid mediators, and have been implicated in a variety of physiopathological processes (15Natarajan R.

Whether iPLA2β plays a role in vascular inflammation and neointima formation has so far not been examined in any animal models of which we are aware. Here, we report that smooth muscle cell-specific iPLA2β responds to vascular injury and participates in the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation and neointima formation in a murine carotid artery ligation model. The antibody against iPLA2β was generated in our laboratory as described previously (16Xie Z. Gong M.C. Su W. Turk J. Guo Z.

C57BL/6 and 12/15-lipoxygenase-null mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The iPLA2β-null mice were generated in the laboratory of Dr. John Turk, as described elsewhere (25Bao S. Miller D.J. Ma Z. Wohltmann M. Eng G. Ramanadham S. Moley K. Turk J.

All animal studies were performed in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals,” American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky. Nested PCR was used for cloning of the rabbit smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) promoter. Briefly, the first pair of external primers (rabbit SMMHC-MluI-F1 and rabbit SMMHC-SpeI-R1, see supplemental Table 1) was used to amplify a 2,305-bp rabbit SMMHC promoter from the rabbit brain genomic DNA. The second pair of internal primers (rabbit SMMHC (−2251)-F2, rabbit SMMHC (−18)-R2, see supplemental Table 1) was used to amplify a 2,234-bp fragment (−2,251 to −18 bp relative to the transcription start site) using the first PCR product as a template. The 2,234-bp PCR product was sequenced and found to be almost identical to the published rabbit SMMHC promoter sequence (26Kallmeier R.C. Somasundaram C. Babij P. A novel smooth muscle-specific enhancer regulates transcription of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30949-30957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 14-mer oligonucleotide corresponding to the −17 to −4 bp of the rabbit SMMHC promoter was added to the 3′-end of the 2,234-bp fragment by PCR to generate a 2,248-bp rabbit SMMHC promoter (−2251 to −4 bp). A mouse bacterial artificial chromosome clone (RP23-300M4) containing iPLA2β gene was purchased from Invitrogen and used as PCR template. A 0.952-kb PCR fragment (−1,411 bp to −459 bp relative to the translational start site) containing a predicated iPLA2β promoter (−1,278 to −460 bp, analyzed by Genomatix MatInspector software) was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (supplemental Table 1). After verification by DNA sequencing, this putative 0.952-kb iPLA2β promoter was subcloned into a pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at KpnI and XhoI sites to generate iPLA2β promoter-Luc reporter. Four sequential steps were taken to construct a smooth muscle- specific transgenic vector as described below. First, an additional 28-mer (−3 to +25 bp) oligonucleotide containing the rabbit SMMHC transcriptional start site was added to the 3′-end of 2,248-bp SMMHC promoter by PCR to generate a 2,276-bp SMMHC promoter (−2251 to +25 bp). Second, a NotI enzyme site in pCI vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was removed by NotI and SmaI enzyme digestion followed by large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase and blunt ligation. The modified pCI vector was then cut by PstI and BamH1 to generate an ∼500-bp fragment containing a chimeric intron, a multiple cloning site, and a SV40 late poly(A). The ∼500-bp fragment was ligated into PCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) at PstI and BamH1 enzyme sites to generate an “intermediate vector 1.” Third, an ∼2,400-bp rat iPLA2β cDNA (19Guo Z. Su W. Ma Z. Smith G.M. Gong M.C. Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 is required for agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of contraction in vascular smooth muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), containing a Kozak sequences at its 5′-end and a FLAG tag at its 3′-end, was amplified by PCR and then ligated into the intermediate vector 1 at NheI and SalI enzyme sites to generate an “intermediate vector 2.” Finally, the 2,276-bp rabbit SMMHC promoter was ligated into the “intermediate construct 2” at NotI and EcoRV enzyme sites to generate an iPLA2β smooth muscle-specific transgenic vector containing a rabbit SMMHC promoter, a chimeric intron derived from pCI vector, a rat iPLA2β-Flag cDNA, and SV40 late poly(A) derived from pCI vector (Fig. 2A). The iPLA2β smooth muscle-specific transgenic vector was linearized by NsiI enzyme to remove the PCR-Blunt vector backbone. The linear DNA fragment was microinjected into zygotes from B6C3F1 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) by the University of Kentucky Transgenic Mouse Facility. Pups derived from the microinjected embryos were screened for the presence of the iPLA2β transgene by mouse tail genotyping PCR using two sets of primers (supplemental Table 1) as follows: the first set of primers, Trans-iPLA2-up and Trans-iPLA2-down, was used to amplify a fragment from the 3′-end of iPLA2β to the 5′-end of the FLAG tag; the second set of primers, MHCP-Intron-F1 and iPLA2-R1, was used to amplify a fragment from 3′-end of a chimeric intron to 5′-end of iPLA2β. Seven independent founders were identified to be positive to both sets of PCR screenings. Pups derived from the seven founders were further subjected to Western blot using an anti-FLAG mAb. Three of seven founders were found expressing iPLA2β-FLAG tag protein in vascular smooth muscle tissues. Based upon levels of iPLA2β protein expression and iPLA2 enzymatic activity (data not shown), two independent founders with different levels of exogenous iPLA2β were retained in the laboratory and were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice at least eight generations for the current studies. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) in sterile saline. The carotid arteries were exposed through a small midline incision in the neck. The left common artery was ligated with a 5-0 suture just near its bifurcation to completely disrupt the blood flow (27Kumar A. Lindner V. Remodeling with neointima formation in the mouse carotid artery after cessation of blood flow.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The right common carotid artery was used as a sham-operated control by passing the same suture below without ligation. We used pluronic gel, an established local drug delivery method (28Villa A.E. Guzman L.A. Poptic E.J. Labhasetwar V. D'Souza S. Farrell C.L. Plow E.F. Levy R.J. DiCorleto P.E. Topol E.J.

Res. 1995; 76: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), to deliver BEL or antisense oligonucleotide to the carotid artery to inhibit iPLA2β and avoid potential systemic side effects. BEL or vehicle (Me2SO2) was mixed with 30% F-127 pluronic gel at 4 °C. The final concentration of BEL in pluronic gel was 91 μm. iPLA2β antisense or sense oligonucleotide was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and then suspended in 30% F-127 pluronic gel at 4 °C.

Comparative studies of processive kinesins revealed that neck linker length, sequence, and orientation modulate interhead tension and therefore regulate head-head communication for processive stepping (17.Clancy B.E.

However, unlike kinesin-1 and Eg5, CENP-E can also promote MT plus-end elongation in vitro (20.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanochemistry of CENP-E is specific for its functional roles in mitosis. More recently, a key threonine residue near the CENP-E motor domain and conserved across species (Thr422 in human and Thr424 in Xenopus laevis) has been identified as the site of a phospho-regulatory switch that is critical for chromosome congression and correct biorientation (24.Kim Y. Holland A.J. Lan W. Cleveland D.W. Aurora kinases and protein phosphatase 1 mediate chromosome congression through regulation of CENP-E.Cell. 2010; 142: 444-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this threonine by Aurora kinases A and B occurs during prometaphase when the chromosomes are near the spindle poles and where the gradient of Aurora kinases is high. Because CENP-E phosphorylation weakens its affinity for MTs, this mechanism is believed to contribute to correction of inappropriate kinetochore MT attachments. In contrast, as chromosomes move away from the spindle poles and congress to the equator, CENP-E becomes dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1, leading to higher MT affinity and stabilization of kinetochore end-on kMT amphitelic attachments (24.Kim Y. Holland A.J. Lan W. Cleveland D.W. Aurora kinases and protein phosphatase 1 mediate chromosome congression through regulation of CENP-E.Cell. 2010; 142: 444-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25.Hendrickx A. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Den Abt T. Van Eynde A. Nicolaescu E. Lesage B. Bollen M. Docking motif-guided mapping of the interactome of protein phosphatase-1.Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To identify mechanistic differences for CENP-E that contribute to its role in chromosome congression, we pursued a pre-steady-state kinetics study using a recombinant, truncated human CENP-E dimer (20.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results show that the ATPase mechanism accounts for the high processivity of CENP-E and its ability to elongate MTs in vitro. More importantly, this study has revealed that productive CENP-E association with the MT is unusually slow and may bias CENP-E selection for stable kMTs, a characteristic that could enhance the role of CENP-E in chromosome congression. The experiments reported in this study were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C) in ATPase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% sucrose). On the morning of each experiment, bovine brain tubulin was cold-depolymerized, clarified, and polymerized with 1 mm GTP at 34 °C. These MTs were stabilized with 40 μm paclitaxel, and MT concentrations reported are the paclitaxel-stabilized tubulin polymer. All reported concentrations of nucleotides (ATP, ADP, GTP) and nucleotide analogues (mantATP, mantADP, AMPPNP, ATPγS) also include the equivalent concentration of magnesium acetate. Errors are reported as S.E. A human CENP-E construct was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The CENP-E-His6 protein includes the N-terminal residues, Met1–Leu407, followed by 22 additional residues at the C terminus from the pET30c(+) plasmid (RDPNSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH). The predicted Mr is 48,467 per polypeptide chain and 96,934 for the CENP-E dimer. On the day of each experiment, CENP-E was clarified (90,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, Beckman Coulter Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, TLA 100 rotor) followed by protein concentration determination using the Bio-Rad protein assay with IgG as the standard. The CENP-E concentration is reported based on the concentration of a single CENP-E polypeptide. For the experiments in Figs. 1 and 4, the MT·CENP-E complex was preformed and treated with apyrase (0.02 unit/ml; grade VII, Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min to generate a nucleotide-free complex (26.Krzysiak T.C.

Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29261-29272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The grade VII apyrase isoform preferentially selects ADP to convert to AMP, and the binding affinity of AMP for CENP-E is so weak that CENP-E becomes essentially nucleotide-free. Because the concentration of apyrase used is so low, it does not compete with CENP-E for nucleotide during the experiments.FIGURE 4ATP-triggered mantADP release kinetics. A preformed MT·CENP-E·mantADP (mADP) complex was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with ATP. Final concentrations: 5 μm CENP-E, 10 μm MTs, 2 μm mantATP (mATP), 5–500 μm ATP.

C, the observed rates of the initial exponential phase were plotted as a function of ATP concentration, and the hyperbolic fit of the data provided kmax = 19.4 ± 0.6 s−1, K½,ATP = 26.6 ± 3.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide-free MT·CENP-E complex was rapidly mixed with mantATP (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) in a KinTek SF2003 stopped-flow instrument, and the fluorescence change was monitored (λex = 360 nm, λem = 450 nm, 409-nm long pass filter). The fluorescence increase as a function of time is correlated with mantATP binding because the fluorescence of mantATP is enhanced by the hydrophobic environment of the active site. Each transient was fit to a double exponential function, the observed rate of the initial exponential phase was plotted as a function of mantATP concentration, and the data were fit to the following equationkobs= k+1[MantATP]+ k-1(Eq. 1) where kobs represents the observed rate of the initial exponential phase, k+1 is the second-order rate constant for mantATP binding, and k−1 is the dissociation rate constant obtained from the y-intercept (see Fig. 1). The MT·CENP-E complex was preformed and rapidly mixed in the KinTek chemical quench-flow instrument with ATP plus trace [α-32P]ATP. The reaction was subsequently chased with 30 mm nonradiolabeled ATP (syringe concentration) and allowed to proceed for 15 s (>10 turnovers). The reaction was expelled from the instrument into a 1.5-ml tube containing 100 μl of 22 n formic acid. The acid terminates the reaction and releases any nucleotide at the active site. This experimental design quantifies [α-32P]ATP stably bound at the active site because during the time of the chase, the stably bound [α-32P]ATP proceeds through ATP hydrolysis. Any weakly bound [α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP in solution is diluted by the high concentration of nonradiolabeled ATP. Therefore, this experiment measures the kinetics of ATP binding. The products [α-32P]ADP + Pi were separated from [α-32P]ATP by thin layer chromatography and quantified (27.Chen C.J. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

Kinetics: a tool to study molecular motors.Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The individual transients were fit to the following burst equationProduct = A0[1-exp(-kbt)]+kslowt(Eq. 2) where A0 is the amplitude of the initial exponential burst phase representing the concentration of ADP·Pi formed at the active site during the first ATP turnover, kb is the observed rate of the exponential burst phase, kslow represents the rate of subsequent ATP binding events corresponding to steady-state turnover, and t is the time in seconds. For these experiments, 200 mm KCl was added to the [α-32P]ATP syringe, resulting in a final concentration of 100 mm KCl after mixing and prior to the unlabeled ATP chase. This strategy is commonly used for processive kinesins to slow the rate of subsequent ATP turnovers without affecting the first turnover (27.Chen C.J. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

The exponential burst phase therefore becomes better defined to quantify the kinetics of the first ATP turnover. The observed rates of the initial exponential burst phase were plotted as a function of ATP concentration, and the data were fit to the following equationkobs=[K1k+1'[ATP]/(K1[ATP]+1)](Eq. 3) where K1 represents the equilibrium association constant for formation of the collision complex, and k+1′ is the first-order rate constant for the ATP-promoted isomerization with Kd = 1/K1 (see Fig. 2). The pre-steady-state kinetic experiments to determine the time course of ATP hydrolysis were performed in the KinTek chemical quench-flow instrument as described (27.Chen C.J. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

Kinetics: a tool to study molecular motors.Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The MT·CENP-E complex was rapidly mixed with ATP plus trace [α-32P]ATP for times ranging from 5 to 600 ms. The ATP syringe also contained 200 mm KCl (100 mm after mixing). At varying times of incubation, the reaction was quenched with 10 n formic acid (syringe concentration). The formic acid quench terminated the reaction and unfolded the protein, releasing nucleotide from the active site. The products [α-32P]ADP and Pi were separated from [α-32P]ATP and quantified as described above for the pulse-chase experiments. The transients from these experiments were fit to Equation 2, and the observed rates of the initial exponential burst phase were plotted as a function of ATP concentration. The hyperbolic fit of the data provided the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis, k+2 (see Fig. 3). To determine the mantADP release kinetics from the trailing head (see Fig. 4) and correlated with processive stepping required that we generate an intermediate in which the leading head was nucleotide-free and tightly bound to the MT with the trailing head detached from the MT and mantADP tightly bound at its active site (see Fig. 4A). The strategy used was previously developed for Eg5 (26.Krzysiak T.C. Grabe M. Gilbert S.P. Getting in sync with dimeric Eg5: initiation and regulation of the processive run.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2078-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The preformed MT·CENP-E complex (10 μm CENP-E, 20 μm MTs, syringe concentrations) was treated with apyrase to generate a nucleotide-free complex. This complex was incubated with 4 μm mantATP, a concentration less than half the CENP-E active sites, and therefore, each mantATP was assumed to bind to the nucleotide binding site of the trailing head because of strain-induced gating of the leading head (17.Clancy B.E.

The mantATP was subsequently hydrolyzed to mantADP (see Fig. 4A). This MT·CENP-E·mantADP complex was then rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of ATP in the stopped-flow instrument, and the fluorescence change over time was monitored and correlated with mantADP release from the active site. The observed exponential rates were plotted as a function of ATP concentration and fit to a hyperbolic function (see Fig. 4C). The preformed MT·CENP-E complex was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with increasing concentrations of ATP plus 300 mm KCl (syringe concentration), and turbidity (λϵx = 340 nm) was monitored. Because the MT·CENP-E complex has a greater mass than MTs without motors or CENP-E in solution, the detachment of CENP-E from MTs results in a decrease in turbidity. The observed initial exponential rates from the transients were plotted as a function of increasing ATP concentration, and a hyperbolic fit of these data provided k+3, the rate constant of ATP-promoted CENP-E detachment from the MT (see Fig. 5). The stopped-flow instrument was used to measure the MT·CENP-E association kinetics and mantADP release kinetics (see Fig. 6). A CENP-E·mantADP complex was preformed and rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with varying concentrations of MTs plus 2 mm ATP (syringe concentration), and the fluorescence change was monitored over time. The transients were fit to a double exponential function, and the observed rates of the initial exponential phase were plotted as a function of increasing MT concentrations. The data from 0.5 to 4 μm were fit to the following linear equationkobs=k+4[MTs]+k-4(Eq. 4) where k+4 is the second-order rate constant for MT association, and k−4 is the CENP-E off rate as defined by the y axis. The apparent Kd,MT is defined by k−4/k+4. This experiment was designed to determine whether CENP-E bound ADP tightly at both nucleotide sites of the dimer, or whether the dimer exhibited a high affinity site and a low affinity site. Nucleotide-free CENP-E at 5 μm was incubated with either 5 μm or 2.5 μm mantADP to form the CENP-E·mantADP intermediate. It was assumed that if one nucleotide site bound mantADP tightly and the other weakly, the addition of 2.5 μm mantADP to 5 μm CENP-E would result in mantADP partitioning to the high affinity site. The CENP-E·mantADP intermediate was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument, and data were collected in two time domains: 1–10 and 10–250 s with fluorescence expressed in arbitrary units. Each transient was fit to a double exponential function (see Fig. 7). This study analyzed the ATPase cycle of a CENP-E dimeric motor (20.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We showed previously that this CENP-E dimer promotes MT plus-end-directed MT gliding at 11 nm/s, and the steady-state ATPase kcat was 0.9 s−1. Furthermore, MT plus-end elongation promoted by CENP-E required ATP turnover, and the kinetics revealed that the elongation rate occurred at 1.03 αβ-tubulin subunits/s. The overall goal for the pre-steady-state kinetics study presented here was to determine whether the ATPase mechanism of CENP-E was consistent with its processivity, the CENP-E-promoted MT elongation, and whether the catalytic cycle was in some way tuned for its role in chromosome congression. Substrate binding by dimeric CENP-E was measured by two approaches: fluorescent mantATP binding using the stopped-flow instrument (Fig. 1) and pulse-chase kinetics with [α-32P]ATP using the rapid quench-flow instrument (Fig. 2). Fig. 1A shows representative transients of mantATP binding to the nucleotide-free MT·CENP-E complex at increasing concentrations of mantATP. The transients are biphasic, and the observed rates of the initial exponential phase were plotted as a function of mantATP concentration, providing the second-order rate constant of mantATP binding at 1.4 μm−1 s−1 (Fig. 1B, Table 1). The observation that the mantATP binding kinetics were biphasic (Fig. 1A) suggests that the second phase represents mantATP binding to the second head of the CENP-E dimer. The relative amplitude associated with each phase at ∼50% (47–56% initial phase and 43–53% for the second phase) is consistent with this interpretation. Fig. 1C reveals that observed rates of mantATP binding during the second phase of fluorescence enhancement were also dependent upon the concentration of mantATP but were not linear as observed for the first phase (Fig. 1B). The hyperbolic fit of the data provided the maximum rate of mantATP binding to the second head at 1.6 s−1, therefore implying that mantATP binding to the second head was limited by an event that occurred after mantATP binding to the first head. These results are consistent with an alternating head catalysis model for processive kinesins.TABLE 1Experimentally determined constants for the MT·CENP-E ATPaseMantATP bindingk+1 = 1.4 ± 0.06 μm−1 s−1k−1 = 1.6 ± 0.7 s−1ATP binding (pulse-chase)K1 = 0.13 ± 0.01 μm−1k+1′ = 47.5 ± 0.8 s−1K1k+1′ = 6.2 μm−1 s−1Kd,ATP = 7.7 μmA0 = 1.96 ± 0.1 ADP·Pi per CENP-E siteKd,ATP = 16.7 ± 1.7 μmATP hydrolysisk+2 = 24.7 ± 0.5 s−1Kd,ATP = 12.3 ± 1.1 μmA0 = 1.93 ± 0.1 ADP·Pi per CENP-E siteKd,ATP = 44.8 ± 4.4 μmMT·CENP-E dissociationk+3 = 1.4 ± 0.01 s−1K½,ATP = 6.4 ± 0.5 μmMT·CENP-E associationk+4 = 0.08 ± 0.004 μm−1 s−1k−4 = 0.07 ± 0.01 s−1Kd,MTs = 0.9 μmMantADP releaseHead 1k+5 = 0.9 ± 0.01 s−1K½,MTs = 5.1 ± 0.1 μmHead 2kmax = 19.4 ± 0.6 s−1K½,ATP = 26.6 ± 3.2 μmMantADP affinityKd,Site 1 = 3.6 ± 0.3 nmKd,Site 2 = 31.8 ± 1.4 nmSteady-state parametersaData from Sardar et al.

The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes is a highly disseminated human-specific pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases, including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, common skin rashes, rheumatic and scarlet fever, and meningitis (1Potempa J. Golonka E. Filipek R. Shaw L.N. Fighting an enemy within. Cytoplasmic inhibitors of bacterial cysteine proteases.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The majority of these bacterial infections remain localized to skin and soft tissue; however, many S. pyogenes strains can penetrate deeper into tissues and induce severely invasive diseases, such as sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome, with high associated mortality (2Musser J. DeLeo F. Toward a genome-wide systems biology analysis of host-pathogen interactions in group A Streptococcus.Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite our current arsenal of antibiotic treatments, S. pyogenes remains at the forefront of bacterial pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. As such, it is imperative to identify new approaches and methods to control these common, but often fatal, infections. S. pyogenes secretes a variety of documented virulence factors into the extracellular space that promote infectivity and down-regulate host immune responses. The cysteine protease SpeB is one such factor that has been extensively studied for its ability to promote S. pyogenes infection. SpeB, or streptopain, is a highly conserved secreted cysteine protease that is found in the majority of S. pyogenes strains (3Yu C.E. Ferretti J.J. Frequency of the erythrogenic toxin B and C genes (speB and speC) among clinical isolates of group A streptococci.Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 211-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production, secretion, and activation of SpeB is highly regulated, and its proteolytic activity has been linked to immunomodulating activities during infection, including 1) degradation of host immunoglobulins to promote immune system evasion (4Collin M. Olsén A. EndoS, a novel secreted protein from Streptococcus pyogenes with endoglycosidase activity on human IgG.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3046-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); 2) cleavage of the cytokine precursor interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to its mature form, resulting in inflammation and septic shock (5Kapur V. Majesky M.W. Li L.L. Black R.A. Musser J.M. Cleavage of interleukin 1 β (IL-1β) precursor to produce active IL-1β by a conserved extracellular cysteine protease from Streptococcus pyogenes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 7676-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); and 3) release of the peptide hormone bradykinin from the precursor H-kininogen to produce hypotension during septic shock (6Herwald H. Collin M. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Streptococcal cysteine proteinase releases kinins. A virulence mechanism.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Additionally, SpeB has been implicated in degradation of fibronectin and vitronectin, two host extracellular matrix proteins involved in tissue integrity (7Kapur V. Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Li L.L. Hamrick M.R. Hamill R.J. Patti J.M. Musser J.M. A conserved Streptococcus pyogenes extracellular cysteine protease cleaves human fibronectin and degrades vitronectin.Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and in the liberation of proteins tethered to the streptococcal cell surface, including M proteins and C5a peptidase that are proposed to enhance S. pyogenes virulence (8Berge A. Björck L. Streptococcal cysteine proteinase releases biologically active fragments of streptococcal surface proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consideration of the potential host targets and the careful regulation of SpeB proteolytic activity suggest an important role for the protease (9Nelson D.C. Garbe J. Collin M. Cysteine proteinase SpeB from Streptococcus pyogenes. A potent modifier of immunologically important host and bacterial proteins.Biol. Chem. 2011; 392: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, due to conflicting results from human tissue samples and animal models, the relative importance of SpeB to S. pyogenes pathogenicity has been highly debated (10Collin M. Olsén A. Extracellular enzymes with immunomodulating activities. Variations on a theme in Streptococcus pyogenes.Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes exclusively infects humans, and active SpeB is secreted from the bacteria in individuals with invasive disease (11Gubba S. Low D.E. Musser J.M. Expression and characterization of group A Streptococcus extracellular cysteine protease recombinant mutant proteins and documentation of seroconversion during human invasive disease episodes.Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 765-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this protease secretion in human S. pyogenes infections and establishment of host and bacterial substrates, some data suggest an inverse relationship between SpeB production and disease severity (12Kansal R.G. McGeer A. Low D.E. Norrby-Teglund A. Kotb M. Inverse relation between disease severity and expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease, SpeB, among clonal M1T1 isolates recovered from invasive group A streptococcal infection cases.Infect.

Simpson A.J. Buchanan J.T. Chhatwal G.S. Kotb M. Nizet V. DNase Sda1 provides selection pressure for a switch to invasive group A streptococcal infection.Nat.

Chhatwal G.S. Walker M.J. Trigger for group A streptococcal M1T1 invasive disease.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1745-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Some recent results have suggested that down-regulation of SpeB expression and inhibition of protease activity promote the accumulation and activation of host protease plasmin on the GAS bacterial surface, thereby promoting infectivity (13Walker M.J. Hollands A. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Cole J.N. Kirk J.K. Henningham A. McArthur J.D. Dinkla K. Aziz R.K. Kansal R.G. Simpson A.J. Buchanan J.T. Chhatwal G.S. Kotb M. Nizet V. DNase Sda1 provides selection pressure for a switch to invasive group A streptococcal infection.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Similarly, a clinical correlation has been reported between S. pyogenes invasive disease severity and diminished SpeB expression (12Kansal R.G. McGeer A. Low D.E. Norrby-Teglund A. Kotb M. Inverse relation between disease severity and expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease, SpeB, among clonal M1T1 isolates recovered from invasive group A streptococcal infection cases.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Regardless of its potential role as a virulence factor, understanding of the structure and function of the secreted protease SpeB will help in elucidating the biology and chemistry at the interface between human epithelial cells and S. pyogenes and potentially provide insight into the role of proteases secreted from other bacteria. SpeB, like most extracellular proteases, is synthesized as an inactive zymogen to protect the intracellular components of the bacteria from proteolytic activity during protein production. SpeB is composed of an N-terminal signal sequence (residues 1–27), a prodomain (residues 28–145), and a catalytic C-terminal region (residues 146–398). Once secreted into the extracellular milieu, SpeB is susceptible for maturation to the active protease by autocatalysis, mature SpeB, trypsin, and subtilisin (15Liu T.Y. Elliott S.D.

Mutational analysis and structural studies have already revealed residues essential for catalytic activity (Cys192 and His340) (19Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W.

These studies, in combination with kinetic interrogation, have identified the preferred peptide sequences targeted by SpeB for cleavage (17Nomizu M. Pietrzynski G. Kato T. Lachance P. Menard R.

Based on this information and the sequence of the SpeB residues hydrolyzed in its self-activation, we have designed and synthesized a fluorogenic tripeptide substrate, acetyl-Ala-Ile-Lys-7-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-AIK-AMC), 2The abbreviations used are: AMC7-aminomethylcoumarinCHO(S)-2,6-diaminohexanalE64trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butaner.m.s.root mean squareFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylTLStranslation/libration/screw. which demonstrates robust catalytic turnover by SpeB, and a specific peptide inhibitor acetyl-Ala-Gln-Ile-(S)-2,6-diaminohexanal (Ac-AEIK-CHO).

Here, we report the highest resolution crystal structure to date of mature apo-SpeB at 1.06 Å resolution from a crystal obtained in neutral pH conditions and high resolution crystal structures of SpeB in complex with the general proteinase inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E64) and in complex with the SpeB-specific N-terminal acetylated peptide aldehyde inhibitor Ac-AEIK-CHO. These structures elucidate the residues essential for substrate binding on the nonprime side of the SpeB active site and the conformational changes of the protein associated with binding. Unexpectedly, these crystal structures provide the first view of a “floppy” glycine-rich C-terminal loop, adjacent to the active site, in both the apo and complex isoforms. With this structural information, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis on all of the loop glycine residues to understand the functional role of this large and unique loop that is not found in other papain-like proteases. Our structural and biochemical results provide insight into the structure, function, and broad substrate specificity of SpeB and new information that could aid in the development of small molecules capable of the specific regulation of SpeB activity. The S. pyogenes 10782 zymogen SpeB clone (residues 28–398) was generated without the N-terminal secretion leader sequence (residues 1–27) using standard PCR-based cloning and verified via double-stranded plasmid sequencing. SpeB is overexpressed as a C-terminal His6 tag fusion (additional amino acids for the affinity tag include LEH6, residues 399–406) from Escherichia coli BL21DE3pLysS (Stratagene) in a pET23b vector (Novagen). Cells were grown in 2× YT medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.8–1.0. Flasks were then transferred to 25 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. SpeB self-maturates during expression and results in the fully active protease (residues 146–398). Cells were immediately harvested and resuspended in ice-cold 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl (buffer A) and subjected to three cycles of lysis by microfluidization (Microfluidics). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and soluble fractions were loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was immediately diluted 5-fold with buffer B (50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5) and purified by cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP HP, GE Healthcare) with a 20-column volume gradient to 50% of buffer B containing 1 m NaCl. Fractions corresponding to SpeB were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and 1 mm DTT. If required, pure SpeB protein was further subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare) in PBS and 1 mm DTT to remove any remaining contaminants. Mature SpeB was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using Millipore Ultrafree-15 devices with a molecular weight cut-off of 3500 and immediately stored at −70 °C. Pure SpeB yields are ∼10–20 mg/liter of culture with >95% purity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A). SpeB point mutations were generated using QuikChange (Qiagen) mutagenesis. SpeB C-terminal loop mutants were constructed using forward primer and complement 5′-CAG CTA CAG GAG CCG TTG CTA CTG C-3′ for C192A, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTG CTA CTG GTG-3′ for G378A, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTGGTG TTG GTG-3′ for T379V, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTG GTG CTG GTG-3′ for T379A, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTG GTA CTG CTG-3′ for G380A, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTG GTA CTG GTG-3′ for G381A, 5′-CTT CAG CTC TTG GTA CTG GTG-3′ for G382A, 5′-GGT ACT GGT GGC GGC GCA GC-3′ for G384A, 5′-GGT ACT GGT GGC GGC GCA GA-3′ for G384D, and 5′-GGT ACT GGT GGC GGC GCA GG-3′ for G385A. Purification was performed exactly as for wild type SpeB. The point mutations did not affect structural stability of any of the recombinant expressed SpeB proteins as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry (data not shown) (23Vedadi M. Arrowsmith C.H. Allali-Hassani A. Senisterra G. Wasney G.A. Biophysical characterization of recombinant proteins. A key to higher structural genomics success.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 172: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Crystals of mature apo-SpeB were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes (2 μl) of SpeB (10 mg/ml) and reservoir solution consisting of 0.15 m sodium nitrate and 15% PEG 3500 at 4 °C. Inhibitors E64 (G-Biosciences) and Ac-AEIK-CHO were added in a 3-fold molar excess to SpeB and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C and immediately used for co-crystallization experiments. Crystals of SpeB in complex with E64 and Ac-AEIK-CHO were grown from solutions consisting of 0.2 m magnesium nitrate with 20% PEG 3500 at 4 °C and 0.15 m sodium nitrate with 26% PEG 3500 at 25 °C, respectively. The His6 tag was not removed because the protein crystallized readily. Data for all three SpeB x-ray structures were collected on single, flash-cooled crystals at 100 K in a cryoprotectant consisting of mother liquor and 20% PEG 400 and were processed with HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z.

The calculated Matthews coefficient (VM = 2.1 Å3 Da−1) suggested one monomer per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 42%. X-ray data for the apo and E64 complex SpeB structures were collected to 1.06 and 1.50 Å resolution, respectively, on beamline 11.1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (Menlo Park, CA). For the SpeB·Ac-AEIK-CHO complex, data were collected to 1.37 Å resolution on the Advanced Photon Source beamline 23-ID-B at the Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL).

The apo-SpeB structure then served as the search model for the E64 and Ac-AEIK-CHO SpeB complex structures. All structures were manually built with Coot (27Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17187) Google Scholar) and iteratively refined using Phenix (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G.

For the ultrahigh resolution apo-SpeB structure, anisotropic B-factor refinement was included, and hydrogen atoms were included in the model coordinates. For the SpeB complex structures, TLS B-factor refinement was carried out in the last round of refinement with the SpeB monomer split into nine TLS groups as determined by TLS Motion Determination in Phenix (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S.

TLS refinement resulted in improved electron density maps with a minimal change in Rcryst and Rfree. The electron density maps clearly identified that inhibitors E64 and Ac-AEIK-CHO were covalently attached to Cys192 within the active site. Water molecules were automatically positioned by Phenix using a 2.5σ cut-off in Fo − Fc maps and manually inspected. All three structures revealed a nitrate molecule (from the buffer) bound to residues located within the C-terminal loop. For the apo-SpeB structure, the final Rcryst and Rfree are 14.4 and 16.0%, respectively; for the E64 complex structure, the final Rcryst and Rfree are 15.8 and 18.8%, respectively; and for the Ac-AEIK-CHO complex structure, the final Rcryst and Rfree are 16.4 and 19.1%, respectively (Table 1). All models were analyzed and validated with PROCHECK (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite. Programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr.

https://openalex.org/W2077558589,"The G146V mutation in actin is dominant lethal in yeast. G146V actin filaments bind cofilin only minimally, presumably because cofilin binding requires the large and small actin domains to twist with respect to one another around the hinge region containing Gly-146, and the mutation inhibits that twisting motion. A number of studies have suggested that force generation by myosin also requires actin filaments to undergo conformational changes. This prompted us to examine the effects of the G146V mutation on myosin motility. When compared with wild-type actin filaments, G146V filaments showed a 78% slower gliding velocity and a 70% smaller stall force on surfaces coated with skeletal heavy meromyosin. In contrast, the G146V mutation had no effect on either gliding velocity or stall force on myosin V surfaces. Kinetic analyses of actin-myosin binding and ATPase activity indicated that the weaker affinity of actin filaments for myosin heads carrying ADP, as well as reduced actin-activated ATPase activity, are the cause of the diminished motility seen with skeletal myosin. Interestingly, the G146V mutation disrupted cooperative binding of myosin II heads to actin filaments. These data suggest that myosin-induced conformational changes in the actin filaments, presumably around the hinge region, are involved in mediating the motility of skeletal myosin but not myosin V and that the specific structural requirements for the actin subunits, and thus the mechanism of motility, differ among myosin classes.Background: The roles of conformational changes of actin in myosin motility are unclear.Results: A G146V mutation in actin, which perturbed its conformation, impaired force generation by myosin II, but not by myosin V.Conclusion: Conformational changes of actin involving Gly-146 have critical roles in motility of myosin II, but not of myosin V.Significance: The mechanism of motility may be different between myosin types.

https://openalex.org/W1976639573,"The transmembrane tyrosine kinase HER2 (ErbB2, neu) is a prototypical biomarker for breast cancers and a therapeutic target. Although anti-HER2 therapies are remarkably effective, HER2-positive tumors are heterogeneous and some subtypes do not respond or develop resistance to these therapies. Here we show that H2NTF, a novel N-terminal fragment of HER2, is expressed at variable levels in 60% of the breast cancer samples analyzed. Characterization of H2NTF shows that it is devoid of the tyrosine kinase domain but it readily interacts with full-length HER2 and other HER receptors. As a consequence, H2NTF acts as a dominant-negative, attenuating the signaling triggered by full-length HER receptors. Expression of H2NTF results in resistance to the treatment with low concentrations of trastuzumab in vitro. However, cells expressing H2NTF and non-expressing cells have similar sensitivity to trastuzumab in vivo, indicating that H2NTF/trastuzumab complexes trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1996732072,"Ca(2+) microdomains or locally restricted Ca(2+) increases in the cell have recently been reported to regulate many essential physiological events. Ca(2+) increases through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor (IP(3)R)/Ca(2+) release channels contribute to the formation of a class of such Ca(2+) microdomains, which were often observed and referred to as Ca(2+) puffs in their isolated states. In this report, we visualized IP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) microdomains in histamine-stimulated intact HeLa cells using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, and quantitatively characterized the spatial profile by fitting recorded images to a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Ca(2+) concentration profiles were marginally spatially anisotropic, with the size increasing linearly even after the amplitude began to decline. We found the event centroid drifted with an apparent diffusion coefficient of 4.20 ± 0.50 μm(2)/s, which is significantly larger than those estimated for IP(3)Rs. The sites of maximal Ca(2+) increase, rather than initiation or termination sites, were detected repeatedly at the same location. These results indicate that Ca(2+) microdomains in intact HeLa cell are generated from spatially distributed multiple IP(3)R clusters or Ca(2+) puff sites, rather than a single IP(3)R cluster reported in cells loaded with Ca(2+) buffers."
